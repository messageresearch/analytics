Oh, at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart, it ro away. Yes, it was there by faith. I receive my sight and now I'm happy all the days.

We'll just um acknowledge Brother Kimma, do you mind coming up, sir? Praying over the rest of the service and the prayer requests and ties. Let's just bow our heads. Dear Jesus Christ, Lord, we truly thank you because you live, we can truly face tomorrow. Oh dear God, King of kings, Lord of lords. You're the God of all gods. You're the author of Genesis. The one who speaks anything must happen. Who is like you, Lord? We thank you for a wonderful time that you have given us yesterday. Father, a time of refreshing of our hearts, of our souls. Oh, Father God, what a tremendous thing that prayer can do. Father, when we just come in that secret place between me and you, my brother, my sister, and you, Father God, that moment of prayer that we have so many times been deceived by the devil not to go into. But yesterday, Lord God, you showed us, Father, what a precious moment they are. Oh God, when we can just close ourselves, oh Father God, and speak to our maker, dear Jesus, thank you, Father. Thank you for this inspiration that you have sent to our church. Truly you want to see us see great things happen among us Lord. Father God and that is the beginning. Oh father your prophet said if you want a growing God just read your Bible and pray every day. And thank you Lord Jesus for making that possible yesterday. Lord you've opened up an avenue especially for me and I know for my brother and sister Lord God to see how prayer can change things. Father God, we want to remember sister our precious sister Ed's mother. Father, tonight Lord, may you go to her, Father. What is a stroke, Lord Jesus, in Genesis 18, you created four bodies and you, Father God went into them. What is, oh God, a stroke, Lord Jesus, to you. Just speak the word, Lord, and all will be made right Lord God. We expect to receive results, oh Father God, testimonies, oh Lord, that you've changed the situation, oh Father God, because sons and daughters of God have prayed to you, Lord. Take the, oh, Father God, the tithes, the offering, Lord, you see the giver, Father God, that give cheerfully. May you multiply as you multiply the fish and the loaves, Father God, when you were here on in your body, Lord. May you do the same thing for us today. continue to bless the service, Father God. Take Brother Seth out of the way, Lord. And may you use the gift, Father. Oh, dear Jesus. May you speak to our hearts, Lord. You know the need that this church has tonight, Father. We did not come to see a man, but we came to see you, Lord. May you take your son out of the way and use the gift that you have placed within him. Father, we thank you once again as we turn the service back into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen.

Everything the devil was throwing in our in our in our path like what is going on? But everything is all right. I was debating.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I pray God. I say, may you fill again these pews with angels. And here they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I got a late prayer request here from brother Enoch. He said, please pray for my friend Marcus. He's been battling brain cancer and was just declared terminal ill and they are going to to move him to the hospice. The hospital gave him six months to leave. He has a wife and a child praying for God to put his hands on him and heal him because he's capable of doing more than just to heal him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe in the miraculous. We had a wonderful praise and so in the prayer yesterday if you miss it next time just hop on. Amen. God is working in a miraculous way and there is nothing too there's no storm too powerful that God cannot handle. Amen. There is a reason why he had to work with this person or be a friend to this person because God knew in the time of trouble somebody will stand for it. So let's pray together for this prayer request. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you again humbly this evening, Lord. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, your mercy, and for your presence tonight, Lord, because we can feel it. We can, Lord, Father, sense your presence. And we thank you for being in the midst of us. And every time we meet here, there is not one time that you failed to be here, Lord. Father we are approaching you again Lord with this prayer request on behalf of our brother for his friend Lord. Father you know what is going on. The doctor said the best that they could but Lord Father the absolute doctor is you because you're the only one that have the power to decide on the life of someone Lord. Father Lord Jesus Christ we are approaching you. You're the God who is rich in mercy. asking you that you touch this man from this brain cancer. Lord, Father, I claim the blood of the lamb upon the church praying and Lord, Father, we rebuke this cancer. Lord, may he leave Lord, Father, this man in a supernatural way by the power of the Holy Spirit. Father, I've seen patient Lord that was affected by cancer totally here Lord and coming back to the office Lord. Father, I pray Lord, Father, that your hand may move in a supernatural way, Lord, and have mercy upon this wife and the child, Lord. Father, that they are about to lose their daddy so that you can change, Lord, Father, the situation. Come on the sin, Lord, and make him know just Lord, Father, that you are a healer, but you are also Lord, Father, the savior of the soul, Lord. Father, bring him closer unto thee, Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that this prayer request Lord be turned unto a praise report by the power of the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. Father we humbly ask it and commit everything unto thy hand with faith as you told us to ask Lord and to believe Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience. Amen. Any family member here, new subscribers online? Numbers keep going up. God richly bless you and welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle and precisely to our convention on Wednesday. I was coming up with a huge traffic. I don't know what was going on. There was nothing on the road. A huge traffic and I was praying. I said, "Lord, may you open the road for the people that are coming to church to make sure they made it on time." But God grace was there and we have overcomers tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Everybody can see their season in the midst of chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to change the way you looking at things in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can David say goodness and mercy will follow me when &gt;&gt; how can goodness and mercy be there when you seek? &gt;&gt; Because David didn't say some days of my life. &gt;&gt; He took all the span of his time that was given to him. In other words, David is telling you from A to Z, &gt;&gt; if you look in my life, you will see goodness and mercy. But the devil have trained us so much for years that in the days of our life we can tell what is bad &gt;&gt; and we remember all the bad time. But David look he say I see goodness and mercy. Amen. Goodness everything is going good and mercy even when things are going bad is the God rich in mercy. Learn to see goodness and mercy in every circumstance in your life. Whether it looks bad to our way, our perception, whether it looks good, God is there. Because being trained to only look on the wrong way, you're going to miss your season &gt;&gt; because the shepherd can take you to the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you wonder, how did I get here? It was the shepherd. &gt;&gt; He was the shepherd. &gt;&gt; How did you end up where you are now? &gt;&gt; It's the shepherd. Amen. &gt;&gt; How how are you the person you are today? &gt;&gt; Some of us never thought we're going to be here. &gt;&gt; You thought you going to live in another state or whatever. God move you move roof from another country, from another state, from another city and everything and put you to Did you ever thought you going to be living in the place you're living today? &gt;&gt; Did you have even in the mind that okay, the house I'm living in now was the house that I'm going to be living in. You thought you're going to live in another house and then you find yourself in a different house. And so everything has been orchestrated by the master. And if you are somebody who's always paying attention to the negative, the devil is really good at that. Amen. The first thing he does after service is begin to throw some negative thing just to keep your attention away from what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember in the midst of chaos before you panic, Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Before you get upset, sir. &gt;&gt; Before you start getting frustrated and speaking things that are not supposed to to be coming out of your mouth, &gt;&gt; push the brake &gt;&gt; and look, you say, "What is going on? What is the blessing that is coming in this time that the devil begin to upset everything left and right?" Because Satan doesn't upset me like that. If he start upsetting this and this and this somehow there must be something God is about to deliver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because God is about to deliver something, that's the reason why he's throwing everything out of so you can be taken off by that and miss what God is bringing unto you. If you go listen to the message, I believe u either uh is there anything too hard from the Lord on something? Brother Brandham says that uh Abraham and Sarah was giving him a hard time and almost miss the visitation of the Lord because things were not going right. Everything was dwindling and and a rough time with Abraham and it was the time that God was coming down in Genesis 18 and because of that Sarah was fasting. Look at Mrs. Lot over there. She prospered. She's over there. And Sodom didn't even know Sodom is going to be burned. Lot is going to lose everything and he's going to get into a disaster. And God was coming to visit Abraham and to change even the body and bring the solution to Sarah for something Sarah has been waiting for years. God was bringing it and the devil was upsetting Sarah rather trying to make Sarah to lose the blessing of the Lord. Amen. So when chaos or things are going out together, chill out, relax. Patient are cancelling. That's okay. Go back. You'll find something to do quickly. The Holy Spirit is doing something correctly. There is nothing. Amen. Even though it seems like it's adequate, we will understand it better by and by. But God told you this is the season &gt;&gt; and the season may come as a blessing in disguisement. When you look it's dark but approach it closely you will see it's angel wings that are beating together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have even a quote brother Brandham say tension is a blessing. &gt;&gt; Do you know that quote? &gt;&gt; How can tension? Do you know that quote? If you don't I put it in the group chat. Do you know that quote? How can tension be a blessing? Who want tension? How can tension be a blessing? And brother Brandham say without that tension, I could not be where I am. &gt;&gt; You don't know that quot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what do you think it is? Is it tension really? One bird that uses the storm to go up is an eagle. Amen. Take it and go up. And after a while, when everything's said and done, you will sit down. You say, "Now I see what is going on and what was it all about." It's not about God destroying you. It's about God trying to bring a blessing. And when he trying to bring a blessing, this is the time Satan will rise and try to kill every child that is two year old down thinking he's going to get the Messiah. Did he get the Messiah? But Satan didn't know there was already a prophecy that prophesied in the Old Testament that Rachel is weeping for the children. &gt;&gt; So was Satan fulfilling prophecy or was Satan? You see now? So all of that was already in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those children will be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; So look through God eyes and don't focus on what the devil is doing. Amen. Brother Set is preaching tonight. But they said trustee, song leader, preacher, musician. I don't know what else God already know. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how he's doing all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's nothing but the miracle of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the last time was so good. &gt;&gt; Very good that we can't even wait to hear tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you under expectation. Yes. &gt;&gt; So let's pull on the gift of the Lord and hear from the Holy Ghost himself. Only believe. Oh believe. Oh believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. All me believe all believe. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Only believe &gt;&gt; Lord I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord I believe. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord I believe. Oh all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Oh, &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe that all things are possible.

Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus is here and all things are possible. [Music] Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you very much, musicians. Uh we just want to appreciate you for the wonderful work you've been doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um even as we have our Bibles turn to Psalm 127. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 127 verse 3-5. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 127:3-5. Um, but before that, let's just have a word of prayer. Father, in the name of Jesus, we are grateful, Lord, to be in your presence tonight, Lord. Father, even as we open your word, Lord Jesus, may you break the bread, Lord Jesus, tonight we ask, Father, may you take me aside, Lord, and speak your word, Lord. I have no word for your children tonight, Lord. But your children are desiring to hear from you, Lord. Father, may your spirit quicken every reading of this word and every quote, Lord Jesus, oh God, that you've laid, oh God, tonight, Lord. Father, may you move in our lives, Lord Jesus, and do its wonderful miraculous work, Lord. Father, people are in here, Lord Jesus. Oh God, those also listening online, Lord, have expectations tonight, Lord. Father, we don't come to your presence living the same, Lord. We come to your presence being satisfied, Lord, and be full, oh God. Father, full of joy, Lord Jesus. Oh God, we ask, Father God, may your blessings be upon us tonight, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We bless you in Jesus Christ's name we prayed. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalm 127 verse 3-5. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And Bible says, "Lo, children sir, &gt;&gt; children &gt;&gt; are an heritage of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, heritage is an inherent an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It said, "And the fruit of the womb is his reward." &gt;&gt; That's right. Correct. &gt;&gt; As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, &gt;&gt; so are children of the youth. &gt;&gt; of the youth. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we've got youth in our church, Amen. we've got some weapons, amen, against the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Happy is the man &gt;&gt; that have his quiver full of them. &gt;&gt; They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can we be seated tonight? &gt;&gt; Arrows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, we've got some weapons tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see the children growing, anytime we have a baby shower, &gt;&gt; the Lord is presenting or is announcing some arrows. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's open to Psalm 94. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 94. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 94. Amen. verse 12 to 14. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; If we're there, we can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "Blessed is the man whom thou chestnut." Amen, oh Lord. And teachest him out of thy law. That's right. &gt;&gt; That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Until the pit be for the wicked. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. For the Lord will not cast off his people, &gt;&gt; neither will he forsake his inheritance. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, we saw that children are the Lord's inheritance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Bible says that he's not going to forsake his inheritance. &gt;&gt; It means that those children belongs to him. &gt;&gt; It is something that he has. It's something that he possesses. They are his property. &gt;&gt; And Bible says he's not going to forsake that. &gt;&gt; Let's say you have something that belongs to you and it is yours. &gt;&gt; Just imagine how you protect that. &gt;&gt; So just imagine you being a child of the most high. &gt;&gt; He said ye are God's and children of the most high. &gt;&gt; So just imagine how God is going to protect you &gt;&gt; being a child of God. the hedge of protection that he has around you &gt;&gt; as a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, even as we we ponder on that, let's go to the book of Joshua. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We we we we just uh skipped certain things the last time. Uh we just want to bring it in tonight. Amen. Joshua chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Joshua chapter 2. Yes, &gt;&gt; we are going to read from verse 1 to13. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the story of the spies coming to Rahab. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And remember from the last time as the prophet said that when the Lord comes to you, Amen. He's interested in everything that you have. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; He's interested in every door. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's interested in everything that belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are seeing an example of a child of God. Even when the spies came, we didn't know that she was a child of God. But there was something inside of her &gt;&gt; that was portraying that she was a child of God. Amen. So let's see how a child of God behaves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is Joshua chapter 1 verse 13. And Joshua the son of Nan sent out of Shadim two men to spy secretly, &gt;&gt; saying, "Go view the land, &gt;&gt; even Jericho." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they went and came into an hallowed house named Rahabh &gt;&gt; and lodged there. And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country. Now verse three, and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house, thine house, for they be come to search out all the country. Verse four, it said, "And the woman took the two men and hid them." &gt;&gt; Now, this is Rahab. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anything that comes into my house belongs to me. &gt;&gt; So, when God is bringing a blessing, it is my property. If you are coming to take it away from me, &gt;&gt; I have a protection around it. I am going to keep it because I know what blessing is coming to me. Amen. And we will see what Rahab said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and the woman took the two men and hid them and said, "Thus, there came men unto me, but I was not whence they were." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, she was hiding them. And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it was dark that the men went out, wither the men went not. Pursue after them quickly, for ye shall overtake them. Amen. So the king is is is trying to say that let's let's um hasten to go get this men cuz they they might escape. Amen. But she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax &gt;&gt; which she had laid in order upon the roof. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she hid the men such that nobody could see them. Amen. And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan onto the forts. And as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate. And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof. &gt;&gt; Now let's see what happens. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And she said unto the men, &gt;&gt; I know, &gt;&gt; I know &gt;&gt; that the Lord have given you the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that your terror is falling upon us &gt;&gt; and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. She's not um testifying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you. &gt;&gt; When he came out of Egypt, &gt;&gt; and what he did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Jordan, Sion and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. And as soon as we had heard, &gt;&gt; so somebody says heard, &gt;&gt; heard. &gt;&gt; And as soon as we have heard these things, &gt;&gt; our hearts did melt. &gt;&gt; Melt. &gt;&gt; Neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you. &gt;&gt; For the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above &gt;&gt; and in earth beneath. That's right. &gt;&gt; So this is the testimony. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of somebody who just heard. [Music] &gt;&gt; Somebody who just heard &gt;&gt; not having the experience she just heard. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now therefore, I pray you swear unto me by the Lord, since I have showed you kindness, that we will also show that ye will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true talking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's asking for a true talking. and that ye will save a life. My father, &gt;&gt; my mother, &gt;&gt; my brethren, &gt;&gt; my sisters, and all that they have &gt;&gt; and deliver our lives from death. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You and your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your mother. So my mother, my father, my siblings and all what they have, &gt;&gt; all my cousins, &gt;&gt; all of them, my first cousins, my second cousins, all of them, my granddaddy. Amen. I am speaking onto their lives. Amen. And even the neighbor that came to me, amen. I am proclaiming healing. Amen. Onto their life. When I go to school, all my acquaintances that come around me, I said, "Hey, I'm a child of God and have the overflow of the blessings of God." Amen. So, because you are close to me, that I receive you as part of my blessings because I am hiding you in the blessings that was proclaimed to me, that was given to me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So this is from the message &gt;&gt; as I was with Moses &gt;&gt; so I will be with thee. &gt;&gt; The prophet said why &gt;&gt; thou and thy house &gt;&gt; certainly &gt;&gt; thy house shall be saved with thee. &gt;&gt; Certainly &gt;&gt; thy house &gt;&gt; shall be saved with thee. &gt;&gt; Certainly &gt;&gt; thy house shall be saved with thee. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "Why?" &gt;&gt; If you've got faith enough to have yourself saved, you can have faith enough for your family to be saved. &gt;&gt; Thou and thy house. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "Look at Rahab." Rahab said, "Have mercy upon me. &gt;&gt; Spare me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to die with this unbelievers." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Rahab is calling the others unbelievers because she has heard. &gt;&gt; She's declared that she's a believer. &gt;&gt; I don't want to die as an animal. Amen. I want to die in the arms of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; I believe your God because he's both God of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; He does visible things. &gt;&gt; He makes things real. &gt;&gt; I never seen him do it. I never seen him do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I believe it anyhow. &gt;&gt; See? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is a situation where she's not even seen it before, &gt;&gt; but she believes it &gt;&gt; regardless of whatever condition that comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't sometimes need to have evidence of of of it being happen happening before. Amen. But because we believe in Jehovah, we've not seen him heal such a case before. But because we believe it, the Lord is going to do it. &gt;&gt; He said, "I never seen him do it, but I believe it anyhow." See, she had never seen Joshua. &gt;&gt; She just heard of Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you be like, "Oh, well, I've I've not had an experience to see the angel of the Lord or neither have I had any experience of the pillar of fire coming to my room and all those things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've heard the the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You heard the preaching of the gospel. That is all what you need &gt;&gt; to take possession of what belongs to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so the prophet said she never seen God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never seen God. &gt;&gt; So the prophet is saying &gt;&gt; she never seen Joshua. &gt;&gt; Now he's saying she never seen God. &gt;&gt; So when you see Joshua, &gt;&gt; you've seen God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you remember Joshua one time was a spy &gt;&gt; who went to the land &gt;&gt; and came back with a testimony that they were able to take the land. &gt;&gt; Now Joshua represent Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also sends a spy or also sent spies. Amen. To go and attest of the goodness of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go on. Amen. &gt;&gt; It said she just heard. Others have seen it and she believed by hearing it. Now said, I want favor for me and my father, my mother. They are both old and crippled up. &gt;&gt; I've got some brethren. &gt;&gt; I want to have faith for them. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "And the the preacher." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The preacher with the word of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you remember one time Joshua was also a spy &gt;&gt; who was having that evidence that we are able to take the land &gt;&gt; and also remember our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; when he came down was a preacher. &gt;&gt; He was also a spy that we are able to take the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said yes he's coming this way and we are going to take the land. Now, if you want to get them saved, get them in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you believe it, go get them. Get them in here. For will not be responsible if they in the street. &gt;&gt; So, God has a specific place &gt;&gt; that he has appointed that you must bring the people in. &gt;&gt; As long as there's a believer in the house, that believer is hiding the spy. Amen. that is the preacher of the gospel. So bring everything in that fold so that they get saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So this from the message Hebrews &gt;&gt; chapter 7 &gt;&gt; the prophet said and any minister &gt;&gt; that sent out under the inspiration of the king of heaven &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We are talking about the preacher now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Under the inspiration of the king of heaven will not go for money. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Neither will he go to make big churches. Neither will he go to inspired denominations. &gt;&gt; He will only go for one principle &gt;&gt; and that is to bring back his fallen brother. &gt;&gt; He's going in with one principle. &gt;&gt; To bring back his fallen brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Abraham. Amen. When he went, Amen. to save Lot. Amen. He was offered riches. Amen. But that was not what he wanted because he knew that he was getting inspiration from Elleon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was able to provide everything that he needed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So his aim was to go and save his brother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, this is from the message. What is that in thy hand? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The prophet is doing a discernment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says this, "But there's nothing in me that I could help &gt;&gt; except God will let me know what to do." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So if he will reveal to me why you're standing here, will you accept it then as truth? &gt;&gt; If it's finances &gt;&gt; or whatever it is, &gt;&gt; you believe that God is interested in your case and he's going to hear. So the Lord is interested in every case. &gt;&gt; So we we don't just name certain cases and said well the Lord is able to save this one but this one um is too hard this one is too sensitive so we take it away from the Lord. The the prophet said God is interested in every case &gt;&gt; whether sickness whether finances whether whatever you need. &gt;&gt; When you go to school and and sometimes you have been taught something you don't understand. Sometimes we think that oh this is this is something that God is not interested in. No &gt;&gt; everything whatever. Amen. God is interested in every case. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "May the Lord grant it is my prayer." &gt;&gt; Every case that is brought tonight &gt;&gt; to the pulpit to the altar, may the Lord grant it is my prayer. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, "As you look at me," he said, "Not you know like Peter and John passed through the gate called beautiful." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; They said look on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look on us. I said not look to them as him but just to give attention to what they are saying. &gt;&gt; Catch the attraction of the spirit. &gt;&gt; So whatever case you have tonight, Amen. Look on us. Amen. Look at him. Amen. The pillar of fire. He's interested in every case. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as you see, um, the spies going to Rahab. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're talking to Rahab &gt;&gt; about they coming to take the land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rahab has already given her testimony. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, that was a seed word that was given. &gt;&gt; So, a seed &gt;&gt; is a word that has been planted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll get to what the prophet said about the seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a word that has been planted &gt;&gt; and that word when a seed is planted, there's an intention of a harvest. &gt;&gt; When somebody is putting a seed in the ground, &gt;&gt; what is his main focus or his main aim? &gt;&gt; His aim is to reap what he's sowing &gt;&gt; is to harvest. &gt;&gt; And in the harvest, we have a multiplication. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a harvest, it's not just one seed that is coming out. &gt;&gt; It's a multiplication. &gt;&gt; So when God is sowing a seed, Amen. in the Lord Jesus Christ, he's looking at a multiplication. &gt;&gt; He's not looking at just one seed. &gt;&gt; He's looking at a multiplication. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this is God revealing himself to his people. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now many times &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, this may seem strange. &gt;&gt; Everybody be real reverent. &gt;&gt; If you can get the person, just what I was trying to do to the woman talking about the sermon. Amen. Was get her in the right mental attitude. &gt;&gt; She wouldn't have to be prayed for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in the right mental attitude. She wouldn't have to be prayed for. The right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Do you believe that?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The word is a seed." That's right. &gt;&gt; That a swer sword in the ground. Right. &gt;&gt; When God comes to preach his word, &gt;&gt; when God send a spice who come with a word, &gt;&gt; it's a seed &gt;&gt; that the swer is sowing. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "And every seed will bring forth of its kind." &gt;&gt; So when the Lord is bringing the seed of healing, &gt;&gt; which is his word, &gt;&gt; he's looking at a multiplication of that word. &gt;&gt; If one person gets healed, It means we have so many people who are in the pipeline to get healed. When one person got saved of cancer, Amen. It means the Lord is waving before you that we have so many cases of cancer that is going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's sewing that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In you for a multiplication. &gt;&gt; Because there has to be a harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the prophet said, "If you need salvation, the seed is here &gt;&gt; and the seed is Christ." Amen. If you need healing, here's the seed in the word. &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed. &gt;&gt; Put in your heart. Don't dig it up every morning to see if it sprouted. &gt;&gt; Put it in there and leave it there. &gt;&gt; Is God's business to bring forth the harvest? You just leave it there. order it by faith and praise every day thanking God for it. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is saying leave it there. &gt;&gt; Be thanking God and praising him every day. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Every day. &gt;&gt; Let's open to Luke chapter 8 verse1 15. &gt;&gt; Praise him every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Luke 8. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. We just want to take just that um verse. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Luke 8 verse1 15 &gt;&gt; and you feel there let's say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "But that on the good ground are they,"Hu, &gt;&gt; which in an honest and good heart, &gt;&gt; honest and good heart, &gt;&gt; having heard the word. &gt;&gt; They heard the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They keep it &gt;&gt; just like Rahab, &gt;&gt; she hid the spice. &gt;&gt; Amen. and bring forth fruit &gt;&gt; with patience. &gt;&gt; So when you look at these people with a good heart, they are masters of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they believe in the word of God &gt;&gt; whether um it lingers, it terrorists, they have patience &gt;&gt; because they know it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; So these people are masters of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that is the end time bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That fell on good soil. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Patience. &gt;&gt; With patience. &gt;&gt; Now talking about we we are getting into um our theme for tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; This from the message redeemer redemption &gt;&gt; in 55. It said notice now we are going to Ruth. Amen. Notice Ruth was willing to forsake her idols, &gt;&gt; forsake her past life, &gt;&gt; forsake her people, &gt;&gt; forsake everything, &gt;&gt; and return with Naomi. &gt;&gt; Just like where &gt;&gt; she didn't care what was going to happen in Jericho. &gt;&gt; She's moving with her own family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said no matter what the circumstances was, she was willing to go on. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way every man that comes to Christ must first be willing &gt;&gt; regardless. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said, I never like to tell the people, oh, you are going to prosper. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And be a rich man now &gt;&gt; and God's going to bless you &gt;&gt; and you ain't going to have no sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as we saw on Sunday, Amen. We are looking at greener pastures. We are looking at still waters. We are But there's also the value of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet is saying something. He said I say if you're really born again in your heart, &gt;&gt; I don't care how rough the road gets. &gt;&gt; You still hold on to God's unchanging hand &gt;&gt; because the focus is on Christ. Amen. If he take me to greener pastures, I say hallelujah. When he take me through the still waters, I say hallelujah. But when he take me through the valley of the shadow of death, he is my focus. Amen. So I praise him anyhow. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter what that lays before me, &gt;&gt; if Jesus goes with me, &gt;&gt; I will go." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Long as he goes, that's all that's necessary. [Applause] As long as he's with me in the valley, in the still waters, in green pastures. Amen. That's all what is necessary. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And she returned and oh the picture now, Ruth, the gentile church just coming in and Naomi, the Jewish church coming back." And notice when they turned and went got back to the homeland, they came in just in barley season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; anyone knows what barley season was? &gt;&gt; It was Pentecost. &gt;&gt; The first fruits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you remember &gt;&gt; that when Rahab was talking to the spies, &gt;&gt; she asked for a token. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now the token represents she already having what she wanted. &gt;&gt; The token is there as as as a placement or to represent her inheritance. &gt;&gt; So they had to give her a token to show that whatever she is asking she already has it. &gt;&gt; So we have the first fruit of the Holy Ghost. Bible said that is our talking. Amen. until the day of our redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as we have the first fruits. Amen. &gt;&gt; How the gentile church was brought in under the wings of almighty God at Pentecost, the gentile church, the bride, and when she returned, it was barley season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the same message, uh paragraph 44 say, "And now they had a king's manuh &gt;&gt; there by the name of Boaz." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And he was a rich man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So remember the prophet said, "I'm not going to preach to you about God is going to give you riches, God is going to give you this, God is going to give you that, God's going to give you that." &gt;&gt; But here, &gt;&gt; we know Boaz was a rich man. &gt;&gt; And Naomi sent Ruth out into the fields to clean in Boaz's field, &gt;&gt; which was the custom in that day and still today. right in that same field made gleam behind the reapers. Amen. So what was she gleaning for? She was gleaning for food. And that's what the gentile church did. Coming behind the Orthodox church, picking up all they had, which was the Old Testament. Gleaning what God give to the prophets. &gt;&gt; The gentile church, the young church, the holy spirit church of the firstborn. Gleaning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now let's go on this uh with this. And when Boas came out to see her, to see how everything was going on, a righteous man, a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now remember, Boaz was a rich man. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he was a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Any preacher under inspiration is not going for money." Yes. &gt;&gt; But here &gt;&gt; Boas Christ is a rich man. &gt;&gt; So prophet Boaz was a type of Christ. &gt;&gt; When he come out to look upon his harvest field, he was the Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; Christ is the Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; And he came out to look upon the field. And notice as soon as his eyes fell upon the beautiful Ruth, &gt;&gt; now let's keep that in mind. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; It was love at the first sight. [Music] &gt;&gt; So the rich man Boaz &gt;&gt; is looking upon the beautiful Ruth. &gt;&gt; Said, "Who is this young maid out here who is gleaning in my field?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us are are scared away from saying beautiful because it makes you unholy. &gt;&gt; Shut your mouth. &gt;&gt; Shut your mouth. &gt;&gt; But beautiful is beautiful. &gt;&gt; My wife is the only beautiful woman to me. &gt;&gt; The same way as the pastor's wife is the only beautiful woman to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's how it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I come to my um my team for today. Amen. My title is the Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; God's inheritance. &gt;&gt; You remember that the children &gt;&gt; are an inheritance unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Bible said he will never forsake &gt;&gt; his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are children of the most high. God will never forsake &gt;&gt; his inheritance. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's read Isaiah 53. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:9 to 12. Isaiah 53:9-12. Now we are talking about Boaz the rich man. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said Boas types Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So let's read Isaiah 53. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 9 to12. &gt;&gt; And he made his if we are there we say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 53:9 Bible says, "And he made his grave with the wicked." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And with the rich in his death. &gt;&gt; Now with the ri rich &gt;&gt; in his death. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why did they bury him amongst the rich? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He have put him to grief. When thou shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. &gt;&gt; He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. &gt;&gt; He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For he shall bear their iniquities. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, he's justifying many. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Justifying his children. Amen. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death. &gt;&gt; And he has numbered with the transgressors, and he b the sin of many &gt;&gt; and made intercession for the transgressors. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, he's already taken all these things for many. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, why was he doing that? &gt;&gt; Let's read 2 Corinthians 8:9. I I mean they they can just put it up. 2 Corinthians 8:9 verse 9. Amen. And I'm reading. He said, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; that though he was rich, &gt;&gt; yet for your sakes, &gt;&gt; he became poor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That ye through his poverty might be rich." &gt;&gt; So we are talking about a rich boers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he came, he made himself poor &gt;&gt; that you will become rich. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's read this message. Amen. God has a provided way. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; From paragraph 126, it said, "And notice." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Then they had to get all of her inheritance had been taken away from her. Um the prophet is talking about Naomi. Amen. So they had to make a living. Amen. He said Ruth being a young beautiful woman. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Went out into the field of Boaz to glean. &gt;&gt; That was what the peasants did. The poor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What want you to notice the type of church is Amen. It's a poor church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Christ was made poor so we become rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we notice that the inheritance was lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God has to do a way to bring back those riches. &gt;&gt; So Ruth being a type of the gentile bride. Now she went out behind the harvesters to pick up a few straws &gt;&gt; that had some wheat on it. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She was she was um gleaning like a peasant uh from the beginning. Amen. Shack it off like that in a in a sack for a living. Gleaning barefooted in the fields of &gt;&gt; Boaz. &gt;&gt; And Boaz was the Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; Representing Jesus Christ the son of God. Notice the great Lord of the harvest. &gt;&gt; And he came out to look upon his fields. He saw the gleaners out there. He saw the reapers. And when he cast his eyes towards Ruth, he fell in love with her Christ with his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when Boas came and look at Ruth, &gt;&gt; the beautiful Ruth. &gt;&gt; Okay. Boaz fell in love with that church which was Ruth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read Acts. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 7 verse 1-8. Let's see um what brother Steven has to say. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about God's inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Steven is is about to address something here. Amen. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; So, Acts 7 verse 1 to8, &gt;&gt; it said, "Then said the high priest, &gt;&gt; are these things so? And he said, men, brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, amen, before he dwelt in Karam." Amen. and said unto him, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee." Amen. Then came he out of the land of the Calians. Amen. And dwelt in Karen. And from then, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell. &gt;&gt; And he gave him noninheritance in it. So he asked him to go to the land. &gt;&gt; So brother Steven is saying that he gave him none inheritance in it. No, not so much as to set his foot on. &gt;&gt; Now God had asked him to go to a land. &gt;&gt; And brother Steven here is saying that he didn't show him any inheritance or he didn't give him any inheritance. All what he had to see or all what he had was just to put his foot there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So from the beginning it was just putting your foot there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; let's say I have a condition a sick a sickness condition. They call it any kind of name, &gt;&gt; kidney disease, cancer, brain tumor. &gt;&gt; The Bible says I just need to have my foot there. [Music] &gt;&gt; So before that condition can go away, it needs my foot. &gt;&gt; So when you see any condition appearing in your life, your foot is there. It means God is about to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. For that thing to go away. It needs a foot &gt;&gt; to claim that inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Under your feet. &gt;&gt; It only needs my foot to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I get to any work place, &gt;&gt; when I get to any school &gt;&gt; and there are challenges, &gt;&gt; all what I need is my foot in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because wherever my foot is, God has given me that land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Verse five, I said, "And he gave him none inheritance in it." No, not so much as to set his foot on. &gt;&gt; Yet, he promised that he would give it to him for a possession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had promised &gt;&gt; that he was going to give it to him as a possession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, at the beginning, it was just his foot that was there. &gt;&gt; But the promise was given. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to recede after him &gt;&gt; when as yet he had no child. &gt;&gt; God had given him that possession. &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, all what he had was his foot. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He had no child. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God spake on this wise. So brother Stephven is explaining what why God did that. Amen. That his seed should s in a strange land. and that they should bring them into bondage and then treat them evil 400 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. So already the possession was given to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then something had to happen. Certain situations had to happen because God had planned everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. So sometimes you are in conditions, you are in situations that look as if it's not yours, &gt;&gt; but the thing was already given to you &gt;&gt; but things are happening around it and it look like it's not yours. &gt;&gt; Bible says that as long as your foot &gt;&gt; is in there, &gt;&gt; it is your possession. As soon as my foot is in the life of my child, as soon as my foot is in the life of my mother, my father, my brethren, all of them, that possession is mine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, &gt;&gt; said God. And after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place. &gt;&gt; Now, now looking at Israel in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing that um they in a strange land, right? &gt;&gt; But one thing they forgot was that they themsel was Jerusalem &gt;&gt; because in order to make Jerusalem, you need a people. &gt;&gt; So whilst they were going in bondage, &gt;&gt; they were carrying Jerusalem with them. But they didn't see that. They didn't see that. &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to open their eyes &gt;&gt; and say that the land that you are in, &gt;&gt; build houses, &gt;&gt; marry, have children. Amen. You can bring your inspiration in there. That is why Daniel had to be in there and praying. Amen. They didn't go after the gods of Babylon. Amen. But they had to bring their own god in there. That's right. &gt;&gt; So when you get into a situation, Amen. It is you, heaven, that is going in there. &gt;&gt; When it's a sickness, your foot is in there. That is heaven being brought into that situation. &gt;&gt; You only need your foot to be in there. &gt;&gt; Because you are heaven in that situation. &gt;&gt; So he said, "And he gave him the covenant of circumcision." &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So he gave him &gt;&gt; so Bible says that he didn't have any possession except his foot &gt;&gt; and yet God had promised him &gt;&gt; that possession. &gt;&gt; But then what did God do? &gt;&gt; A token &gt;&gt; of circumcision. &gt;&gt; So all what we need is a token. &gt;&gt; When we are in any situation all what we need is the token of the Holy Ghost. The talking of the word, what the word has said, that is all what we need &gt;&gt; to prove that we already possess the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we we we want to get um to the sermon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just two. I mean we we we are we are going to close but let's just get to the sermon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's open to John 12:24. John 12:24. I mean there's there's no dull moment um in in the house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring prayer is refreshing. &gt;&gt; Bring singing. &gt;&gt; Bring fellowship. Bring preaching of the word. There's no dull moment. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 12:4. &gt;&gt; John 12:4. &gt;&gt; I know it's a familiar scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 12:24. It said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, &gt;&gt; that's right. Except &gt;&gt; a corn of wheat &gt;&gt; fall into the ground and die, &gt;&gt; it abideth alone. &gt;&gt; But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So remember, when the seed goes into the ground, &gt;&gt; when the swer is sewing the seed, &gt;&gt; the intention is a harvest. &gt;&gt; And that harvest is not just bringing just one fruit. Bible says much fruit &gt;&gt; much fruit. &gt;&gt; So when we have the seed &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who died on the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then started the bride age &gt;&gt; after the bride was taken from his side. &gt;&gt; He had to die. &gt;&gt; He had to go to the soil &gt;&gt; and die. The intention is a harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The intention is a harvest. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he's just going to be alone. That's what the Bible is saying. &gt;&gt; But God's intention is to have many brethren. &gt;&gt; That is why he has to put him to the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now, let's read Mark 11:13. &gt;&gt; Mark 11:13. So we keep that in mind except corn of wheat. Mark 11 &gt;&gt; verse 13. &gt;&gt; So let's remember that when Christ the seed which is the word &gt;&gt; was put to the ground amen he had to die &gt;&gt; to bring much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the intention of the corn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Mark 11:13 says, "And seeing a fig tree," this is Jesus hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And seeing a fig tree a far off, &gt;&gt; having leaves, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; He came. &gt;&gt; If happily, &gt;&gt; now we know happily means perhaps &gt;&gt; maybe &gt;&gt; probability. Ah. &gt;&gt; Now when we say probability, it means there's a chance. &gt;&gt; Now this is the Lord Jesus Christ coming to the tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. With intention of a probability. &gt;&gt; He knew it was not time for fruit. &gt;&gt; But he came with probability. &gt;&gt; So regardless of how difficult the situation is, it it's like something it it's not going to happen. It's not happened before. The doctor says this for the rest of your life, you are going to be &gt;&gt; on on on on this medication. This disease is going to take you to death. &gt;&gt; Bible says if happily &gt;&gt; perhaps &gt;&gt; probability when the Lord Jesus Christ is coming, &gt;&gt; he's not looking at just one side of not happening &gt;&gt; because there's another side of it happening. So whatever situation that comes in your life, amen, approach it like the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Even if somebody says it's never happened, it's not going to happen before. Amen. It's not going to happen. Amen. But when it comes, probability there's that chance that it will happen. There's another side to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ didn't come at the season of fruit. He came at a season of no fruit &gt;&gt; and a season where there was no expectation of fruit &gt;&gt; and a season where it looks like there is no healing. It can never happen. It's never happened before. But he came perhaps the probability if happily. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we we get ourselves in situations. Sometimes people go to school and then they are told that you know you are not smart. &gt;&gt; So this subject you can um you can excel through it. I mean you can't you can't do well in this subject because um you can't catch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Christ is saying if happily &gt;&gt; if it looks like you can do it. &gt;&gt; Remember there is the probability. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is another side to it. &gt;&gt; When Christ is coming, he's the God of possibilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's coming to &gt;&gt; to show himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of a God that has nothing called impossible. in his dictionary. &gt;&gt; So this is a tree. Amen. That is showing leaves. &gt;&gt; And no fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's at a season where there's no fruit. &gt;&gt; But but let's look at who the Lord Jesus is. &gt;&gt; When he's coming, let's &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But before we get to that, Amen. The book of Matthew 12:33 says Matthew 123 I'll just read it quickly. Amen. For the sake of time. Matthew 12 12:33 &gt;&gt; says either make the tree good &gt;&gt; and his fruit good &gt;&gt; or else make the tree corrupt &gt;&gt; and his fruit corrupt &gt;&gt; for the tree is known by his fruit. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So when he's coming to the tree, &gt;&gt; he's looking for fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A tree is not by his fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's open to the book of Esther. &gt;&gt; Esther chapter 1 verse 12. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this bring my mind to Queen Vashi. &gt;&gt; When King Aasseros Amen. Let's read it. &gt;&gt; Kahaseros has his banquet. He has everything going on. is has a princess and everyone around. Amen. Vashi is also about her own business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Her own Exactly. doing her own stuff. &gt;&gt; And then the king sent &gt;&gt; that they should bring her in. &gt;&gt; Now let's see verse 12. &gt;&gt; But the queen Vastly refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlings. Therefore was the king very wroth &gt;&gt; and his anger burned in him. But but let's read verse 11. &gt;&gt; It said to bring vastly the queen before the king with a crown royal &gt;&gt; to show the people and the princes &gt;&gt; her beauty. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the king was waiting &gt;&gt; for the wife that he's married to &gt;&gt; to come and show the people her beauty. &gt;&gt; So when Christ goes to the tree, &gt;&gt; he's looking for the beauty. &gt;&gt; This is from the message marriage and divorce. And any woman &gt;&gt; that refuses a man his child &gt;&gt; has no right to be a wife to him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hey something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the prophet is typing something. Okay. You need to have love for your wife even if she makes a mistake. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember in LA last time I was talking to a brother um who was who was like another brother brought a lot of quotes of the prophet about marriage and divorce. He said in adultery you have to put your wife away in in fornication you have to put put her away. And and so so I I told him that even if the woman cut her hair the prophet said that what what she's done it it's it's is liable to putting her away. Amen. So are you going to be legalistic in doing this thing? &gt;&gt; And I said it is the love that you have toward that was what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; It is that love. &gt;&gt; So when when the man even goes out somewhere because of the love the woman has for the man. It's like even though he can go out to do anything, he's not going to do it. I believe him. I trust him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So so so the man also has that same thing. It's vice versa. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the love I have for the woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go out and mess up my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we don't put ourselves in those legalistic things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet said, "Put it away." Amen. So &gt;&gt; they said, "You remember? &gt;&gt; Do you love her?" Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember in the Bible when the king married Esther? &gt;&gt; Amen. So bringing us to Esther in Vi. Amen. Because the queen refused. That's Vashi. &gt;&gt; He just got him another one. &gt;&gt; So you're looking at Vashi, okay? Who was supposed to portray her beauty? &gt;&gt; She did not do it. &gt;&gt; She refused. &gt;&gt; So the king has to go for another one which is Esther. Right &gt;&gt; now, we know Esther types the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just got him another one. And what happened when she refused to come out with a king and obey him? &gt;&gt; The same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's read this. And so is it when the church refuses to become pregnantated in the age that we now live in &gt;&gt; to bring forth children of this age. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So remember it children are God's inheritance. &gt;&gt; So God's intention is for the age to bring forth children. So if a church is not bringing out the children of the Lord, &gt;&gt; that church will be divorced. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You must bring forth fruit from the age. &gt;&gt; They said we are not Lutherans. &gt;&gt; We are not worthless. &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the age has to bring forth children &gt;&gt; through the pregnancy of the word of God &gt;&gt; to bring forth a child of this age, &gt;&gt; the seed child. &gt;&gt; So Christ going into the earth, the intention is to bring forth a seed child in every age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The pro I hope you understand that. Amen. For the sake of time, 259 he said he went right on revealing his word to the body &gt;&gt; and vindicating him same by himself. &gt;&gt; His children begin to kind of look more like him &gt;&gt; because it's fully maturing &gt;&gt; or they become children of the word, not children of the church. children of the word. &gt;&gt; And the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word, unadulterated, not touched by any man's organization, any man maturely. &gt;&gt; She will be purely unadulterated. Amen. Bride of the word. Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She'll be the pregnant daughter of God. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's see why it is so. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is Christ requiring this? &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelations 22. Sorry, brother Stephen. I had to use this scripture. Revelations 22 verse 1-5. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 22. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 1 to5. Let's look at an example of who Christ is as a tree. &gt;&gt; And he showed me a pure river of water of life, &gt;&gt; clear as crystal, &gt;&gt; proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamp. And in the midst of the street of it &gt;&gt; and on either side of the river &gt;&gt; was there the tree of life &gt;&gt; which bear 12 manner of fruits. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And yielded her fruit every month. &gt;&gt; Every month. &gt;&gt; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said every month. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now each month you come you have a different kind of fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if even the month is a season in that month you come and you get a fruit &gt;&gt; in January you have a fruit &gt;&gt; when you come in February you have a different kind of fruit &gt;&gt; in March you have a different kind of fruit &gt;&gt; until December &gt;&gt; the following year it starts again &gt;&gt; so it is a tree that bears fruit all year round &gt;&gt; so regardless of the season &gt;&gt; Amen The Lord Jesus Christ only know of fruit &gt;&gt; regardless of the condition that we are in. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ only knows of fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even how difficult the situation is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's only looking for the fruit of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are we are closing. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is from the Sardisian church age. Now when when the Lord sold the seed, Amen. the seed had to go to the ground. Amen. Just like you have um the time of fall, Amen. where we know there's planting. Amen. And it goes to the winter. Amen. The winter everything dies. Amen. Then it comes to spring. &gt;&gt; Things begin to budge forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pointing towards the harvest. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, let's look at the Sardisian church age. &gt;&gt; The seed was put to the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when the seed is put to the ground, it gets to a point where you begin to see it come out. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to look at who that bride is &gt;&gt; in the midst of something that looks like um just leaves. Amen sir. &gt;&gt; Now the sadistent church age because when you look at Mark 11, Amen. Christ saw only leaves. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at another age or another scenario where there are leaves. &gt;&gt; And I said &gt;&gt; well one time there was a man went forth you know on his own grounds there. You see, a man went forth and dis up a great big field and he took all the roots out of it &gt;&gt; and everything and then he planted corn. &gt;&gt; Each morning he went to the door and look out to see if he had any corn &gt;&gt; the first thing you know. So each morning he was going to see this. Each morning he's going each morning &gt;&gt; cuz he has an expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each morning he goes. That's a step of faith. Amen. He knows that he has planted corn in there. &gt;&gt; So one morning, two little blades &gt;&gt; was sticking up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now when you take the blades of a corn, they are leaves. &gt;&gt; Two blades sticking up. &gt;&gt; Anyone ever raise corn? Where's George? Right. And them. I don't know who raises corn here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe brother John. Amen. I don't know, man. You know them two little blades that stick up? &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Praise God for my field of corn." &gt;&gt; I said, "Did he have a field of corn?" He said, "Well, in one way." &gt;&gt; I said, "Potentially, yes." I said, "That was you Lutheran." &gt;&gt; In the first reformation. So in the Lutheran age there were two blades &gt;&gt; showing two leaves. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we are comparing leaf to leaf. &gt;&gt; How does the bride behave in this condition? &gt;&gt; Now the prophet points us to the Lutheran which is the Sardisian church age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now from this verse which shows the elect of God to be a few names. You can see clearly what we have been teaching about this age. &gt;&gt; It was chaotic. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It was unfulfilled. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet is describing that age of the two blades. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The two leaves. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It was chaotic. &gt;&gt; Unfulfilled. &gt;&gt; It was split scores of w &gt;&gt; and God rebuilt it almost in its entirety. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; It was weak and sickly and ready to die. &gt;&gt; I can imagine a situation which was which is weak, sickly and ready to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not the glorious era that the carnalminded Protestant historians have tried to make it. &gt;&gt; One quick look at that tree saw it was conquered and blighted, denuded of leaf and barren of fruit. except for some deformed and wormying fruit that was fast dropping to the ground. So the prophet said, "But &gt;&gt; hold a moment. &gt;&gt; Look closer. &gt;&gt; There at the top &gt;&gt; in the light of the sun &gt;&gt; were some first fruits. &gt;&gt; Now this is a condition of two blades which is leaf." Now in the first instant he went there was no fruit. &gt;&gt; But his friend trying to prove that with his bride regardless of the situation remember every month there was fruits that was being shown. There were fruits that were being manifested. So in the first age there were fruits that came up. In the second age there were fruits. They were bride in every age. Now you see in this age of the leaf, God is showing his power that regardless of the condition, Amen. &gt;&gt; there are still fruits at the top. &gt;&gt; There at the top in the light of the sun &gt;&gt; were some first fruit, a few names, perfect in him, &gt;&gt; for they were born of him, filled with him, walking with him by his word. So the prophet said, "Thank God for those few &gt;&gt; and they shall walk with me." &gt;&gt; That is what God says he will bestow upon them for his upright walk. &gt;&gt; That is part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them. If they were willing to walk with him through toys and snares of life and be an honor to him, he was going to reward them. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he's not forgetful of our labor of life. &gt;&gt; God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him. [Applause] [Music] So, so I just want to bring our minds to this. &gt;&gt; This was in Sardis. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; How much more loud this year? &gt;&gt; When we have the harvest, &gt;&gt; what kind of fruit &gt;&gt; is it showing to the devil? Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember from the beginning he swed the seed &gt;&gt; to bring much fruit &gt;&gt; the time of the harvest. &gt;&gt; And if even in that condition &gt;&gt; of service of the lutherance there were still first fruit &gt;&gt; how much more the time of the harvest. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So this is my last quote. The prophet said we are living it. the evidence. &gt;&gt; How do you know he lives? Well, I'm living above that. &gt;&gt; I'm already raised up from that. &gt;&gt; Done. Tasted of the first fruits of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's what I'm talking about. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So just want to take this song and invite brother Stephen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Such a beautiful light comes when the dwar drops of mercy how bright shine all around us by day. Brother Steven amen by night. Jesus &gt;&gt; the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One more time. We walk in the light. Such a beautyful light. Where the drops of mercy are bright. Shine all around us by day and by now. Oh, we know that Jesus [Music] the light of the world. One more time. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. Such a beauty for life. Come when the do drops of mercies are bright. Oh sh. [Music] Oh Jesus, the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. If perhaps &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If perhaps &gt;&gt; if there is a possibility, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; to find something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a season, &gt;&gt; but that season is the season of the impossibility. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not the season of the fruit, &gt;&gt; but it was a season of the impossibility. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that season opened the third pool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Jesus would have found fruit, &gt;&gt; he would just take it and move on forward &gt;&gt; and never activated the anointing of the third. &gt;&gt; But because &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no fruit. Amen. &gt;&gt; He open up the power of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So look at your situation. &gt;&gt; Look at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Always there is a possibility. &gt;&gt; And if it feels like there is no possibility, then it's a signal for you to move on to a different gear. &gt;&gt; You speak the word of God because nothing is impossible to him that believe. &gt;&gt; In other words, if there is a possibility, I do it. But if there is no possibility, it doesn't mean there is a road block. It means now I need to use to a different level where I need to use a different gear and say okay now because there is no possibility we have to believe the impossible &gt;&gt; because with God all things are possible. Amen. In other word there is no impossibility for you &gt;&gt; in season. &gt;&gt; I will give you the quote. We will get to that in season and out of season. Amen. You will see what it is. Amen. We call it out of season, but it's actually is a season. &gt;&gt; It is a season called out of season. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a season that is called out of season. When it's out of season, then it's a season of miracle and impossibility. Amen. whenever because if not you're not going to believe the third pull &gt;&gt; because the third pull will bring a squeeze a strong squeeze until you have to completely depend on God and live on the impossibility because God is squeezing every deity out of us. &gt;&gt; In other words, even if you were scared to speak the word now, don't worry. The pressure will bring it out. Remember his anointing come in the midst of adversity. &gt;&gt; So when you see adversity and enemy and everything squeezing back in then it's God who want to bring the oil that is supposed to come from the inside of the dove. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime we are best when pressure come. &gt;&gt; Amen. When pressure come then your brain begin to work in a different rhyme that is different because you're trying to get out of a situation. Then you find out potentially about yourself that you never taught before. Amen. So God knows what he's doing. Amen. If everything is clean, easy, without any problem, you won't even learn anything. You can't even strive anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we were in dental school, we start pulling teeth. You want everything to go smooth. But how are you going to learn? If you pull a tooth, no problem. Because the instructor is there. if you you you are locked the instructor come and take off and everything and then they send us to clinic and I ended up where I chose I tried to pick up in Charlotte I say if I stay in Charlotte I'm going to stay close to my family so I will be there all the time when I when we begin to pick the site my computer froze so every site was picked and I was left with whatever was left so I ended up in Fagville [Laughter] And when I got there, every Wednesday you go to the prison to pull teeth. You don't do anything, just pull teeth. And that's where I begin to learn things different because you see things in a different realm and you get to difficult situation and the more difficult cases you are handling the more you are getting to a true dentist because you got to fight because we knew that after graduation your teacher ain't going to be there. When you get to your practice, there is no teacher standing there to help you with a wave a tooth. You fight that tooth and get it out yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God knows how to train you because God knew one day, one day you got to face the situation. And when you face the situation, you won't have time for prayer. &gt;&gt; You won't even have time for fasting. You have only one shot is to react to the situation. That's when Joshua realized that there is nothing I can do. But you know what? I got to speak to that son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't say let me ask the Lord's will if we can speak to the son. He didn't say the book of redemption is not back yet. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. Joshua didn't say we received the book of redemption. Now we can speak the word. He didn't have the book of redemption. The book of redemption was still in in heaven. He for I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. According to the way we are taught, &gt;&gt; we need to receive the book of redemption back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he came down in Revelation 10, Luke 17:30, Malachi 4, all of that when he comes then we feel entitled to speak the word. Joshua didn't have the seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't have the book of redemption. He didn't care whether he came back to earth or not. He need to come out of a situation. &gt;&gt; And the inspiration struck him and he spoke the word &gt;&gt; and that's it. &gt;&gt; Under which blood? The blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not even born yet. &gt;&gt; What are you afraid of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What else do you want? Amen. &gt;&gt; What vindication do you want? What sensation do you want to feel before you speak the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at his situation. He matched the situation 40 wilderness hungry. This this this a scripture send him that it happened over there because he happened over there. This is the scripture I'm going to use. And God brought him angelic food. Take your situation, match it to the scripture. Take what is in the scripture and put it there and move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a season when it seems like there is no season. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we got used to things being fine before we speak. Pray for me on Sunday and you will see what where God put you and what is hidden in what looks like a a mess. Amen. It's always an opportunity to show who you are. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight again. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love and your mercy, and for speaking to us tonight, Lord.

And may you bless those that need it in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, give us a mercy tonight, Lord, as we go into our respective place. May you remove any hindrance, any attack from the world of darkness. And Father, I know the devil has been going left and right since we started this prayer. And even before the prayer meeting, Lord, the whole day was hectic left and right. And I knew what he was Lord, father, afraid of. But now that you have given us the victory, Lord, we pray, Lord, and cover and claim the blood upon each one of us. May you protect us. And if you tar to come, may we meet again, Lord, Father, to fellowship around the things of the kingdom. We thank you and bless your word, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Come on, White John. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's pray for our sister Lily. She burned her hand. She had some blistering on her hand. So, let's just pray so that God can do the miraculous again. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you again, Lord. Father humbly tonight on behalf of our sister. Lord, just like I said Lord since Monday a hectic day Tuesday because of the prayer oncoming Lord Father things breaking down left and right Lord but Lord we know through it all there is a season Lord and Father Lord Jesus Christ one was been affected and attacked by the devil. We all as a body suffer together Lord. But Lord Father, we're not going to sit down to cry and just Lord Father mourn or Lord Jesus Christ complain about it. But as a body, you have given us the power to unite together and to ask Lord Father and you will grant it unto us. Lord, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you touch our sister hand and may you heal her completely by the power of the Holy Spirit. Father, we saw you healing people that got burned, Lord. Father, until Lord Jesus Christ, there was not even a pen, Lord. Father, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you touch our sister where she is, Lord. May the power of the Holy Spirit overshadow her. May you touch and bring complete healing and a complete victory and also a testimony for the glory of your name, Lord. Father, you heal her for many things, Lord. Father before Lord, but I pray Lord tonight be another special grace Lord that you will show your presence and extend your love to your daughter Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. I claim the blood upon this church. Protect us and lift up a standard against the enemy in Jesus precious name. Amen. We'll walk in the line. Such a beautiful [Music] life.
