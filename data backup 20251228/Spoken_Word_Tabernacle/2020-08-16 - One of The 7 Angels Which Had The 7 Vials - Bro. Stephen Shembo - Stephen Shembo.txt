christ we appreciate all the family visitors i cannot really say visitor it's family we got sister fanny's and sister amy's mom and dad with us here you're more than welcome and we had brother paul i see brother joseph there there's so many of you god richly bless you amen and amen if you would let's go back to the scripture we spoke couple weeks ago on who is the robobale i believe all of you know who zarova river belize last week we got into the trumpet and everybody in this church should know what a trumpet means sister should be able to exhort and brothers should be able to preach it so we know what a trumpet is we know the difference between the last trump which is the message of this hour and the seventh trumpet which goes to the jews in this church we believe a hundred percent on the message of the hour so if you don't have if you have a problem with the message you better answer scrub respect what we believe and leave us alone but we stand for the message of the hour in this pulpit it's only the bible says and brother branham say know what td jakes or the baptist or whatever say no it's the message of devourer interpreting the scripture praise the lord amen isaiah 29 now if you dare you can say amen the bible say and the vision of all in other words the entire book of isaiah the entire vision remember as we went through the series of the unchanging pattern of god we showed you by the prophet that isaiah wrote to the entire bible how many believe remember that isaiah had 66 books and what branham said all those 66 chapters represented the book of the bible in other words isaiah wrote the entire bible now isaiah is saying here that the entire vision or everything that he spoke in other words the entire bible everybody clear now you might be saying the entire bible the entire vision is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed everybody clear so the entire bible now is sealed everybody clear which men deliver to one that is learned in other words somebody who is educated saying read this i pray you and he say i cannot for it is sealed in other words when a book is sealed with a sale that seal is a lock to the educator are you there if you give a person or somebody who went to school this bible they can read it they don't have a problem with the riding because they went to school they're educated but if you fill the book then regardless of the education there is no way they can decode the scripture and isaiah is saying that the entire bible the entire book has been sealed and that still is to block the wise and the prudent but to reveal that only to the babes and brother branham said those bread are the predestinated seed of god hallelujah verse 12 and the book is delivered to him that is not learned so the problem is not only for the one that is educated even the illiterate but the illiterate is double-blind he cannot read and they still lock him up as well are you there he said and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray you and he say i am not learned so the one who's illiterate doesn't even worry about the seal because to begin with he cannot even read but the one that is educated that is able to read the scripture is locked by the seal it is only to a specific class of a people to understand prophecy everybody clear let's go to daniel chapter 2. so this book is a problem to those that are educated and those that are illiterate in other words whether you go to school or not you need to connect to the god that wrote the bible are you there you cannot say that i was uneducated you're still in trouble daniel chapter two verse one and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar naboo can nebuchadnezzar dream dreams where with his spirit was troubled and his sleep broke from him then the king commanded to call magician very educated on that time and astrologer phd's and the sorcerer and the calvins for to show the king his dreams so they come and stood before the king and the king said to them i have a dream a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream then spoke the carvings to the king in sarriac o king live forever tell your servant the dream and we will show their interpretation if you notice as long as the king have not spoken the dream the magicians are locked are you there so they're telling the king give us the dream give us the spoken word give us the scripture because once they have the scripture anybody can give you an interpretation we have the bible and we have none more than 900 denominations because we all have the scripture are you there as long as we have the scripture you can make this bible everything you want to brother branham said that even the unbeliever the hidden use the bible for debate because they have the scripture but if it's still then it's a different thing praise the lord verse five the king answered and said to the caudans the thing is gone from me praise the lord if you will not make known to me the dream that's not a problem with the interpretation thereof you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made there dug here they were waiting they got used to it you give us a dream because you're a king we're going to tell you things that are going to please you and that's how we go whether it happened or not no problem and the king said this time is different for me to know that you really have the gift of interpretation of dream you must first tell me the dream in other words the king sealed the vision hallelujah verse 6 but if you share the dream and the interpretation thereof you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof verse seven they answer again and say let the king tell his servant the dream they are locked educated are you there and we will show the interpretation of it the king answered and say i know of certainty that you will gain the time in other words you need to hurry because you see the things is gone from me but if you will not make known to me the dream there is but one decree for you decree for you for you have prepared what lying the king understood you see now you have prepared lying and corrupt word to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof in other words i always study you i know you all you want is for me to give you the clue then you can run with loose end all kind of way but for this time i steal the vision you need to be able to go beyond the seal to interpret the vision everybody clear praise the lord verse 10 they calvin answer before the king and say there is not a man yes there is upon the earth that can show the king's mother therefore there is no king lord no ruler that asks such things at any magician i thought they have power an astrologer i thought they can read the zodiac or cardinals they are educated and it is a rare difficult thing that the king require and there is no other that can show it before the king except the gods only gods not big only small gods and jesus said did not your law say that you are gods you must be a god to go into somebody's mind and to decode the seal hallelujah only god whose dwelling is not with flesh praise the lord let's jump to verse 27 daniel answer in the presence of the king a prophet and say the secret you see it's a secret now which the king has demanded cannot the wise man the astrologer the magician the shuffle show to the king in other words this is a different level it is a different category it is not to the educated there is nobody that can tap into this level verse 28 but there is a god in heaven that revealed secret [Applause] and makes known that to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days your dream and the vision of your head upon your bed are these drop to verse 45 for as much as you saw in other words i'm skipping this daniel was able to unlock the vision he took a prophet to decode the seal when they still see the face of a prophet he automatically pop up are you there the key to the seal is in the prophet praise the lord so daniel decode the vision and king nebuchadnezzar says in verse 45 for as much as you saw that the stone this is daniel keep talking was cut out of the mountain with a hand and that he broke in pieces in in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold we spoke about this last week the great god has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure watch verse 46 now we're going to get to something this morning then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face i want you to keep your seat belt this morning we are putting the foundation in this church so make sure you get your seat belt praise the lord when daniel came and decoded the vision that nobody else can decode except god nebuchadnezzar fell down before daniel then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped daniel a king brother stephen he is a hidden king keep your finger right there we're gonna come back okay let's go to jeremiah 27. just keep your finger right there take jeremiah chapter 27. jeremiah chapter 27 verse 6. if you dare you can say amen we're going to go back again to daniel make sure you get your bible i don't want you to say brother steven say the bible say brother branham are you there verse 6 and now have i given all this land into the hand of who nebuchadnezzar you need to preach with me the king of babylon karma my i thought he was a hidden god said he is worthy brother stephen it's only one scripture go to verse chapter 25 if you need more you see me if you need more scripture you see me jeremiah chapter 24 verse 9 behold i will send and take all the family of the north say the lord and who nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my let's go back to daniel so the man who was worshiping daniel was a servant of god a god then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face when he sees the level of revelation that daniel unfold the king fell down and worshiped daniel we're not going to worship a prophet relax relax i know somebody's like maybe online especially online because there's a scrub and they are putting thumbs down he's like go ahead go ahead we got him now you want to get your answer today then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet order to him a servant of god the king answered to daniel and say of the truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings a revealer of secret saying you could reveal this sacred secret nebuchadnezzar a hidden number one number two uh servant of god he only happened to heed and brother stephen not jews let's go to revelation 22. that's why i like brother kalima a revelation written by john a jew a servant of god an apostle a prophet a christian revelation 22 verse 6. and he said to me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophet sent his angel there was an angel sent to show to his servant are you there so in the book of revelation god sent an angel and that angel was the one showing john everything and when the danger keeps showing showing showing and the level of decoding was so high show his servant the things which must shortly be done verse 7 behold i come quickly who is speaking there who is talking to john this word let me go back again who is talking to john the angel by who is speaking here using the voice of that angel [Music] so this angel sometimes when he speaks [Applause] he have to go back and listen to his own tape because he was not him that was speaking behold i come quickly blessed is he that keeps the saying of the prophecy of this book i john the servant of god the apostle who leaned in the bosom of jesus saw these things and heard them and when i heard and sin i fell down to worship worship before the feet of the angel which show me this the level of revelation is so high until john fell down to worship verse 9 then say he to me the angel see you doing not for i am your fellow servant and of your brethren d so this angel is a prophet and dania was a prophet and of them which keep the saying of the books so he also have to keep the word of god worship who [Music] and he says to me still not the saying of this prophecy of this book for the time is a hand let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father we are getting into a part that seems to be very difficult challenging being attacked lord attacking the entire message buy it lord but father it is not great it is not difficult for you because you are the holy spirit who wrote the bible and you know why you permitted everything your prophet told us that if this book was a hebrew jewish book they would have hide these things but it was not a hebrew book it is the book of god that's why you put in everything knowing that one of this day you're going to unveil this mystery through your seven angel lord father we commit ourself unto the handmaid the holy spirit may the inside teacher come down lord father and teach us your word to your children be the alpha and the omega father in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we spoke about zerubbabel we spoke about the seven angel this morning we're gonna spoke about one of the seven angels which had the seven vows in the scripture there are seven angels like we saw last week there were seven angels with seven trumpet there were seven engines with seven trumpets that belonged to the deuce and there were also seven angel with seven trumpets that belonged to the gentile we saw that last week but in the scripture we have also seven angels which carry seven vows and one of them is a particular angel and it's an angel that was actually revealing the book of revelation to john that angel that john fell down to worship was the angel that was carrying the seventh vow but the bible referred to him as one of them in other words not every angel but there is one among the seven that have a particular ministry to unfold the book of revelation unto john are you there now we found out here i put him like the last one but we're gonna see who he is we have a word there called the vow what is in the message why are we not a denomination brother branham says how many knows that wisdom is one of the gift of the spirit now what kind of a group is he talking to them he must be talking to a group of people that have the gifts plural of spirit operating in this church we preach about them here is the mind that has wisdom but continue he said now you stop find that all through these church ages here pulling out the holy spirit speaking out how those gifts to be working in the last day now we got gifts of healing working it's going good well brother there is that a gift that is just one of them that is just a little minor thing that's healing well here is a far greater gift right here which will be the best the gift of the holy ghost of wisdom to put the word of god together and to show the church where we are standing then just get somebody's heal in other words brother branham is saying that the gift of healing that can put the word together and position a believer is more important than the gift of healing of your body what upon him say we all want to be well but i rather have my soul well then my body where any time you better be here first in your soul but that healing comes by the word of god not the written word but the reveal word of the hour because god said i send my word and my word healed them everybody there now last week we found out that there was a pattern brother bonham called that pattern a plan and we found that when a seal broke in heaven a thunder was revealed you should be familiar with this in that thunder there was a message and when a messenger will pop up a man of the hour having a ram's horn we spoke about the last week he was the message of the hour but in our part we already know our messenger is brother branham so he will blow the trumpet not our trumpet but the rams run trumpet because the rams run spoke about the death of a are you there and that trumpet was called a gospel trumpet we saw it last week i'm just building then we're gonna fly are you there when he blows the trumpet the sound of the trumpet was called trump a trumpet was an instrument but the sound of the trumpet was called trump and that trump is create war and in that trap was the message of the hour everybody clear in the message of the hour there is all the equipment the believer of the age need to withstand the evil of his day are you there that message provide your helmet of salvation are you there because paul said that i am not a shame of them because it's the power of god aren't you so salvation comes from the gospel which is the message of the hour are you there that message provides the breast spirit of righteousness and paul said in that gospel was revealed the righteousness of god so righteousness comes from the message that message also gives you the belt and the belt is the truth per se and jesus sacrificed to say my words are truth so the gospel the belt bring you also the gospel are you there and that same message gives you the shield of faith faith cometh by hearing what it comes from the message the word the gospel are you there and that same message also gives you the shoe the shoe which is the gospel of peace again the message and that same message gives you the sword which is the word of god so the message is enough to equip you to withstand the endeavor of your time hallelujah so when you receive the message heaven have to back you up are you there because the message is the word and we found out that we were temple of god jesus was the temple of god but paul also told us that you are temple of god but if you notice in the old testament when they were putting stuff into the temple nothing happened when they put the the candlestick nothing happened when they put the light nothing happened when they put the anchor nothing happened but when the world the ark was received into the temple then the pillar of fire came down so if you need god in your life you must first receive the message then heaven will back you up hallelujah hallelujah so god will send an anointing to back you up and the children of the devil will be also anointed by another anointing come from hell because when heaven open up hell also turn loose so the batter is not karma the battle is not fleshly the true battle is between seed it is the wheat against the terror but once god finish his work he will pull completely direct out with the messenger and he will drop the vow which was the judgment upon those that rejected the message you remember that now brother branham says this notice what happened here is the plan of it i'm repeating this the first thing happened is an announcement in heavens first what happened a seal open what is that a mystery unfold see and when a mystery unfold then a trumpet sounds gospel trumpet he declare war a plague fall are you there and a church edge open what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed but when he dies he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begin to proclaim that message and what does it start a world a spiritual world so every time the true message of god is preached it's gonna create woe and we are ready for war and then god take his messenger with the lack of that edge and lays them away asleep and then he dropped oh plug but branham didn't say val he said prague i say vow i am not more than brother branham i must be behind brother branham are you there and then he dropped a plug upon them who rejected a plug means what a temporary judgment everybody clear let's continue and he sent forth the the first messenger and he preached and a trumpet sounded as we picked it up after a while and the trumpet was declaring war trumpet always denotes worry the messenger the engine come on earth the messenger of the hour like looters like any of the messenger that we have talked of what does he do he arrives and is still open reveal a trumpet sound war declare and awake they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they are put in and a plug fall upon those who rejected them so here brother branham is speaking about a plague but we have spoken of her val what is going on and now as we study this we are comparing it now the first three books of the bible of revelation which we have pretty somebody want to see right i caught you thank you it just came by like a wave thank you the church now there is seven church ages seven seals seven trumpet and vows and unclean spirit like frogs and all these guys together are we following praise the lord there is seven verse you know there is sevens as we are going through they all happen right there the same time everybody clear following the plugs following the churches that's the same because it is all set up into one book everything and everything happened just in rotation everybody clear one goes right into the other and the other and the other there is two spirit working god and the devil brother branham this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of revelation for out of the church ages the edges comes the seal and out of the seals come though gospel trumpet and out of the trumpet comes though here he doesn't say plug take revelation 15. if you dare you can say man we're gonna navigate in revelation today back and forth so we need your bible revelation 15 verse 1 and i saw everybody there and i saw another son in heaven great and marvelous seven angels everybody clear having seven what last place everybody clear for in them is philip though so right here in revelation 15 the bible said that when you look at the plague the plague is something that is filled with the wrath of god everybody clear john two verse five it's speaking about a plague not a vow verse five and after that i look and behold the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened and the seven angel came out of the temple the same angels everybody clear heaven seven what plagues you already seen that clothes in pure and white lemon so this angel number one they have plagues number two they are cloves and their clothing is in what white and pure what lenin we are trying to decode that angel right and having their breasts girded with what number three this angel has a belt that is a golden brother god speak of deity you need a court you see me everybody there having their what a little bit louder heaven there so the belt is not where we put our belt here [Music] everybody the belt of this angel are where the breast goes in the bible it says the paps it's a breast or in a perhaps position praise the lord seven and one of the beasts who is that beast i put a lie on there but the bible didn't say it the bible said one of the beasts let's repeat what the bible say i put here as a star one of the just the way it's written though four beasts we don't know who he is but stephen put a lie on there one of the four beasts gave this is not that he give he gives so when dos angel before they come out of the temple inside the temple one of the beasts gave them something are we there one of the beasts gave them gave to the seven angel seven golden vowel so we have number four here golden deity valve everybody clear seven golden vowel full of what i thought that the plague had the wrath of god right now the vow have the wrath of god in other words these two things are the same a trumpet is an instrument a trump is the sound of the trumpet are you there a valve is a container a plug is what is inside the valve we clear now we clear now go up to verse 6 to chapter 16 verse 1. and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angel go your ways and pour out there vowel of the wrath of god upon the earth they don't say again poor the plague because the vow contender plug all of them life of god one is a container one is what is content inside but when you say poor the plug poor the valve it is the same thing we clear now as we look at this angel [Music] we see seven of them we just read them and they were given dosba by one of the four beasts and i put there that he was a lion he says one of the four beasts why a lion take revelation forward we only have one service i can rush you lose or i can go slowly you win i want you to win when uh jacob was struggling with the angel the engine have to let jacob win so i want you to win okay i'll leave it alone revelation 4 brother branham said when the pastor stand on the pulpit he's god's angel that was it revelation 4 let's go to verse 7. and uh so there is an another here first beast first there is another and the first beast was like a first equal lion come on and the second beast was like oh there is another second second is a knox or a cuff there is an order and the third beast was as a festival third there is an order third there is another is as a man if you continue the fourth one is in it's like unto what there is like a flying ego if i ask you the first beast means what lion right second beast means what ox third means what fourth meteor if i ask you the lion is which be the first second or third check revelation 6 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen praise god and i saw when a lamb opened one of the seas and i heard adi was a noise of a thunder watch one watch what is written there one after let me look at this sentence one after okay did they say his name let's leave it alone don't interpret leave it alone one of the four beasts say come and see let's just leave it alone we don't know him okay job two verse three and when he had opened the second seal i heard there now we have the order we have the order the second business who is oh let's check him we don't know the other one let's go to verse five and when he opened the third seal ahead there we have another who is the third business thank you let's go to verse seven and when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the who's the foggiest now let's go back one of the four beasts we already know this we already know this we already know this so who is that beast any question so when the bible say one of the four beasts it referred to her it is hide to the eyes of the wise and reveal only to baby predestinated baby so this beast is a lion why a lion he leaves the throne to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a king to bring the word to to judgment who have rejected his a plague is given to those that have rejected what and the lion who's responsible for judgment must be the one to give it to everybody clear now are you there the lamb cannot speak because the lamb bring grace but once you reject once you eject the message the throne of god is turned into a throne of judgment are you there then there is no blood on the mercy seat because the blood is the message of the hour that's the token are you there once you reject the message you reject the blood then god speak to you as a lion remember the old testament teaching now as we heard it when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it judgment seat and when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his right he was a judgment seat then he became naughty at all king notice here he come leaves the children as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a thing to bring the whole world into that is what rejecting the message turn god into an eye on you everybody clear but one of this angel is peculiar he's the one revealing the book who is this angel you ready we just saw that this angel one of them i just pulled one out because the bible said one of them so i leave the other one i just pulled one of them are you there this one has a plague a golden vowel val means the judgment plague have the wrath of god judgment golden means divine judgment the same moses that could pull israel out was able to destroy egypt the same word that said noah was the one that destroyed the unbeliever are you there you're following me so the golden vine is divine judgment divine vow it is an angel what kind of angelosi what is it we have two kinds of vengeance right bounding killer well what is an engine a messenger get the dictionary and find out what an angel means some of them's heavenly messenger like those to the jews some of them are free messengers that god dwells in to bring his earthly message and these are messenger angels of the lord messengers to you they are standing there with their hands out to obey what god says so right here we found out that there is two category of angel there is heavenly angel which can come right now and disappear and there are also earthly edger which are human beings messengers are you there but is this a human being or is this a heavenly angel we okay the bible says that we already understood this right the golden vowel we know what it means check right we already understood the plan check right now the bible says that they have they are clothed in white and pure lining we are trying to decode this angel why take a revelation 19. before we get to the worship shake you up again and me say that i don't touch that the stuff that you don't want to discuss that where the trouble is the stuff that you don't want to discuss in the marriage that's where the trouble is [Applause] we must be open-hearted revelation 19 verse 7 if you dare you can say amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and he is everybody clear the wife of the lamb and his wife has made herself ready we are talking about the wife of the lamb which is the bread wow okay he caught it let's go to verse eight and to her who's her the bride to her was granted that she should be away in [Music] stop there can i circle this okay okay come on to her was granted that she should be away in fine land and clean in other words pure clean end stop that's how you read your bible pure clean and so this garment is a garment that belongs to the bride so this angel have something to do with the grinder he's wearing the same garment as the bride brother stephen say [Music] i want to see it in the bible are you there fine lemon clean and white for defined learning is the righteousness of what ouch so we found out that this garment belonged to the earth so this center must be a sent a sent member of the bride tech jude chapter verse 14. are you there jude verse 14. it's the last book before revelation if you dare you can say amen everybody here and enoch enoch also there why not the six only the seventh noah died adam died seth died one two three four seven rupture brother brother now we found here that enoch was the seven from noah which was a top of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but enoch was translated enoch was rapture the seven showing that it is the seven church ages that takes the rapture now there is no doubt we are in the seventh church age we all know it it is the seven churches that take the rupture all of the other six died but enoch was she was sleeping because he was not found god took him but the end time brad will be called out the rupturing without death will be caught out of the seventh church age which we are now bearing record that edge let's go back to the bible now verse 14 and enoch the seven from adam prophesies and saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of what to execute what vowel vowel vowel not for mercy vow are you there take zechariah 14 we are navigating we're getting somewhere zechariah 14. first four talking about the coming of the lord everybody there few people everybody there and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem this is the third coming jesus coming with his brother are you there which is before jerusalem on east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall we move toward the north and half of it toward the south verse 5 and you shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountain shall reach to ezra yeah you shall flee like as you fled before the earthquake in the day of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall come and out there we clear now so we found out that here pure white and lion and it is checked this angel is a part of the bride he's a part of the saint everybody clear when we look at the blood itself and the vow take revelation 17. now we're digging if you're sleepy wake up you need this everybody there revelation 17 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen and there came one of the seven angel that's where your title came from one of the seven ninja which had seven vows not all of them one of them that's why we pull him out right and talk with me saying to me come here i will show you the judgment do you see that angel the vow are you there the judgment of the great wall that sits upon many waters everybody there verse 3 so he i want you to preach with me verse 3 he so that angel was picking up john and he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness so that angel said come but he has the power to pick up john in the spirit and take him to a place where john can see things jump to verse 7 and the angel said to me wherefore did you marvel in other words he showed to john don't say oh my god [Laughter] i will tell you ah that angel say i will tell you in other words i'm gonna explain it to you so that angel has a knowledge of the mystery i will tell you that he understands the revelation of the mystery was given to him to explain it to john so when john have a question he has an answer question jump to verse 9. and here is demand which has what do you remember my first quote do you remember the seven heads are the seven mountain which the woman seeks wisdom you see that wisdom putting the word together to show you your position are you there verse 21 chapter 21 revelation you want to navigate today just bear with me revelation 21 verse 9. if you dare you can say amen brother elijah you remember this and they came to me what one of the seven engines which have there that same angel again full of the seven vast uh the seven last plug and talk with me come here i shall show you the over there i'm gonna show you the world the prostitute here i'm gonna not only give you the revelation of babylon but i also gonna give you the revelation of the bride are you there a bride i will show you the bride the lamb's wife verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit again that angel has a power to take you and connect you somewhere until you listen to him and your eyes pop up and you say now i see everybody there jump to verse 15 keep your seat belt verse 15 you there keep your seat belt we saw that angel being part of the scent we are trying to decode okay verse 15. and he talked with me who talked to him to john the seven injured i have though okay and he talked with me and had a golden read everything with him is just gold deity golden measurement we saw that the plummet was in the hand of the robot which was the sword okay golden read to measure the city the city is natural but the city also is spiritual which is the bread because ephesus was a city smyrna was a city tartarian was a city philadelphia is city laodicea is city but the brother also is a city the new jerusalem but the measurement of the bride is with that angel that danger knows how to measure you are you there verse 15 and the gate thereof and the world thereof verse 16 and the city lies four square this is where the pentecostal bite stuff here they don't know the fourth square is different here okay let me deal with this they see the brother brandon said that it is like a pyramid are you there here when john is seeing the city coming down john says that it look like it's a foursquare john never contradict brother branham when you look john said that he was looking up so when you look at the pyramid that the best it looks like a [Music] squad jesus christ this message this message is the truth [Applause] you don't play with this message if you don't understand something leave it alone believe it and move forward you don't have to understand everything once a prophet is vindicated whatever he say listen to him [Music] oh moses this is the red sea we don't have a boat follow moses did you know god is gonna separate the water you didn't know it looks foolish are you there when the ethiopian eunuch when the etopian eunuch was baptized by philip as soon as philip baptized him what happened to philip he disappeared he was in another in another city let me ask you a question if the ethiopian eunuch tells you that i was with philip right now [Applause] and the people in samaria tells you that i was with philippe one now how are you gonna put that together [Music] it is not logical brother branham being here and being here what about philip he was here and he was over there you asked the people of sanaya philippines here you asked the unit feel it was here what are you gonna do with it search the scripture search the scripture in them you think you have eternal life the scripture defends this message [Applause] [Music] praise the lord let's go to verse 17 and he measured the wall who measured the wall measure the wall the angel he measured the wall thereof 144 cubic according to the measure of what please look at your bible according to the measure of what that is of thee so this danger is huh are you there the angel is descent he is a part of the blood to be more specific he's not a woman he's a man he's human one of the four beasts check the golden girdle on the breast on the paps that way we are what's wrong with that check revelation 1 7 13 if you're there you see that he was never turn it over the shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the golden tight around the top with a sash over his shoulder guarded about though the breast with a golden girdle guided up high what is it an attorney for the brand a judge for those who rejected the message the judge with his search over his shoulder guide up here not done as a priest see that shows he was not in his priesthood son of god now john went all the way over into the lord's day and saw him coming as hell before jesus died jesus have 12 disciples and those 12 disciples have specific spot i don't have time now brother branham said the one who was in the other court was phillip that's why when the greek came they have to talk to him first are you there but when jesus was sitting eating there was one disciple that had a peculiar a peculiar behavior when they sink he always come and say hey they're telling me you are sitting on my spot peter said what's going on it's john again peter turned around he said john you need to grow up he said ah and jesus is sitting john will come push by telling me get close to jesus take his hand off and put it in jesus chest and he sit quiet and jesus doesn't do anything are you there jesus could tell his disciple certain things and he could hide certain things the only one who could decode those stuff was john that's why peter said who's gonna betray you jesus keep quiet peter say i know who got the key he said john asked him are you there when john asked the question jesus opened up and he always leaned on the bosom of jesus and before jesus died peter said what would happen to that one you love him so much are you there jesus said what is that to you if he terry tell her jesus fulfilled that scripture on the island of patmos by showing the coming of the lord the coming of the lord he comes like a lion so that messenger have to appear like a judgment angel brother brother a snow white hair de-judged not girded around the west but girded around the pubs up here judge with a sash of the judge over his shoulder he stood with a golden pure holy refund god that held his judgment are you there now let's go to revelation chapter one we are there we still on one so let's go to first one now before we get here we got clear here right let me erase this let me keep my two here everybody there praise the lord now the book of revelation is called the revelation of jesus christ and by the brother branham said the bible also is the revelation of jesus christ this is the most official book of any book in the bible this is the only book that christ put his heal upon it is the only book that christ wrote himself of the whole bible the ten commandments he wrote with his finger that's right jews held on that and today it is the revelation the book of revelation have more symbols it's a seal book are you there in it then all the rest of the book of the bible it has more symbol because it is a book of it is a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class gods the book is not meant for everybody this message is not for everybody there is nobody can understand it hardly this book is made for a certain class of people the toronto me say the hidden things belongs to the lord and once he revealed it it belongs to the children i will get on this later vadavanam it is also the consummation of the scripture in other words he finished the scripture the book of revelation the complete transformation it is geographically placed at the right place at the end of the bible so god put genesis put this put this put this but this book god keep it at the last place and it is a book that is written by this angel with the vow the revelation of the whole thing bless back here with a blessing to who reads it and hears it with a curse to them that shall add or take away it's a complete canon this book is deep i thought the bible was an absolute yes it is but the absolute interpretation of the bible is the message [Music] what is going on brother stephen revelation 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show to his servant thinks that must come shortly and he send and send send and signify it explain it by his angel that angel that we saw are you there to his servant john who bore record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that is so blessed is he there the first verb is to read are you there in order to read you must have it in written form in other words you must have it in book are you there so this revelation of jesus christ will come in the form of books let's continue blessed is he that really and then there is two verbs here the first verb is to read the second verb is to hear here you need an audio or a voice so this book when it's revealed by the angel it will come into form it will either be in books form or in audio forma that audio might be tips it might be mp3 it might be ipad it is still audio or it might be books blessed is he that here that reads and he the word of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time inside and if you either read this message oh audio listen to this message there is a blessing to it this book this message of this angel comes in audio or book form either it's a book or it is intense the bridge the mystery of this seventh seal book will be revealed at the signing of the seventh churches message see the seven angel begin to and there is the messages rolled up there and we got it in end blessed is he read and listened so this angel is a said member of the brother he's a man that will be displayed in books and chips [Music] take revelation 19. [Music] how did stephen say our pastor say the bible say brother branham says are you there verse 9 and he says to me who says that thank you write blessed are they which are called to the marriage stopper of the lamb are you there and he says to me these are the true saying of god and i fell i thought jonah fell already in revelation 22 when we read this is in 19. and i felt at the feet to do what to worship him so if you see people worshiping do you think it's crazy and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said to me who you who are waiting online just wait and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said to me see you do it not i am your fellow servant and of your brethren they have the testimony of he added that he has this testimony of jesus christ the testimony of jesus that's what he says he has the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of in other words this man is a prophet he says he has the testimony of jesus christ what does that mean take revelation 6 bear with me i don't want somebody to shoot you up there and say hey you are worshiping brother brown i'm in the message we got to deal with it revelation 6 verse 9 and when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that was slain for the word of god and for the testimony which there did you see here he said the testimony of jesus brother branham these souls under the altar these souls are understanding now that is under the altar they were martyred by sinful men like eichmann talking about the jews see they are they are holding right on them million of them see but they are remain jews everybody clear verse 10 and they cry out with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true do you not judge and avenge our blood of them that dwell upon the earth so these souls have the testimony of god but they are crying for vengeance are you there now remember what is it they were killed for the word of god's sake not for the testimony of christ did you understand that remember the church comes in the mighty of the church was for the word of god and the testimony of christ but branham is explaining to you that the testimony of christ belonged to the bride whatever guarana they were slain for the testimony of god for the word of god the testimony they held now we found out that the bread was the word of god and the testimony of this had no testimony of jesus christ and you got to have the token and when the token comes it testifies off he said he would and christ is the word and how can you deny that the bible is true part of it and still say you have the token when the token is there off so the testimony of jesus christ is the token this angel had their token nothing particularly that none of this under the altar were killed for the testimony of jesus none of them they were not they were not like antipas who was slain for holding first his name these are not born-again ones no token with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word and notice how they are crying out for they cannot be bright material their bread turned their cheek and christ forgive them father for they don't know what they are and you on the internet that follow me like a pharisee i forgive you this church forgives you because you don't know what you're doing but repent lest you find yourself fighting against god these are jews they have to be because they are in the fifth seal they are crying for what vengeance so this angel is a part of the blood and he has a token and in revelation 22 he is a prophet he's a saint he's a proud of the brother he's a man he's a prophet his message comes in book and audio he's a part of the bride he have a talking message who is this angel this is your angel [Applause] are we clear are we clear the problem we have brother stephen john fell down to do what why you ready there is brother branham said when you look at the scripture superficial you want to come up with a superficial understanding there is a double mystery to this okay number one john by nature he was a jew are you there but in this book of revelation who is john john being taken up immediately after the church age was the top of the rapture [Music] this is a gentile church it's coming this immediately after the church age is over this long audition churches then comes though so the church goes up like john did in the presence of the of god that just wings up my soul around caught up at the rapture of the church this place the book of revelation was written at the end of the day so john is dealing with this angel this angel is a messenger are you there but john represents the bride but the brand have two kind of people the fourth mystery of the new testament as one body composed of what jewsen so the bride of god help jews and gentiles because the bride started in jerusalem are you there but as we progress more and more after the italian church age brother branham said the jews drop and the church turn around completely to the gentile that's why brother branham always say luther wesley panicle luther wesley particle because that's the pride the part of the blood that is purely gentile are you there so john worshipping the angel is bringing up a behavior of gentile in other words the part of the bride that will be dealing with that angel will be a gentile blood not a jew we found john is a type of the gentile take out to chapter 10. we're gonna run sooner toward the airport but let's deal with this are you there at the chapter 10 if you're there you can say amen verse 25 and as peter was coming in who who was cornelius a jew what a gentile in the house of cornelius and as peter was coming cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and did what are you there so john felling down to worship was a signal that the part of the blood that's gonna deal with this angel will be a gentile brother we clear we just found another gentile here when the angel came and said call peter he's going to tell you when he said peter what did he do john was behaving like a gentile are you there when king nebuchadnezzar they opened the vision what did he do a gentile take act 14 you are attacking things you don't understand step up to chapter 14 verse eight and then started certain men had lystra was it jews was that jews okay elisha important in his feet being a cripper from his mother womb who never had walk the same heard paul speak who stand fastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand up right at your feet and he leap and walk a miracle and when the people saw what paul have done they lift up their voice saying in the speech of the la la canyon the gods are come down to us in the likeness of what gentile do you see their behavior every time the supernatural open what happened watch verse 12. and they called barnabas and paul mercurius because he was the chief then the priest of the of jupiter which was before the city brought oxen and garland to the gate and would have done sacrifice with that it's a gentle behavior are you there it is a signal that the part of the bride that's going to deal with this message of this angel will be a gentile take daniel ford daniel chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen i'm sorry i'm going to the scripture but i gotta do it when you are there you don't need to call me you take the bible yourself verse 4 if necessary you can call me daniel 4 verse 8 but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was who beth sasser according to the name of mine so the image nebuchadnezzar made was the image of who you see now you see now a gentle behavior let's go to verse 3 chapter 3 first one nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was please call cubit and the breath thereof six cubit he set it up on the plane in the plane of dora in the province of what babylon who made the image the image was made by a man not god are you there verse 18 but if not these are the three people be known to you o king that we will not serve your gods adult no worship the golden image another statute which you have set up jews don't do that are you there it is a gentle behavior are you there naboo kenesa was the one that made a statute to daniel are you there and ask the people to worship it the three review refused but they never rejected daniel are you there the three people never says because daniel they are making your image from now on you are a false prophet are you there if somebody make a statute of brother branham and want us to worship we will refuse but the picture of the pillar of fire was not made by men it was the mechanical eye that caught the picture you need to know what an angle is are you there one day elisha was with gazi and he said there are more with us there's he doesn't see and he said lord open his eyes when they open his eyes gazi with a human eyes saw the supernatural but this time not human eye but a mechanical eye the mechanical does not fabricate like nebuchadnezzar he only declared it is not an adult in this church we have to lift the picture off the pillar attire [Applause] are you there it is not a jewish church it is a gentile church number two number one everybody clear it is a signal that the part of the bride will be gentile number two take luke 17. why is john falling down to worship this i have to put all of this down so we take off everybody clear verse 17. are you there i want everybody to read this you only have one service let's handle this before you get in the war up there are you there verse one then say he to the disciple it is it is impossible for what it is impossible for do you know what offense means do you know what offense means in other words it is inevitable for a stumbling block not to happen you want to remove stamping block god said it is impossible it must happen you need to understand god it is impossible that offense will not come but who will woe to him through whom they come we cannot stop somebody for doing things that are stupid but the problem is to him not as needed the message if somebody worship brother pronoun it is impossible matter of fact if nobody expressed that brother branham will be a false prophet [Applause] take matthew 26. take matthew 26 you acting like peter the scripture says jesus must die and peter is there lord they're not gonna kill you they're not gonna kill you like he loved jesus more if you were there you're gonna say oh peter he really loved jesus do you know what jesus said he said he was satan are you there he said get out of here devil are you there the one who was blocking the fulfillment of the prophecy was satan through credit he doesn't want jesus to be rejected but of faith must come to him for jesus to be good messiah jesus needs to stay alive for this message to be true there should be no adult achieving the message the same spirit verse 24. verse 24 if you dare you can say amen the son of man goes as it is but whoa to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it has been good for that man if he had not been in other words somebody must fulfill a scripture but what to him for fulfilling that scripture it was better for judah not to be born but judah must be born and he must betray the messiah to make the old testament prophecy become true somebody must worship brother branham it is bad it is not good but he get to make the center true [Music] if nobody expressed that spirit of idolatry brother branham does not qualify to be that angel offense must come but woe to him the offense comes offense is proving to us it is the messiah it is the message of the hour it is the truth you don't take your mind and understand the bible with human mind take a look 24. we want to stop judah if judah didn't kill him how would we have power over the devil huh how joseph expressed clearly that he was sold for 30 pieces of of silver you don't want judah to do that no judah must do that and when we see we look at the old testament we say that's the messiah are you there but we acting like peter no we don't want judah to do that judah must fulfill prophecy would dictate the event but woe to judah it was good for judah not to be born but judah must be born luke 24 20 44. the bible says and he said to them these are the words which have spoken to you one was yet with you that all things must be fulfill which were written in the law of moses and in the prophet and in a psalm concerning what so if this century was worshipped in the book of revelation that must be fulfilled not for us to worship him but it is a cleaner determination that we are following the right thing is a dollar tree in a message a problem again no word to him who does that word to him who worship brother branham but to me it's a signal that our brother branham is a true messenger then then john the revelator the whole book of revelation was wrote when he was wrote he said i have sent my angel jesus did and john fell down to worship the angel but the angels said stand up worship god see a true angel of god won't stand to be worshiped and he said that he was a prophet and was his fellow man that had been sent to signify these things therefore angelic being is ordained minister of god to come to the earth to bear record of the word so no true angel will stand to be what brother branham what did you do when people begin to worship you is this something new you went to asia you see people worshiping brother branham they did it when he was alive it is not new news it's not good news it is not breaking news it was there when he was alive and he must be when he is alive if it happens when he's dead it's a problem it must happen when he's alive [Music] i heard a few more times and the other day in canada yeah i thought he was hidden i thought he was a heater who's who's going to do that naboo caneles are mine john yeah apostle prophet christian who did this here [Music] a brother showed me a little ticket of things he is packing his pocket say william adam is our lord baptizing in the name of william in which he is he breaking news why you didn't reject the message in 61. why you didn't reject the message in 61 we are in 2020. [Music] all these years all these years all this year the message was good only today i hope you change your mind who are listening you who put thumbs down your times will go up [Music] if he had been an enemy if he had been my enemy i would have known it was a joke but a precious darling john beloved john the beloved john come up to confess his sins and he's wrong and say his faith is me as being jesus christ and i got all kind of leather that has come in the last few days and calls from different places saying that i was present that is uh i am y'all i am you all john when he wants to worship the angels say i am you all i went to the lord here not long ago when i first heard it about a year ago and then when i went to the lord and he referred to me today instead of god saying don't worry about that god say go look at there [Music] instead of god say you are right what they are doing is bad god is telling brother branham look at that look at that that when john came forth preaching that they had not had a prophet on the earth for so many years until there was all a mess in the heart thinking maybe john was there in other words instead of god saying william bradham don't be broken-hearted god look at brother branham he said why are you crying look in the scripture when john came with the spirit of elijah they did the same thing and you also have the spirit of elijah what do you expect [Applause] do you expect less do you expect less jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god does not [Applause] let me see if i can i can pull that i can pull that where are you yeah that's it john he said he was not he even give the scripture remember if you ever believe me if you ever believe me to be huh remember that is hell it is the self the lord it is a has nothing to do with it i am y'all in 1961 why didn't you reject the message who is this angel it's your messenger there is seven church edges seven plugs seven seal seven trumpet and by god's help and with the book of history i can prove to you that we are living in the seventh trumpet gospel champion for the seventh plague and for the seventh seal to be open and the seven vow to be poor everything together we have more stricter fundamental proof of it than that we do we have more stricter fundamental proof i believe by faith and what if the angel of the lord was standing here now circling and every one of your eyes would be visualized to see that would be pretty good but to look at this picture often is far more proof than what if you was looking with your eyes see isn't that right because you could have an optical illusion but that camera won't take an optical illusion it won't do it because it's a camera it will take the action he has to be there to strike there this is not another if you wish to sell it make it enough so every person poor people can get it but i say look another thing i will require for the this picture is sacred it is not something to play around we are not worshiping brother branham brother branham is the seven angel the one who have a commission to unveil the book of revelation but if somebody worship him word to them but scripture must be fulfilled any question let's stand sunday the mystery of the tuesday [Applause] you saw who jerobel was you saw who the seven angel with the last trump was you saw who is unveiling this book of revelation which is the revelation of the entire bible it is still to the alleged to the to the to to the educated it's only revealed through prophet but he has a mystery connected to it that ninja is not a heavenly it's an earthly manger he's a saint he's part of the blood he's your brother he's a prophet he's a man he's a human being but he have been commissioned to unfold the entire book of revelation and if somebody fall down to worship him two ways number one we are gentile it's a gentle behavior showing to the people that he's gonna deal with the gentile broad and number two offense must come to line up with the scripture wrong to him that does it but he have nothing to do with the vindication of the message the message stands true and that offense of judah make jesus christ more the messiah let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace again we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything you're doing for us for this church and opening these things to us father years ago these
