no denying that i have changed i've been saved from who i used to be but even in my best i must confess i still need help to see the way [Music] somebody with a hurt that i could have helped somebody with a hand that i could have held but i just can't see fast myself lord help me be a little more like mercy a little more like grace a little more like kindness goodness love and faith a little more

the name of the lord how many believe that jesus is here praise god we got few peoples out and a lot of folks sin so blessed be the name of the lord amen people were giving testimony it's wonderful to hear them i had one and i keep forgetting about it keep forgetting about it i believe if it was uh brother robert was a couple way a couple fridays ago me and brother robert were at the church property there he was waiting on contractors and things like that so we were outside talking with brother robert and suddenly a whirlwind came out you don't believe on it check your bible that was my first time that i was inside the whirlwind so it started swirling around moving around moving around and finally me and brother robert were in the midst of the whirlwind a powerful one then it left me and brother robert and he went straight to the door of the church and opened the door of the church amen god spoke to job in the whirlwind and brother robert rushed and tried to hold the door to pull it back but the whirlwind was so strong that brother robert was unable to pull the door back then he left the door again and come and went straight in the midst of the property and whirled around and went up and that was it [Applause] you know in the scripture elijah and elisha were talking together right until the world won't come up so it's up to you to know what was i talking with brother of it that's a i can't say it on youtube before i get somebody upset thank you very much the musician god reach me bless you [Laughter] amen your church is made out of concrete you know that right you want me say it okay few people so we leave it alone [Laughter] few people so we leave it alone do you want me to say it oh okay so you'll be responsible for it [Laughter] i was uh i believe it was the week before i was with brother tim hayton and he mentioned to me he said brother stephen there is something about this area that the spirit of the lord like he said there used to be an old church of the message in that area he says something happened and the church left the message amen he said then a second church came in in the same area he said for some reason the same scenario again happened he said the lord again took you and brought you in the same area back again i say and he told me say i don't know it seems like there is something in this area that the lord still want to hold the church there regardless of what happened so when i told robert that he said what is stephen i never even thought about it and i said you know the story of the three little pigs [Applause] can you say amen i say if you look at your church it is made out of concrete amen and that story had the big bad wolf and paul in the scriptures say the nicolet and spirit is a spirit of wolf [Music] and the first house was blown by the wolf you remember that and the second house was made out of what the second house was made out of what [Music] made out of water are you there it was made out of wood and the wolf came and blew it up are you there i said the third one is made out of concrete this time this is the last one and this house is not going to fail amen that's why your whirlwind came up [Laughter] are you there then your whirlwind was so happy that we were talking about it and he came as a vindication that this time this is the end that's what [Laughter] that's why your building doesn't give you much room to play the even the door of that building are still you can't temper with it amen this world now doesn't give any room to manipulate again let's go to our bible before we get into something else you made me disclose my secret [Laughter] amen the third house that was the end of the bad wolf amen that house was made out of concrete go to your church and hit it like this make sure you got good gloves before they take you to an ambulance genesis chapter 3 blessed be the name of the lord how many are on listen to the sermon on wednesday so everybody is in the page nobody behind them praise god genesis chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother david if you would check please the folks online last wednesday they were worrying about the sound and something like that so just make sure everything is good and connected as a priest working in the sanctuary you have a right to check your text if it's nothing about the sacrifice then you got to go outside you got to stay within the sacrifice then you can do it on the sabbath day if it's not the sacrifice then you gotta respect the sabbath in other words if it's not related to the church you cannot text six if you're there you can say amen hallelujah and when the woman soaked the last of the eyes that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes the last of the earth if you notice you might be seated that the problem with eve is more related to the eyes because the eyes brad branham told us that it's the gate to what it's a gate to the soul i love this church hallelujah amen and that he was pleasant to the eyes notice that everything that made it fair is related to the eye the look the appearance everybody clear praise the name of the lord and a tree to be desired so not only was he pleasant enticing to the eyes but it was something that causes you to last after not only was a pleasant to the eye but it's something that can cause lust are you following me it's something that can turn the black dog on everybody clear if you watch that too long if you focus your eyes on that automatically it would turn the black dog on it started with a sight but once you get past the sight it gets into a lust you begin to desire it you begin to long for it we have a terrible territory this morning a tough one not even terrible it's it's a terrible as far as the black dog they treat to be desire to make one what wise what kind of wisdom is that what kind of wisdom is that somebody called it if you go to the book of james james say there is a wisdom that is earthly and that wisdom is essential if you need that scripture you see me it's essential it's based on lust right but clear she took off the fruit after the last of the ice and after desiring and begin to last after remember the two women in uh ezekiel 23 right they were lasting after something after lasting after something then she ate the fruit so you don't eat the fruit just like that you remember the mechanism of james before you get to the eating there is the last of the eyes that last of the eyes will turn on the black dog once the black dog is turned on then the next thing you are doomed to commit adultery or fornication anybody clear and did eaton gave also to her husband with her and he did what now he moved from one person it became contagious now you became an agent of satan you are now dispatching by influence you are now influencing somebody else you started it on now after you committed everything outside you want to be bold enough to bring it to the church are you there that's why we've seen in the past where we came out you will see a young man backsliding he's going to go stay away from church for so long and the next time you meet him coming to church you're going to see him bringing his girlfriend how many seen that you remember in the old church in other words he got bored enough that he's coming in the church to show the young people that i can do it and nothing can be done if you do it here you're not going to leave this church i'll talk to you okay if you do it stay away if you bold enough to come here i'll make sure the d can keep you there and i'm gonna talk to you okay verse seven and the eyes of both of them were water they were open after this after they ate the fruit and they knew that they were water so they never when they were under the state of innocency which is the state of an infant as we showed you on the drawing there was no worry about the outfit everyone clear the worry of the outfit or the outer appearance it is turned on with the black dog everybody clear in other words it takes the turning on of the black dog which happened a puberty a teenager also turn you to be conscious about how you gonna be start uh start joining yourself everybody clear in other words a young man can take a you can give them any kind of clothes they don't care they can wear whether the paint is short or whatever they can come to church they don't worry about it but if you look once you reach an age of teenager then you begin to worry about your appearance then you begin to worry even the young men they want to look good they want to have a tie they want to make sure their hair is cut a certain way they were not worrying about that before but they start to be worried about it when the black dog is activated so the activation of the black dog you don't do you do that you don't understand why you're doing it but you are doing it because you came to the time of love that time of love comes with you to be conscious that hey i need to make myself look good and you want to see the same struggle what happened in menopause when you turned off i'm going to show you that amen hallelujah have you never seen a woman going to menopause how she's don't worry we'll go through that and we're going gonna give you coat you're gonna see and the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were what naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves what apron so they begin to be concerned about how they should dress everybody the concern of the dressing comes with the turning on or the opening of the gate to the black dog amen instead of relying to god to tell them how to dress dead themselves begin to dress themselves so it's an automatic response for a young man or a young woman that goes to puberty to begin to dress themselves a certain way your dress code started right there when the innocency is broken anybody clear verse 8 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife did what why did they heed themselves when they already cover themselves are you awake they already saw fig leaves they went to walmart and they pick up a clothes and they put it already clear according to their own house because everything that a man does is good in his own eyes solomon say so according to their owners when they put that clothes on that dress when they begin to go out they thought they cover their nakedness it takes the presence of god to tell you that the dress the skirt they paint the shirt that you have is inappropriate can you say amen when you are outside the presence of god you will think what you're wearing is correct it takes the presence of the almighty god to prove to you that no matter what you're wearing you think you're looking good in the eyes of the lord you are still naked you need a clothing that when god look at you god can see you wearing clothes at the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new book and adam and his wife did what they hid themselves from what from the presence of the lord among the trees of the garden everybody clear and the lord called to adam and say where are you and he said i heard your voice in the garden and i was water for the first time i was afraid because i was water i thought they already have clothes but in the presence of the lord they could not justify their outer appearance they could not take their clothing and prove to god that we are still clothed they sense themselves that that clothes was not enough to protect them from the presence of the lord everybody clear i was naked and i did water i hid myself everybody clear job to verse 21st to adam this is man achievement after the opening of the ice after they touch the fruit after the black dog is awakened because satan could do nothing to them as long as their eyes was blind that's just like a child nothing their eyes is blind but once the eyes is open then there will be an automatic response from you to see a young girl to begin to fix yourself the reason why you want to make yourself look beautiful it is a signal that the black dog has been turned on do you follow me the reason why you want to look good on a suit on a good time it is telling you that your black dog was turned on [Laughter] 21st to adam and to his wife did the lord make water not fig leaves coat of water god have to kill a lamb and take the covering of the lamb and made clothes [Music] why is god clothing his children because the black dog is turned on now god also became conscious that i need to preach to you about how you should dress your dress code comes when it's turned on anybody clear that's why you can hear people my daughter is so little i can put pants on and brother branham doesn't do a problem are you there but once the black dog is turned on back it up so before when it gets done because some people they are turned on before even 12. so it's up to mama to watch your kids you there is up to daddy to watch your kids when they begin to see the first menstrual period even though they are not 15 years old you know your pastor is a doctor right so i'm gonna tell you as a doctor are you there i don't want to wait for another minister i'm responsible for your soul i can play a game with god and adam and to adam also and to his wife did the lord make what coats of skin and did what look at the word they didn't say that god did he clothed it's a clothing cloth of water them the dress god was not for adam only he was for both adam and who let's go to isaiah chapter 3 we are still on the preparation to the second banquet we are shooting the black dog territory i'm way down into the deep the mid zone of the ocean where everything is dark that's where we're shooting when we finish then we're going to begin to back up back up back up and pick up esther and then move on ever clear isaiah 3 if you dare you can say amen verse 8 for jerusalem is what roon and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doing are against who the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory verse nine they show off their countenance that's weakness against them in other words when you look at their face their face is already telling their sin everybody and they declare their sin as who as sodom they hide it what in other words people are not ashamed of their sin anymore it used to be they do certain things and they hide it but the people in this last day are so bold until they are expressing their sin plum blank and that attitude is an attitude that was in sodom they can't hide it used to be that when people are homosexual they will do that at night but now they don't care whether it's day or night they're going to show you clearly that i'm a homosexual i'm a transgender anybody they hide it note word to their soul for they have rewarded what evil to themselves job to verse 16. moreover the lord says because the daughter of who so these are the women in the church the women that call themselves christian the daughter of zion are water they are hurting do you know what it means they are proud look at your facebook look at your whatsapp look at your instagram look at the picture you are putting look how you are facing the picture can we see humility in that picture or can you see a proud spirit do we see on your profile a young lady that is humble or do we see a young lady that is really looking at somebody get everybody's cell phone number and watch what they post and you're gonna find out they are already proud and they work with what straightforwardness right here when you talk to them they look at you like this are you there and what wanton eyes do you know what wanton means seductive eyes hello seductive eyes walking and doing that messing in other words twisting as they walk i'm going to show you that messing means twisting i'm going to show you what brother branham said so when they walk they are twisting themselves this is not pagan these are the daughter of zion a spirit upon the church making women behave a certain way messing as they go and making water a tickling with the water and tinkering with the feet in other words when they walk there is a noise what are they wearing chill out you see now right in the bible i hope god will remove a stubborn spirit a resentment spirit so that you're gonna receive what is coming out here to clean your life [Music] i hope god will give you a humble spirit that you're going to look at your shoe and you put it in the garbage and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord was smart with a scab the crown of their head on the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover the secret part do you see what is coming to you you open a door that you're gonna be vulnerable on the outside by doing this you are telling god turn on hell on toward me and brother branham said that's the reason why the boy begin to whistle at you because you told god take off the protection off and let help come that's why they come the boys that begin to caught you will no longer be church boys it's going to be people on the outside attracted by you they're going to be telling you you don't look like the other message believer you look different it is not a compliment it is telling you that hell has been open my friend on youtube i'm preaching to this church are you there hallelujah 18 in that day the lord would take away the bravery of their tinkling ornament about their feet and of their cause and their ron tire like the moon their chance and the water the bracelet and the water the muffler and the water the bonnet this is a woman dressing all over and the ornament of the leg and the headband everybody following me and the tablet and the earring look at the description of the daughter of zion the ring not one ring but many rings a sister the rings and the nose jewel the changeable suits of apparel and the mantle and the wimples and the crispin pins you know what it means sister and the water if you look at that word it means the hand mirror so what you're doing now is not new it was in the bible they had a hand mirror over there there is nothing wrong with having a hand mirror in your purse in your bag but it's showing you the description of these women their emphasis is more on the outside appearance the glasses or the hand mirrors and the fine lining and the hoods and the veil and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be water you think you are doing all of this to beautify to smell good to be attractive and all of that god is going to turn it into something else and instead of a girdle a rot a rent and instead of a well-set hair what's going to happen to your hair because you play too much with your hair everybody clear and instead of a stomach here a garden of sackcloth and a burning instead of water you're going to continue to apply more makeup but it would seems like your skin begin to burn have you seen that before you're trying to change your skin make yourself fair and afterward it begins to burn and those burning don't go it is a scripture it is in your bible let's go to ezekiel 16. it is in your bible we're going back to the foundation of this message ezekiel chapter 16 if you dare you can say amen lord help me if you dare you can say amen verse 3 and say that saith the lord to jerusalem your birth and your nativity is of the land of canaan your father was an amorite and your mother earth heighted all i'm going to show there is the birth is from gentile like abraham remember wednesday abraham was a babylonian his birth in babylon job to verse 8 and when i passed by you and i look upon you behold your time was the time of love now you know what it means and i spread my skirt over you now you know what it means your first relationship is with christ and cover your nakedness why is god worrying about the nakedness now do you see now he's worrying about the nakedness because the time is the time of love the black dog is turned on then god comes he say now young sister you need to be aware how you dress yourself do you follow me when you were eight years old you could walk and you won't do any man anything you follow me you can get a little girl like the one sitting there and with her dress she can pass one time two times three times and men are sitting they don't see anything if you ask them they say yeah there is a small girl passing here back and forth back and forth back and forth but take a teenager and make her pass three times before boys before you know it you will see some of them do you know why because there is something on you because you teenager your outfit already changed there is something about you that can provoke someone that's why god comes and begins to give instruction how to dress you young sister you understand hallelujah i now cover your nakedness yeah i saw to you just like in eden the eyes open god comes too close here the eyes open god is coming again too close everybody clear i saw to you and enter into a covenant with you say the lord god and you became who mine then washed are you with water the word and i totally wash away your blood you know the blood is the life that came from your father everybody clear and i did what verse 10 uh verse 10 i did what our clothes remember in genesis 3 when the lord came he did what he clothes you see and in ezekiel when god comes again when the black dog is turned on god comes again to do what to cloth i clove you also with embroidered work and i showed you feet with badger skin the feet of the gospel but that gospel must be badger skin it must be a gospel that is vaid in human flesh the word made flesh and i guarded you about with lyman fine lyman which is the righteousness of the same and i cover you with what silk now this came on down there and i have to give it to you let's go to revelation 17 then we're gonna pray i didn't mean to read it but it came down back then so i got to do it if you dare you can say amen and there came one of the seven angels which have seven vows and talked with me saying to me come here i will show you the judgment of the great hall that sits upon many waters we spoke about this on wednesday everybody clear verse 2 with whom the king of the earth have committed water so there is a spirit of fornication upon the catholic church you follow me that great hall is the catholic church if you have a problem you need to read your message am i clear i commit they have committed fornication and the the inhabitant of the earth has been made drunk with the wine of her water a wine of her what fornication drop down to verse five and upon her forehead was the name written mystery water that's where abraham came out now that babylon was already destroyed as a city but the spirit that was on babylon continued to move in and that spirit moved into a church and sat down on the catholic church are you following me but that spirit did not stop only on catholic church once you commit fornication you're gonna be an agent of satan then you gotta spread it out everybody and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon the great the mother of water so there is a prostitution spirit that is upon every church that is outside the bride of jesus christ that's why they can preach as they preach but still the women don't change because the anointing over there came from satan down to the catholic and the catholic dispatcher to all the protestants which are the daughter of the harlot but abraham must come out of that [Music] are you following me you must come out from the land of the gardens and you go to the country that i shall show you you must separate yourself from babylon and not only do you separate yourself from babylon you gotta separate yourself from lord denomination and you gotta separate yourself from your family [Music] everybody clear the mother of harlot and what abomination all of them concluded of the world what anointing is in that church and do you expect when they preach the people change you can preach you go that anointing keep coming you need to be under a different headship everybody clear turn on to ezekiel 23 and let's pray if you get there you can say amen you need to buckle up pretty good because we're going to dig it amen we got to clear this black dog so when we come out from there we begin to move into rupturing faith amen the lord is taking this time to clean up everything because they can be dropping heavy equipment when you are not clean down there anybody yeah those heavy equipment requires something if you dare you can say amen all right we on part 23 let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for giving us lord father an opportunity to meet together again around the revealed world of the hour father we are committing this service again unto the hand may you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children may the devil and his army be completely sealed out may only the holy spirit and the angels lord of glory comes down lord father and minister to your children as we commit it all in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we on part three preparing for the second banquet everybody clear on wednesday if you can go with me to ezekiel 23 verse 11. we already got 23 uh verse one all the way to eight where we dealt with the first sister her name is who a hola okay i hope somebody's not sleeping anybody clear now we're gonna get her second sister verse 11. and when her sister a holly bar saw this everybody clear so there was a power of influence ahola lived her life and when she lived their life they both had the weakness that happened in egypt and when they lived their life she began to live an unclean life by having a wrong friendship which went to you on wednesday and we told you that environment brother problem explained to us is everything ever clear and brother pronoun explained to us that when you come unto the lord you must separate yourself from your worldly friends you cannot be a believer and your friend is the one smoking pots you cannot be held you you cannot have a friend that is a joker why you are a believer because according to the scripture automatically the longer you linger with him you're gonna find yourself going back again to the same uh thing that you came out everybody clear then paul came in and explained to us that not only for the people on the outside but even in the church that if you see a man that is called a brother if you see somebody that is called a sister that lives under fornication you must separate yourself from that person ever clear because if you don't do that you're going to be contaminated because as long as they are sinner in the church they became an agent for satan ever clear so far we say in jehoshaphat making a mistake on wednesday he went and tried to help ahab and he almost lost his life ever clear and that's the reason why when somebody's living a wrong life you need to stay away from them because you can find yourself in a car accident because you were pulling with your friend going somewhere on downtown or going somewhere to have good time and because of their life you can risk your own life am i clear but praise be to god amazing grace jumping and the lord rescued jehoshaphat did he listen no he went again and start doing business again and the lord destroyed the business then the third time he understood that we cannot do this ever here abraham came out of the land of the counties when abraham came out of darling he made another mistake again he picked up a lot with him and god have to cause circumstances to happen to separate abraham from who from lord ever clear then we found out that even in the family of david there was david's nephew that gave the plan to destroy her own cousin that's why even in the family you must make sure where your children are going if they are not leaving the world you better protect your children than try to protect that family everybody clear when paul i believe john spoke to us again that if somebody comes to you and do not believe doesn't bring you the teaching that we're teaching you need to tell that person i'm not going to receive you because brother branham said you must you must you must associate with people that believe like who like you does your friend believe the message of the hour ever here the bible says if somebody is living uncleanly you cannot even eat with that person we show it to you on wednesday you cannot go in the restaurant with that person young people you say no we're not talking about religion we are just friend we can talk you're gonna find yourself you open the door that's gonna cause you trouble if your friend is speeding on brother branham people have friends on facebook that are posting things against the message why do you keep them as your friend are you awake are you awake your friend that you have friend on facebook everything he's posting is against the message of the hour why do you keep him on the friend list block him block him on what's happened block him because that a door that satan will continue to pump things and before you know it you're gonna begin to reason and cause you trouble with your faith if somebody doesn't believe this message if somebody is against this message if somebody can talk badly about brother pranam if somebody can spit on this message block that relationship cut that relationship off don't fellowship with them if you don't listen that is your problem i don't have your blood with you you're going to be responsible for your own blood because you value your relationship more than the word you better come from us to keep your friend even though your friend is against what you believe paul said if somebody comes to your house when he brings you a different teaching than this don't receive him and paul and john even say don't even say bye-bye i gave you the scripture on wednesday when you said bye-bye you are also participating on him separate yourself everybody clear let's go to verse 11 and when her sister a hollyba saw this by influence she was more corrupt in her inordinate love sometimes you see a younger that are more troubled than the elder have you seen that the elders are a little bit moderately but the other one that is coming down the more world [Music] amen amen the elder knows how to behave in front of boys but the younger one is so bold she's more aggressive to men that's right in her inordinate love then she no in other words she did more than her sister ever clear and in her world more than her sister in her wardum verse 12 what happened again to her she did what she died she lasted same thing again just like eve remember eve was the last of the eyes then that last produced the desire are you following me then the desire brought the action then the action turned you into certain agent everybody clear she dotted upon the assyrian the same one that god killed took abraham off of him her neighbor captain and rulers clothed with clothes most gorgeously they look good they have beautiful suits horsemen riding upon horses they all have bmws all kind of called hammer all of them deserve what young men not old men young men young people young men then i saw that she was what defiled there was a weakness that she had from egypt from her youth that they took both one way verse 14 and that she increased her whoredom her prostitution how did she increase that prostitution what gave her more fuel what gave her more power to be more deadly are you there because the problem brother brother say you're gonna have two dogs the black dog and the white dog and brother obama said the one you feed the most is the one that's gonna be winning the battle so what do you feed which dog do you feed you cannot be a religious girl and suddenly you turn wild it doesn't happen in one day there was something you were feeling over time what was this woman feeding into it that made her bold [Music] are you there verse 14 she increased her warden her prostitution for when she saw what she saw men portray upon the water she opened the door to be watching the images of the babylonian are you there are you there in israel this image were not today you have to enter the babylonian world and when you enter into the babylonian world when you get there you're gonna see billboard you're gonna see things on the internet you wanna see where the pages that's gonna come out and those web pages have images word made flesh and that she increased verse 14 her prostitution for when she saw the last of the eyes watch carefully remember here she saw something the last of the eyes when she saw men portray upon the world the images of the jews are you reading with me the images of who the images of the counties the babylonian the images of the garden portray with vermilion girded with girdles upon their lungs exceeding entire attire upon their heads all of them places to look to in other words beautiful handsome men she opened the door to begin to watch movie she opened the door to begin to watch top model she opened the door to begin to watch all kind of series she opened the door to begin to read all kind of magazine with pictures and those magazines have boys that are different than the boys of israel and those boys are handsome because they airbrushed them are you there ever clear after the manner of the babylonian of the charity the land of the world she was born over there everybody they took you out of babylon and you going back into the you open the door yourself to the world and those images that that lady was watching all the time admiring those images she forgot she got a weakness are you there then she moved from part one and then she dropped desiring those men look at what those images does jump to verse 16 and as soon as she did what she saw them with a what the bible is insisting with the eyes which is the gate of the soul eve so that the fruit was present but he forgot that that fruit we have also a power to cause you to touch after he has a power to erase your sexual part amen let's go to verse 16. and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she did what right here look good last everybody here she darted she lasted upon them and did what do you see now now it's you who begin to chat on the internet are you there i like your picture on facebook i like it you a young sister a boy posted something how can you like what he posted he's not your brother what do you like what do you like what do you like you a married man a woman posted something and you came out there you said look good look good for what are you there go tell your wife to look good are you there a sister posted something a young man put a thumbs up what are you what is making you what is giving you pleasure what is giving you pleasure she began to send messages he was not those people calling her she was the one sending the messages she was the one saying i love you he looks good how are you doing she forgot her weakness she sent messenger messenger to them into kardi and the babylonian not the jews came to her into the bed of water in other words they understood the signal that what you are sending us you actually desiring us no brother i was just telling him he looks good you think you are telling him he looks good his interpretation is she likes me you don't understand that oh you look good today on the suit you are telling him when he goes he begins to think she told me i look good she told me i look good she tell me i look good you thought you were doing that innocent amen and the babylonian came to her into the bed of love and they did what she fell on the same thing she did in egypt they defile her with their water now it's a different kind of prostitution they took you from level one now you are in level three with the whoredom and she was what now she become polluted that's why you run away from church she was polluted with them and her mind was what i ended from death in other words after she did everything that she could that she thought was good she turned around and she began to disgust them do you remember what happened to emon on wednesday after committing what he committed with his own cousin what happened half sister he hated him are you there after committing this you're to be miserable now your life is wrong that was it that was it they already play around with you they took picture of you they did everything they can do with you and they kept those pictures on the cell phone the day you open up your mouth they send it to your husband you want to pray with them they can post it you're not going to do nothing amen are you following me verse 18. so she discovered her hurdle and discovered her what this is not the first time she left egypt she already did it when she left egypt she became covered but when she got into the promised land she re-uncovered that again the old mark uncovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sister watch verse 19. you ready yet she did what she multiplied her hardem in calling to water she begin to go back to her old memories are you following me of the things she did in word in her mind you following me she begin to replay the movie of her sexual relationship where do you get this pastor let's read with me yet she multiplied her whoredom in calling to remembrance ever clear the days of her what remember in the days of the uh in the day of her youth she committed fornication she's bringing those memories back she's putting those movies back again anybody following me when she had played the harlot in the land of what watch verse 20 very good then we're gonna take off are you following me for she did what she doubted she lasted upon their what their paramour their lover paramo means a lover what we call boyfriend girlfriend upon her boyfriend her paramour whose flesh is as the flesh of isis and whose issue is like the issue of horses what is going on here go keep your finger right here go to ezekiel 16 verse 26. i'm going to maneuver here just stay tight we need a maneuvering here to move on to this you ready ezekiel 16 verse 26 watch that you need to read with me you have also committed water with the word a horror committed fornication way in egypt a only by committed fornication where in egypt there is a characteristic about the egyptian what is that characteristic you have also committed fornication with the egyptian your neighbor great of water flesh and have increased your wholedom to provoke me to utter you committed fornication with people that are more inclined sexually than you go back to ezekiel 23. now let's read it again the egyptian verse 20 for she lasted upon her lover whose flesh is as the flesh of water and whose issue is like the issues of what in other words when she committed adultery fornication she did it with people that are master phd everything they do is just about sex and iron she got into the land of egypt into the land of canaan she begin to play the movie of the world back to her mother she opened her door to pornography of her mind let's move on now does the son of god mean angels or spirit from heaven the sons of god of genesis 6. that was the person question all right i believe that there was not angels see they were beings sons of god like the scripture says not angel they were sons of god and they came from heaven to the earth and was put into water flesh in other words the people that watch women and then they begin to last after them brother branham said he was not injured they were human beings but what happened in those women beings that made them last after women not press themselves into flesh because josephus was saying that they were pressing themselves into flesh why branham said no because that way you commit you make satan a creator everybody clear i believe hope flesh is born sexual outside of jesus christ i believe he is the only virgin born being there ever was jesus christ i don't agree with josephus on that and that great historian about they've been pressed in the flesh but i do believe that they were supernatural what beings that come down and to cover the spirit of water so when those men begin to last after those women it was actually an anointing that came and dropped on them you following me praise god and i believe they are right here yet today you follow me still walking around in what in other words men die but the spirit of sexual lust doesn't die it's going to hurt somebody else you follow me ungodly damn same beastly what i'm saying busily you saw the description in ezekiel lustfully ungodly what spirit to live right in human being now someday these men will die and if there is another generation they shall come right down on what on them brother brother continue there is where i think the same question can after the nature of the brute everybody following me like an animal that lived with this woman that brought forth this child which was half brute and men like a great beagle fellow but the problem is saying here that the serpent in the garden of eden was the master of sex he was the phd of sex he is the one that thought if sex and a holla and a holy br met people just like the serpent i'm going there and then he went out there and his children begin to come from him and then beast sexual lust like the who in the beginning that all last beast found this water so the same anointing that was in the serpent in the garden of eden that anointing was moving around the land and found young men watching women and that anointing landed there and then got into those young men and before you know it they were acting like beasts won't make people act like beasts on pornography what is the spirit that anoints pornography for somebody to behave like that knowing that they're gonna be recorded it is an anointing of the serpent [Music] i'm gonna go slowly these daughter things and took on them and the daughters of men look away to jesus how many a rich man will listen at this table of that temple don't have to be always rich in water in money no you can be rich in water rich in what pleasure of this life hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham i go to a man's office and he says he's a christian peanut all around the world remember a holy bar on the wall are you there that all boogie woogie music going on i don't care what he says i don't believe his testimony because his spirit is doing what the black dog is feeding on that his spirit is feeding on damn things off the water the black dog is growing if he would marry a chorus girl or what if he would marry a what so that beastly anointing doesn't work only on men he also work on women you want to find women that are phd in sex marry a sex queen oh just to pray the modern hicken he reflects it shows what he has in mind of what his future home is going to be because he's going to look he took her to raise her children in other words when you bring a woman that you want to get married to your wife is telling people what is in your heart you cannot be a brother in the church and you wanted to get married to a woman in the world and when people meet that woman she's dressed sexy all her breasts outside that is the spirit that is on you and you gotta be delivered from that demon [Applause] are you there whatever she is that's that is the way she shall raise those children in other words you get married to her she's gonna take that program and put it in the children why because once you get to eating she became an agent of satan she's not going to work for the kingdom of god she's going to work for the kingdom of the devil everybody here he reflect what is in the man a man that takes a woman like that show just what he's thinking of his future could you imagine a christian doing a thing like that no sir i couldn't a true christian will not look for such beauty queen and chorus girl and what sex queen he shall look for christian character everybody following me praise the name of the lord john 31 verse 1 to 3 job say i made a covenant with my water job made a covenant with his eyes why job why do you have to sit and make a covenant with your eyes what was the covenant job he said i made a confident with manager why should i what about what job says that he made a covenant with his eyes do you follow me but that covenant is not really with the natural eyes it is about they think that job is thinking in his mind because a holy boy pulls the video in his mind you follow me what are you thinking what are you meditating on as a man thinking in his heart so is the man job said i made a confident with my eyes but the problem is not the eyes the problem is my thinking i am checking my thinking why do you check your thinking i'm checking my thinking that the subject of my thinking is not about women [Music] for what portion of god is there from above in other words if somebody have a tendency to always think about women what is his reward from god what portion of god is there from above or what inheritance of the almighty from on high is he not what distraction to the wicked in other words if your mom is constantly thinking about women god have a portion for you in heaven but that portion is not eternal life it is to destroy you and a strange punishment to the workers of what because you know better and you're still doing it praise the name of the lord psalm 101 i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way this is david oh when will that come unto me i will walk where not outside my house because outside your house you can make yourself look christian but david said when i am in my house when there is nobody with me when i am alone in my bedroom even in my bedroom mama is not there that is not there inside my bedroom i'm going to behave myself wisely are you there because when you are in the closed door that's when you begin to do things that you cannot do outside you follow me he said i will walk within my house with a what perfect heart david would you please explain us when you get in your house when you lock the door when you get in your bedroom when you lock the door what do you mean by walking with perfect eyes what do you mean by walking with a perfect heart what do you mean do you mean that you are walking saying perfect perfect perfect what are you doing david can you give us more explanation on what you're doing brother david help us i was sent no water before my what other words when my door is closed when my bedroom is closed when mama is nothing when dad is not there when brother is not there when deacon is not there when pastor is not there i would not put pornography i will not watch something wrong on the telephone when i am closed door are you there why david this is psalm 100 and what one if you go to psalm 51 you're gonna see david committed adultery with bathsheba are you there and he repented then in psalm 101 50 some down are you there david now learn he said lord i don't want to put anything wicked in my eyes why is david worrying about his eyes why is david worrying about his house from 51 plus 50 give you a 100 on one those are the mathematic of the bible why is david worrying about his eyes let's go to first second samuel chapter 11 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm going very slow compared to the speed i thought oh my god second samuel chapter 11. if you dare you can say amen few people before you come to church you need to make sure you pray so we don't pump you up everybody clear second samuel chapter 11 if you dare you can say amen verse one and it came to pass after the years was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent job and his servant with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon a lot and besieged you ever but david terry is still at water hey jerusalem watch now and we come to pass in the evening that david arose from his bed david went and sat on the table and they gave him his meal as a king he ate the meal and suddenly he got sleepy he said i need to go rest a little bit the day was a little bit hard today and david went and went to bed to rest a little bit at the evening the innocent david is waking up and he woke up he took a shower he washed himself and he said you know what it's beautiful the weather is nice outside let me go on my porch on top of my house and just uh walk around a little bit just to get some fresh air what did david do that was wrong nothing okay watch the weapon and he came to pass in the evening in the evening time that david rose from his bed and woke up on the roof of the king's what house was defeated in somebody else's house david was in his own house so he doesn't have any problem with anybody come on and from the roof he did what the eye the devil put something looking right there at the roof why how did the devil put it only facing the roof i'm going slowly i hope you catching one day you're going to remember this are you there and from the roof he saw a what a woman washing herself look what the devil put there i am not in somebody else's house i am in my own house in my own property the devil said no problem i cannot trespass on your property but

saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very what why didn't the devil put an ugly one day there was a woman that was very beautiful to us so they therefore knew which caliber he worked with so when you looked up something happened are you there hallelujah remember our holy br the man that made her fall was handsome man that's a that that that's the test to a sister but now a test to a brother it is a beautiful woman are you following me he says and david sent an inquirer after the woman in other words david didn't know even the woman let's see and once say is he not this who bat shiva the daughter of water helium the wife of who in other words uriah and david were nebul read between the line the house of david and the house of uriah they were close together and bathsheba was

my child you the one you came for more you remember when i called you from all brother branham look at david how could he have done one jump into a pit and kill a lion how could david take uriah's wife the beautiful bathsheba when he heard what what was in your wife that was different than 500. the power of the black dog are you there but see her taking a what that's why you hear david say even if i am now in my house i cannot put anything wrong before my because i learned that even in my house in my property when i was under my own roof by seeing something wrong i put myself in trouble now lord even when i am inside my property i'm gonna watch that black dog fifty one two zero one fifty but seeing her taken above and there is the water negligence now watch how the devil play she just forgot to put the shed when she was taking her and knowed that the king made the trip there by day how many times down over there bashiva knew that king david usually when i'm from because we never with the king the king usually i see him every evening he goes outside and just watches the kingdom and the devil say what that's the only window i can get to david and he just put a negligence on bathsheba to leave to open their pornography and when david said from his own house not from somebody else's house i'm gonna pull david down amen verse our paragraph 117 but shiva don't work look where brother branham is attacking a man that looked upon a woman and lasted after her has committed fornication with who caused the problem sister you come to church don't be a problem that you're gonna answer one day but sheba done wrong just like if done what and adam was included in it i think we are always hollering about women too you sons of god men i know you are the strongest bunch that's right the strongest sex you are over the women that is true so act like it in other words brother even if your sister is already weak and she's already giving herself to you why don't you take a stand like joseph and say sister no let's stop and don't do this why do you have to give in [Applause] why do you have to give in [Applause] oh she started then i did it where can you bring a testimony that i was right at the point and the lord rescued me [Music] are you there don't overpower them try to take some little girl and ruin her life david took somebody's wife and destroyed the marriage and killed even the husband but be a son of god tell her she is in the water in the wrong and stand like a son of god she is yo in other words two they said sister i understand but this is too far we are not in this stage yet no let's get out of here you know what you need to drive in your own car let's get out of here i'm sorry and she's gonna know that if i marry this man if i marry this man even though he's traveling i know he can resist a woman are you there your wife will be sleeping in peace knowing that i remember when i tried to give him he resisted me this is a different caliber oh when you go to work your wife is still scratching your head when you come in let me see your cell phone who call you this is how we are brother brother say if a marriage is when somebody is traveling you say if i hear that you meet another woman it's a lack of trust show her which caliber young sister showed that boy that i cannot play this game and when somebody comes and say you know your wife did so and so you say no my brother no you got the wrong woman you got the wrong number i was in the same thing and she resisted me i'm not gonna trust your story and you protected yourself and you're gonna be respected in your marriage your husband will give you respect all the day of your marriage because that's going to be a scar to his life are you following me are you following me god had revealed it to that prophet he said david there was a rich man live on this side of the road and had a whole lot of sheep he was a rich man you can read it dancing very rich and one day what a visitor came and instead of the rich man taking one of his own ship and making a what a feast to the visitor these are language in the bible and we're going to decode them well instead of that he went over and took the poor man's slave and by what force took the lamb and slayed it go to verse to chapter 12. so you understand what he means here are you there and the lord said to nathan said nathan to david and he came to him and said to him there was two men in one city one rich who was the rich man thank you and the other poor who is the poor man uriah the rich man was exceeding many flocks and what in other words he have many wives 500 but the poor man had nothing saved what one leader what you land a female in other words your brother only have one wife you had so many which he had brought the nourisher up look at the relationship of uriah with his wife do you see brother look how uriah was taking his own wife somebody is picking it up look at the marriage of uriah a gentile who was converted in israel look how he's treating his wife a new lamb which he had bought and nourished up and grew up together with him the wife of his youth they grew up together are you there and with his children and did eat on his own meat and drunk on his own cup so when you write a drink he drop it down bathsheba can come and go ahead they can use the same straw what they love in the home this is the law of david brook are you there rude it's cruel are you there and drunk off his own cup and laid in his own water your wife laying in your bosom hallelujah and was to him as a water their love was so much until the love that they have for your own daughter you rather have that for his own wife do you want to hurt your daughter are you there and there came a whoo a traveler who is the traveler watch the travelers soon the traveler to the rich man and his pair to take his own flock of his own herd to dress it for the wayfaring man that was come to him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him if you look there are two people one is rich it's david the second one is poor his name is you are. between david and mariah there is a man that they call it traveling or a wayfaring by traveler the bible means that this man is not a permanent resident you following me young people this is somebody who's passing by sleep in the hotel and go but he doesn't live in north carolina are you there he's someone that is coming for a certain period of time then he's going his way are you there when he comes he needs to be entertained you need to make a feast for him are you there but you must make a feast the right way amen let's go to brother branham took the lamb and slayed the maid what to this visitor brother branham who is this visitor now that was david what you following me the traveler is your sexual desire it is a desire that is not permanent it's a desire that comes and go it comes and go it comes and go but when it comes you must know how to quench it how to satisfy it if you want to satisfy according to first corinthians 7 let his own man has his own wife and let his own wife have her own husband that's the way you give him the feast if you satisfy him by fornication sin by adultery sin that's why brother branham said david should have gone to his own hallelujah now that was david persians he had what 500 wife but when he sinned uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wife to do what to quench the black dog or to satisfy his passion he went and took the other man's water do you follow me what causes it by the look of a woman without clothes are you following me we can always judge the other fellow but when it comes to us that is different because when they told david he got angry are you following me david in psalm 119 turn away man eyes from beholding water that's why david learned he got burned pretty bad are you there did he learn that i'm not gonna play with his eyes are you there even when i am in my house i'm not gonna open my eye to see anything because that can cause me trouble like he caused a holy by trouble to look at things on the wall quicken down me in that way isaiah 33 verse 15 blessed be the name of the lord he that walketh what righteously and speaketh water walking speaking he that despised the gain of the oppression that shaketh his hand from holding the brabs that stopped his here from here for hearing of blood and that do what shatters his eye from seeing what if this is what you do if you shut your eyes from seeing evil he shall dwell on what his place of defense shall be the munition of the the rock of salvation bread shall be given to who his water shall be watered the night shall behold the king in his water guarantee without sanctification you cannot see god are you there with that sanctification cleaning your eyes from seeing what is wrong automatically you're going to see the kingdom are you there are you there let's go to ezekiel 23. let

listen to me carefully hallelujah you took they came for you did wash yourself i want you to read the second one and you did what painted what number one the eyes are you there stop what was the reason why this woman painted their eyes what was the reason because the messenger was coming amen in other words when she knew she's gonna meet a lover a man she painted her eyes the painting of eyes the bible is describing it that it is when a spirit of fornication when a spirit of adultery when an unclean spirit of protestation get into somebody when they want to please or attract a man they will paint their eyes why do you paint your eyes why do you penguins i didn't know that but the spirit that made you do that is an unclean sister it's an unclean spirit she painted her eyes because men are coming you say there is no scripture about painting eyes from today i'm gonna give you all of them i heal all of them one by one i'm gonna give you all the scripture are you there are you there one by one what is the purpose that you have to put something blue here do you see what spirit is on women and they don't know they don't know that when they put something like this it's gonna do something to a man and i'm gonna prove to you in the bible what the eyes painted do to a man it's in the bible brother kelly he has been zoomed out sister from today stop painting your eyes you are putting yourself under a different category that you don't understand it is not brother stephen saying in this church the bible says brother branham says are you there go search in the message if brother branham give the scripture and you will hear him say i preach i'm skipping scripture i'm skipping scripture he said may the holy spirit get it that's why you need to come under the anointing of the messenger so that anointing that show brother branham can go back with you and say right here when my messenger say it's right here when brother branham say it's right here where is he that in the bible where is that in the bible get the anointing that was working with brother branham that anointing will go with you in the bible and say my messenger when he speak luke oh my god hallelujah

this is for this this is for this what do you do sister sister sister sister tell your child to get those bracelet off young brother cut the bracelet off sister tell your husband take off the bracelet put it in the garbage it is not meek for a brother to wear that those are the sabines the servants of the wilderness which put bracelet upon their hands and beautiful crown upon their what head those are the sabbats do you know who killed job staff somebody need to know the bible do you know who destroyed job staff go check job chapter one and go see who destroyed who came and steal the stuff of job and destroy who did that the servants and who said he's gonna destroy job he was the devil so when the devil wanna act in the life of job he took the sabbats to destroy job the anointing upon the servants is an unclean anointing when our holy barwana commits fornication she's bringing disservice because they are people of a clean living and you putting bracelet you are showing yourself to god that you're a young man that is anointing with those kind of anointing you're a young brother you're a young married man that has a problem with women are you there the eyes can you give me a few minutes i strike the eyes and we go let me see your hands before somebody get mad on me okay thank you all right hallelujah this is the scripture that most people use to protect themselves when they do something bad especially when it comes to the outer appearance in first samuel chapter 16 verse 6 the bible says and it came to pass when they were come that he did what this is samuel god said go to the house of jesse i'm going to pick up a king when samuel came samuel used his eyes when he look and see who eliab keep in mind india and say surely the lord's anointed this before him samuel when he looked he's so illiam he said wow that's the kingdom god said chill out but the lord said unto samuel look not in his what i want you to think carefully the first thing god is telling samuel are you there god never said to samuel look not at his clothes [Music] continence means what face god is there samuel is watching when samuel look he said this is the lord's anointing and god say this is your error you are looking at faith karma and what else look not on his countenance all upon under height of his what how tall he is everybody clear this is where people like because i have refused him this is where people like people that wear a lot of stuff and they don't want anybody to tell them this is what they use that's the weapon for the lord sees not as men what for men look from the water but the lord looking from the water oh my brother stop looking at me you can see me like this god sees my heart it's the scripture that people love in the bible when they don't want to take paint they don't want to take wrong clothes they don't want to take all kind of stuff when you say the lord sees my heart the lord look at the heart you can see me like this the lord look at the heart the lord look at the heart let's correct you today you ready what god was talking about was the face and the what god was not talking about the cloth keep thinking god was not talking about the makeups keep thinking god was not talking about the high heels god was not talking about the tight dress god was not talking about the painting god was talking about the choice i sent you for choice when i sent you for choice don't look at the face and don't look at the shape you follow me from today you are disarmed are you there you follow me because people are quick no no no no no no the lord says why are you doing this the lord sees this young man taking her doing all kind of stuff oh no no the lord sees my heart the lord sees my heart in other words the lord is blind to everything you can do but he only look at your eyes on your heart world god see psalm 22 25 it's a matter of choice what man is he that fears the lord him shall i do what in the way he shall water in other words if you want a choice in your life you need to go to god that's why this was for a choice of the king god said don't look don't make choice like men men look at face at beauty and they look at the ship and they pick people don't do that i am the one who's gonna direct you [Music] brother steven so if god directs the samuel to pick up somebody so that person probably is not going to be beautiful he's going to be ugly that's why because men look at beauty so god will not pick somebody like that let's see what god picks and samuel said to jesse i hear all the children and he said they remain at vietnam and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel say unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down here come uh till he comes here done and he said and brought him now he was what right when you look at him what is steven you see i told you that's the choice of god always the people that are now attracting me let's see now he was ready and we thought of a what who picked up of a beautiful continent and what goodly to look on him too and the lord said arise and what anointing for okay we're clear there okay samuel and andy ab 17. remember elia his eldest brother heard when he spoken to the man and ended up anger was kingly they guess who the one that the prophet taught to pick look how he's treating the one that god chose the one that was supposed to be picked by human intellect look how he's going to treat the one that is chosen by divine revelation and he said why come here and with with whom has that left those few sheep in the wilderness anoda was david pride and the water naughtiness of that heart god say that's a man after my own heart eliab is calling him he is naughty let's see what goliath say about david and one day philistine look about and saw david he did what why he didn't love him for the cause that he hated him for he was but what a youth it's a problem young people they therefore don't like you and he was water ready and of water he didn't like that kind of beauty john 7 jesus talking to the pharisees he said judge not according to the what see brother stephen i told you see don't judge the appearance jesus also say that that's fine judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment john 8 15 ye judge after the what after the flesh human i judge no man brother stephen do you look on things after the outward what that's human john 8 if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that what in other words when i judge it's the father that will help samuel who's judging for the father judges no man but has committed what all judgment time to who and he has given him authority to execute what judgment because he is the son of man brother stephen god don't look at people on the outside fine but he that is what spiritual judges what and he himself is judged of what abstain from all appearance of what how can god say don't judge with appearance and god say abstain from the appearance of evil put it together god said don't judge but god come he said when you see the appearance of evil get away from it in other words you're judging that because a spiritual man judges make sense now drop this and then we go i always i have been accused of being hard on sister about wearing bobbed hair and manicure all over their face and stuff i have been accused of being hard on our sister it is not that i got anything against them i don't say the woman is not a good woman that she's some street walker or something that is not my attitude but it is this when she put on when she put so much water on the water shows there is a lot water on the water when you ought to be filled up with crust because the water outside always express what is what there you shall do what you see and where cross ought to be in there to take care of for the god and to take care of the things instead of so much artificial pump you know green water remember holy bar remember loliba green i need an unhuman water and all kind of stuff i just don't go for it i don't believe the bible does either did he give you a scripture do you see now where he's coming from and so i like that i like to be just what we are this is the major sin of our days it is the major sin among our people what is it worldiness as the bible said laodicea edgeworth she is what when you when you hear the word of god call out against him then you take the other out you are unpopular with the world you are tempted to do what because the people don't appreciate you like they used to everybody clear oh my god let me go here and then i'm gonna let you go to proverbs 6 and we finish here we are talking about the eyelid i will come back on that one everybody clear let's take proverb 1 and then we finish proverbs 6.
