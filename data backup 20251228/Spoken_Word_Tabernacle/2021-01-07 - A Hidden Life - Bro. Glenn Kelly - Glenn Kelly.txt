god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy lord god we thank you lord jesus for another opportunity lord god just to come before your precious children lord god and lord god will you recognize lord god that in your presence is salvation then your presence is healing in your presence it's deliverance so we thank you lord god for leaking the prayer requests already lord jesus lord god because we look unto the hill to where our strength and our help coming from and we know he comes from the lord lord god we bind up every demon for us we bring every spirit under subjection to your holy spirit on tonight lord god we look unto the hill get glory to thy name they glory to thy kingdom and by faith lord god we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen amen we thank the lord and we thank brother steve pastor than all the saints and the musicians that'll be all it's uh it's an honor we know that those that are struggling but it's all for the glory of god is that right because god made us overcomers in this age is that right so you just pray with us i was out there in the grave through my notes and i grabbed the wrong note so i don't know what he's gonna preach tonight either is that right i'm just gonna get out the way and let him have his way because what i wanted to bring god already knew he wanted me to leave at home so i guess this is what he wanted to have tonight right hallelujah let's go to romans chapter eight i'll tell you i was going to work with the predestinated ones you know but here's the lord will see what he has hallelujah romans 8 verse 29 you have to say amen he said for whom he did for anew he also did predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover who he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and to whom he justified them he also glorified he says and and what shall we we then say to these things it's god before us who can be against us may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word and you may uh let's go over to um joshua hallelujah and joshua 1 and we verse 6 be strong and of good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them you may be seated amen we're looking here let's look at we're going to look at joshua by the grace of god you know we gotta listen to a thought and we got the inspiration of you know a hidden place a hidden life i want to look in there you know in that message when brother branham he was working with that a hidden light it was short but it was loaded and the thing that just kept striking my spirit was us being being tutored you know when he talked about the one there been intruded but he also was talking about that hidden life you know being justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost but we know we want to move behind the veil is that right you know that's the age and that's the time that we're in now so we will you know spend that time so we have so much trouble and all of our trouble is not just because of the devil i'll just say that god is allowing it but god is allowing these things so that we can become stronger and be prepared for what's coming ahead is that right because the last time was here we was working with the baptism or the other holy ghost is that right it was telling that we know that the holy ghost is god's own life it's zoe it's the spirit of god that is dwelling inside of his children is that right but we know that the holy spirit is moving and that's why we were showing them the last thing that we that we read to you i was going to read to you some more because we were talking about the justification the sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost but then we wanted to move into the adoption is that right and to make a way for the person himself and that's what we're moving into because when god is coming we may not appear to be nothing but when god come we're going to be just like him is that right so we have to understand now during this time being being moving we're moving into a position and i tell you when brother branham worked that lesson you need to go back and really really study it i've been studying it because i tell you it's major to where the holy spirit has the pastor right now and you know when we're moving into the because a person has to understand before you can move into that position under the adoption is that right it has to be a character there it has to be the person himself to be able to say he mean we want to use you and he's going to tell you to go pray for joe blow so that the limbs can come back and so this can go back but you have to be now disciplined it's got to be the true genuine holy ghost down inside of you god is getting us ready for this here now so we have to understand the last time that we was here remember the holy ghost is also a seal but it's a but it cannot seal you if something is loose is that right so we have to understand that's why we want to look at this joshua ministry we just come to encourage you along the way but we know in the old testament they had a tutor is that right and the tutor was intruded for us was a school master we know it was the law and that was the school master until that that the fullness had come was coming is that right so now we know we're no longer on the law but we're under grace is that right so we're in them by the grace of god and that's what the holy spirit was sharing with us there on sunday he says it's the lust of our eye it's the lust of the flesh and it's the pride of life so we have to understand i tell you i'm gonna share my testimony too i'm excited i'm standing up here because if you would have known the condition that i was in i tell you about a week and a half ago i tell you the devil came in but the lord said when the enemy killed me like the flood i would lift up a mighty standard against it so you have to learn to fight that in the war you're in a war and you got to learn to fight this war you know you know where he was growing up we used to like prize fighting you know you got to understand your enemy you got to understand you got 200 million demons loose in this hour here now so we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness and rules in high places so you have to understand you know paul's paul was saying he said the things i desired to do i did not the things i desired not to do i did but i found it was a war among me a world war in my memories award my what in my mind is that right that's why god said cast on every imagination that came and tried to exhort himself up against the hand of god is that right because you got to understand your opponent you know when you got around and then wasn't there any other minimum having that lead you know what i was back in my time you know i know some of y'all made it in but anyway back there you know he understood his opponent is that right he always understood them but you know when he got around that he knew that's why he could put on the show and he could he could predict a certain time he would knock him out and what he was going to do is that right but he had he always had problems with who he had problems with joe frazier is that right because when he fought smoking joe he got a realizer because you know when you're like prized fighting you know when you're gonna hit a man with a jab if you can hit a man with a jab you can hit him anytime is that right you pop him and you can hit him but what he was doing was wearing that neck down wearing that neck down wearing that neck down but you know down there but when it came to smoking joe smoking joe always kept moving at him like this is that right so ali had to trade different alley had to train to throw 115 to 120 punches around he's tired when he came up against joe now you're in laird to see her you can't get slack on your prayer life you can't get slack or read your bible you can't get slack on fasting you can't get slack on these things you got 200 million demons loose out there you got to understand the times that you're living in hallelujah help us lord he said look we're living in these perilous times but you have to understand you got a tutor and the tutor is watching over and the two always go back and report back to the father don't think you're getting away with anything the holy ghost goes and report and tell them right it's a good child when they got a bad child you know sometimes people want to try to pacify him but he's not going to pacify him that's why you thank god you got a pastor that love you you know why not so much because what god is doing through him but he'll correct you ah that's when you know you got somebody that loves you is that right because love is corrective so we have to understand it is our here and now man when that tutor that tutor goes back and he reports to the father he tell them maybe perhaps you're having trouble over there in your flesh it's because when i told you to go fast you're not fasting yet he's not fasting yet so he go back and tell the father no he's not fast enough yet father but then he told this one over here yes father when i wake him up in the morning and get up and pray about two or three in the morning lord god uh when someone needs prayer when someone needs someone to visit or someone needs a phone call they're being obedient is that right the holy ghost comes up and the holy ghost comes and it tells the father it goes back and reports to the father so the tutor is there and when the tutors now see that you're ready then you're a good child and your report and you gave in a good report and then the holy ghost says damn i could do what movement to the what the adoption is that right there i think we can move them into the adoption that's why you have to understand this flesh uh there's no good thing in the flesh the flesh the five see taste feel smell and hear was only sent to contact your earthly body is that right that's all they were said to do to contact this earthly body but you have to understand memory reason and conscient affection those and then what those are sent to contact you what your spirit is that right that puts you on free more well with god so when the enemy comes in it's left up to you if you're going to receive it or not is that right god puts you on free will so that's why you say meditate he said meditate on the word of god what day and night is that right now so when you're coming in now when the holy ghost now comes and you become what you'll be coming that's what to the position i mean that position is now the adoption when you're adopting the adoption now have put you in a position you are put in your position in your position maybe you're just you're you're sent to be a beautiful housewife is that right be the best housewife that god has moved you into your position god have chosen you to be maybe you are a nurse you are the best nurse that god chose you to be because now you have been put in your position is that right god has chosen you i mean you are preordained you are ordained for your position and so maybe god have chosen you to be a beacon be the best deacon that you can be if god have chosen you to be a trustee you can be your best trustee that you can be is that right if god has sent you a good husband you'll be the best wife that you can be and the husbands you can be the best husband that you can be you are now moved from this side of the holy ghost but you are now being moved into your position is that right look what he says hallelujah let's look at joshua joshua 1. he says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over they go over this jordan now and all this people unto the land which i do give thee even to the children of israel it says every place that the soul of your soul shall tread upon that have i given given unto you as i said unto moses for the wilderness and this lebanon even until the great river euphrates and the land of the hittites and to the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast he says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life you see what we're talking about come on now joshua's we live in the holy ghost sanctuary come on now when you move into your adoption when you move into your position it's time now to recognize moving to who you really are saints you can speak that word is that right it's time to stop the living below our standard saints on we don't have to claim nothing we don't have to claim no copic we don't have to claim no virus we don't have to claim no sectors we don't have to claim nothing god says i'm the lord thy god the hair of all my diseases but i look into the hell to where my strength and my health coming from i'm jehovah rafai my god [Music] okay praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord he said now look he says there shall not there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee i want things let's look and see here we have to recognize in this hour here now when god says something is not like man you can stand on it god's going to bring it to pass but this is the hour here now saints he said when we bind on earth shall be binding in heaven what we loose on earth shall be loose in heaven god has given that authority that's a powerful authority that god has given us some is taking it lightly in this hour here now we don't have to accept nothing all you got to do is pray and when you get down there and pray bind those demons up send them back to where they come from use the authority that god has given us this is the church of jesus christ uh let them know that all the world knows what god will be doing through here it's gonna be a day when the limbs is gonna come through here is that right it's gonna be a time when the eyes of the blind will be open again it's gonna be a time when their legs grow back again come on saints we're moving into that that's thou believe it because thou believe it we are the ones chosen we are the ones ordained for this year we're waiting for this to come it's going to be a short work before we leave out of his things thank you jesus hallelujah hide the good fight of faith he said look he said now be strong he says verse six to be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto thy fathers to give this is only be thou strong and very courageous that thou may observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant command thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mays what prosper which so ever thou go is why because god has given us the seventh angel messenger don't turn from the left don't turn from the right is that right he came in here the church will do what to tie up all the loose things is that right and this is the hour here now same thing these things god put us in this age here now because he knew that we would be overcomers is that right he ordained us for laodicea is that right the pentecostals in them luther thought that was it is that right oh no no no no no no wesley thought that was it didn't it no no no no no no no no pentecostal start that was it no no no no no no no no he said what no you can't do what limited god at all is that right god's been unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding unfolding i'm telling you saints it's not going to stop until we become just like christ so you guys will enjoy it enjoy it i left my notes but i'm telling you i was going to read something to you it's going to keep unfolding saints this is christ unfolding the word in the hour that we've been waiting on is that right that's why what paul was saying the things i desired to do i did not there was a war going on in my mind you don't have to get caught up in the spirit don't let satan plant seeds in your mind meditate on the word day and night is that right trust in the lord in all thy ways and lean not to thy own understanding and he will leave and he will guide and he will direct that path and you will never fault is that right he said put on what the whole armor of god and for so that you may be able to do what stand against all the wiles of the devil in these end times is that right we thank the lord i'm looking at some i'm thinking they're going to die saying the prophet's name i'm saying lord where are they going huh what they trying to do they think they got their own some type of revelation huh no way better leave that alone hallelujah we want to go behind the veil is that right you don't want to go behind the veil so sweet it's been so sweet when they tell you about it you want to go behind there little brother brandon said that he had a hidden life he said what you got to do you coming in justification coming in sanctification he said you got to get along first and just get some quiet time he said after you get alone and you get some quiet time just quiet time he said then you got to go you pray and after you get around and then you pray and you pray and the holy spirit will come and then he'll minister to you is that right and then after they come in and minister to you and then when you get in there you invite them into study and when you invite them into study it's just like that veil just dropping behind you ah and then they come down there and he'll meet you and he'll tell you exactly what he wants you to say to his precious children is that right you're gonna feed my sheep uh he knew what we was gonna need tonight because i didn't is that right hallelujah look what he said joshua hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord he said but now and be strong and very courageous confident that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law that moses my servant commanded thee turn not from to the right hand or to the left and verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of the mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night he says that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein see he'll come and say oh god my precious sister over here this angel and when the holy spirit go back and report back to the father and he's got a good report when the tutor tells them that she's meditating on the word day and night though and they get around and then god knows she's getting close she's falling in love with jesus and when you're falling in love with jesus he's an intimate relationship he'll just come in and start opening that word up to you saints i'm telling you we're moving into something that they have that it's not even for them i say this here if it wasn't for that kovic they better thank the lord because we probably wouldn't even be live streaming and some of them wouldn't even really know what we get what we're receiving i'm telling you this is fresh from the throne of god hallelujah this is no man what he's given the pastor god is bringing this fresh they've been waiting this was hidden manna that's right brother robert that's exactly what it is there was a hidden manner they can't understand it it's not for them to understand is that right that's why paul started talking about the adoption that's why paul started talking about moving into into those things see the of the eye the lust of the flesh and the pride of life is that right the god knows you know the enemy is going to come at you in those three ways i'll rescue recognize how the holy spirit just drilled that in that way is that right sunday he wouldn't let him get away from it because you have to understand is that right we're looking for the body change we know that we're going to have a body change we know that we're going to have issues in this flesh on this side here and now we know that we're going to go through things but you don't have to claim it is that right i'm not going to sit there and say i thank god for this uh uh code that's trying to get on my back or whatever no i'm going to say god once i recognize what i did to allow the enemy to get up on me i say father thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace lord god thank you lord god for being able to see me through this lord give me strength father let me recognize lord god that you're going to get glory out of this situation as you want to get glory out of someone with the virus why because once you receive the baptism of the holy ghost he said grieve not the holy spirit of god to read by you and what sealed until the day of your redemption is that right sure you're going to make mistakes but paul talked about it over there in the ephesus is that right he says our sins doesn't mean that since god doesn't condemn a sinner a sinner he's a sinner is that right he could do that because we sin but god also know that he already shed the bread blood when before the what foundation of the world is that right god knew the devil thought he had some of us as hormones but god slew the blood again before the foundation of the world god said he knew he was going to have some alcoholics the devil thought he was going to give us but god knew he was going to slew the lamb of god before the foundation of the world god know he was going to have some drug dealers but he slew the lamb of god before the foundation of the whale god knew he was going to have some hormone with but he slew the lamb of god before the foundation of the world god knew he was gonna have some murderers but he flew the lamb of god before the foundation of the world god knew he was gonna have some liars but he slew the lamb of god before the foundation of the world so when you send all the blame all the blood all the blood and sign my name according to all that is written there is for them that shall that way prospers and then thou shall have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be strong neither nor be dismayed for the lord thy god his what with thee where so ever thou were ghosts those at home brother john keep on singing brother john huh he said keep on singing brother john draw that devil out of your house you have been positioned you have

shake the foundation of the devil he wants to see your movement he wanted to see you down keep saying it i'm going to tell you the testimony in a minute keep singing keep praising him keep singing keep praising him keep singing keep praising him look what he says this is what come to me look at psalms 47. look at psalms 47 hallelujah like i said same time just letting them have this way i left them notes home but that's okay we having a good time we're here is god's ambushing the devil tonight is that right it's just a word of encouragement saints hallelujah we thank the lord just keep on praising his name is that right hallelujah psalms 47. he said oh clap your hands all ye people shouted to god with the voice of triumph for the lord most high there's what is terrible is that right he is a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nation under our feet he should choose our what inheritance for us the excellency of jacob which whom he loved god is going up with a what shall the lord with the sound of a trumpet sing praises to god sing praises sing praises to our king sing praises for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with what understanding is that right what you doing doing understanding in all your getting get understanding is that right so when you're singing you're praising him you're compounding the devil is that right he's reconfusing him we ain't pushing the devil he's sending attack on us is that right but now we gotta remember we got people in position we gotta recognize now we know lord uh watch over brother robert lord uh when we ride down the road is that right man somebody keep brother robin under your prayers or somebody keep the pastor under your prayers somebody keep running fairly under your prayers if we keep one another under the prayers i'm telling you we all will be covered is that right the devil trying to take him out with the flat power is that right but the angel of the lord is look what he says he says verse 8 god rings over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness the prince of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto who god he is greatly exalted we serve almighty god what a mighty god we serve is that right hallelujah i want you to look at it turn to joshua 10. turn to joshua 10. go back to joshua just a few words of exhortation saints then i'll give you this testimony hallelujah glory to his name i tell you the lord's just been so good so good to me he says down here i tell you what we're looking let's look at joshua 10 and we'll start at verse 12. he says you're familiar with the story here but we want you to see and look at the confidence that joshua had in the lord is that right all the testimonies that joshua had he says verse 12 joshua 10 and 12. he said then speak joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand still moon upon gibeon and thou thou moon in the valley of egypt and the sun stood still and the moon moon stays until the people had what avenged themself upon their what enemies is not this written in the book of jesus also the son stood still in the midst of heaven of heaven and haste not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like the like that before it or after it that the lord hearken unto the voice the voice of a man for the lord fought for who now the lord is fighting the same battle for us is that right now we have to move if gospel we can say the sun stands still and the room stands still covered get on your way in the name of jesus christ loose my brother loose that family loose them in the name of jesus christ any sickness in his diseases god said that it would not come upon his children he said he was going to show that it was a difference between us and the lord is that right come on saints we gotta come on up here there moving to your adoption moving to the word saints is that right i'm telling you saints god is able let me share this testimony with you and i'll tell you we came in there y'all saw my little grandchildren we were there the week of uh uh new year's and we went there to tennessee and we went to tennessee and we came uh um well yeah we was here came to service and after he came to the service then we took him back to tennessee and after we took him back to tennessee the lord gave us grace to to go but then when i went there to tennessee i looked the lord told me i was supposed to

in there and we got around and then i was calling brother robin who was getting things together for the communion and the foot washing and it was still troubling me i said lord i was praying but i was determined not to receive anything that was going to come on me and hinder the work of the lord is that right if joshua said son stand still if joshua say moon stand still god you can give me strength to do your work for your children you can give me the strength father i'm no lord god i didn't do what i was supposed to do but you can give me the strength of the lord god and we came in there and we

mercy on me lord jesus and we got in there and the lord came in and brother steve came in and he came in there today he said boy the devil sure was fighting us uh i tell you and i looked up at him and i didn't say he said he was jumping on and jumping on people over here over here over here over here i started to say brother stephen over here but i didn't say that right i got around and then i just looked at it i said yeah that devil he hopped up and then we were coming down in there when we got over there even coming here that night for the communion that that would try to run us off the road and try to call us director and i said lord but my wife and i we always prayed and when we prayed and show the angel and the lord and camp around them that fill you so we got over there and we came in there and once we got in there we made it through there and after we made it through and after we made it through the communion and we made it we rejoicing and we were praising the lord and but steve you're gonna have to tell me how to do that i love that i gotta learn that you know what man the devil hates that that devil hates that you know what i'm saying i don't know how y'all do that but the devil hates that boy he gets the devil scared is that right he can't handle when he when i hear you say that but anyway we got there and we got there and it was struggling when we got down there and they were struggling i'm still my flesh and then when we got around there the holy spirit he was ministered uh brother steve was ministering suddenly and then he mentioned my name and i looked i said uh-oh i said he got around in there i said lord i don't know but i must i better be ready by the grace of god and then when he called and he asked me and he asked me when i minister i said lord i didn't tell him no i said lord but you're the god the almighty god you're jehovah jireh i say lord if you strengthen me to the communion if you're stripping me through the food watching lord god you can strip to me through this service on wednesday night lord jesus touched his body father so when i went in there i laid down and i knew what i had to do i had the old-fashioned way i didn't know your younger generation know about it but when i got in there i put on a pair of pajamas and i put on a sweatshirt and i put on another shirt and i put it on a sweater and i put it on a jacket and i put it on a hat and i got up under that blanket your children gonna need something wednesday night though and the morning night when they got in there and the devil said lay there he said brother steve the devil said lady sleep i said no i can't lay there and sleep it's three o'clock in the morning he's telling me to get up and pray and i got up there in prayer i went into the prayer room and i got in there i landed on my man i couldn't i couldn't pray y'all i got there the aching nicole was just running all through my body down through my legs and i just started singing i still started crying but i remember the crocodile i remember the crocodile in the sundown i mean when countdown uh brother brandon said you need some more holy ghost sometime he said you gotta cry sometime you gotta mourn sometimes you gotta pray sometime you gotta save some time now and i started worshiping and started worshiping god and then started singing praises and i got in there in the pain and the pain that was down the road left and left my legs right and left my feet there and i didn't lay you back and i said thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus hallelujah i'm telling you faith give him his praise give him his worship give him his honor give him his glory i'm telling you to leave and leave this body it has no right he's trespassing hallelujah be of good courage be strong in the lord he said look look when he says i'll tell you let's turn over to hallelujah help us lord go to ephesians let's go to ephesians chapter one help us lord the lord is good i'll tell you things when you get there i'm not gonna glorify no devil i'm not gonna glorify no virus i'm not going to glorify you might be a god to get you and god to take care of you got to take care of that flesh i've got to keep you strong but paul was talking about this here i'm just going to touch a little bit of it here because it comes to me any adoption look at ephesians 1 and verse 3. it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in christ it says according as he has what chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him we're in love see having predestinated means you have been ordained pre-ordained you cannot get out of this what god has called us to do i am now using that the word predestination with understanding i recognize noun that the devil knows that he's in trouble that's why god said that's why the prophet of god says if you once the bride who recognizes who she is she is really going to become that invincible army is that right we are coming in here now this body here now is just waiting to be what claimed is that right but god has to train you he has to bring you into a position into your to unto your position so you can understand what god has called you to do and when that god has called you to do we all are prayer warriors but god is going to use us in special ways saints we have to desire to for those souls one to be saved out there i even heard brother branham when he went to win on the other side and he saw those converts and he was wondering who they were and it was about it looked like a million converts and when he saw those converses the converts they were young and they were young and beautiful and even the lady there don't give up on anyone is that right he said the lady that was he led to christ at 90 years old is that right and she was young and beautiful that's why i automotive and objective and one thing i loved what he said he said lord are these my converse he said when i'll go back then i'll preach like i never did before he said to win another million to your kingdom is that right that's why we're here for saints we're fulfilling the plan of redemption god sent this holy ghost this holy ghost it would lead it would guide you know all truth uh it was sin because it's our fortress it's our buckler it's our protector it's our teacher it's our counselor he will lead and he will guide you we got the best teacher in the world states just humble yourself be still and listen for that still small voice is that right that's that voice the holy ghost that enemy and he's speaking to you there and inside of you that seed that was planted there before the foundation of the world the god god is bringing us down saints i know i said it earlier but i'm telling you it's in manna this is special god have saved the best for last the way this word is being unfolded is that right the word is being unfolded to us now is because it's the holy ghost the holy ghost is in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh the holy ghost was sin so what so god can have fellowship once again is that right so that god now because we can refinish the plan of redemption that god has sent us here to do is that right and so that we can become what one with god against once again saints that's what he's bringing us into he's bringing us in to be just like him saints hallelujah come on up musicians come on musicians i tell you god is richly doing some great things for us let me finish reading a little bit more in this uh in ephesians he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted into the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he have bound to toward us in all what wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he have purpose in himself saints let the tutor let the tutor bring back a good report let the tutor bring back to the father that father they're praying and they're reading their bible father they're standing in the gap for one another father they're binding up demons forces lord god father and they are fasting lord god father they are hungering and thirsting to come into the presence of your of the lord father they are hungering and thirsting for lost souls father he's the holy spirit is reporting back to the father a good report and he says now we can do what now we can say that we can do what put him in the position they're ready for the adoption and everything god bless your saints have your way let us bow [Music] our hearts and mind about heads bow all except for the pastor everyone else has battle except for a pastor someone know that they're troubling and need uh prayer or your needs your salvation or you're struggling in an area just raise your hand and we'll all just god

father you see the hands you know what they're up for lord god but lord god perhaps they want to see more supernatural of you lord god so that's the first sign we see lord god a supernatural act because the hands are meant to hang by the side and they went against the law of gravity so father bless them lord jesus strengthen them keep them watch over them father lord god continue to bless the
