wi-fi so we kind of chatted a little bit this morning so everything's good they're they're actually on their sundays they're actually totally locked down the country you can't go out of house on sundays so that means no church can you imagine for the whole country most of it's catholic anyways but um so that may be a blessing in reverse but [Laughter] but there are other denominations in other churches i think a few last i heard there was nine message churches but so it's got to be really crippling to the businesses as well so any other prayer request you got something brother okay

nine or ten of them out there the big big ones just see me at my car okay they're good if you slice them and put vinegar and pepper on them okay that's the southern way but it however so has anybody got a song on their heart this morning hey man nobody good thank you sister i had a feeling i did so god bless you i don't know what to say but the lord just told me to sing so amen i'm just gonna sing about his grace amazing grace you all just sing with me i don't have the words if they could put the words up so we could all sing [Music] together how sweet the sound that saved [Music] like me

many days [Music] we comes his grace and grace will lead [Music] so we'll sing amazing amazing grace how sweet the sound [Music] like me i was i once was lost god we are found [Music] we were blind but thank you lord now we can see we have seen hallelujah hallelujah you got one amen come on up please pray for me i haven't sung in a while and i'm very nervous i want to give a little testimony before i sing um i got to a point a few months ago and in the last couple months well the last year and a half where i was questioning the message very heavily you know and it was it kind of you know kind of went back because of the church split and you know i wanted to be able to be in the position where i chose the message for myself instead of you know following everybody else because everybody else left and you know i came to the point where i'm i felt old enough to where i needed to make that decision on my own and um it caused some arguments with my parents and i for a few months because i decided to stay for me for a few months to um to really make that decision on my own and see for myself this is what i believe and i'm not leaving because everybody else is i'm leaving because i know this is this is wrong this is what i believe and i'm going to do that because i know it's right so um you know it didn't it did progress to the point where i i felt that confirmation and i needed to leave and so that didn't take away the doubt though you know for some reason i just i had that doubt in my heart for a few months and um i don't know what it is but maybe it's the preaching here but the last few months i've gotten that confirmation and um i had an experience yesterday that my dad and i were joking about it but it really took me off guard um i took piano lessons for a couple for about five or six years from a pentecostal pastor's wife and she and i became very good friends you know i i prayed for i put up prayer requests for her in church for a few months because she had gone through breast cancer and you know she's completely healed from that now but but um she and i stayed in touch i would go to her house sometimes and catch up and get coffee every once in a while and she was always very very sweet to me very kind i do have a very close relationship with her but yesterday i went to her house for breakfast and to catch up and her mother was there who's also a pentecostal pastor's wife for the last 40 years and um they were you know i was telling them about how i had doubt about what i i believed for a while but now i've never seeked god more in my entire life than i do now and you know i was just i was giving her that testimony and you know i've explained to her about about what we believe about the message and you know with panic with pentecostal doctrines they believe a little differently with speaking in tongues as we do and i i explain that to her you know i believe we speak in tongues and there has to be a certain order about it but it is a beautiful gift that god is god will give you in the moment if it's in the correct order but um we would have discussions about that and that came up yesterday and i told her i said i've never experienced that myself got you know i have gifts in other in other ways i have you know gifts and music but i said god has never given me that gift you know and i pray one day he may but you know if it's not his will then he won't i've experienced i've seen other people have it and i think it's a beautiful thing but you know so she she started talking about that and she was saying well you know that means you don't have the holy ghost if you've never experienced it for yourself and i said well i don't quite believe that i don't believe that everybody every christian has to experience it for evidence of the holy ghost but i believe it's it's a gift and so it it it progressed the situation progressed to the point where she and her mother were hovering over me had their hands over me praying for me and almost trying to force me to speak in tongues to get the holy ghost and i felt so uncomfortable it was very you know i felt i felt so uncomfortable in my spirit and it drained me by the time i left you know and when they were praying over me i think they got disappointed because i didn't and i felt i felt bad about myself you know i'm thinking oh my gosh if this is how it is in their church you know people must feel bad about themselves if they don't speak in tongues if they don't get that gift like i can't even imagine because i've always felt like i got the holy ghost when i was 14 at a at a believer's youth camp and you know i definitely can say i've needed the the um refreshing of it the refilling of it and i believe i've been getting that but sorry i feel like i'm about to i'm on the verge of crying this whole time but but that really like confirmed to me that i don't belong anywhere else i don't belong in any other denomination any other church if if just that one experience with that just made me it really made me feel uncomfortable in my heart and i think that was the confirmation one of the confirmations i needed that i'm right right god has me right where i belong so so um i've sang this song plenty of times and i pl please join me if you know it i'm just gonna sing a little bit of it not the whole thing but i hope it's a blessing to you and i hope if anyone here has doubt about whether or not you should be here um maybe this song will be a blessing or maybe you can come talk to me and we can we can talk about it together and you know maybe we can help each other out so please sing this with me if you know it truth is i'm tired options are few i'm trying to pray but where are you i'm all churched out hurt and abused i can't fake what's left to do truth is i'm weak no strength to fight no tears to cry [Music] even if i try but still my soul refuses to try but one touch will change my [Music] is this is my offering lay me at the throne leave me there all alone to gaze upon your glory [Music] sing to you this song truth is it's time to stop playing these games we need [Applause] [Music] so lord speak right now let it fall like we're desperate we're chasing after you [Music] my heart is torn in pieces it's my offering lay me at the throne leave me there alone gaze upon your glory and sing to you this song [Music] take me to the king i don't have much to bring my heart is torn in pieces it's my offering lay me at the throne leave me there alone to gaze upon your glory and sing to you this song take me to the key [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i'm with your son [Music] thank you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord [Music] hallelujah thank you lord thank you hallelujah we thank you lord we thank you for your presence lord thank you lord let's invite our pastor up this morning hallelujah believe [Music] all things are [Music] possible [Music] all things are possible [Music] only believe [Music] but i [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] amen god bless you all this morning we greet you all in the name of jesus christ father help me move this culture here everybody happy don't worry about that sound everything will be all right thank you i believe everybody can see from here right blessed be the name of the lord what else can we praise god but for a personal revelation of jesus christ amen [Applause] brother branham says that god doesn't have grandchildren he only have sons and daughters of god so we must reach to a point where it is between you and the lord and that's it nobody else can get there amen once you reach that point that was it i was talking to somebody last night he was going through something and he asked me he said pastor thank you very much musician he said pastor as a pastor as a brother what can you advise me i say brother if you take a decision not just a decision but if that decision is coming from your heart if it's a sincere decision coming from your heart even hell knows it amen you can take many decisions that's why you see people coming to the altar repent and go back and nothing happened repent and go back and nothing happened but if you take a decision and that decision comes from your heart amen and you really mean it i told him i said brother what he does it create an atmosphere around you that's the atmosphere brother brother i'm saying you get closer to somebody and you can sense whether they like you or they don't like you you don't have to say anything you know what let's sit a little bit you don't have to say anything amen i said brother branham say even a dog will recognize if you love him or not amen how can a dog speak a human language dog do not speak human language but there is a language that even animals understand that language have to come from your heart amen i said brother if you want to be out of trouble take a decision in your heart from the bottom of your heart you say i don't want to be in trouble if that decision is genuine hell will wake up [Laughter] amen you won't have to force anything everything will begin to run smooth without any problems amen i told him i said one time there was a woman that came to brother branham and the woman was suffering of something and she came to brother branham and she explained brother branham her situation and brother branham say okay you go ahead and kneel and i want you to pray about it and the woman knelt down and begin to pray begin to pray begin to pray begin to pray and she finished she rose up she said brother branham everything is okay it's finished brother branham say it is not okay yet that's the kind of prayer we usually do you want to pray for somebody in jesus name go out thank you jesus i'm healed thank you lord i'm here but you he didn't get there brother branham told the woman go back again and start praying over the woman went back again and begin to pray and begin to pray begin to pray brother branham says suddenly she touched something and when she touched that thing the woman began to cry nobody told her how to cry nobody will teach you how to start sobbing it's not going to be you anymore it's going to be somebody else that is taking over when that woman reached that prayer she rose up brother branham said now [Laughter] amen brother adam said now it is over and it was over amen that's why sometimes that channel take a quick turn and you get it sometimes you might have to linger in prayer a little bit but if you got used to a prayer where you just sit lord i pray for my son i believe he's good he's good good and you raise up and you go that's why you don't see a lot of stuff happening amen but let the heart connect to the maker amen nobody will say nothing if you rose from that prayer the first sign you're gonna see the worry about what you were praying for will be taken off it looks like whatever burden you have like somebody lifted up and no matter how many symptoms the devil will pull in your face it will do you nothing and when that prayer happens the devil in hell will wake up and say something is happening somewhere amen amen so when a child of god get a personal revelation of this message amen even if the whole church backslid even if the pastor backslid you gonna stay right there [Applause] if it's going to be one person going to the rapture it's going to be you amen whether your husband like you or not he don't matter anymore whether the whole church is for you or not he don't matter anymore because you reach a point where nobody can put you there except class you remember the tenth vision you remember the tense vision when you entered there when you come out if they ask you a question you don't know how to explain it the only way you can explain somebody is you gotta go back yourself and you enter there when you come out we can talk a different language but we can explain you won't explain me i won't explain you but when we look at one another we understand we know the same thing hallelujah have you seen two marriage people they can look at one another in their eyes and they know what they're talking about amen you can sit there and watch the eyes and watch their eyes and you don't get nothing but when the wife is looking at the husband she can even write you a book [Applause] amen she can even tell you my husband is saying this this this this this and you go back exactly the truth it is a different language [Music] [Applause] they love the lord blessed be the name of the lord oh my god now you got me preaching something else lily you caused it [Applause] hallelujah we thank everybody for the tremendous work that was done yesterday so god richly bless you i know some of you wanted to be there but there are circumstances that did not allow the lord sees the the heart amen and the lord will bless you amen i was looking at the church this morning i know because of fourth of july few folks are out but it looks like the church brother robert you can see what's going on so we might need all the chairs there amen i won't show you anything you just need to go back there and you watch what is happening amen because i don't want youtube to know what is going on [Laughter] amen so thank you very much continue to pray we are almost there we are running through some difficult time but we almost there just keep praying praying and let the lord make a miracle especially for the parking lot then that will make a big difference amen so we certainly covet your prayer sister divine it's going to be next week lord willing she came back to me she said brother stephen i graduated last year [Laughter] amen he always start with a woman i thought he's going to start with the guys and the woman claim her position [Laughter] amen she said brother stephen he was in the middle of all this kind of stuff but i travel i need i say so what you mean you are claiming your bibles you say yes so you're going to get it next week we already got it we just need to put your name on and think so lord's willing you will get it next week amen yeah i believe you already got a message he told you about the website maybe some of you already saw the website so please bear with us because we're still working on it we putting people in contact where we need to start uploading the stuff on the website and the streaming and everything so you can go straight and see it amen have you noticed a mystery on your website i send it to the deacon and the trustee nobody's talking about it what was the first picture on the website from the left who was on the first picture broad able who was in the middle brother stephen who was the end and didn't put it it was not me who put it somebody did it amen what is the first person that starts worship god in the bible [Applause] [Music] oh somebody's catching it what was the first person that received a revelation of the lamb in the bible who was the first person amen and who was the first mother that was strained in the old testament no in the old testament because paul spoke about the blood of abel amen which was speaking loudly right and that blood was speaking about the old covenant which is the old testament everybody clear then in the new testament jesus christ came as the lamb of god and he produced the true lamb that evil prefigure amen the lamb of the lamb that elbow was killing was prefiguring jesus christ so when jesus was dying at the cross and jesus said father do whatever forgive them because they don't know what they want and when stephen came and they begin to kill stephen the first human being that expressed their true atonement in the new testament was who i didn't put that everybody clear so the old testament is there and the new testament is there but there was a revelation that jesus did not have when jesus was here on earth when jesus resurrected then the father unfolded that revelation and jesus took that revelation and went to who in the book of water ever clear in the book of water this is the old atonement this is the new atonement but the book of revelation finished the entire plan of redemption are you there this one was slain and have to wait for the lamb under paradise because all the old testament sent they died and this one was slain about here and he's waiting for the rapture but this one they tried to kill him but they could not kill him and jesus even gave him a promise that some of you won't die until they see the water he takes that's why brother branham said when the rapture will come the old testament sand will be in the front then the new testament sent a following and it's gone by the ministry of john the revelator so your whole three pictures have your entire bible written right there hallelujah you know i was talking to somebody when i spoke about the heart i said their heart was on the east side right and when i told brother chad we were talking to him and he took a piece of paper he said brother stephen look at this look at this in the human being brother branham said in the heart is everybody okay i'm gonna take off sooner i'm just preparing at the airport amen brother when i'm saying in the middle of the heart there is a compartment where there is no cells nor even blood there that is the occupancy of water of the soul how many chambers do we have in the heart thank you my sister will already say that how many chambers do we have four chambers how many ribs do we have 24 water everybody clear so in the middle of the heart there is a soul which is the throne of god america which is the throne of god on the east side of your body on the east yes ever here this is the north this is the south this is the west this is the east side amen but if you go on in heaven where god sits on the tron around god throne there is four beasts yes sir that's why the heart have four chambers everybody clear and before god there is how many elders [Music] how many weeps do you have that's why paul said your body is the temple of the water everybody clear when adam was put to sleep how many ribs did he pull worn and made water when the book of redemption in the book of revelation ever here there was one rib that was taken off here one rib amen and that rib was a woman ever clear but in the book of redemption when there was a call to the kingsmen redeemer amen the whole creation was already completely lost and john was crying because no one was found worthy to do what to take the book and to break the sales how many elders move how many others moved one ad has moved one who was that elder and john is the type of water any question this message is perfectly in line with your bible oh my god i can't even get on what i'm trying to preach amen so just remember that's your website i was looking at that and then he pops up boop i say oh my god who did this how did this he didn't even know what he was doing but he was the lord doing that amen so when you see this picture now you're going to look at them in different eyes you won't look brother brother jump on it no that's not god it's going to be like evil john in the book of revelation the middle is stephen then your eyes are changing amen blessed be the name of the lord our house meaning lord willing is going to be on the 17th brother robert right so you're going to receive more information about it we will put a new box it's already there question and answer how many are reading their cod book only a few people oh my god you need to work hard amen you need to work hard if you don't have that you let me know i will buy you another one amen just beca in case if there is a sermon if there is a service going on here if you see anybody on the outside stop begging money or something like that don't deal with them we are not in our church property yet we're in a place where there's all kind of people so you if you see somebody going outside and going left and right from one person to another send them to the deacon and let the deacon handle what are their cases whether they're suffering or whatever is going on don't deal with them for your safety send them to the everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord i can't talk much but you already got it let's stand now for a scripture you took my minute just bear with me if you're sleeping please wake up if you go outside take your telephone you got a link put the link and continue to stay up everybody clear if by any chance you have to step outside click your link we have one service let me try to land this plan everybody okay let's go to the book of proverbs chapter seven we already explained this a lot we went in detail it was in preparation to the hill amen i wish the whole church was here but if you're not here make sure you get this and you get it we explain to you the body of a woman how the body was made has set and operate and everything proverbs chapter 7 if you dare you can say amen verse 7 and be held among the simple ones you know what it means and naive a discern among the youth remember we still we stationed at the youth we started from a childhood and we stationed on the teenager and and entering the teenager he brought us to all these avenues of makeup and high heel and and hair and all this kind of stuff because those are the stuff people bother when you reach that age amen so that's why the youth a young man void of understanding you might be sitting passing through the street near her corner and he went to her way to the way to her house we already know this is approximated verse nine in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night and behold there made him a water a woman met this man we know that woman we already demonstrated to you but i just want you to keep it's a woman amen that woman with an attire of water so when you look at the woman at the first the way she dressed the way she presented herself there is no question about it you don't have to think twice when you look at that woman automatically the information that the woman is giving you is she's a street woman you don't have to even think twice you don't need any diagnosis or anything the woman is dressed like a water like a harlot like a prostitute this is her outer apparel her clothing and everything else that she put on anybody clear because remember paul and peter explained to us the prostitute of their time how do they look karma and a water and a scepter of heart remember the word saddle when it was used the first time it was used in genesis and that word shadow we already explained to you in other words this woman had the heart of the devil anybody clear the heart of this woman was the heart of the serpent and the old serpent we know is the devil lucifer everybody clear so right here what i'm trying to point out is the condition of the heart amen was expressed on the outside by the clothing everybody clear there is no way her clothing could be a clothing of a prostitute but the heart is a christian it doesn't work anybody clear the bible is telling you that her apparel her clothing the way she presented herself she presented herself as a prostituted camera and the reason why she present herself as a prostitute is because the heart that she has is the heart of the serpent in other words she received the teaching of a serpent because it is the teaching of the serpent that causes a man to fall for a woman it is the teaching of the serpent that causes seduction ever clear so she received the teaching just like eve received the teaching and she used that teaching as a voice unto adam and adam fell just like sarah had the teaching and the teaching of sarah put abraham in trouble so this woman received a teaching in her heart and that teaching came from the serpent from the devil because it's the same heart as the heart that was in genesis 3. and thy heart now is expressed on the outside as an appearer of a prostitution the outside was only a manifestation of the inside we okay praise god jump to verse 15 therefore this is the woman speaking can i forfeit to meet you diligently to seek your face go back to verse 13. so she caught him and did water did the man start all the woman so there is no restraint in this woman she doesn't wait for you to start she is the one teaching it is if that gave me the fruit make sense it was not adam getting the fruit it was eve that started because eve was already taught by the serpent anybody clear he said she caught him and kissed him and with a water an important do you know what important means it is a face that doesn't have shame it is a shameless shameless face anybody clear remember last week when we spoke about the shame we showed you that same and nakedness goes together so a normal woman when she is exposed even if it's her husband she has a tendency to be shameful everybody here but if the shame is removed amen the only woman that have a shameless face jeremiah 3 verse 3 says that it is water it is a prostituted forehead that refused to be water that's why this woman is not ashamed because she is a harlot she's a she's a prostitute and a prostitute are not a shame amen why because the heart she receives is a heart of a beast anybody clear with an important face she said i have peace offering with me this day i have paid my vows so she is religious everybody here therefore came i forth to meet you diligently to seek your face and i have water find you we found that this woman here is speaking about the peace offering amen so this woman is religious it is a church anybody clear that church have an anointing of the devil and that anointing will cause the women to dress like prostitutes so now go all over the town look at the churches in the denomination even the church where we came out of it look at the way the women are dressing it is telling you which heart was introduced which anointed enter in the church ever clear so far blessed be the name of the lord let's go to isaiah 3. give me everybody there yeah let me zap that that's okay okay that's fine okay uh okay let's go verse 8 you don't want to call somebody in a party a diabetic and made it and make him wait three hours before you give him food for jerusalem is roon and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doing are against the lord remember they are against the law they are not for the lord this is jerusalem and judah this the the only kingdom that remain faithful to the lord now it's fallen everybody clear to provoke the eyes of his glory verse nine they show off their countenance in other words if you look at their face they show off their countenance that's weakness against them you don't have to talk to them if you love if you just look at their face it's already have a message anybody clear what is that message the fact they show off their countenance does witness against them and they declare their sin as water in other words they are not shamed they don't have any shame they are not even covering their sin they are bold with their seed they are openly showing you who they are don't want to hide their picture they are free to put them on facebook so so you know this is what we're doing it's an anointing they show off their countenance that's witness against them and they declare they are displaying they are seen as sodom they hide it not they don't hide it amen woe to their soul for they have rewarded evil to themselves in other words you look at their face even this anointing make people bold when they are in the wrong amena you guys don't believe that women should cut their hair i'm gonna cut my hair and put it on facebook moreover the lord says because the daughter of water not the hidden daughters these are daughters of zion who is the daughters of zion anybody clear if you notice the scripture never say the daughter anybody clear the scriptures say daughters in plural remember that because this prostitute in the book of revelation she is a mother of water how many harlots plural she's a church but the daughters of zion the churches they call themselves christians are you following me the daughters of zion are water they are proud number one they are haughty in other words they are proud you can't tell them nothing that's why they are bold that's why they don't fear anybody anybody clear if they are proud what is that what is the importance of being holy in proverbs 16 verse 18 the bible says proud goes before water so these daughters are living in the time where god is about to bring destruction and before destruction there is an anointing that is going to drop in the churches and make them proud bossed and then i uh uh uh address themselves inappropriately blood goes before water this is what make lucifer fail in heaven and holy water spirit before a water so it shows that there is a destruction there is a fall coming out that's why brother branham said before judgment come you must enter in the spirit of judgment hallelujah proverbs 18 verse 12 before what the heart of a man is water so when a man you begin to see a spirit of pride a spirit of heartiness upon a man where he knows everything you cannot tell a woman anything just not the next station you're gonna fall anybody clear before destruction the heart of a man is hoody that's what happened to lucifer and before honor is water you want to go up the way up is what that's why when you enter the pyramid the first section of the pyramid you go into the descending passage before you go to the ascending passage the people thought because the pyramid is long when you enter you begin to come when you enter you go down first everybody clear psalm 101 verse 5 who so privily slander his neighbor in other words gossip about his neighbor him will not do water i will kill him him that has a water they look at people like this what do you want him they have a high look and a water will are not water god can put up with you that's why when lucifer express a proud heart god could not take it he have to go down but there is a spirit in the daughter of zion that is bringing that anointing they won't listen to anything they know everything the daughter of zion are hoody arrogant proud i don't want to talk to you you're not the kind of people i deal with i deal with big people not you anybody here i deal with big name in the message not a small one like on you that's it [Laughter] the daughter of zion are holding and walk with stretch fourth neck so not only do they have a proud spirit but there is something that isaiah detected on their walk amen they make stretched forth what is causing the neck of this woman to stretch forward ever here and not only that and they have what wanton eyes the words wanton means seductive eyes why because the anointing is an anointing of seduction of prostitution the neck and the eyes are seductive remember that the eyes of the tsunami was dove when they look at your eyes they see purity they see christian because the eyes are the gate to water there it is a camera that is reflecting your heart but when they look at the prostitute in their heart she has a tendency to cause seduction the mirror is reflected in the eyes that's why brother of adam said you want to get a cow they say look in the eyes but i'm saying the same applied to hope to women they want to nice come on walking isaiah comes back again to the walk walking and messing in other words twisting so what is making this woman to twist because the woman is walking normally but isaiah when he's looking at the time of the end before destruction comes isaiah notice a spirit on women and when those women are walking something is making them balance their hips hallelujah isaiah at that time didn't have the vocabulary that you have amen that's why nehem look he say i see chariot running with eyes like torches but what i'm saying he saw cars if you notice now never say i see chariot and horses did you notice that they usually say pharaoh his chariot and horses but when nehum spoke nehum said i see chariot running nehum never mentioned the horse in other words the chariot was running without a horse but the eyes of those chariots look like torches is his car but he didn't have your vocabulary to tell you that this one is a car he can express it through the vocabulary of his timer everybody here so when isaiah look he found out that the daughter of zion are walking and they are twisting and isaiah don't understand but something picked up isaiah like give them a little bit more detail so when malachi 4 will come he will identify what he was [Music] ever clear he said they are walking and messing as they go so if they stop they're not messing it is when they work that they are balancing up everybody clear as they go and making a water and taking notes with water so when isaiah was looking isaiah saw the modern woman and isaiah look he could not describe isaiah said i see them they are walking and they are like men sing and also i'm hearing so okay they're making a tinkling nose do you remember the vision of the bride do you remember the women that were walking there everybody they are making a tinkling noise with the water let me ask you i can take a sister here walk here if you want to make a tickling nose with your feet go ahead and make a tinkling nose your feet are flesh how can your flesh make a thinking noise hallelujah let's go to zephaniah 1 and we're going to pray my god lord help me be gracious with me let me land this plane hallelujah zephaniah chapter one in this church we read the whole bible we don't stop at john matthew john matthew since the opening of the seals we read everything we can preach the book of solomon we can preach the song of solomon we preach everything amen yeah you don't sit in the church three four years you can hear nothing about the other book go back to the prophet zephaniah chapter one everybody there i know some of you will be looking sephanaya comes after habakka before hagai if you have a problem go pass ezekiel you pass ezekiel then you go you're going to go to three little tiny books and you're going to see them everybody there few people everybody there did you find it go ahead and keep looking my brother pass ezekiel we're going to see who read his bible at home or not amen showdown pass ezekiel and go slowly 35 miles an hour you're going to find it did you find that some of them need to go back in the back side of the book because that's where the seals are so go see the seals is going to give you the page number amen are you there everybody there is a fanaya you there don't follow me i want you to look at zephaniah 1 verse 8 and it shall come to pass in the day that of the lord's water this sacrifice is explained in the book of revelation it is a distraction that's why in revelation there is an angel in the sun i already explained that in this church who is calling for supper that's why brother branham was preaching in the sun because destruction is coming and they're calling the fire of the air for the sacrifice because there will be so many people slain that they found can eat flesh everybody clear the lord sacrifice that i will punish who i will punish the princes everybody clear sorry let's go to verse seven hold your peace at the presence of the lord for the day of the lord is a hand remember there is distraction anybody clear for the lord has prepared a water there is a slaughter people are going to be killed he has beat his guest the fire of the earth are coming and it shall come to pass in the days of the lord's sacrifice that i will punish who the priest's comer and the king's water if it's princess which tribe was producing kings which tribe they were talking about in isaiah judah yes make sense the princes and the king's children because they are princes from judah and judah is the jews the churches embark here come on i'm gonna destroy the priests i'm gonna destroy the king's children kama and oh everybody there such as such as our water clothed with water not only is god going to destroy the people but god is going to destroy people that wore wrong clothing is he clear with you i'm going to destroy those that have strange that was clothed you see the word clothing strange what apparel this word strange is wrong clothing god is going to destroy them if you wear wrong clothing doom for distraction anybody clear what is wrong clothing let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord we went through a preparation to just come to this point so that your children can see not in a legalistic way but can detect the very spirit that is behind things lord i pray that you give a revelation not in the head of the people but father made that revelation drop in the heart because once it's dropped in the heart just like you did to our precious sister father there is no devil in hell that can remove from them and automatically whatever drop in the heart in the subconscious lord father we know that it will be reflected on the outside if it's not reflected then we know it has been stuck in the head in the intellectual part father may have made everyone in this church may they receive it in their heart and see what you are trying to say lord through the churches father we committed all and seal every demonic spirit away from this church and commit your children and to the hand in the name of jesus christ amen if you outside click the link everybody clear we on part 43 i want you to keep in mind here again that jesus said that you have heard that he was says by them of the old time that shall not commit water this is physical jesus magnifier but i say unto you that whosoever looks upon a man everybody clear so far why a woman because that's the only creature that was created as a byproduct a product of a product she was the only one that can cause problems that's why lucifer went to her not to adam but here lucifer never attack adam that's why when god begin to punish the woman everybody here god put the punishment on the conception do you follow me do you follow me and then god changed the covenant you follow me and god said that your husband who was of the original creation they want the devil didn't want to deal with it they want the devil waited for him to go out so he can talk to you i want that man to rule over you that rulership is not a curse that rulership is for protection do you follow me i wanted to open the door for the plan of redemption because my attributes are blocked that's why i made the woman a little bit different now that she unlocked the plan of redemption because i am the one who created hell i must provide a protection for hell now adam make sure you protect eve because she is a weaker vessel [Music] [Applause] the woman was not given to you for abuse the woman was not giving to you for a sex story the woman was given to you for responsibility and protection [Applause] hallelujah that's why you heard me saying that's why you heard me saying if anybody begin to play with sisters in this church i'm gonna chase you away because as a husband to the church as a spiritual head i must protect their sisters [Applause] everybody there how did your woman fall how did your wife fall where were you at where were you at brother branham said when the americans soldier boy marriage and divorce is is he's just passing me like this by the bottom say when the american soldier went overseas he calls what to the women because what the women committed adultery you traveling you leave your wife for two years what do you expect what are you doing two years away from your wife you are supposed to be there for protection [Applause] are you there oh my god whosoever we condemn the women we condemn the women we condemn the woman we condemn the woman what is your responsibility i'm the ruler i'm the chief i'm the chief do you understand chief when the country is in war we want you to get in war it's automatic when a fight goes on the woman will go behind the husband why because of protection god said i finished the plan adam you the strong one you're the one that had the book of redemption you know now from the today go take care of him amen how many time have you seen a woman in the scripture going to war why they didn't put the woman to war where did the country start putting women in the army do you see why brother branham said it's a disgrace to even have a woman police officer the prophet is zeroed in with the scripture hallelujah who saw looking upon a woman but lust after her has commit water with her already in his water how can a woman cause somebody to lust after her everybody clear part 43 i want you to remember this please i want you to remember this because sometimes i say things at the beginning and people don't get it and they're going to ask a question later and i already said it at the beginning now i ask who our sister in spoken word tabernacle i have altered some of my words so that i could speak it before them this is marriage and divorce billy has in his pocket this morning out there some things that could not be said out before a mixed audience and some that are probably will do whatever he will say you must understand take it as from your home to the best that i know you would sit in the doctor's office and listen to him he would have to say very water you don't want a doctor that is speaking in code you want a doctor that tells you the truth plan the problem in the message especially in this country people preachers are not playing you are talking to a teenager like a 50 years old man how is he going to understand what you're trying to say you say read between the land wait between the what line [Music] everybody clear we must speak very plain to you and some of you young ladies and young men i don't want you to get the water brother brother i'm saying when i'm gonna speak plain to you i don't want you to misunderstand me everybody i don't want you to get the wrong impression i want you to believe and just do what remember truth has got to be everybody here so far what are you going brother stephen sometimes in speaking in the midsole yes as we have today both men and women that's what is here sometime using parable to get it point in it would seem like that maybe i must say something that would not be just appropriate among a mixed group of people you say whoa why did he say this but if you were sitting where in the doctor's office they would you will listen to him no matter if you are teenager or boy or whoever he was and we are well in the house of god where we are to have water and water and clean heart if we have not it is our place at the water in other words i'm gonna say things planned here if your mind is still traveling you need to go to the altar because truth must be preached as truth and i'm responsible to this church everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord you know this chart i told you we're getting back up to start going to the surface amen we spoke about the stage of being a baby we went to teenager adolescent and we found out according to ezekiel 16 that adolescence has its trouble we talk about the bill we talk about the smoking we talk about the women and we found out that adolescents have a tendency to have problem with clothing problem with makeup problem with hair that's why we have to go through all those territory to make sure we finish before we give you the solution for adolescent because the solution for a child brother branham said he was not a whooping it was water prayer everybody clear so far now going this brother branham says this i got a prophecy laying at home one of these days i'm going to read it and you wonder why i rap at women the way i do 30 years ago i got water that saved the lord 30 years ago this is in 1962. so god already spoke to brother branham in which here you see what i'm saying 30 years ago i got into that save the lord 30 years ago when i entered the ministry right at the beginning of brother branham ministry he told me the lord that the strain of water women will come so what and imputed in the last day they be the most defined thing on the earth it is summer go to the mom and you're gonna see that this scripture this quote has been fulfilled go to the mall go to the pool try to go take a shower in the pool you're going to come back with a legion of demons here right she started it at the water remember the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the water itself god's eden at the beginning and then everybody clear you remember why we were preparing you now what about them say she started at the beginning and satan used his hair at the water in other words what satan did at the beginning satan knows that his time is ahead so he's going to multiply everything upon the women everybody so far and look what is happening look down through the ears said she shall continue to do water what do you see today is that what you saw 10 years ago they were tight they don't put anything they're out you get in a store today you need a holy ghost she shall continue to strip herself and say there shall be a little tiny group the very elect that is predestinated that will escape water that is your solution where are we going brother stephen anybody clear so far let me take off this airport lord oh search me try my case right now lord don't let me come have to come before judgment before you this is a prophet after preaching this way oh if there be any unclean thing in me lord take it away please we see a day that we are living in when men and women are becoming water there is a bold spirit a shameless spirit brother venom is saying the people are starting they are ashamed you say one time there is not even blush among the water in other words the women won't be shameless she can walk with an underwear and she's fine no blessing because a normal woman will blush but what is causing this woman not to blush by the problem there won't be no even blush among the daughters of zion their modesty has been so taken away till they don't even water in other words they left the state of innocency when they removed the veil eve was scared but this veil is removed and somebody is not ashamed it's a prostitute everybody clear oh lord think of it and know that the time peaceable is bleeding away just a minute or two more and the great water before fall will come you remember that because the great destruction will come then let him that is filthy be water when the rapture nobody will be saved anymore except the hundred and forty four thousand anybody following me brother branham continues hallelujah he says one day and the daughter of zion would walk how howdy proud in the last days they will fail to walk after who after the lord no matter what you say to them you can preach and preach and preach it's just like hitting against the wall over there by the problem saying that there is a spirit that is coming that we can preach we can preach we can preach it looks like the people are not affected what is causing that brother branham he said it said that's what upon water so there is an anointing when the prophet luke it's gross darkness upon the people and that gross darkness is there to block the gospel is going on there is no seems to be so hard to find a genuine water that is men or found a woman that is really a water why because there is gross darkness upon the people it is an anointing it is a spirit of prostitution that landed everybody here and that is just about the way the time are getting when we see the water the church that fell to recognize water they failed to recognize the message of the hour and because they kicked jesus outside in the church of laodicea jesus is outside knocking the whole church is in darkness when you see our daughters of zion doing the way they are doing when you see our brother that smokes drinks and tell dirty jokes and things and still trying to hold on the water these are not true sinners these are people that come to church but still living like unclean and try to hold their confession in christ oh my it is water and water that is what is upon the people stay tuned as we move in in proverbs 30 verse 12 and 13 the bible says there is a word that are pure in their own eyes they don't see what you see they don't see nothing wrong about walking with a shot they don't see anything wrong about walking with a tight they don't see anything wrong about going to the beach and being there naked with an underwear they don't see anything wrong about having a bathing suit hallelujah it's a generation that are pure in their own water and yet it is not working from their water they are filthy but their mind is telling them they are right they are confessing to be christian but they are not washed away from their filthiness it's a generation there is a generation oh high water how proud are the eyes and the eyelids are what so this generation not only do they have a proud spirit but they have a high esteem about themselves lover of themselves amen they see themselves like they are in the certain level you can talk to them it's a spirit where are you heading brother stephen hallelujah brother branham and there will be sons in heaven above and in the earth men's heart falling for fear perplexed time of time distress between nation how the people will be water heavy and water proud watch now because we're talking about the daughter of zion who is the daughter of zion everybody clear how the daughter of what come out the water if you notice here brother branham put church in singular amen because there is a difference between the bride and the church amen but this church here is not one church it is a church called jezebel but jezebel is the mother of water it's many churches under that's why he's bringing them to the ecumenical council to connect all of them together into one unit against the brother anybody following me praise be the name of the lord brother adam said how the daughter of zion the church would work hardy high-minded they are proud with the way she'd work and men's and twister she went everybody clown horseless carriage are just linked through the broadway i just explained to you this and different things he said the daughter of zion how they do until and welcome brother proud of me is bringing the second things here brother branham say not only their work have a problem but another problem brother branham say it is the way they dress everybody clear so we have a walk and a choice and in proverbs 7 a woman is just like a what a prostitute because her heart is a heart of the devil everybody here so far let's go now hallelujah brother brother in genesis 3 21 the bible says adam unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god makes water coats of skin and deed water we explained to you that the first manufacturer was free ever here it was not enough to conceal and to protect the body god came and destroyed the manufacture that's why when jesus christ came he looked at the fig tree and he cursed the fig tree amen then god himself killed him and took the lamb and clothed the man and the reason why god was clothing we explained to you that the clothing of god was to do what it was to conceal or to cover because shame was brought by nakedness ever clear ezekiel 16 when i passed by thee you're already familiar with this i look upon them behold the time was the time of love you already know teenager anybody clear and i spread my skirt over thee and did what covered the water this is what he did in eden you understand so when you reach that teenager your hormone begins to work god comes and is interested in your clothing in you being properly covered because he doesn't want any other man to last after you everybody everybody understand nakedness i swear unto thee i enter into covenant with you say the lord god and you became mine because your first marriage is with christ then what shall deal with water because there is a generation that is filthy by the good in their own eyes they are not washed with water everybody i wash them with water the water of the world yeah i totally wash away the blood from the your birth and are naughty with water they give you the holy ghost and i did water i closed thee also with blood at work and i did water so god not only was he responsible for the clothing but god was responsible for the clothing and the water and the shoes everybody in eden god was only interested of clothing adam and adam left but in ezekiel when god comes in the time of puberty god cover the body and god make sure he also supply the shoes why is god interested in the shoes everybody clear so far brother branham when isaiah have he talked about her immorals of women who get in the last days and how there be so much water cloth they had to have and how they have to have their hair set and everything like that the bibles speak that as they are tree how she'd work with water their shoes is not healed shoes can i erase this the shoes everybody following me is not hill shoes anybody follow me the problem is water high heel shoes remember the position of the devil is that the seed of the woman will crush your head and you will do whatever bruised water the devil is after the hill the heal of who the woman i'm gonna put enmity between the woman and the water and the serpent you're gonna crush his head about here but he's gonna bruise your water you follow me you follow me he's gonna crush the word we okay that's a serpent when i when isaac had his twins one was jacob one was eso when jacob was coming jacob was holding water that's why they call him jacob because he was showing a bad character from birth that's why the angels say that name is not good because you are holding in the position of the serpent you need to be changed from jacob to israel a place with god right but here and before that what did the angel did he knocked him out and he changed his work the work the work of the daughter of zion anybody here she will walk with water high heel shoes tinkling her what as she water if she's stationed you won't hear it if she start walking then you're gonna hear that's what isaiah picked up anybody clear and she will roll down her water stockings and the things she would do and many changeable set apparel which means clothing and stuff like that and saying oh that will be taken away from her and she shall sit and stink from immoral and said even seven women will grab one man and said we shall do our own work i already explained you this let us just take your name and take and take away our reproach brother branham is explaining here that the prophecy that we read here is concerning not heal shoes but high heel shoes why is high heel shoes a problem we okay william marion branham in the rising of the sun brother branham say and she dream a dream brother branham's mother you ready you ready make sure you stay up she dreamed a dream that i was standing here by the side of harmony's trip brother bonham there are three steps hallelujah can i erase this there are three steps one two three then there is a road anybody following me brother brother was standing here in the dream you gotta go one two three steps to reach where brother branham is hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord she dreamed that i was standing here by side of three steps and i was standing preaching to who that's why the message goes all over the world that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the water so right here is a highway there is a highway here but branham here is preaching to the whole congregation of the earth that's why he was a man the angel sitting in the sun and his voice is going all over the world he's telling everybody here he's telling all the people here he says for you to get to this highway you must come to these three steps everybody following me you must walk into this tree step and on the highway is a little pearly like white mine run into it to the doors of water so when you look at this highway brother bottom is saying that in this highway when you look on top of the highway it is a road like this and there is a little penalty road here in the middle and this road goes all the way to the gate of heaven everybody clear he says and they go to the door of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearl had been stretched out on top of this water it's like the like a runner like a runner carpet that they put there so you gotta walk the three step on the runner and you continue on the running and as you go there is an extreme here there is a part here but you don't want to go here you go here you get in trouble you go over there you get in trouble everybody here because brother branham had a vision of a mamba and the mamba was sitting beside the highway everybody here and if you get off this track you can find yourself in a legalistic way [Music] if you got this track you can find yourself in the extreme grace that's why when brother branham preached marriage and divorce he said there are two classes they are calvinists and there are armenian one is legalist one other is a grace grace grace grace and he said both of them are wrong you got to stay in the middle class and brother branham preach marriage and divorce as a sunday school lesson that was the third class hallelujah brother branham say if that is my message exactly today what and what and what justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost you on the white highway anybody clear justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and i was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to work on that water if not the message is a burden anybody clear everybody clear so far there was a man there was a lady came by and you know what kind of water what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago there was a lady come by head done a great big pair like they were today how was that everybody here so not only was her heel high they were looking like spikes everybody care and she came by and i said wait a minute sister wait a minute sinner wait a minute whoo so she's in the message she's a daughter of zion she called herself christian she wait a minute sister you can walk the highway with that and i say you can do that and she said ah she said look around at the rest of the women so when this woman came here she heard the message and she turned around she began to talk to the other woman are you following me she was a woman that could teach others jezebel everybody she looked around to the rest of the women and say don't believe what he is a water a church telling other churches that this message is a mad message can i repeat it again a church in the message [Music] that comes against the prophet and she turned around from the prophet and she now begin to tell other churches that the message is wrong holy land don't believe him i shall show you i can water in other words we don't have to be in the message [Applause] you can be outside of the message just receive christ and you can walk the highway a woman a church preaching to others i shall show you i can be justified sanctify and fill with the holy spirit and still do whatever she wanna show brother branham that i can get these three steps and still continue with my shoes on i don't need to change my shoes i just let her go brother i'm leaving alone go ahead continue your right couldn't do no more a burden could not work you won't be able to stop them leave them alone and she jump up on the highway because she want to prove she's bold she want to disprove the message she jumped up on the highway and she looked back at the water said see i told you in other words you see i'm here without the message i told you you don't need the message you don't need to follow this mad prophet here he was a madman he was having problem he was telling stories one time he said 51 something he said 43. she looked at the sister say i told you she started to do whatever she want to show really that i can do it i can even run hallelujah brother venom say you know as the bible says in isaiah he continues five that there won't be water i'll stretch neck everybody here they have to why brother branham women must have a stretch neck what makes them to have a stretch neck they have to they are water brother brother say they are pitchover can you give me my timer we only have one service brother problem say the condition of the neck is caused by something brother branham say the condition of the neck of their neck their neck here is caused by the preaching over pitching over means somebody that was like this and you move him this way that's right you understand me you are looking straight and then when they tilted you amen brother branham say that is what is affecting the neck but the problem is what is causing this woman to be pitched over are we okay is everybody okay by the problem he said they have to they are peach overseas messing are they they have to have to do whatever so whatever is pitching them is responsible for the condition of the neck and it's also responsible for the twisting what is causing that hallelujah messing as they go making a water and thinking whatever is pitching is affecting the neck it's affecting the work it's affecting the muscles and he's also making a noise hallelujah tinkling with the hill see the daughter of what the church in the water so this woman she start up the highway just as hard as she could one and afterwards they got the road got wet so this road is not planned like this it is a road that goes like this amen now if a road get narrow it started here wide as he goes down he gets water it is a road that is in the pyramid shape because the pyramid as you go as you go as you go the pyramid get what the stature of a perfect man because when you start you are birth justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost you are birth then add to your virtue water knowledge knowledge temperance temperance god when he get to brotherly love he get tight amen and when you get tight you are close to the gate of heaven are you following me brother brother she run as hard as she can and the road got narrower and narrower she stopped water and water as she daughter at the end she began to find out that it's a problem amen she didn't listen and mother said the horrible scream that i ever heard in my life was that woman doing what before destruction what cancer she didn't want to listen to the prophet she challenged the prophet she challenged the teaching of the prophet ever and before we get to heaven and followed me away what happened everybody she fall in does what and smoke going down like that i turn around and i say what you see what i was telling you she didn't listen what is this thing that makes the woman pitch over when he pitches the woman it is also affecting her neck affecting her waist affecting her muscles and affecting also her work everybody clear there is two women standing here remember my coat at the beginning you remember my quote at the beginning okay if you look at this woman this woman is straight and this is called the center of gravity it is pretty much balanced with her body everybody understand if you look at this woman her center of gravity is shifted yes everybody clear what is causing that tilt if you look down at the bottom of this woman you see that there is something that has been elevated on the woman if you sit like i'm sitting flat you can pitch other the only way they can make you pitch over they have to raise you up when they range you up then the force of gravity begin to pull you down the earthly forces you remember moses said the forces of gravity ever clear when they pitch this woman if you notice right here that preaching is pushing her belly toward the front everybody follow me if i take my phone and i put it like this if i do this the gravity on this side have increased the forces it's is gonna pull this phone down if i leave this phone like this it's gonna go down amen but in order to keep this phone up i must do something to readjust the phone everybody clear so the readjustment of the phone is making a woman now begin to be designed with a new form that she doesn't have you follow me the normal woman look like this everybody follow me when you answer the heel she's gonna receive a new form that she doesn't have anybody follow me let me continue when he moved her like that brother branham say that is what is affecting her neck because the neck gotta be balanced everybody follow me not only does he affect the neck if you notice the torso of this woman here if you notice her breast remember my coat at the beginning if you notice her breasts here they are come over there they are up now the chest begin to provoke we follow me this chest is now different than that one now not only is the chest changing if you notice the west of this woman is pushed toward the back you follow me who caused that the shifting of the angle are you following me the muscles get pressure you won't hire him before you know when you get in a car you take them off quickly you know the reason why you take them off amen because there were tension going on they barely move toward the front the bat pushes up and the front move up that was not the way you were born you were born this way you were not born like this you now design [Music] by the devil who loves the hero everybody follow me that's why i have to go through that now it's clicking everybody following me the masters get pressure that's why you get in the car off you want to breathe because you are doing work help me brother stephen remember my quote remember my quote at the beginning sister remember my quote at the beginning okay if you have a problem with your mind to the altar remember my coat brother make sure it's bigger not too big so when they go home they see it if you look at the normal woman standing up straight her and the flow are 90 degree everybody follow me but when they give you a high heel brother brother say you are pitched over the high heel is gonna bring you down this way according to the plan of gravitation right there when you pitch the plane of gravitation shift with you are you following me but if you stay this way you're gonna fall you won't be able to continue so your body have to readjust with the new plan of gravity you follow me if you notice right here you will see that this woman after the heels i alter over there here the body is proportionally stabilized between the ax if you look here you're gonna see that the front of the woman is now more toward the front compared to the axe this acts and this asks is the same but the hill as he pitched the woman everybody clear as he shifted the woman the body have to readjust back to keep the woman erected when the body he rejects it's gonna shift the woman toward the front that's why you see the in here they were part here part there in here almost in the back there is nothing everybody care then everything is shifted to the front who does that they hide here anybody clear their body shift to the front the shifting of the body to the front change the center of gravitation to be proportional to the twisting of the angle of your shoe you follow me if your shoe is a small hill like this no problem somebody asked a question how high are you clear the more height you going the more shifting the body have to adjust [Music] if you look at this plane here this plane is parallel to the other one because the body is twisting and not only do you twist your womb as a woman twist are you following me relax i hope nobody's sleeping everybody clear what is he talking about when this shifts the back of a woman does two things he pushes backward and uphold do you want me to repeat again i'm talking to this church do you want me to repeat again this shifting here take the breast of the woman and does two thing to it it pushes that toward the back and he elevated again that's why if you look at this back not only is he back it's elevated who does that the serpent now when you are adjusted like that you reach a parallel with the new plane according to the hill you use now you won't fall back here if you look at this part here it becomes different than that part so the woman is pushed to the front and to the back where do you get this brother stephen hallelujah in the message presuming brother branham say brother i see these people walking through the street these water stretch out want on water the neck are stretched out hills on about water it is not here but it's water you follow me heal about so high why men push what are you sleeping women push out where the brother problem i'm learning this why did brad branham learn this did he have this chart this is in 1962 women pushed out in the water and out in the water and around like water where did brother brother learn this and some women said to me a pentecostal woman say wearing this little bead skirt you know just about half way down on the water keep that keep the knees okay why brother branham that is the only count they make they make sewing machine and sell goods see that's all dirty spirit is on you why would a pentecostal woman want to act like that she's not what she's just got the name of what in other words she doesn't have an experience about here brother stephen continue in the message no if not and here is the other flesh and i speak in a mixed audience going to speak to you as a water that's what i'm doing as the water here is the flesh it's weak this young lady came twisting every form her body working with a pair of what not heal shoes by water high heel shoes on and what is the high heels she was doing herself what stuck out water in the front and water this is what brother branham is telling you in the front and back and the dress is high above the water remember the knees oh a pair of shorts on do you know the bible said she will act like that you know the bible says that is the way she would act how she won't be so what so that pushing out on the front and pushing out in the back is making you look filthy in the eyes of god hallelujah brother stephen where are we going when the plan is shifted like this this womb that was resting calm is twisted what is going on the brother of the bible says adam was not deceived by the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if she continue in water in faith and holiness not having a baby make her safe but because she is raising children doing her duty not raising water cats dogs and whatever more to take the price the place of a child and that and us to do as they do today giving its mother love so that she can go out and run around all night some people do that sorry but they do it that is awful rude for me to say but it's the truth they don't want a baby to be tied down with it in other words the child became like a blockage in their life if that is your attitude something is wrong in your mind everybody brother branham said today it is a dishonor almost to see a big family anymore they rather pay a hundred dollars for a little snowy uh nose dog and pack it around and give it the love of a mother and practice birth control that then to have children think of that something old hang around to the bar and drink and play a card in other words we want to go out we gotta we want to hang out we want to go out when we have babies too much we need to go me and my husband we need to go the baby is troubling us amen why it's a disgrace that's right the greatest what i know a woman can do outside of the coming to christ outside of coming to christ and being loyal to her husband is to have what you might be nursing a little preacher how do you know ever clear but this position affected the womb and medically proven it causes some women not to wear children to bear children because of what the shifting of the hill you look on the front brother branham but when you come to go out on the outside and maybe wear whatever so much of a blouse and so forth and then boost yourself out there with water but the problem is saying what the devil did after shifting the woman with him and giving her a temporary lustful shape everybody clear the devil doesn't stop there because he pushed you toward the front he invented a different strap for women to boost again your breast to cause a man to last after you [Music] i'm gonna read it over now maybe wear so much of the blood and so forth and then boost what yourself out there with what that was the odd calling and things that look water and cause what you understand now cause man do you realize that is a spirit of water so you don't want to do that sister don't you do that that is hollywood what it is a different makeup the holy would make you up the devil design you now differently when you go home you take that strap off you take the high heel off you're gonna look different then your true shape comes yes love a woman on facebook good luck don't you do that that is hollywood makeup and trap of the devil when you do that you make men things water wrong thing about you and when you do that then you are guilty of committing water adultery with a man because you presented yourself that way to him you can't help the way you are working sister remember my two quote some women by shape they have eight shape anybody care what people call coca-cola you know the old coca-cola right some women by shape they are straight some are flooded some are more pronounced the one who created you is god the one who gave you that shape is god brother brother i'm saying you can't help it but you need to be mindful of your shape are you there there are certain fabric that don't belong to all the women if you are flat you can wear anything nothing happens but if your shape is more pronounced you better watch what you're putting on because the fabric you use can accentuate your shape and you cause trouble while in your heart you are innocent and when you put on high heels you make it worse my robe is long my dress is long it's okay did you watch your ship you what do you get me if a woman is heavyset sometime that says absorb her her toes are you there if a woman is skinny that's where the devil works with the high heel so you skin here you big on the top and you peek on the bottom when you pass a man does this damn are you there you caused that you wear your clothes so tight and you put her head on and you're causing problems sister you're gonna find yourself you have to answer for adultery oh my god you can't help the way you are built but just go around and stay the way god did what don't try to make yourself something that you are water because when you do that you are giving a different shape you are perverted by the devil you are designed by the devil hallelujah brother branham then i do some of these women that put on little strap under them to throw their self out don't even look like a human being they got a purpose in doing that that is what that's why do you call you you hear people telling you you look sexy it's not a compliment it is telling you you are provoking amen ungodly a woman where ever so many clothes and try to make herself look like something she's not everybody follow me why women are actually that way it's some kind of hollywood stuff and the devil and the devil spirit get on them women to make them try to do what attract the attention of men through what do you see what you're doing a woman breast was giving her for what that's exactly right the woman is right in the primitive line but she is lying right i have more respect for that for a woman like that that is the way her mother raised her that's the way they don't pay any attention to it the baby nurse who had out like a madonna picture that you see and if people will only get their mind set like that it will be water you were given that to nurse the baby not to cause men to follow after you everybody clear so far so by that we can see that this is wrong about here brother branham continue oh woman just pass your more than thinking of dress pass your modern thinking before you go out on the street before men you young women you old women before you go out on the street with your clothes so what pushed out water and in the water so it is not only responsible for the dress but for the shoes you put the shoes that give you a certain shape now you destroy your womanhood because the woman was controlling by beauty by sex and by what shape or form the devil is designing you here by high heel and by wearing certain trap that tighten you up do you follow me and he's designing you by beauty with all the makeup and everything to bring a man for sex are you there i'm not critical i'm your brother i stand between the living and dead and realize what i'm saying before you enter out in other words before you go out and know that your body is what because you caused problem at the beginning it's sacred order and sacred curse that god has given you before you enter the street dress like that pass your mind through water a thinking woman's filter and let it remember that whosoever look upon you to last after you you have committed water adultery with him already remember that who brother branham is saying before you leave your home when you dress sister remember one thing if you cause a man to last after you because of the heel you put that's gonna make you twist on your walk and gonna make you provoke men remember that you're gonna be responsible for that everybody clear so far look at the modern one today lead a skin down dress that every water she can't move without what brother say every movement you make in you are sinning how many sin did you do a day walking tipping down the street with all the makeup and cosmetic of matt factor can put on her nearly fixing her hair like someone some little girl wearing a little skirt just above her remember that she if she got any at all but you look at her she is what satan knows how to do it he is the author of what that type of beauty not any beauty the beauty you were born with god give it to you but this beauty that the people call sexy that's what satan is responsible for it because that type of feud which results in what you will find yourself in a hotel you say i'm married wait in the day of judgment where is the man that took that woman and made the old dirty looking clothes to uh that they put on to push them out in one way and the other and misfit them said what did they do it for what do they wear those kind of things for cause you want men to look at you and no other way to prove it i don't mean to say you have to dress like something other into antique box but you can be more like a water but random didn't say you must go to goodwill women has become dented and so forth more water they dress themselves more attractive where you the women used to wear great water not tight and what did you get the stuff that sister don't have any more sleep you see where it's coming sleep and long water and heat their what that was the original plan of god to conceal heed their body because they didn't want men lasting for them they live for one husband and choose them for wife today the women pour out themselves into little clothes and immorality is on such a moving rampage beyond anything you see a woman wearing a pen you wondering how did she put that paint on and how is she gonna take that out because it's so tight that the skin is on the outside and we call that sexy and it is what wrong i'm gonna head to the airport now here she come up with a lot of paint something that she's not a modern brad watch your face and he run from her scare you to death take all the stuff off of her and so is the church with a big painted front a complete theological max factor buff has a beautiful false face on them man-made beauty and not god-made beauty no such character he needed if i wonder if our women realize that is the reason i want this step to go out that you must not put we want you to be pretty but we want you to be natural we don't want you to be some of these pretty women dunk in them in the wash tub and while and wash them up they might look a little different and dress them like they should be dressed wow everything they have on the top is different they have cut their hair jezebel they put in them little girls dresses they put short bikini and ever you call it on them they put paint and rouge and all them kind of things to make them something that they are what it's a designer but through scientific they have been able to do what to achieve it the devil is achieving that do you know there is more spent for what cosmetic for women than there is in the united states twice and three times as much as pen for food to live on prove that's right for what cosmetics we are resting our experience on a bunch of nose and then tick stick the glamour of hollywood in have women on up on the pulpit with clothes so tight and sexy looking dancing in the spirit and don't know what kind of spirit it is anybody clear brother problem but dilla did you notice she know that samson had a power she didn't know where that power laid she could not tell what the power was but there was some great power that simpson possessed and she wanted to find out as delilah she kept wooing samson after her water and she dressed herself her water and she walked before him and t-heed like some of these little teenagers of the day and want to just act like something another a strip tease trying to who who what you're doing you're going to be responsible for it only way you can receive life is through a birth it's messy but it makes life people try to dodge it they don't want to wash the manicure off their faces what is you call that stuff not manuka or mascara and whatever it is that crazy i don't know that crazy stuff you look at a whole lot prettier if you would not wear them if you shall try another act twofold it shall beat all the max factor ever could make i tell you that you shall just try and lure that if he shall be an eternal beauty a sweet and quiet spirit that is what this woman had that was esther head when she came before the that's the reason she overrun the other girls because she came she come adorning herself with a sweet spirit before him everybody clear that sexy looking is wrong sister that's sexy looking is wrong sister hail it's not here it's high here but it's even spike it is not the problem is not spike the problem is the height they might be look big but the problem is the height they might look thick the problem is height all of this stop it stop it sister stop it anybody clear stop it she obeyed everything but one word everything but one word penelope costa women can be saved sanctify and fill with their holy spirit then what absolutely men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded and she felt it as i said she would have went on in on the highway all right but she felt to listen telling her what was what the prophet was warning her she didn't listen and she fell she fell maybe today she's twisting down the street some little half-dressed woman sending more soul to hell than all the bar room in the country she shall twist herself down the street thinking she's something they have stretched out their neck wanton dancing that means twisting as they go in the last day fulfilling water and that's even water when you wear a high heel you wear tight graces you are fulfilling the scripture and you don't even know what scripture you're fulfilling a wrong spirit roman 12 1 i beseech you brethren brethren by the mercies of god that you present your water a living water which is water and water which is a water and be not confirmed to this water but be transformed by the water that he may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god present your body as a living sacrifice don't present your body as a lustful experience sister avoid the high heel it is giving you a temporary shape that is causing lust you're going to be twisting you're going to be causing problems and you're going to be responsible for it because you didn't pay attention that you were fulfilling the scripture let's stand there [Applause] the body of a woman is not a body to play with it's a sacred body you need to be
