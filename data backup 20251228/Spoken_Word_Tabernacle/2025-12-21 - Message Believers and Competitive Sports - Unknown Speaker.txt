[music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want to hear you went to a sport or games. You should be away from sport &gt;&gt; in this church. You can do your you can go with for your exercise &gt;&gt; and you dress a certain way with pants and everything. You can shoot the ball and everything but never get into competition. &gt;&gt; Never play for competition. &gt;&gt; You play to to sweat like brother Steven sweat on the pulpit right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can run. There is nothing wrong with it. Amen. But not for competition and begin to think about going to NFL, going to NBA, then become millionaire, then give mommy and daddy your money. Most of the time the problem start from the parent &gt;&gt; because the delinquency is coming from the parent. &gt;&gt; The parent are looking for money so quick. So they're pushing the children towards sport, sport, sport, sport, sport. And before you know it, you find believer in this message with children that are progressing in NFL. where they are women, there are all type of stuff going on. Don't don't don't say amen. You can keep quiet. Just say amen. There's no problem with me. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, you can say as long as I have one. Amen. And then we are looking all of that behind money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to teach our children to depend on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; God can bless you many ways, &gt;&gt; but you don't get to get into that sport arena, the NCAA and all this kind of stuff because it's going to put you in an environment of women, crazy beer and crazy songs and everything and you will be worshiping the devil. &gt;&gt; I already gave you the quote in this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So parents, keep your children away from sport. &gt;&gt; That's true. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep your children away from sport, &gt;&gt; bodily exercise, profit if not much. &gt;&gt; So go run, lift weight or whatever you want to do in pent and everything but do not get into sport. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we see brother over there NFL and hey, what are you doing in NFL with the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
