Jesus Christ name we pray hallelujah amen amen God bless you Saints you may have your seats we greet you tonight in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ trusting that uh you are doing fine you know only a Wednesday night that's when the devil fights with traffic and things but I'm so thankful that today we didn't have traffic the Lord smiled upon us tonight am but nothing is going to keep us from church some people to to be killed to get a new Bible just to get a Bible I mean for me going through traffic it's that's the little that I can do I won't be able to stand with the people in the Dark Ages that were killed for for coming together I may not be able to stand with those they have a greater testimony the only thing I can do is to sit in my car and go through the traffic Hallelujah that's the little that I can do praise be to the the Lord amen you may uh stand and let us read the Bible at this time amen uh we're going to read from Genesis chapter 5 if you have your Bibles Genesis chapter 5 and we we'll start reading from verse 21 amen if you have it you can say amen amen Genesis is the first book in the Bible you all of you know that but we have little ones in church and they have to hear it also right Genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and Enoch lived 60 and5 years yes sir and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he had begat Methuselah 300 years and beget sons and daughters and all of the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him amen you may have your seats amen for a little time tonight we want to talk about the patriarch Enoch and for our subtitle it's our walk into translation amen amen Enoch is indeed a patriarch yes the prophet spent a lot of time talking about the patriarch Abraham that's right because a patriarch is the uh he's the the one that begins that that starts something he like a Pioneer that becomes a patriarch you know or a family Elder so Abraham was the father of Faith as as you know as Bible readers would call him sir he was he was not the only one with faith but he he reached a certain level where God said you're going to be the father of Nations up until now we are called the Sons of Abraham and he was a patriarch because everyone traces their roots to Abraham that's right the the Muslims they say Abraham is our father the Christians they say Abraham is our father the Jews they say Abraham is our father so Abraham that makes Abraham a patriarch and his wife was a matriarch amen sometimes we talk about Patriarchs but we forget about matriarchs they are there in the Bible because God was very specific he says you will have a son by your wife Sarah it was not just random God was very specific when God called Abraham he also called Sarah so so so we are thankful for the great women of of the Bible who knew how to support their husband in the ministry and tonight we are also thankful for the sisters that we have in church you know people think that you know we as as message Believers we look down upon women no we are the people that respect women more than any other group in the world we respect women to an extent that we don't want them to go naked we don't we respect women right that we are willing to work five six jobs just to keep them at home so that they can enjoy and then don't have to worry about bills so if you are married by a Christian you are married to royalty hallelujah praise be to God we respect women that's why we believe in making a vow to one and forsake all others we are the only only people that makes that vow Hallelujah up until death so if somebody says message believers they don't respect women he doesn't know what he's talking about they he does not know we are the only institution that does not administer divorce we do not administer divorce brother Steven is a marriage officer that's it is not a divorce [Applause] officer Hallelujah am this is just so that I can warm up the sisters to get their amens I like I like the sisters in this church because they they they say amens praise be to God so Brothers make sure that the sisters are not leading with the amens so Enoch was walked with God until he was not that's right so you when you walk with God yes sir you are walking towards a certain goal you are not just walking with God you there's a Target when God is working with you it's a journey it's it's it's not it's not like a dog walk where you're just walking around you know where just loitering around when you are walking with God you are going somewhere he may not tell you where he's taking you to but he's taking you somewhere that's why he said unto Abraham leave thy mother and thy father yes sir and go to a place yes that I shall show you he did not know where that place was but he knew that God was taking him somewhere yes my brother and tonight we know that God is taking us somewhere amen hallelujah yes sir we are on a journey to go somewhere friend my brother and by the grace of God by the opening of the seals yes sir we have an idea what that somewh is amen although we know that eye has not seen Ear Has Not Heard sir what God has in store to Those whom he love that's right praise be to God Amen so when you walk with God you are going somewhere amen amen amen so in the verse that we read Enoch was going somewhere somewhere yes my brother and the end of Enoch's Journey take your time was translation Hallelujah yes my brother that was the end of Enoch's Journey amen right yes sir so this is God he calls Enoch yes sir and he takes him on this journey yes sir to translation amen amen amen is that right we know what you're talking about we know what you're preaching about praise be to God Amen so you see that God was taking Enoch towards translation amen so when God called Abraham he had a place where he was taking him to yes sir so every one of us when God called us calls us he is taking us somewhere God does not take people call people in vain and they just are sitting around and not doing something when God calls you he takes you somewhere you might not know but he's got a plan for you and God has a plan for every specific person that CA amen he's got a plan for brother Greg right here he's got a plan for brother Seth plan for brother Kelly God takes us on a journey and God loves to walk he would come in the cool of the evening time and he'd come in the garden and he would walk with Adam amen because God loves to walk with his people yes my brother Hallelujah yes my brother so so so so Enoch was the seventh from Adam yes my brother how many knows that according to the genealogies of the Bible yes sir and we remember when Adam when when when men fell when Adam fell the Bible says that be the day that you shall eat you shall surely die that's right so everyone began to die and when you read from chapter five in from chapter one it tells you that Seth lived this these many years and he died that's and Enos lived 1200 years and died that's and Canaan lived uh for for these many years and died and Halo and Jared lived all these years and died but when you come to Enoch there's a change in the pattern Hallelujah when it comes to Enoch the 7th the pattern changes God takes a corner because remember God is a builder and he's a wise master builder and he's not building a straight line he's building a building so you you have to watch the corners when God takes a corner and Enoch had so much faith that he broke precedent Enoch had so much faith that he broke the pattern of his family and I believe tonight that by Faith by faith even if you say my grandfather had asthma my father had as you can break the pattern by [Applause] faith Hallelujah you can say oh my grandmother had temper my mother had temper but by faith I overcame that temper Faith breaks patterns that's why I don't believe in inheriting diseases I don't believe in inheriting problems I believe in inheriting Solutions Hallelujah the devil will tell you oh your grandfather did this all the negative things but he would never come to you and tell you your dead your grandfather was a great entrepreneur so you are going to be a great entrepreneur sir the devil never tell you your father was a great peaceful man so you're going to be a peaceful man he comes with the negatives and because people believe it it they accept it then they live in that but Enoch was different even if God said You shall die but Enoch defied Hallelujah when you have faith you can set a new president preach preach my brother Hallelujah because everyone else that was dying was operating at a certain level fath that's exactly right that's exactly the lutherans were operating at a certain level of Faith right John Wesley was at a level of Faith Columba was at a level of Faith but when Elijah comes he brings a new level of faith that breaks the CT of death that's why we cannot do the things the same way the denominations are doing because we have got a higher calling we have got a higher mission to accomplish we cannot be you know repeating the same messages that the denominations are preaching we cannot be running after the same things the denominations are running after because when Israel was moving yes sir God says this is Mount SE and it belongs to Esau and that is not your mountain and I not going to give you that mountain that is not your inheritance that's EXA that's exactly so you have to know your inheritance and what is not your inheritance because remember Abraham had many sons that's right but the Bible says he gave them gifts and he sent them away but unto Isaac he gave him all his [Applause] substance and when when brother Bram walked into or Robert's office remember I told you before he says Lord you gave him this highrise building you gave him all these wonderful things I only have one sister who my secretary she's an old type writer and the Holy Ghost said look up I am your portion this is not your Mountain I am your [Applause] portion sometimes you know we get carried away by things that we see but that may not be your God has a better portion for you up there God has a better price for you up there Hallelujah don't get envious when you see the unbelievers driving around with super cars and say oh Lord if only I can have a Lamborghini that may not be your portion my brother maybe your portion is playing the guitar and God gives you a price up [Applause] there am am am so God is the portion of his people he says he says Abraham I'm your exceedingly great reward I am your portion and your exceedingly great reward which means our portion in this age yes sir is God our portion is God it's the Holy Ghost it's the word because the word and the Holy Ghost is the same thing the Pentecostals they have their portion the hypocrit the Jesus Christ said they receive their reward in food but we have a different price than the Hypocrites how many knows that and that's why our life and our conduct is different because we have got a different calling Hallelujah I see people trying to run after the Pentecostals that's not your portion we are egos friends now Genesis chapter 17 verse1 let's let's open that that scripture yes brother when is the night of teaching yes take your time how many love teaching amen amen amen teaching stabilizes the church as I was reading a a quote with brother saying I want to have a teaching Revival says all all you allers how many remembers when we used to take the book of Exodus and would spend weeks on it amen if you look at brother bram's meetings it was teaching if you look at the great you know Hebrews series The Prophet was teaching and that's a wonderful message amen you think about adoption he was teaching on Ephesians you think about the seals he was teaching amen you see that was the climax of of of his ministry we love healing campaigns and we will continue to have them out there when we are trying to to to win souls right but when we come here we still pray for the sick but that's not the main event friends we still healing is part of the word we cannot take healing out of the word the prophet says healing is the children's bread but now you cannot give your child inheritance for bread only when you if you are a wealthy father you can't say my children I'm Only leing You bread friends you give them your estate Hallelujah you give them your stocks you give them your l you give them your estat and then you give them bread it's part of the package but the children cannot just be satisfied by [Music] Bread you said you have to have a balance that's right because having a balance that's why you see Priests of oath they were ordained by God to to have the right kind of measurements because measurements bring balance am God was very specific he would say an e of flour that's right a heel of oil that's right right you you cannot put 16 teaspoons of salt in a cake uh uhuh uh it's no longer a cake we put 10 cups of flour and a pinch of sugar no are you going to have a cake no are they the correct ingredients yes are they the right quantities no so someone will say no brother it's in the word yes it's in the word but it has to be placed right you have to place it right pre pre is is this a microphone I'm going to put it here take your time goad micone pre preach the microphone has to be placed right right friends yes sir you can have a a guitar a microphone but if you don't place them right that's right no Harmony take your time take your time preach imagine you walk into a home and you're in the kitchen there you find toilet paper in the kitchen something is wrong friends preach my brother preach you say Pastor can you pray for that sister I think she's going through a lot that's exactly because things are not properly placed amen amen amen amen but but when the right teaching comes that's right places positionally places everything there's a place for musicians there's a placing of deacons there's a placing of evangelist there's a placing of of of gift that's exactly right Hallelujah we want gifts in the church but they have to be placed right amen amen amen amen amen preach but when you have somebody taking one hour trying to speak in a tongue it's not properly placed the Holy Ghost would just say something and then we write it down the elders who know what it is in its right place yes brother Hallelujah so Genesis 17 God says yes sir when Abraham was 90 years old the Bible says the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the Lord Almighty walk before me am and be thou perfect so so when you walk with God you are going towards something so God to Abraham he says after you walk with me you are going to be perfect remember we we we told you what Perfection is perfection is maturity because you cannot you cannot have it harest something unless it's perfect or it's mature but when something is mature then you can put it in the Garner so God said unto Abraham walk before me or walk with me in other words then you shall be perfect so to reach Perfection we have to walk with God so now now remember sir the old Saints the Bible says that they without us that's right could not be made what perfect so which means we have the promise of coming to Perfection Hallelujah we have the promise of coming into Perfection oh my because our Perfection it triggers the resurrection because when we meet the Lord in the air sir but we cannot hinder those that are asleep that's right but that process for it to come we which are life and remain have to come to Perfection but for us to come to Perfection we have to walk with God now God is a spirit and they that walk with God they walk in the spirit and the Bible says the sons of God are led by the spirit of God now if we are walking in the flesh we are not walking with God if we have to walk with God we have to walk in the spirit so when we say Enoch walked with God we are saying Enoch was working in the [Applause] spirit yes of course there are times when God would physically come God can do that the prophet says he loves to manifest himself to his people that's exactly but if but but if you want to read it correctly it's working in the spirit so when you see children's book you you know walking and and and and God walking that's fine you know but but really when you walk in the word when you walk in the spirit of God then you are walking with God yes my brother so so so Abraham was being called to a walk of Faith yes my brother for him to be perfect amen because remember one thing I'll tell you is this we are men of the Flesh and we have natural senses but God says if you want to be perfect you have to walk in the spirit and bypass your senses so Enoch worked with God now let's continue reading here the prophet talks about I'm laying it Foundation yes in the message testimony says and all of a sudden something happened it seems like in every principle I was a young boy again I didn't know what mentally taken place or what it was and I looked standing in front of her and there in front of me and they stood just the way she was when I married her so this Prophet had this experience sir he would G to have you know a memorial of his marriage a honeymoon trip right you know anniversary trip so he was walking in this forest and he said he caus it a virgin Forest now all these things are symbols friends yes my brother you know he was walking in this virgin forest and a voice said to him yes sir do you want to walk with me Hallelujah and he says of course Lord it would be my greatest pleasure to walk with you and remember when God comes Hallelujah when God would come to Adam he would come as a voice that's exactly because Adam says I heard your voice walking so when God is walking it's a voice so when we are walking in Christ we become walking voices of God so the voice comes to the prophet am and he says don't you want to walk with me because he was in another way another you know adopted son that's exactly and God says I want to walk with you because God always long to walk with his people and he says and and and and and the prophet was walking with God in that forest and tears were going down his beard Hallelujah and as he was walking says something happened says I don't know what it isad it was as if I was young again and my wife was young again Hallelujah he was showing us the mystery yes sir that this bride yes because remember the wife of a minister or of a prophet sometimes they typify the church how many knows that if if you read Ezekiel if you read all the prophets of old God would even if you H Hosea God said to Hosea go and marry a prostitute because it's supposed to be a type how many knows that yes that hosas married GMA that's right a prostitute right because it was supposed to be a type and by by Hosea Maring a prostitute he was declaring the word of the Lord now the prophets they they declare the word by speech but they also declare the word by their life brother Hallelujah brother because the the message and the messenger out one yes my brother take your time take your time so when when HOSA was marrying GMA yes that was the word that was the word of [Applause] God when God said to to to Jeremiah your wife is going to die don't weep that was the word of the Lord when Moses married Zora that was the word of the [Applause] Lord when Jonah was in the belly of the fish that was the word of the Lord the life of the Prophet is thus says the [Applause] Lord hallelujah praise be to God glory I mean that's a bit deep but it's fine some people say brother you're becoming a fanatic but that's Bible friends that's the Bible amen amen amen amen amen because you see because prophets of God yes yes remember there was a brother Bram prayed for two boys one got healed that's right and the other one was sick and dying and he saw a vision and the prophet go and the angel told him for this one to leave you have to eat this that's exactly right by eating that it was a symbolic that this one will Al be healed that's exactly so prophets of God they also leave the word of God that's exactly right that's why yes we emulate the prophets 100% but there's a difference between me and the prophet exactly the prophet could take a cigarette and the angel would take it from his hands right if I take a cigarette nobody will take it out of my hands I am not a prophet [Applause] PR Hallelujah when I came to the message I received Christ yes sir that's when I started to sanctify my life the Holy Ghost working through me but a prophet is Sanctified from birth that's exactly yes brother God sanctifies a prophet from birth you don't you don't you don't you don't come out of nowhere and say well God has called me to be a prophet I've stopped playing with women that doesn't work like that if God makes you a prophet he cleanses you from birth [Applause] preach Hallelujah that's why I don't believe this modern day prophets someone just comes from from prison says I'm now a prophet no it doesn't work like that GL to God Hallelujah now the word Enoch means dedicated am it means trained Hallelujah Enoch for him to come into translation he had to be dedicated he had to be dedicated and he had to be trained yes sir Journey pre my brother preach and he had to be what now who trains the son before adoption go ahead my brother go ahead go ahead who trains the son before adoption it's the tutor which is the Holy Ghost so Enoch had to walk with the Holy Ghost am from here to here hallelujah he had to be under training and he had to be dedicated Enoch was not a man who was coming to church every once in six months Enoch was was not a man who would open his Bible once a year no Enoch was dedicated Enoch was trained by the Holy Ghost AM was not a man who say oh I don't know what happened I ended up going to the Club no no no no no you know was trained by the power of the Holy Ghost yes my brother yes my brother so for us to come into translation which is the rapture goad which is our Perfection sir the Holy Ghost has to take us through the same Journey friend yes my brother because remember let's go back to Genesis chapter 5 now I may not be able to finish but we don't preach to finish part two my brother we preach to speak the truth the prophet was I was listening to the message the Rapture the prophet says I've got 10 pages left you We Don't Preach to finish now the Bible says now Enoch lived 65 years yes sir and he begat Methuselah Hallelujah yes sir so Enoch was just a manh and he beget what methus right right Hallelujah yes sir so so Enoch yes sir now I want you to I want you to stay with me very closely yes my brother Enoch was the son of Jared who was the son of you know Mahal Enos and so on and Adam so Enoch was in the right lineage and Enoch had had a seat of eternal life amen hallelujah brother because for because when you come to the world even before you you have that seed of eternal life in sh yes you have that city of eternal life because if you are Eternal you always Eternal am am but what happens with Enoch when he when he was 65 years old go ahead now he beges methus right which was a type of the new birth because methos was the eighth because Enoch was the seventh that's right so so so methus being the eth because remember eight is the number of new begin yes sir so when when when when Enoch be methus which is the eighth from Adam that was a type of Enoch becoming Born Again standing again yes Hallelujah so when Enoch was born again he started to walk with God because the prophet says when you are born again that is not the end of the journey that's the beginning of the journey so when Enoch be meus that was his new birth in a type then he walked with God for 300 years yes my brother until he was not found and this translation hallelujah how many knows that the Rapture is is is is is is the translation that's exactly and how many knows that the Rapture is the adoption Naturally Speaking because the Bible says in the Book of Romans that we are growing we are Longing To Be clothed because remember we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons so we are adopted spiritually and we are also adopted naturally which is the rapture when God takes us to himself but when we are here the spirit is crying out AB father exactly right so methus yes sir the name methus means Hallelujah take your time let me see if I have it here on the slide now meth means you know when when when he after you know when he's gone then it comes right so so methus was speaking of the coming judgment Hallelujah yes sir because remember Enoch was a prophet right was the prophet in the message the Rapture he says the first Rapture was Enoch and the word of the Lord came to Enoch that's right and and Jude said right Enoch prophesied that's exactly right of these men that's exactly Enoch was a prophet that's exactly so when he be methus he CAU a revelation right because remember Enoch was living in a day that is similar to our day that's exactly right because God would not have sent no yes sir and the flat if the people were not Wicked that's it exactly right but the Bible says that the Earth was wickeded that's right and there was violence that's right and people were eating and drinking that's right but it did not start in the days of Noah no sir it started in the days of Enoch amen and then Noah was the one that brought the Judgment that's exactly right how many knows that that's exactly right because the prophet says Noah was a type of the church that went through the tribulation how many knows that sir but Enoch was the type of the Bride the rapt but Enoch was living in an evil time that's right how do we know you said brother Aron how do we know that because God sent judgment and why would Enoch let's go to Jude chapter one yes my brother yes why would Enoch prophesy of evil man yes my brother if you go to Jude chapter one yes sir right the Bible talks about you know Jude is the second book from Revelations right yes sir one chapter yeah chapter one which verse is that someone can shout it shout it to me verse 14 verse 14 right thank you brother and Enoch also the seventh from Adam you know Jude had to specify you know other people they would say so and so but they he had to be very specific the seven from Adam prophet side of these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints so so Enoch was preaching the second coming of Christ because remember Enoch was a type of the later day messageer of the hour and Enoch had to preach the coming of the Lord so here Jude is saying Enoch prophesied behold the Lord cometh he's preaching the coming of the Lord because remember the Bible it spoke it spoke more of the second coming of Christ than the first coming of Christ amen that's why the seals are very very important because they are talking about the coming of the Lord amen amen amen amen am saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints yes sir to execute judgment yes sir upon all the Earth and to convince all that are ungodly among them all of ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed Hallelujah so Enoch was talking about the coming of the Lord and he was talking about judgment yes sir because Enoch was living in an evil time right but although Enoch was living in an evil time he was dedicated he was trained he was the type of the Church of the Bride that would come in the last days that though we are living in laia that's right yet will be dedicated unto the Lord that's right yes my brother yes my brother Hallelujah yes sir praise be to God Amen can I can I take can I go slowly uhhuh take your time now the prophet says I was born under a Nazarite birth that's exactly of course it's just a little different and so many things I do in my life I wouldn't ask other people to do it goad brother I wouldn't say they had to do it be Christians because it was different all together the prophet was a Enoch was a type of the Prophet or the prophet was the antitype of Enoch right and he is coming now as the as the seventh angel that's right Hallelujah yes sir was Enoch we can type him as the bright but we can also type him as Elijah the prophet our Prophet brother Brenham right yes and he says I was born under a Nazarite vow that's right what is the na it's a vow of Holiness right so he says I don't I wouldn't ask other people to do it so Enoch had brothers and sisters that were going to church but Enoch's walk was a little bit different yes brother but Enoch did not ask other people to be like him Enoch had a revelation that he was different preach my brother preach amen and the prophet says you see and her hair is given to not a hat lady her hair is given the Bible said right shows she's a Nazarite unto the Lord that's right says the sisters the reason why they keep their long hair it's a nazer right vow unto the Lord because they remember our sisters oh praise be to God in the preview of the Bride the prophet says I saw the ladies and I could see their hair long and they Walking In step like onwards Christian Soldier and they were going up into heaven am but there was another church which was decked in Gray and they had fig leaves they covering they part with fig leaves and the prophet says they were dancing to rock and roll they were dancing to f a POA Hallelujah you didn't think I was going to say that I said it my brother they were temping to room yes to rock and draw that's right but this other bride was walking in Step yes Hallelujah yes yes he never promised Hallelujah yes my brother they were singing the Christian songs going up to heaven that's right but this other one in one quote the prophet says I saw a being led by a witch ahuh yes sir Hallelujah yes my brother anyway that's a different subject because remember Jezebel was a witch how many knows that she Bewitched the people right because Jezebel Bewitched the people because remember there were three things that destroyed the church that's right Jezebel nikans and bism that's right how many knows that that's right praise be to God yes sir so a witch is not what you see in in in you know in children's books of somebody on on on on his sck no it's a foolish Galatians who has Beed you that's witchcraft when you are taken from the word amen amen and you are plunged into creat that's right that spiritual witchcraft that's exactly right that's exactly don't be afraid of the village that's not going to send you to Hell Beware of the Witchcraft that Bewitched the Galatians amen amen amen amen don't say oh I don't go to The Village at night during the day because they will see me with my card go to the Village my brother you are a Christian yes yes yes it's people that are not properly taught that's exactly right oh she was manifesting a witchcraft friends that's childish very very Hallelujah before you yes sir amen preach it God Hallelujah the prophet says and he said how glorious would that little branch that escapes this isn't the flashing red light uhhuh these things it will be Holiness unto the Lord amen because remember Enoch we said he was dedicated yes sir and he was living in Holiness now now remember in the in the in the Bible the priests they had a golden uh they they had a Golden Crown right right right I I think I have a picture just just it's just a symbolic it's not the way it was but just so that you'd understand you know God would tell them H you know take take take a golden plate that's right right and write Holiness unto the Lord that's right and tie it with a blue cord now you are properly taught I'm sure you know these things right and the high priest the priest would wear this upon his forehead that's exactly right because remember the Holy Ghost yes also affects your forehead because your forehead is a of your Revelation that's why the mark of the beast the Bible says it's on your forehead right what what you are doing with your hands right because your Revelation affects your life that's exactly right right it's a mark you receive on your forehead that's right but it's also on your hand it's your daytoday life and remember also the Holy Ghost affects your what because in Ezekiel chapter 9 right those that were sealed uhhuh the angel with the rightous inor sir he was writing something yes sir Hallelujah so we also have a writing Upon Our foreheads that's right but it's a spiritual writing amen amen and the priest had a writing that said Holiness unto the Lord yes sir and a true revelation of Christ that's right brings Holiness automatically my friend automatically you cannot say oh brother we just preached deep things and people are living in fness the Holy Ghost brings Holiness amen holy hly it's a holy walk hlyh Hallelujah so Enoch was dedicated unto the Lord and we as the Bride As the church we also have our vow of the Nazarite of Holiness that's right and we have Holiness Upon Our forehead like the high priest yes my brother yes my brother the prophet would somebody would come in the prayer line the prophet says I feel a welcoming Spirit uhhuh you are a Christian that's exactly right because they a light around them you may not see it but you have a light around you if you are a Christian amen amen and the prophet will say you're an unbeliever there's Darkness around you or you are dying there's Darkness you're shattered to death right how many knows that yes now let me keep R rushing here my time is running now Enoch had a revelation and let's see what Enoch's Revelation was the prophet says in the message question and answers yes sir says just like the pyramid m mhm as Enoch built right so Enoch was the servant uhhuh and in know the message and he he he put his message in a pyramid in a pyramid so Enoch had a pyramid message Enoch was the seventh and he had a pyramid [Music] message Hallelujah yes so we as the Bride As the church we also have a pyramid message amen which is the Capstone The Headstone right amen because Enoch also knew that in Blasphemous names right but when once you have all these virtues then Christ kepts up your virtues with Divine love amen how many knows that amen the true teaching of of stat of a perfect man not the movement the true teaching of it friend uhhuh once you draw the pyramid some people start to preach my brother preach my brother hallelujah amen now we as Saints now the the high priest he was given this golden plate yes sir but we as the church the prophet says that the Bible says that we receive a crown of life amen how many knows that of course when we get over Yonder we receive a crown of life but you cannot receive a crown there if you don't have a life here because it's a crown of life amen amen you got to have a life amen because the Bible says in the book of Hebrews yes sir that Enoch by faith Enoch now the word faith means Revelation amen so Enoch had a revelation that's right that's why he was putting it in a pyramid that's exactly right Enoch was preaching the pyramid message that's exactly he was preaching the second coming of Christ exactly and he was preaching judgment that's right so Enoch by faith in other words by Revelation because faith is a revelation that's right worked with God Amen and Paul says uhhuh for before his translation that's right he had the testimony yes my brother he had a testimony that's right that he pleased God Amen before he translation amen he had a what a testimony a testimony that he pleased God that he pleased God Amen because remember we Are Witnesses how many knows that yes sir how many knows that we as Christians Christ said t in Jerusalem from the promise of my father and you shall be Witnesses unto me in Judea in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth yes sir I'm I apologize I'm going very slowly today that's fine cuz I want the teaching to sink in my brother now for you to be a witness right you have to have a testimony that's exactly right you cannot be a witness without a testimony testimony of so before you are translated you have to have a testimony because Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God that's right and without faith it is impossible to please God that's right and what is faith faith is a revelation that's right so inoc it is a revelation that pleased God Amen amen amen amen amen so we have many people today that call themselves Christians go ahead now but only a few will please God that's exactly because God is looking for a specific testimony amen he is looking for a specific Revelation that's right and it's a pyramid Revelation that's right Hallelujah yes my brother when we say a pyramid we are not talking about just one sermon we're talking about the whole message of the hour whole message of the hour that's the pyramid Christ yes sir yes sir yes my brother so Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God Amen because remember first John says that which was from the beginning right that which our hands have handled which our eyes have seen this is what we declare unto you yes sir in other words they the testimony that listen we handled it we touched it we felt it but you know what we are declaring that unto you Amen in other words you have no right to witness unto Christ unless you have met him amen amen because remember friends sir I will take you back to this okay to bring forth methus as a type right and then he had to walk with God until he was adopted that's right now the Holy Ghost you receive the Holy Ghost it quickens the life that is already existing in that's exactly right but you cannot say well I'm adoped all I only just believe and then that's it the prophet says that that's a Baptist Doctrine how many knows that he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed amen so you have to believe God Amen yes the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word of your day that's right but you for you to that but the the faith has to be accepted by God that's exactly because the prophet says Abraham believed God right and it was given to him for righteousness that's right but God gave him the sign of circumcision to show that he accepted his faith that's exactly right because you cannot make the scriptures contradict one another no sir no sir no sir no sir what the prophet says it's like someone says I believe Jesus if you ask people today how many believe Jesus the whole world will say that are they saved uhh that's the question today you have people who say I believe the message do they all have the Holy Ghost you have to have the Holy Ghost since you believe amen amen amen amen amen amen and today we are we are taking the Holy Ghost and making it something for the Youth Camp yeah the Holy Ghost is for the church am it's not for the Youth Camp friends pre my brother the Holy Ghost is for everyone it's for the young it's for the old it's for the the grandfathers and the grandmothers the Holy Ghost is for the whole church glory to God that's why people are dying that's exactly why ah I'm paying my I'm paying money to send my my kid to Camp what about you you also need to be in Camp Glory oh Pastor pray for my son he wants to receive the Holy Ghost what about you sister have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed this message this message Hallelujah yes sir you have to receive the Holy Ghost you have to have an experience with God my brother my brother and it's not a tongue it's not a tongue no a tongue is just a gift that's any hypocrite can have a tongue that's right the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost a tongue is a tongue these two things are separate that's right that's [Applause] right you can go into a a dumpster and find some carets but that doesn't mean you found a [Music] car these things exist in a car but doesn't mean that whenever you see a a c thrown everywhere you have seen a car no you may find caret in cars but not all car seets are cars preach now preach now preach you may you may receive you may speak in tongues when you receive the Holy Ghost right but not everyone who speaks in Tong the Holy Ghost that's right that's right that's right that's right that's right Hallelujah you have to show by the life that you are living because we have to go into translation friends because remember yes Sir Isaac was born by the promise that's right ishma and Isaac were both sons of Abraham but Isaac was born by the promise that's right and our promise tonight is the promise of the rapture right and friends we are losing our God preach my brother people are chasing after things some are chasing after money some are chasing after women some are some are doing all kinds of things yes my brother why are we here friends that's it why did God send Elijah friends God sent a prophet so that we can go in the Rapture that's it that's it and let's not forget why we are here we are we are here to be out of here friends oh may God help us tonight people are becoming entertained people are becoming people are becoming I don't know what's coming upon the people my brother what are we doing friends Enoch was was was focused on that message of the pyramid people thought Enoch was losing his mind people thought Enoch was a fanatic but you know what he knew what God has revealed to him that's it do you know what God has revealed to you uhhuh we've become complacent friends until remember the prophet says remember when when when they took the eyes of Samson he began to entertain them that's right when the Holy Ghost leaves the church church becomes entertainment that's exactly right preach now preach entertainment entertainment entertainment where is Christ playing games just have muscles but there's no strength there's no virtue you have got pews nice pews and nice instruments but where is Christ in all of those things that's it that's it the eyes have been taken away that's exactly and who who what is the eyes of the church is the prophet amen amen is the message of the hour am that's why whatever we do we stay with the message we baptize according to the message we marry by the message we sing by the message because the message is the eyes of the [Laughter] church amen once you remove the prophet that's it you are blind blind blind oh I don't like brother Bram you don't like the eyes where are you going pre if the blind lead the blind they will fall into a ditch and the ditch is called the pit of Hell amen amen amen amen amen amen but this church Hallelujah God has given us eyes to see yes my brother he has given us the eyes South yes my brother W Hallelujah yes my brother because the prophet says if you don't repent Bible says I will take out the Candlestick when God takes away the Candlestick that's he is removing the messenger amen you just become a church with no Direction because the Candlestick has been taken out amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah yes my brother praise be to God glory to God this is where we have come friends we have to come back to the message of the hour and we have to come to the main thing to the main line that's that's why the prophet says stay in line stay in line stay in line stay in Hallelujah yes my brother where is thy strength going or Samson uhhuh and remember when when matthus died Bible scholars know this you Brothers know this that's when the flood came that's right because methus lived 969 years and methusa was the longest living man that's exactly it was showing God's longsuffering that's it but you know what scoffers will come right say ever since the days of his pyramids what came about that ever since Enoch's prophecies says the Lord is going to come we've been here for all these years uhhuh that's why they were scoffing Noah that's ex they saying you are a son a grandson of of of of of of of of Enoch we know you people you are branhamites you are fanatics but they didn't know that it was the longsuffering of God Amen that's why methusa lived long amen because Adam God was going to send judgment after methos because methosa almost lived a thousand years ex but God could not break his word no sir because it says the day that you shall eat you shall die and ever since there's no man that has lived a thousand years the Millennium is when we are for the first time in known history Hallelujah we will be living a thousand years and sister Roberts will making cupcakes in the Millennium [Applause] friends Hallelujah yes and sister Trish will be making

got to make something come up with something go on YouTube find some recipes make some cupcakes then you start to say hey the brother say oh sweetheart oh that's new it's the cupcakes yes yes my brother cook yes sir I I have to come to a stopping point now let's go back to our chap I'm going to take Touch One Last point and then we close I'm I cannot finish this and I don't intend to finish it We Don't Preach to finish the Bible says and Enoch walked with God verse 22 Genesis 5:22 and Enoch walked with God after he beget Methuselah yes sir 300 years MH and beget Sons and daugh which means that Enoch was working with God Amen but it was not something extreme like oh he was living in a cave with long beard long beard and and bow hair and eating vegetables vegetarian he was living a normal life friend normal life heaven and wife yes sir he was going to Chipotle and and ordering camole and chips yes sir he had Sons and Daughters yes he had a school run he had homeschooling he had to go he had to go to parents meetings Enoch was a normal man when the prophet say oh I'm going to be a man of the mountains God said you become a bomb in your life your wife will leave you how many knows that standing in the Gap yes sir the prophet says you are called higher higher you are like Enoch you're going to live a normal life normal life because remember friends take your time Hallelujah can I have 5 minutes my brother you see when when the seals were open the Bible became a new book that's exactly right it it hit me this week when I you know I kept my Bible in in covers right so this week I just said let me just take out my the covers and you know I've got many prayer requests that I just people give me and I put them there I pray for them put them there you know so I said let me just take out my Bible when I took it out I said oh it looks beautiful and nice it's a new book oh I love my Bible what changed is that I took out the covers yes my brother so when the prophet came go ahead he he he anointed our eyes yes sir and the Bible became a new book he did not write a new Bible no sir he took the covers from our eyes by giving us I house that's it that's it so Enoch lived a man a life like a man with sons and daughters which means that for him to have sons and daughters he had a wife and he would have time with his wife amen amen so so people say Walking with God makes you extreme no how would why would he have sons and daughters if he was not having time with his family friends read between the light he was living a normal life brother normal some people become extreme when they come to the message of the hour preach be simple my brother yes my brother yes my brother buy a chocolate for your wife buy it some roses sometimes don't don't become too ecclesiastical we are we we are message Believers Brothers we have received the message Enoch was a simple man very simple the prophet was a simple man so Walking with God does not make you mysterious preach preach sisters look nicely dress nicely don't become mysterious very mysterious see the hair is like it's like a an an actual ego like a physical ego no when we say ego we are mean

angel was it was it was it was a Sim Elijah was a [Applause] man like passion in other words he felt the same way that you and I feel he was not a ghost he was just a man also he had he had his complexes he had his moments when he was low some days he was high he was also a man but the Bible says but he prayed he prayed but he prayed you are a natural man but when Brother s and so begin to

talking to me that's Pentecostal yeah amen live a simple life this is God speaking I just got a quote recently and I was looking at that and there was a woman that was complaining and the man came to brother Bram because the woman want the man to to to joke with her and all this kind of stuff and he was complaining to brother I say who this is very good for the married people because I have uh uh a folder for married people I keep putting my coat there until the time is ready so we can unfold what is going on there amen am live a simple life but a Christian simple life amen stay dedicated stay trained walk with the spirit and God knows the remaining how can brother BR make a statement that okay if I tell you that in two hours Jesus is coming and it's true some will begin to call their boss and say bye-bye I won't come tomorrow I quit some will say that if you have to work tonight 12:00 p.m. you would say I won come because Jesus is coming but brother brandham say if I know that Jesus is coming do you follow me he will go and prepare the sermon to preach no knowing that Jesus is coming why do you prepare the sermon if Jesus is coming that's why this message please friend when you read the prophet be very careful we made brother Branham speak things he didn't speak because we didn't sit down under the anointing of the spirit and pray to get really what is the spirit trying to say by this messenger what is brother brandham trying to talk really amen am why because you continue to live a Christian life but the main focus is the rapture but even though we looking at the rapture we got to put the kids in bed we got to do this we got to go to work and be good citizen and be good to one another but the man Focus the target is whenever the trumpet s the Jubilee trumpet what do you have to do you drop whatever you doing and you go so if the Rapture catches you at work you're not going to say wait let me go home when I when I'm going to step home I say now go ahead that's movie where they say everybody get on the elevator and say then push the button no wherever you are there will be an elevator there one of these day I will show you your elevator that will take you to the Rapture there will be an elevator coming up and get you to the Rapture I will prove it to you I call it elevator but I will show you what it is amen live a simple life people make this work
