========================================

River boy he really foretold America didn't he now we find out that in doing so then there was a man that had some wisdom about him come up and counsel with the King he said the thing to do is excommunicate her and sent out to the nation and calling all the virgins that there is young virgins and there pick yourself a wife it pleased the king so he sent and he sent out the chambermaids and so forth that went out to to pick all the young virgins that the beautiful women throughout all the kingdoms and the provinces that he was over which was the greatest in the world and when he did it come to this little Jewish girl she was rather a kind of an offcast the caus like the Gentiles you see she was cast off to one side and she had no father and mother Mori her uncle was Raising her and she had to go to qualify and so what they did they had to take these girls in for purification for so many months they had to perfume them and do all kinds of an adorning and fix them all up so they could go before the king that's just about the way the world wants to fix the church today darn it up with the world pattern after the things of the world trying to get more members taking in anything in their Fellowship it's a pitiful thing one organization trying to beat the other and take anything in for a member you might take them in this organization but they'll never come into the fellowship of Christ until they're cleaned up and born again how the spirit of God it's true they might have their name on a book here but not up there the Lamb's Book of Life till it's wrote with the blood of the Lord Jesus all the women they fix themselves all up to look pretty and oh I imagine they got really some looks on them maybe after the first lady and so forth they got themselves all fixed up because is going to appear before the king I think that's about the whole lot's getting the matter with our churches today they're trying to fix themselves all up worldly having worldly entertainment worldly things in it doing things that's all of the world associating in the world thinking they can meet the king God don't care about that he hates that right but we want to act like the world some

move on to the next order of the service God bless you amen so I want to bless the Lord because this testimony has been like almost a month I was supposed to give this testimony but the devil was kind of stopping me I don't know it was really bad but the devil come the devil could not stop me because the Lord kept reminding me by brother kayy brother brother the poly cup we need to testify so my husband and I needed something but we needed uh to have a document before doing what we're supposed to be doing so the do was a very important document and the man was supposed to help us get the document is a is's a big person you cannot see him it's difficult to to even meet him so I told my husband let's pray let's pray and the Lord would do something so we W praying when we W praying I told God I say God when we going to meet this person I want him to say A B C D concerning this power problem so you put this word in his mouth in our favor then I'm going to praise you and after that we want to see the the the person when we I told my husband the person gave the appointment to to my husband to meet him but I told my husband when you going to see the person make sure I'm there I have to be there because he have to repeat those word I ask the Lord for him to say this this in our favor so my husband told me okay I will be going this day are you are you going to be available I'm like yeah I will go so we went we saw the the person then the the person repeat exactly word to word word to word so I thank God I thank God for doing that then after answering like that uh the person told us he's going to do do that for our favor so my husband called him again he say okay I'm waiting on you concerning this situation the person told him you wait but telling him you wait he mentioned like I have to do something very big great I don't have to do just what you ask me I'm going to do exceed like they were preaching exceedingly abundantly so we have to know that God is with us and we have to take him in to take him by his word he's a faithful God God bless you praise God praise God Amen you heard that testimony right so your faith is going up the faith for Paradox you believe Paradox now I was in the at work today and um one of my employee got like a strange pain right in the middle of the procedure boom and start crying so I took here and I check she was crying I say what's going on I just went ahead and lay hand depending on where the person is so I laid hand on her and I prayed for her and I told her you go on the dental chair and we lay the chair down we said what do we want do you want me to call the ambulance or what she say I don't know crying in tears she say I never felt a pain like this so we called the husband husband came and pick him up to the emergency room I'd say within my heart I say when they go there may the found nothing I'm done do you want me to give you the result what do you expect the result to be within few hours she came back to work like nothing happened they didn't find anything came back to work clock in again and continued to work till the end somebody who was in tears went to the emergency room all test nothing they didn't find anything God is real amen the god of the third pole is here amen God is real you need to rise above and Believe The Impossible the incredible the unreasonable one because God is still the same yesterday today and forever amen I will see which direction the spirit will go tonight then I will see whether I need to send you a scripture reading or not because if I get into what I have to get and you don't know the background you can be lost quickly easily and you have to go home and read the scripture and get the story correctly before you understand what I'm saying so I'm going to watch the Holy Spirit how he's moving tonight because brother poar told me he heard a sermon he didn't preach so I felt L like you know what go ahead and take it and preach that sermon so I will watch the spirit if everything goes to the direction then I send you reading if you read it you'll be okay if you don't read it you'll be puzzle because we are things are opening up in a way we never seen it is later than we think if you see what is going on in the Middle East it is preparing everything for Armageddon so let's do what we can quickly and get out of this place and go meet the Lord into the air amen God is preparing his brde the devil is preparing everything and Rome is preparing everybody on one side but one thing we know before any bumps here don't even go home to seek for me you know where I am in the air if you in the air we going to talk there if you stay here you wait for me when I come back in Armageddon to fight the devil again amen amen so brother polycarp will be preaching tonight let's stand forever only believer yes my brother another testimony no problem boost that Fai I want to give my testimony among them the gods amen so today we having a real good morning got to the location to pick up the load real quick they load me up real quick so it's going to be an early day got back in the truck did the paperwork ready to go turn the ignition nothing nothing at all I just hear the computer making all kind of sounds and no lights no nothing says oh no you know the devil's now on you right now oh you're going to have to tow the truck and all this and all that happen but amongst everything that we've been learning and knowing who we are I said Lord tell me what's wrong with this truck let me figure out what it what it is so I pull down the dashboard look behind the computer cuz I just put in a new fan switch in there it wasn't it so he says look at the battery so I went to the battery the first wire I pulled it was loose and I that was it so I just just want to give God the glory and theong s came to me that God is real my God is real amen let's stand only [Music] believe [Music] believe [Music] believe all things are [Music] POS [Music] possible Lord I believe Lord I [Music] believe oh all things are [Music] possible I Lord I believe [Music] all things are [Music] possible [Music] Lord Do You Believe tonight that's the reason why we here if we were not believing we should not even be here amen amen I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord those that are present here and those streaming God bless you I bless the Lord Jesus Christ who have given us this opportunity to be in his house to eat something as I was reading brother Bram brother Bram said the body need to eat if you try to go one day without food second day without food you will you will notice how your body will get weak the more you continue the more the weaker you get so how much more in a spiritual world if you don't eat of the word of God you don't listen to the word of God you are almost dead amen amen God bless you may God bless pastor I thank him from the bottom of my heart for this opportunity he has given us to be able to do the will of God the will of God is to eat his food and the food is Jesus Christ which is the bread that came out of heaven and the will of God it's the food of the Lord Jesus Christ it's to do his will and to do his Works God bless you all as you're standing let's go to our [Music] scripture let's go to the book of uh Jeremiah [Music] Jeremiah starting from verse 1 to 6 and going uh probably all the way to 10 I'm going to read in the name of Jesus Christ the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying Jeremiah 8 arise and go down to the Porter's house and there I will cause thee to hear my words okay let's pray then you will be sitting as I continue let's pray if you have a request just acknowledge it with an uplifted hand hly father creator of Heaven and Earth we are approaching you tonight as we are bringing our burden there are people who Express their need uped hand and every hand is representing a request there are some that are streaming that are not no matter where they are your word that your hand is not to deliver and to save father what we want is the same way you will bless us may you bless your people wherever they are we don't know which excuse they took for not being because they could be tonight so we commit everything unto the hand no matter the need no matter what they declare in their life or what they consider themselves you are the one that can give life to and you are able tonight to give life word the death that's why we call you God because you can do the impossible what man cannot do father you make it possible we thank you for this take a control from the pit to the father we commit ourselves so that you can speak to all because we expecting to the glory will be returned in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you might be seated as we continue with our scripture he's the same God tonight blessed be the name of the Lord Okay the third verse then I went down to the Porter's house and behold he wrote a work on the wheels the vessel that he made of the clay was mared in the hand of the porter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the porters to make it amen amen verse then the word of the Lord came to me [Music] saying oh House of Israel cannot that cannot I do with you as this Porter say the Lord behold as the clay is in the Porter's hand so are ye in man hand oh House of Israel at what in I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to plug up and to pull down and to destroy if that Nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil I will repent of the evil that I thought to doto them and at what in stand I speak I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant [Music] it [Music] if it do evil in my S that he obey not my voice then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I will benefit them amen amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word based on our scripture that we read tonight my subject tonight will [Music] be the background and the shape of the porters vessel amen amen the background and the shape of the porters vessel amen when we speak about a background we speaking about something that is a foundation a it is Faith it is the foundation for those who are trading we usually call that the working capital amen amen that's my definition according concerning background it's something that is real and usually you don't see it amen with our naked eye amen and then the form or the shape this is something that BR the attraction of people it's an exterior appearance of a body or something it's the image that we usually see with our naked eye you will see people who goes to movie theater they could have when they're making a drama they have a background behind and then they will be working on the back to make sure the SC will appear good and it's something that is really kind of deceiving that's what they call by having the shape or the form amen amen so so the vessel it's something that the porters make it it could be maybe a plate or it could be maybe a vehicle like God who is our Porter maybe created man or created an animal or created a bird what I'm referring to when I say vessel it's something that a Creator have made amen amen and according to the scripture that we read God spoke to the Prophet Jeremiah and he told Jeremiah he said today Jeremiah I'm not going to use the law the book of of the Lord to preach to you in the temple today I'm not going to preach from the scripture because when you in church you take note you are writing things down today that's not my sermon glory to God but today my preaching I'm going to take you somewhere you going to the Porter's house all I want you to do there is to observe I want you to watch and pay attention to what the pter is doing amen [Music] amen and the Lord told him arise and go to the Porter's house and he went down and we know that a house represented a family as Welles a house may represent a community he can even represent a nation amen amen and that's the place that God sent Jeremiah to go and learn or get some instructions based on his observation of what the porters was doing and he told him that day I will cause you to hear my words in other word I'm going to teach you there amen amen I'm going to show you something and behold the pter was working on something now Jeremiah is giving us the description he says that I went to the Porter's house and here he's working on the vessel and Jeremiah gave us more instruction he said when I got there the vessels that the pter was working on got Mar amen amen the same way that the clay is in the hands of the Porter and he noticed that the porter took it and then work with the clay over and made another vessel so let me expand it a little bit when he got to the Porter's house Jeremiah noticed this he found the P working and what he was doing it didn't work it is not Jeremiah who noticed that it is the P that noticed that whatever he was making was working in other word it was not a good image it was not a good shape I'm talking about the P follow me I'm starting with a natural P until I get to the spiritual P which is [Music] God the god that knows who you are amen amen God who created you knows exactly the defect in your life he knows the imperfection of your life God knows and God will work things over tonight he will work things over amen amen hallelujah and he noticed that the P make another vessel different according to his desire now follow me carefully in verse 5 then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot do with you as the SP spoken word Tabernacle tonight don't you think I can do the same thing to you the same way this P this P made something first and he noticed that whatever he made was not well and the clay was still in his hand and he broke the clay again and work the clay off and then he we made another vessel maybe your reputation is already damaged maybe your body is already destroyed by sickness maybe all your business are already collapsed but he is your P your is able tonight when Peter after he received the Holy Ghost he only preached for three minutes said he got 3,000 Soul people could receive the Holy Spirit and you will notice that those people Peter never even touched them but according to the Jewish C you must lay hand on the people but you are not a Jewish you have the great you don't need anybody to lay hand on you need anybody to touch you all that you want is the word of God to touch you if you believe that word he will transform your history he will change your situation tonight blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God God told Jeremiah go down to the house there I will show you my word today I'm not going to preach to you from the book Jeremiah but I want you to see what is going on amen amen Jeremiah went there he went to the pter the poter is somebody who give shap to the clay and he give form based on the clay he's working with amen amen because the clay lays in his hand amen amen glory to God and if you notice Clay is matter it's a substance that's what we call the working Capital when you have the working capital you can make now he have the power to work with something when he noticed that whatever he was working on didn't look good he crashed the clay and started over that's why when we come to the house of God and sometime the Lord will change a sermon and begin to crush you it's just that God want to make you over maybe he's telling you stop the life of sin or stop the life of of and you will see the minister begin to give the word a little bit harsher is God breaking the clay so that you can accept the truth and the truth will give you life blessed be the name of the Lord amen he went to the Porter's house which represent the family brothers and sister you will notice this certain person have some form some shape that is deceiving amen amen you will notice someone looking some somehow and that whichever shape they have will attract you when it's attracting when someone approaches and doesn't find the really Foundation of w he doesn't really find what he was expecting he doesn't see the foundation really of what was standing you will see that that person will find out that you're empty he's not going to stick with you he will leave you and walk he will go away and then you might notice you say why are people leaving me maybe you going to work and you file an application and they take everybody else application but it looks like your application when they read it they TOS it away it means that you don't have the substance within you it is just a form of application amen amen and we will notice that the form of the shape come in different ways they can give you a shape or a form that you yourself didn't even want to get maybe people who are battling with Spirit of uh of night husband and things like [Applause] that in other words those are spirit that will attack a young lady or a young man will attack a young lady or a young man and make you behave like a married person and you will find out that that you are married with a spirit or a ghost something you don't know and you will see that Spirit begin to uh to to torment the person and that person could begin to have some kind of uh physical shap and when that person is going on the street and when people look they could look like oh this look like a marri woman but the woman is not even even married she's still single she but the woman is she's looking to get married maybe it's only married people who want to commit adul that are foll and it seems like nobody is approaching you because someone gave you a form that you are not maybe you are in a marriage Mar in a wedding and people are telling you this man is a married this this is a married woman but when we go into your house you don't even really live the joy of marriage between you and your husband it's just an appearance of marriage maybe people are looking you at you from they say oh this person oh she have children that person have children in other words somebody gave you children but surely they are not your children it's something that we need to catch up tonight blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord the P noticed that the vessel that we work on didn't look good in other word it didn't come out right or maybe something was missed in the process or maybe something fell amen amen and he had the the clay and he went and make make things as his desire you will notice in life there are certain things or businesses in your life that work maybe certain situation you you dive yourself into it and it fell and there are also familyes you will see a whole family children that are coming out from there all of them are failing in life maybe a child is born but there is something that the child missed amen amen he was born well but something wrong with the child's health amen amen God is able tonight there was one day there was one person who had a dry hand in the temple and he met the Lord Jesus Christ and the people of the synagogue trying to block Jesus from they're trying to trap him to see if he's going to heal someone and Jesus asked them a question he said to the person rise up and stand there because Jesus already knew as a he knew he knew that I created this man I knew that during the process something missed there is a lamp that is not functioning correctly there is a part of the body that is not functioning well so today I'm going to fix the situation of this because the clay is in my hand I have the power to make things over to change and Jesus look at the people at the synagogue and ask the question he say in the day of Sabbath do you do something good or do you kill do you save or do you kill on Sabbath day and they begin to reason among themselves and Jesus went straight to business and he healed the man he is the same God tonight that can hear you when you hear his word when we are talking about the background we are also mentioning Faith it's speaking about faith which is the center of everything which is able to change everything Faith into the word of God Amen not in the things of the world not in the words of man but faith in the word of God amen amen that's what we talking about tonight there are things that were missed in our life we know but the same God is still the same tonight he's more present God want you to be here tonight so you can hear this word tonight so that he can change your situation he can change your condition he can change your life I don't care the diagnosis or whatever the doctor or the people of the world whatever they say about you or your life for years or maybe your reputation is ruin God is here tonight he's here to make things over blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to read something here Mark I'm going to go go to the Book of Mark Mark chter 11 verse 12 to verse 14 the scripture says this and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry like tonight Jesus is hungry and you know his food right his food Jesus say is to do the will of my father and to do his work amen amen to hear his word not just stopping it hearing but to bring forth fruit because if you don't bring forth fruit the scripture say every tree that do bear good fruit will be yed down and I want to say this when we mention when they mention that a tree in the Bible symb it usually symbolizes people amen amen maybe a man or a woman but it's just symbolizing a human being because we are we were created to bear fruit amen amen when we look at verse 13 Jesus came down from BET is what it is the House of Joy amen amen it means the House of Joy and sometime it's also call The House of the poor people why the house of poor because Lazarus was living there as and they were calling him poor he was living there too amen amen which were closer to the mountain of Olive and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there and when he came to he found nothing but Le for the time of fig was not yet now let's take the word Jesus answered and say unto it no man eat fruit of thee here forever and his disciple heard it amen amen if you notice in this story Jesus was hungry just like tonight Jesus is hungry and we know that the hunger of Jesus Christ Jesus want to see Soul saved Jesus saved you he want you to give testimony he wants you to do something in your life so that you can bring more souls unto him in Revelation chapter 22:2 the Bible refer to the tree which is speaking about the Tree of Life the tree of life which is by the river and that tree of life and it's giving fruit every single month in other word every month you can go to that tree and there was no season to that tree amen amen because to God there is no season God is the Creator and you are a part of God in other way you are God am amen and you will notice when God created all things he created everything that existed when he finished his creation he created man he created he for and he sent him on the earth when he placed men on the garden God never violated his law to come down on Earth to do to do whatever he want to do without first negotiating with Adam amen amen God cannot do anything without Man Without he deal first with men the children of Israel were in Egypt God never came down himself to deliver them why because God knew that the Earth and everything within the Earth was given to his children I gave it to my that's why you know you will see God came to Moses first to speak to Moses you need to go back over there amen everything that is in the scpt when God want to do something he will first speak to man when he want to destroy Sodom and [Applause] gomorra he said what I must talk to somebody get I must discuss with somebody and God was coming down and when came down you know the story to Abraham after he finished eating he says shall I hide anything to Abraham why because he cannot violate his own law am amen and Abraham understood his position that canot do anything without negotiating without asking me permission since God have a portion in this man I also have my portion and the portion of Abraham was he had his nephew locked up there he was and he begin to intercede oh God what about if you have so many people are you going to save the city and then he keep going down with the number until he found a number he was a small number and God no and God Char take no a lot out of Sodom and bring judgment all of that is to show you God cannot do anything without dealing with but you men you don't know your position amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so Jesus was hungry and Jesus noticed a far off a fig tree Jesus didn't see a field full of fig trees he didn't see several of them he didn't see a big farm he only saw one fig tree because one fig tree means god is dealing individually with people two sleeping in the bed they will take one and leave the other amen amen people with nation he deal with us individually amen and he saw one fig tree and thate was maybe a person are symbolizing because we know trees in the scriptures talk about and when Jesus looked a far off he saw that the tree look beautiful he have the appearance the shape the form the beauty that the Fig Tre was displaying attracted Jesus Christ like he could find and as Jesus was hry Jesus was expecting that when I get there I'm going to find fruit and I will eat but what happened when he get there he to check the Fig Tree and find out that there is no fruit that's why I told you maybe there are people coming to this church they might see all the appearances but when they come in if he doesn't find somebody who's interested into them maybe people who don't know God and they want somebody to show interest toward [Music] them somebody who can talk to them about the message of the hour when he come he hear the pastor preaching it's a good thing but nobody approaches them later on and the people will leave and go amen amen you will maybe meet someone and you will see people coming to your house to visit you but after while all of them goes away you wonder why are people have I done something wrong yes there is something wrong there is something a form that you have that is not real your form is not really your reality but your background is what really matter your foundation is what is your substance is what matter your Clay is what matter am amen but your appearance your sheer it will just attract people amen because the form will attract people and before you know it people are leing you will notice something Jesus even cursed the tree Lord Jesus Christ who is Holy Holy Holy can curse a tree how much more people who are human beings the people that you met in your life that you never knew about what the struggle was how many have curs you or say bad things about you or maybe they left something bad in your testimony amen amen because they came and they thought they're going to be find something good but they nothing and they won't go back empty they have to do something to the tree that and they they did something to you but tonight we are in front of the true pter who is the Lord Jesus Christ who's able to change the situation I'm going to read brother brandham somewhere here in marriage and divorce brother Bram says 1965 in February the 21th in the morning 21st paragraph 150 brother Bram says this when he chose Esau or chose Jacob and rejected Esau boy before either boy could have a right to make Choice himself neither one of them before they were born stealing the w wom of their mother in the womb of their mother God said I I hated Esau and I love Jacob see brother Bram say why brother Bram speaking about Moses down he says I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have [Music] compassion so it is not him that willth or him that rth amen amen but it's God that showeth Mercy for the scripture says unto Pharaoh even for this purpose have I raised thee that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth amen amen somewhere brother Bram is mentioning when God said that he chose Jacob and hated [Music] Esau he said God knows everything and he knows that when Jacob will be born he knows exactly what the boy will do and he also know what Esau will do when he was born and God seeing something wrong with and him could not as God he declared before they were born I love Jacob and because people would say why did he hated Esau like that amen amen he say I'm going to go down where he says who are that to R against shall the thing form say to him that form it why has Thou made me this has not the power over the clay of the same love one vessel to honor and the other to dishonor what if God willing to show his Wrath and to make his power known end such long suffering The Vessel of RA fitted to destruction amen amen let me skip a little be here because my time is running quickly I'm going to go to 152 I'm trying to skip here brother says this what is God God is a great Eternal at the beginning way back before before there was a beginning he was not even God did you know that God is an object of worship there was nothing to worship Him he lived alone amen amen that's why brother is showing here he was not even God he was just the Loos amen amen for him to be God he must have being that can worship Him that's why God you will notice God saying or the word of God declaring when God was creating Son of God were shouting for [Applause] Joy that's at that time he became God because he wanted people to worship Him amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord 153 brother and in him was attribute what is an attb a thought now you shall get something that will bother on the lesson for tonight now notice he was his attribute that was in him now he was in him to be father he was in him to be God he was in him to be son he was in him to be savior he was in him to be healer all these things here are just displaying his attribut is nothing out of order you think God didn't see the end from the beginning certainly he did there is nothing out order just displaying his attribute amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Bram is showing here that God has attribute to be a father if you a Son of God God is your father so no matter what you're doing if you can go back to your father tonight to talk to him he will listen to you he will change the situation he's able because he's your father amen I will be skipping a lot brother saying he was a savior why he had those attribute in his for knowledge he knew that my daughter will mess up he knew that my son will mess up so as a savior he must come down to rescue you if you never fell how can he be amen and in God all those attributes so for those attribute to be displayed and it have to be manifested in your life so you have to watch your condition if you are sick for instance no matter the sickness we found out that Jesus Christ he found someone who had a dry hand and he healed the person he's the same God if a portion of your body is completely uh without life or it's dead God is able to Quicken can you imagine the same man that that Rose Lazarus from the dead he was dead and buried but he came back to life but you are still alive not no matter where you are even if it's in the hospital maybe your whole body is dead already maybe you can only move your finger continue to move that finger or you cannot even talk but you can hear since you still have your you go ahead and or whatever is still alive use that as a body part you show to God you say look at my son look at my son that I'm to tell you that I'm still believing that you are able to deliver me that you can change me that you can bless me blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen it is marvelous he's the same God tonight he's the same God tonight in the message be certain of God in 1955 59 in January the 25th I'm going to read 64 and 65 only because be running with the time I don't know what's wrong with the time running fast he says this when you openly confess that God is the same God and your life applied in his hand to be saying Lord I Am The Clay th are the PO then ask what you will my brother my sister ask what you will if you don't have children ask what you will that's what brother BR is saying and that's what brother Bram did when brother Bram spoke squirel to existence in the message of Grace when he was creating the brother Bram says and I want a certain time I want the last qu I want to kill it amen amen when brother looked and time was going it was only 3 minutes before the maybe brother BR was muring that I say I'm going to have one more this time it's getting closer God told Brother BR only believe and wait right there it's not finished yet time is not reach yet even in less than 3 minutes the squirel will come amen amen and brother BR finally had the squirel and the same God it's the same message that you are listening to God is able to do it brother say I give you the children amen amen [Music] and he got and she got the salvation of her children am amen why because God spoke am amen God spoke brother Bram say ask what you will I don't know what you have as a need but you know your needs brother say ask what you will faith will never move he shall stand right there listen to this through those circumstances will seems to fall from right and left but that faith never moves because you are certain that he is God amen amen and if he is God he keeps his promise he can't make a promise and break it if he is God he's got to keep his promise oh I love that he's got to stay with it amen Amen brother is showing here maybe your condition is getting worse you're trying to do whatever you trying to do the best that you can it's still not working but have faith in faith is the foundation Faith doesn't move Faith look at what God spoke am amen he looking at what God spoke when we read Jeremiah in verse can I not act the same way as the pter did to the clay if something went wrong in your life or maybe in your body God not able who have you in his hand to remodel to repair to redo things for you you think he's not able to change your situation maybe if they taken maybe a womb out of you maybe they amputated you from some body part God is the Creator amen amen God is the creator that can create another one amen when someone is sick it means that one part of his body is not functioning well am amen when you have germs in the body and what they're doing they're feeding on your tissue Anda death now think about a person in that condition and suddenly the person is he do you think that there was no cell Miss God who remodel everything and created new one and gave life to that which was dead how many times have God he you in your life when you were sick but he's the same God who can take to control your situation who can take your problem into control maybe it's a problem at work maybe something was missed in your life or something fell a business or maybe a marriage fa something that failed he's still the same God tonight to remodel to redo and give you hope to give you [Applause] life if you can give me just a little time there is a lot but I don't want [Music] to but I just have one thing I want to help someone because someone must be delivered someone must be healed amen amen somebody must be here he's the same God tonight I can even go to the it's in the Book of Ezekiel verse uh chapter 37 Ezekiel 37 let me go to the scripture blessed be the name of the Lord Ezekiel 37 okay I'm going to get some verse only God spoke to the prophet Ezekiel to prophesize on dry bone and speak to the Bone he say you dry bone listen to the word of God you are not a born here you still have life you still have life in your body job in chapter 32:8 he says this he said but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty amen amen it's the inspiration of the almighty that giveth them understanding that the understanding and so for amen now so in you you have a spirit and God here is speaking to B with but you are not just a power BS didn't have anything I don't have time I don't want to read the whole thing amen he said prophesy to the BS and when the prophet prophesies and God says speak to the spirit call the spirit and prophesize to the wind and say th the Lord the Lord come from the four and Bre upon the SL that they may leave and he did it verse 10 he says so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they live and stood upon their feet exceeding great Army an exceeding great Army amen amen then he said unto me son of these bones are the whole house of Israel our bones and our hope is lost we are cut off for our therefore prophesizes that says the Lord God behold my people I will off and you to come out of your gra oh bring you into the land of is and I will bring you to the house and you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graes oh my people and out of your Graves I shall put my spirit in you and you shall leave if God can bring dry how much more he can give you life how much more he can heal you how much more he can give you what you want you remember the woman with an issue of blood amen amen it was it took a long time that she suffered amen that she was suffering with the condition God knew that condition when she met Jesus when she took upon her heart that if I can Touch the Hem of His heart His Garment but what are you touching tonight touch the word of God because God has his promises we read brother Bram when he explained in detail that before anything could happen first he was a father he was your father he was your healer he was your savior he was all for you you have all the attribute the promises why can't you utilize them for your benefit to change it because he's the same God T he want you to Bear fruits one day there was a woman in she was a prostitute that was coming to the well you know the story already you know the story well when she came to Jesus the disciple were not there and Jesus asked her for water me a Samaritan we have no dealings we have no dealings that was her strategy to attract Jesus but Jesus knew her more than herself and Jesus went straight to and he said and he asked a question can you call your husband she said I don't have and Jesus started said you said the truth because you had five the sixth one you living with doesn't even belong to you and that woman when she saw Jesus maybe he thought this is the seventh one but talking to Jesus in that woman she was the clay she had the foundation already she had the substance already am amen and when she was in the presence of the porter when she faced the porter himself the true por who is the Lord Jesus Christ and he begin to remodel her to discern the thoughts of the heart and when she heard that she said are you the Messiah and the conversation went on when he when he she had a pot a vessel that she was carrying it's like Jesus said and Jesus said this water if you take you will turn thirst again but the word that I will give you you will never thirst again and by talking to her that woman the the the the the clay The Vessel within herself was already filled to the point that she abandoned her natural vessel and she run into the City and she ran into the city listen to me when she went to the city you can read it the book John chapter 4 John chapter 4 I believe 29 and she begin to call to the people come and see the man that Tau me everything that I have I want you to notice something I want you to see this with me that woman begin to give new that come and see the man that told me everything everything that I have done in my life what did that woman do in her life she was a prostitute before she was prostitute she did she was not asham of her testimony she was not ashame of her testimony when you are waiting for your testimony to come and testify here she took the testimony that she had that's what she brought into the City and in verse 39 you will notice that the scripture says this many people believe because of her testimony we can read it if you want [Laughter] to I don't want to abuse the time even though we already over okay John chapter 4 ver 28 and the woman leaving the the the vessel went through the verse 29 and say come see a man which show me all things that I ever did is not this the Christ she didn't have uh she was not ashame of her testimony she did the work of God the will of God Amen and the will of God is to win souls she didn't go and start because it's not authorized to wom you can testify amen there is many ways you can win Soul she went back to her City and she won Souls verse 39 and listen many of the Samaritans of that City believe on him the saying of the woman the woman which testify he told me all that I ever did in your neighborhood never talk about Jesus when you are in at school you don't even talk about you don't even mention about J but this woman brought a lot of people to God that's why Jesus even cursed the because the tree didn't have fruit there are many things that we could go over but uh time is have a great jealousy so we will pick it up later on amen amen and Jesus cursed the tree because the tree never gave the fruit and it was written if you don't bear fruit because every tree that doesn't bring forth fruit it will be you now and being cast Into the Fire we read somewhere that when you don't eat you will be weak you will lose weight that's a natural food but what about spiritual food one week you don't come to J two weeks you don't come a habit for you church for not going to church word how are you going to be strong it means that death is oing in amen amen that's why we God say move a mountain you are unable even to move a mountain am amen why is the mountain not moving because you don't have the substance all you have is the appearance you can speak well you can pray very well you can even say letter very good but if you don't have you don't have the foundation that will give you power that will give you pray power nothing will happen that's why there are many things when we are praying nothing is happening there are people who did many works in the name of Jesus Christ but they met certain things they met certain demon they say you know what we know Paul we know Jesus we know Jesus we know Paul but we don't know you who are you no substance they spoke the word in the name of Jesus Christ that Paul preach but that declaration didn't have a a background a foundation a substance behind it in them that's why it didn't work that's why when you want to move a mountain the mountain is not moving but tonight we are at the Porter House he is the one that gave life to I don't know your problem that went wrong brother says this even if your situation continue to get worse continue to get worse to get worse even if your reputation to worse hold on hold on and it will change it will change it is not up to to you to start working the problem will not you moving the mountain will move but not you if the mountain doesn't move it will be cut down God bless [Applause] you amen glory to God let's stand praise God God the background and the shape or the form of the porters vessels amen the substance in other word the reality versus the appearance the form is the appearance but the reality is what meets the devil amen amen we read the scripture tonight in the book of Jeremiah where the porter have the clay and when something went wrong he can crush the clay and remake everything over amen and God say he can do the same thing to the house of Israel and brother Bram say Israel is God's Redemptive name and we are the true Israel of God which is the brde of Jesus Christ amen God is able to crush everything down and to start everything from scratch and to make something new amen God is able to do that that woman have six husband that she introduced to the city but when she was remodel she introduced the perfect husband the seventh one which was the Lord Jesus Christ and when she introduced that husband as bad as her reputation was in the city God flipped that reputation in the city to be able to bring more souls into God Amen she was bringing souls to the devil at first as a prostitute God remodel her completely by the Spoken Word by Discerning the thoughts of the heart giving the Messi sign and opening revealing the word so that he can bring a fresh beginning to this woman amen what is wrong in your life what is not going right in your life what have fail in your life what is not functioning well in your life what is dead in your life what is damage in your life what is empty what is causing the people to flee way what is causing young men not to be attracted to you maybe a genetic was inserted into you and you struggling with the Gen of the family down in your inside of you you want to be good you want to do good but you trap in this genetics because it's bring bringing weakness to your body to do things that are not right to find yourself smoking to find yourself drinking to find yourself in drugs to find yourself sneaking and doing things that are not right to find yourself in trouble because it seems like there is a trend in the family everybody have a difficulty everybody have a bad marriage everybody suffer for high blood pressure everybody have this and this and this whatever went wrong God is able to crush it today and to remodel everything do you want to talk to him to minute and tell him yourself what is wrong in your life and tell him that you are deporter I came to your house tonight and you spoke to me that you can crash you can make things over you can correct you can make me according to your desire the predestinated seed is the substance that you have and because of that seed in you God have something he can work with forget about your failure forget about the disaster that happened happen forget about how many people knows the bad thing that you have done take that past put it in the Po's hand let the P crush it because when he crush it he can crush it well when he Crush he put it in the sea of God's forgetfulness he himself one remember it and he can change why didn't anybody stop and say this is a bad woman don't believe her why should we even hear this woman she's a disaster every time she talk is about bad things she's not somebody that we can believe what made those people believe a NE Fame woman he didn't take weeks so that the entire neighborhood will know that she gave her life to Christ only one day one moment she dropped her old vessel that she was carrying water for her lovers and she run in the city bringing another vessel that was bringing forth everlasting life I know you could be pressurized because you want to go home but maybe this is the last opportunity you can change your life maybe you play around too much and this word meet you

to your picture to make it look nice it's not working and still it's not enough to convince a child of God you don't need all of that you don't need that you need God you need the maker who knows what what what what went wrong in your life he knew that before the foundation of the world a young young man was born blind and they ask Jesus they say why did this young man was born blind maybe his father suffered a reputation that they did something wrong that's the reason why their child is in the situation that they are but Jesus confounded them and only him can do that he says that it's not the child I myself allow this to happen so that I can draw glory for myself why don't don't you tell him tonight that take the situation that happened to me and may you Joy Your Glory from this situation because if you fix it right I'm going to testify I'm going to show the entire world that this is what my God can do I'm going to show the whole world can't you see his glory in me can't you
