========================================

glory that should follow there women look unto him it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the what holy ghost that sent down from heaven which things that angels what and you're looking into it don't listen to the devil out there tell you you don't need this don't look at it we're not trying to take away their salvation we're just bringing you into oh by god in a hidden veil god hid it from them for us is that right in this hour here now the things that they desire to say but god said no no no no no no like what was this the two sons that wanted to sit on the throne he said it was not i'm not mine to give to you why because they couldn't sit on the left they couldn't sit on the right is that right why because i have to sit on the right and my wife got to sit on the left because it's for his bride is that right that's what those seats are for it's for his bride of jesus christ can we be sitting in the throne he said now look hallelujah which girl of thy loins of your mind sober and hope to end of the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of who yeah when when is a man born again when the revelation of jesus christ comes to them that's where that man is born again is that right when you've seen jesus christ as that was the first door on the east side of the tabernacle is that right huh he is the door he is i am the way i am the truth i am the life is that right his now knows the word being unveiled in this hour here now hallelujah let me keep keep going i'm gonna try to get as much as i can here help me lord he says now he says in those days he dropped down here help me so he says but now the cunningness of the devil makes the people believe that they are christians when they're not let it sink in see that's what the holy spirit was trying to tell us sunday morning huh that's exactly right that's all he's saying people think that they are now god by his grace is bringing you going to bring you up to where you supposed to be by his grace and his mercy he said now look he said it's a cunning day that it would be then when you had to seal your life he said with the testimony the devil has set every cunning trap that he can that's right without every track he's studying he's watching you got to understand his tactics so you got to recognize who you are in his hour here now and followed away in the orders of the lord now you know you are kings and priests is that right so you pray you read your bible you study you study the message help me lord he said now look and jesus told us in matthew 24 how that this would be the living in the living the most deceitful day there is he says so close it be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible is that right remember the holy ghost went to second kings there's sunday is that right he with the second kings and he had elijah and elisha then elijah and elisha he had the son of the son of the prophet is that right and you had the prophet that was there and he got around there they got the word that elijah was about to take off is that right but it was out there somebody listen he wasn't just watching them watching the man is that right the lizard was watching the spirit that was on the man huh you got to understand the anointing that's on the vessel that god is trying to use and speak to you so when they wondered what now elijah knew that that elisha elisha knew that elijah was about to leave but the sons of the prophet they stood way off is that right see there's two spirits it's going to be so close it's going to deceive the very elect if it was possible but they was watching the spirit the anointing when you come in here you prayed up when he was here sharing with us that's why he said when i was a child i act like a child i spoke like a child i did childish things is that right but when i grown up who do what now i put those away now what he come when he was saying that was immature we wasn't ready yet we were still children that's what brother branham talked about in those gifts those ones that was in there remember he was saying about billy paul i think uh uh the pastor read that quote when he ran by billy paul about walking see you can't tell somebody something one time and think they're gonna um just receive it is that right huh he told billy paul he got around there you walk you fall you walk you know how mom and dad trying to teach somebody to walk and the baby falls they get around and the baby falls the next day you come back the next day you're doing it again is that right you're doing it again it's showing him and then eventually do what he started walking he get up and start walking and now they start walking if they do what the baby wants to do they want to run first thing they want to do they want to start running right but now what you got to do now you got to send the pasta to teach them not to run yet you're not ready to run yet though you see so now you come we show them about the gifts that's why the prophet of god said come early put them in the cup prayed up get ready and then god didn't see what god wanted to speak anything to the church he sent him to teach us is that right train up a child and the way he should go when he grow old he won't depart from it hallelujah he said now look he said now he says now let's look at these scriptures he said in second timothy 3 let's look at ii timothy 3 then you'll see i think we read these scriptures here last time but we want you by the grace of god to look at them they come the wrong way help me lord and then they're not just let's look at verse one second timothy three and one he said now look he says ii timothy we learned this that the prophet said that it would come to pass in this last days that men would be heady henry is reckless they're thoughtless you know we used to tell people when we were out there on the streets you know you know with one guy you never mess with a guy that can't go home and put his feet up under the table you don't mess with him and a guy that can't even do wrong right you don't mess with him that means he just do things without thinking he can get you killed and somebody else do i don't know what that's for is for somebody he's thoughtless he said he he he said love is a pleasure he said more than lovers of god he said compare that now just for a moment we just brief it he said because we haven't eternally had much time he said but we're just going to highlight it we can see you get home and you study these things he's had it high minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god what the truth breakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that good see some people are high-minded high-minded doesn't mean that they like smoke their smokers like a fire with just smoke that's all it is they're always running there to do something but they ain't got no fire ain't got no anointing going to them to go do something you see what i'm saying no fire there so god is trying to do he's trying to show him these kind of spirits you're dealing with but remember these aren't any kind of spirits paul was talking about these are religious demons these are religious demons they're sitting up in the churches [Music] brother brown just picked it up and he ran a little bit with it he said now look he said like fire a wicked person incontinent a person that's incontinent i won't get a chance to read all those but that's self-control now you need the holy ghost to come in and bring you under control that's what the pastor was saying then you're not going to kill the fire you don't kill the fire you don't beat it down what you do is is learn them bring them up brother branham says the first thing like the holy spirit is doing first thing he said give him the holy ghost he said you getting the holy ghost he said then you can work with someone after that this is the age for that is that right hallelujah he said now look he said that now the spirit spoke expressly of these things in the later days that's that that's these days the prophecy speaking to it he said lay of the sins and now you remember lay of the sea i just quote some of them lay of the seer age revelations 3 14 is that right you tell them let's turn in and we'll look at it we're still working with deceit the revelation of the word i mean rejecting the revealed word by deceit look at revelations 3 14 he said in the angel of the church laodicea writes these things saith the amen and the faithful when the true witness begin he said i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor without a cold or hot i would that that would be cold or hot he said but i but the works that thou needed he said i know thy works that thou need to call her heart i would that that would be cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold or hot i would what spewed thee out of my mouth see that means he had nothing to do with him they put a god out also is that right they spill their mouth because behold that's the only age that's that god they put god outside of the church behold i'm on the outside knocking trying to get in i'm telling you now look he says because thou sayeth that i am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest and knoweth not that thou are what wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked and now they're being deceived things let it sink in they don't even know it's deception it's coming in so when you come in here and it's messy now that's why the holy spirit when someone send the pastor that quote he says don't rush him he's got to get this out time is short you're going to need all this to be meet in the storehouse you're going to need it saints god don't unfold something just to be giving it to you no no no you don't put on no show for no one he said now you look he says because thou thou says i am rich if christ was good he said but i was i counseled it to be gold to be tried in the fire that thou may be rich and white raymond but i wanted to the point i wanted you to see was they are being deceived we got to understand this is a great deceitful age that's why i said earlier it's not the sinner the drunker the alcoholic the murderer the robber the thief he know where he's going he or she know where they're going but it's the one that's being deceived by the churches that being deceived by their religion that's why you have to understand he brought the religion to eve from the beginning and it runs all the way up until the end that's always been satan tactic is that right he wanted always to be worshiped he wanted to sit in the seat of god you can go to lucca i mean uh isaiah 14 and he talks about that let me get in there lucifer he always wanted to be worshiped if they're not getting you to jesus christ then you be careful you watch them because christ in his age here now he said if i if i be lifted up from the earth then i'll draw all men unto me is that right hallelujah bringing you into what until the inner court is that right my my my my my when you really can really catch that revelation of the inner court you got to get ready for a real fight saints because when them prayers go up you'll be shaking satan kingdom up is that right he's going to lie to you and make you think there's nothing happened but he said god said what what you're buying on earth they're buying in heaven that means whatever you buying on earth you got all heaven back in you you don't have to fear anything is that right oh death where's thy sting oh grave where is thy victory glory be to god oh heaven is behind you saints here's the power the greatest weapon god given us is power is that right he told them when he got there matthew 10 he send them out i heard the pastor make a quote about that he sent them out they was casting out devils healing the shaking raising the dead doing miraculous work is that right it didn't even have the holy ghost didn't even have the holy ghost why did he say in there now he said go pray that with this he said the laborers are plenty but the harvest is plenty but the laborers are free he said but pray ye that you send what choose the harvest to the what brother to the harvest is that right send us to out there and then what the brother branham say the harvest was he said now you are the harvest let's turn to that scripture i don't want to mess it up let's turn it because it's powerful when the lord showed you that note that when god moved that altar of incense into the inner veil we're trying to show you how powerful your prayers are don't let it say lie to you that's what he do it's rough sometimes i know it'll be rough sometimes but if you get there and say lord god i had a rough day lord jesus but i know lord god you always met me in the inner room is that right he didn't know what right it was he thought he had us he thought he had us drinking he thought he had us in smoking he thought he had us in drugging he thought he had us in mogan he thought he had us in gambling he thought he had us in stealing but it was the name written on that radar the name of when he got into the inner court and my child started blasting them run and to a son and daughter of the most high god you as a branch off of the tree of life is that right you is the brains that come up in the tree of life now you're able to speak life for someone else he'll strengthen that inner land he'll strengthen that inner man ain't that what he says about him when understanding come hallelujah understand understanding when it comes when he's really there it'll be a performance it'll be a performance there hallelujah help me lord hallelujah what do we say matthew 10 hallelujah i tell you lord help me look what we got here thank you jesus look at this here matthew look at matthew 9 i'll tell you nine at the end verse 37 look at the compassion christ had for those souls that's out there when you're praying ezekiel has his name david ezekiel ezekiel yeah i've been praying for a miracle praying for a miracle a miracle's not too hard for our god america that's what we're praying for huh those names when they come to you israel is becoming more and more real to me saints he said look but verse 36 matthew 9 36 he says but when he saw the multitude he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherds he said then save he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few he says pray ye therefore the lord of what harvest that he will send forth who laborers into his harvest he was telling you me pray brother brother was saying there in that scripture he says now they know the lord of harvest was standing there he was standing right there so what was he really telling them he was telling you to pray me to pray now we know we can go unto god is that right why because the veil has been ripped then now we got a revelation brother seth that we can go boldly to the throne of god and bring that compassion for someone maybe someone that's struggling out there that you know and when you're in your prayer closet and they come to you send your prayer up saints hallelujah help me lord he said now look he said this laid the city he said now he says speaking to the church of this age they're wretched blind naked and don't know it he said that last phrase he said the word makes it striking he said now look it is they just got the mental conception see they're being deceived that's why people have fallen away they're not getting i want to read something here i want to i i want to read something to you here that's right the first time i ever brought this little gadget up here you know i heard a pastor i heard a pastor say something one day you know what he was sharing a testimony about his phone and i'm sitting there eating it up i said yeah well you know what i better learn before they they come with some more technology is that right i thank the lord for the house full of quiveries is that right because they'll help me who said now look at here the lord help me we're talking about them falling away why are they falling away i tell you what before i read this let's go to uh ii thessalonians i know we have we have many scriptures but i want this to get rooted and grounded so you can god help me so so you can see why the lord is bringing us to that uh tabernacle he says ii thessalonians and let's just look at verse one he says now chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 1. he says now we receive you brethren by the coming of the lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him see unto him you're here being gathered unto the lord hating him you're in his presence he says that ye be not soon taking and shaking we're at satan's going to come at you what ah he said and then it would be to or be troubled neither by what he's going to try to pressure you in your spirit put pressure you in your spirit knew or by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is what at hand don't be worried don't be fearful those things about satan paul had to remind them is that right he says now who opposes he says let no man here we go again let no man deceive you by what any means he says for that day shall come except there come a what falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition we know at that time the devil had got in the judas is that right we know who we're going to rise up in over there out of that catholic church we know he's going to incarnate himself in that pope is that right but paul was trying to remind them we will be gone huh well god is preparing a place for us is that right he said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in god you believe in me also in my father's house there are many mansions is that right if it was not so i would not have told you so so all he said he's preparing you and me to meet him is that right but look why they're falling away if god help me i want to look at this here if you're writing it down to 7 19 52 help me lord hallelujah he said now look this is uh make the valley full of ditches heavenly father the hours come that the building's warmed but it's time the time has come i remember once our dear lord when you when you looked up and said father the hour has come the hour has come for what it's come for what the hour has come now for people to believe all things are possible to them that believe the royal seed of abraham the true royal seat of abraham believe it all isn't that right don't listen to the miracle don't listen to the doctors on we thank the lord for the doctrine we thank the lord for the hospital we thank the lord for them but as a young lady now she's about 35 years old and her parents they told her parents she couldn't have a child and so the parents she uh her parents that they couldn't she couldn't get pregnant but she didn't listen to that is that right they did all they can do they trust all they could in the doctor with the doctor but now her child is 30 40 i think he's 34 years old now is that right i'm telling you but it's time to believe all things [Applause] he said now look he said the hour has come now for people to believe the hour has come for falling away of the church the hour has come that religion would spread the world without salvation [Music] now you see why we're not against the people in the system we're against the doctrine that's why i'm saying you have to understand satan's tactics you got to know what he's doing they will come and try to twist you up i seen charles stanley one day if you don't know that that matthew 28 19 is the rebel the revelation of matthew 28 19 is acts 238 he could twist your mind about theologian can twist your mind up and make you think is right [Music] the tactics of satan the tactics to religion those people are being deceived and you got the goods that can help them around the one that's hungry and thirsty for a true god ain't that right we have a testimony that man that's true in testimony uh that brother robert and his wife when those um mattresses flew off of there when they flew off of their truck and that man came by and picked up those mattresses do you know the odds of you getting those mattresses back in a situation like that in this day and time the most deceitful evil wickedest time there it is but god had a ram in the bush is that right he said that man there that man is there perhaps he's a baptist a methodist lutheran whatever but he truly believes he's a christian and that brother prayed but now why brother robert he will make it in sister the realm because he helped god's elected children maybe he's being deceived and he won't come out of that church but god brought forth a situation so he can make it oh he's just seeing grace we just seen grace wait until you finish pulling those bullets hey [Music] don't go to the pastor don't tell the pastor this you don't need to tell the pastor that let me tell you something the pastor of the age is the prophet of god the pastor of the local assembly he can get grace that none of us can't get uh i'll say it slow he can get grace in areas that we can't let it sink in he's just starting with grace with the uh naomi huh huh look at the grace that was extended to the bride of ruth huh huh look at the condition she was in didn't even deserve but what your god is my god is that right wherever you go i'll go the land that you dying i'm dying huh oh my my my my my my my my help me lord he said now look where are we at he said look hallelujah look what he said here thank you jesus he says now the hour has come that religion was spread the the world without salvation he's saying what that's why brother brandon was talking about ii timothy 3 he says they had the what they had the form of godliness denying the holy ghost denying the power thereof that's why he's saying you got people that's coming in here the holy ghost was hitting it you got people that got racist demons is that right they're still struggling with it brother branham had to go to an afro-american church to get the holy ghost didn't he to see that real spirit is that right to see that real anointing on him is that right god is not the con god is not concerned about a specific race god is concerned about the human race that's what he's looking for each and every so when you stand in the gap you stand in the gap for those that god bring unto you those that you see out there struggling and that's why he said he got the holy ghost i don't want to get ahead of myself don't tell me you can't live no holy life he gained adam and eve could live that holy life didn't it he said they had a veil over there but steve brother branham said they had a veil over their eyes and he said they looked at one another and they walked around in their birthday suit huh every day they walked around in their birthday suit that and never desired any sex is that right you got to be careful what you take in the eyes is the gateway to the soul you're only struggling with something because you didn't put the word before you first is that right don't tell me you can't live this life there's no excuse for this generation is that right there's going to be no excuse why because god is unfolding the word that's why he unfolded the seventh seal is that right when he unfolded the seven seals even when he went it will be gold but he even showed his grace in type matthew 24 with what the sixth seal was that right he was talking about the destruction the thing that was going to come after the rapture after we leave here let me keep going help me lord help me lord he said now you look look at this one here it's 4 4 54. let's look at this one help me lord he said we want yeah look at this here oh help me i ain't doing too bad for my first time he said help me lord i'm boasting in him now i ain't losing i'm boasting in him i don't want no trouble at the river he's there now look he said now look he said you go he said you go around talking about the bible he said the buddhists they come around with with their bible and they say the same thing the mohammedans come around he says if you come pass by the gang's river let me just flip one up he says there's only one way to be saved and that's through jesus christ the son of god being born of the holy ghost filled with his spirit then you are saved by the holy ghost he said now look he said now jude's writing to the people he says they have begin falling away breaking up creeds breaking up creeds denomination and they say we'll where are we the group we're the group this believe this we the group that believes that jude said i'm writing to you to exalt you exalt you rather that you should do what earnestly that's right brother earnestly contend lord of faith that was once delivered to the saints he know the holy spirit had already spoke through paul saying in the last days how this church would be they would be heady high-minded love is a pleasure huh more than lovers of god having a what form of godliness you sitting there they bringing these certain movies and things to you they look innocent is that right they look innocent to you but you gotta match these things with the scriptures if it's not there with the scripture satan is slick you're no match for them i'm no matt's phone you gotta have the holy ghost watching those so-called christian movies that you're watching these days they're affecting your flesh and then when they affect your flesh they're gonna affect your spirit when they really comes to compassion you're not going to have the revelation of true compassion the compassion for us is to do the will of god [Applause] don't get caught up in the flesh huh recognize the time that you're living in that's why he's trying to tell you about that's why he's trying to tell you about those high heels and things i see some of you still coming here with them high heels huh you're still coming in with them in high heels you cause a man to go to hell that's struggling let me tell you something you get there they can't see you if you ain't wearing something decent then you really do you do like a bowl of jello and then you get around in there you understand what we're saying cause that man that loves playing the seas trying to tell you these things satan is crafty he designs these apparels is that right he knows everything that he's doing i don't know how we got on that tell me lord let me tell you look what he says he says hallelujah he got another here he's 7 8 59. help

was saying there uh uh sunday morning thank you jesus they get around and you get caught up with the foolishness with somebody in the world it's because they come and tell you something sweet is that right you think so you think that serpent just came to eve any kind of way do they come to you any kind of way stuff no you should not surely die hey there yeah then trying to be slick coming in soft and easy oh no you can't eat from any fruit tree huh the slacker huh huh talking that slick foolishness to them in their ear that don't sound like the gospel to me does it oh that don't sound like the gospel to me does it huh huh put the word of god on them and you stand back and you watch them i mean you got to hit some of them hard sometimes i have one time i'ma tell you i need help sometime too i had one time a manager come and bring some garments she brought some garments undergarments and i was standing there talking to my manager and i was standing there talking to my manager and they put this mr glenn she put that thing up in my face and i looked as if you don't get that out of my face i said don't you never do that again i wasn't finished with it yet i said where did i put myself in that position for you to play with me like that i don't play with the devil see you gotta understand his tactics [Applause] you know what she went out there told that mr glenn he's mean he's me yeah right okay yeah right yeah right trying to plan to see them here you can't plant no seed there cast down every imagination and try to exalt itself against the word of god resist the devil receive the word resist the devil then he'll flee from you [Applause] huh remember the word that you get in here god says submit the words first lord i need a word lord so i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and my staff that comfort me now believe every word that you're receiving you don't have to explain it just believe it [Music] he said now look hallelujah tell me lord he said look what he said here he said now the address he says oh he says all these things had the long let they have because he married this whole sinner girl hello she was very sexy he said like these modern girls keep on wearing them tight garments huh keep wearing them tight garbage you win maybe you're wondering why that little slicker coming at you maybe you're wearing something you ain't got no business is that right huh huh maybe you're doing it maybe you're walking the salt a certain way huh you got to know what's going on these guys sit back there and they lined up against us some of you were in high school they lined up against the wall and and they lay bets who they couldn't try to get is that right i don't know that's good it's for somebody you know what help me lord he said now look she was very sexy like this modern girl of today it proved that after her husband was dead she dressed she dressed herself twisted before though she could vamp that man of god see the sons of god saw the daughters of men to be fair see his beauty in this end time this beauty that they're trying to catch you with that's why you hear the pastor always talking about facebook facebook all you see is their face isn't that right they're pretty up their face is that right ah he said now you look he says to throw her out of the window he said now look he said but it proved that her husband was dead she dressed herself and twisted out before the jewel he said though she conveyed that man of god but she said he already said throw her out of the window we have more men like jewett today think if you have more pastors like us here today that's not shooting blanks is that right he's not shooting blanks uh he's shooting straight at the target and most of the time he doesn't know the holy ghost just move him in and out is that right because you know every man know the bitterness and the wickedness of their hearts is that right but the word of god is sharper than any two-edged sword as able to discern and thought the intents of every heart is that right you ought to thank god for the word of god the intense you're intense he's sending you a word to block that foolishness so that you won't move in and get yourself into a jam is that right hallelujah he said as jewish today we have it says we we have less judgment then we'll have less jezebels he said but that was that was her nature and she was a worshiper of idols anyway she brought the whole nation to idolatry huh the whole world is in idolatry but they're bringing them to idolatry through religion that's what he's bringing them in sorcery with the witchcraft is that right he's bringing them through religion let me keep going help me lord he said and so has our modern trend today now you wonder why say you don't need this oh yes you do need this you're going to find out down the road you're going to need this saints you're going to need more and more of god in this hour here now because this wickedness religious demon it'll come so close it will deceive the very last if it was possible but it can't see he got in the land you got to understand if you got in there joshua they deceived him temporarily and they got in the land he went to the princesses but he didn't go to god he said first seek ye the kingdom of god and his righteousness and everything else to be added unto you you teach your children about praying you pray with your children you show them the miraculous move of our miraculous god in his hour here now and is that right but when he came in there he did joshua said what a can he still have garments hidden in his heart is that right they ain't carrying it now not only they can't suffer but he got there in his whole family got killed also is that right but look at the grace that's being extended to us oh you may have snatched a hole a bride maybe you snatched a hole a son of god maybe you snatched a hole of a daughter of god then you slipped in like the holy ghost said but look at the grace that it extended to you because the unbelieving husband could stand in the gap with an unbelieving wife but the unbelieving wife could stand in the gap from an unbelievable the non-believing husband you understand see the grace that been extended to this age you ain't got in but you thank god by the grace of god now god is able to keep you until the time to the rapture takes place look what he says he said now oh it is modern day to trend today falling away from these things of god and has brought the world to one of the greatest idolatries that's idols he says just i do just idling just stop there just idling why the pastor always wanted us uh any our readers here y'all keeping up with the messages huh reading your conducting order huh you reading your church ages in your seals praying reading your bible why because they say idle mind is a devil playground the biggest idol dollar tree now is idle time you're doing nothing with your time that you should you got too much idle time that's what our prophet said not brother kelly i'm going to read what he said huh because some places you get there and they look at you you just you just shoot it at them right and then like a shotgun boom and when you get it it hit all those hearts is that right a shotgun pellet hits different hearts you know what you need huh god no you know you and god know you hallelujah look what he said he said now it's idol great is the iniquity of the people today know what to do just won't do it you come in some of you some of you come in from your different countries wherever you come from the lord bless you to be here in america huh it's still a prosperous land you're in the land here's the good but don't get caught up with the worldly spirit we're not trying to bring them to us we want to bring christ to them is that right we're looking at them god has given you the holy ghost he's veiled you the holy ghost inside it i said lord i look at those even the ones standing on the corner and i look at some of them most of them got mental problems or drug problems ex-military guards or they got drug problems and any out there so you got to understand god have mercy when i look at him i say god have mercy on them lord that's a terrible thing a mind that the devil is just tormenting and tormenting but god who's rich in mercy is able to use one of you to stand in the gap for make use a miraculous move when you're here in this land saints you thank god for it you thank god for your home you thank god for your jobs you thank god for being here there in in this land here now you thank the lord for them don't waste your time about worldly conversations that's what the holy spirit was saying the worst thing idolatry is idle time and because if you say things wrong satan is just waiting paul said the things that i did i decided the things i desired to do i did not the things i desire not to do i did so you got to understand wherever good is evil is always present satan is just waiting that's all for you to come out of your mouth with something wrong is that right vain babbling leads to nothing is that right your words is the words of life let me keep going you're producing the words of life that's coming from us look what he says he says now look the greatest iniquity oh boy he said he said god he said god blessing us because he said god just give me a few more minutes pray with me he says god blessing us because he's prosperous us he says that's the he says now that's no sign because blessings not all at all but what i'm saying is some people that's being deceived into the systems by the religious systems they are being taught prosperity is a vessel and spiritual blessing you see through deceit against things remember what our what our topic was rejecting the revealed word by deceit he said now look you got one more i want to read to you from 2016. if you're writing it down it's 5 22 60. help me lord he said now look he said now watch this master teacher paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away he knocks it out when we get ready to read let this about to sink in this is in the adoption that's why the pastor keeps telling you this thing look at this look at you hey the revelation of jesus christ look into your church ages looking to your seals looking to your adoption your adoption positions you your adoption shows you by absolute you are predestinated [Music] he said now look and watch this master teacher paul the first thing he does is knock out all the ideas of falling away knock out all the ideas of ever being a christian today oh we get ready to hit something now you see why the holy ghost had the pastor going this way no excuse he said being a christian today tomorrow i'm going he said the next day god condemned me and the next day i'm back again he said that's nonsense this book is not addressed to an evangelist's teaching he says this sermon he said i don't touch this on the field i bring this to the church for paul address it to the saints those that are called and preserved and are filled and are set aside are and are in the holy spirit already in canaan's land he's trying to tell them the first thing get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost forget about it the blood what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of jesus get it out of your mind you're not a failure you are overachievers huh he used to be happy my my my he's trying to tell them first thing get it out of your mind you're going to get lost he said you're going to do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of nothing for he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are and how you're standing now you might do things wrong and every time you do anything wrong you're going to get paid for it he said yes sir you'll reap what you sow but that has not that has not one thing to do with your salvation when you are born he said when you are born of the spirit you've got eternal life and can no more die then god can die you're a part of god you're a son you're a daughter of the most high god hallelujah come up musicians i want to read this and i'ma stop read this one quote here and and i'ma stop i didn't help me lord thank you lord look what he said the same holy ghost i was able to keep adam and eve sit down look this here still satan's eating remember rejecting the revealed word by deceit compare this now how much i like that man and his wife both god's eaten without this without the stitch of clothes on them and knew it not he said well why didn't then they know it for they were veiled to to their sense of nakedness by the holy veil of the holy spirit it says they could look right at each other and they didn't even know that they were naked they were veiled with the holy spirit of what holiness without holiness no man shall see god your thoughts need to be pure the only way your thoughts can be pure it has to keep your mind here that keep their minds steadfast on me i'll grant them perfect peace he said now the veil yet today he says they were there with the holy spirit of holiness see remember that they were veiled with the holy spirit of holiness yeah now they were veiled god's veil yet today can look and not not lust ah same spirit that adam and eve the same spirit now but sam duncan i'ma go ahead and finish reading it anyway thank you you say look he says god veil yet today can look and not lust he said they turned their heads he said it's a holy veil see holy veil god had god had their eyes they were both one was man and the other was woman and they did not they were naked did not know they were naked because the holiness of god kept their eyes veiled now look at this notice the brother brown said notice god hid their conscience from sin amen by the holy veil they had what clean pure thoughts everything was good they kept their mind on god he said which we had some time today let me drop down he said the worshiper once purged has no more what conscience of sin sin that passed away he said now and that the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost is the action is the action in you amen amen it's a life not a emotion know we have emotions everything but it's not an emotion and not some sort of fleshly evidence but it's a person jesus christ the word established in your heart amen too quick and too quick in every word of this age watch the holy ghost in action not so now listen to this not

grace and mercy god knows everything my god praise god hallelujah started with a wonderful testimony and we're ending up with a wonderful testimony what a night amen how many enjoy the service hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] this deception if you study the message you will really really be on your toes and you're going to be even careful with your cell phone and very very careful more so with your computer and everything else brother bradham say you might not be a prostitute on the street but you can be a prostitute on a higher level if you need the court you see me brother branham say you can be that kind of a prostitute by prostituting your time amen so you see what we're doing in the eyes of god you can be as pure as a lily but in the eyes of god look at what you're doing amen this deception is so great so great the bible says in the book of revelation that because i'm rich because i'm this because i'm this need of nothing those people are not saying just rich like that it's a church that is speaking it is not the people of the world have you ever thought that no it's a church that is speaking it is not sinners that are saying that they are rich no it's church people that have caught another understanding that prosperity means that god is with them that's why they don't need anything because the tendency is when you look at god as somebody that you do something wrong you get a whooping so if god if you didn't get a whooping so what i'm doing is right you understand god wrong that's why people do things that are wrong and nothing happened to them and they say well if nothing didn't happen to me so why is why are you telling me it's wrong because the lord doesn't want me you will go to hell peacefully and find yourself in hell amen so that those people that were saying because i'm rich because i'm this i'm this i'm this that's why brother branham said the pressure of the age is what is riches we handle this stuff in question and answer and the majority of the church is not even there amen and the people that struggle the more if you sit with me and you see where we are pulling people from their lives you will be afraid amen i was talking to somebody today if you put your hand you're pulling somebody you just open up you see a mess and a mess and a mess and a mess and they were a message believer and mess after mess after mess after mess and then we got to sit and then clean that all up i said brother if this happened you don't want to be stay for the rapture like this amen it's people that have that mentality it's coming from a pentecostal world they think because prosperity means god is with you and before you know it they turn into money minded people all the time money money money money and the church means nothing if money is on the left and the church is here they will go to money and just leave the church when they say lovers of pressure do you know what it means lovers of pleasure do you know what it means it means the church is up and there is a game you go into the game it means there is a wonderful fellowship you're going to meet with your friend over there and you're going to leave church early to meet your friend to have that good time because and you're going to try to put even pressure if the preacher takes just a little bit longer you're going to go out quickly amen you can come in church 10 minutes and you leave why are you leaving no i'm going to meet my friend over there and we will be sitting and eating that's a lover of pleasure that's what it is amen amen you have service in your church where are you at oh no no no no no so-and-so is over there and i'm gonna meet with him we have a birthday party so we gotta cook that's the reason why i didn't come lovers of pleasure it's more than god amen it's a deceitful oh my god you say christian moving you're fooling yourself i was telling somebody you gotta know yourself don't fool yourself the bible said no one knows what is in the man save the spirit that is in the man okay when i'll talk to the young sister i'm gonna open the cannon to help you understand this kind of stuff amen you gotta know yourself amen you gotta know you gotta watch yourself as you moving in life and you know that if you put me before cigarette i'm gonna fall you need to be conscious of that anybody here so when you see cigarette run away don't play a game with it anybody care don't fool yourself because you're gonna fall do you hear me amen you have not caught it yet probably amen god when he makes you he makes you different do you hear me you can see somebody you give him a microphone right here and he starts crying he starts with one word second word third word he cries and you'll be sitting there like why is he crying like that he can just pick it up that's the way god make it anybody care that's his makeup somebody can look at the disaster and the panic and somebody else can look at the same disaster and they come because of their makeup everybody care so now you have to understand your makeup because the devil will play with your makeup anybody care anybody here don't fool yourself like somebody else you not somebody else you are unique on yourself do you hear me i will talk to the young sister and then they will understand amen you might be a little bit more emotional than somebody else you didn't sin you will you're going to cast that devil for nothing it's just your makeup but you need to be conscious of that makeup amen because the your your christian movie will play with you everybody care amen because you never understood that there are certain areas you cannot get into anybody here i'm not talking about filthy that's what you're missing if you're in pornography you're already down in the ditch that's not what i'm talking you still happy in higher that's why you struggle with certain things you don't understand why you struggle because maybe by your nature you should not be around boys stay away amen that's it don't fool yourself you're going to go home trying to catch that devil because you don't understand who you are amen you don't pray you don't go to church as you're supposed to go you don't read the bible like you're supposed to go it says been two years you never sat down and listened to a message you never sat down and read the whole sermon book all you do is you're on netflix what do you think you're doing [Music] that's why your conscience become dead back here and now what we're doing we're hammering and then the man is now working or all the the the sister doesn't catch because there has been dough in their conscience they can't get it because you stay in that uh uh a state for so long until it's common it's normal it's an ego that was up there that landed down and now he's sitting listening to the child each other each other shot each other until a prophet have to use a gun do you hear me that eagle was staying there watching the squirrel anybody here what took that eagle away was when brother branham took the shotgun when the prophet took the word and aim it to the ego he helped the ego to leave that that shot each other and go out brother branham was not trying to kill the ego he was trying to scare him to pull him back to his position so when you read brother branham it's a message you're not reading a story he's telling you something in between that story don't read the message like stories it's not stories it's showing you brother branham is the messenger he came and he's holding a shotgun and he's talking to amigo and he realized that the eagle is not supposed to be done here he's supposed to be there he pulled the shotgun the shotgun on the prophet moved the eagle back to position hallelujah amen here that's why we use shotgun to pull you back again where you supposed to go how can you sit with a friend that tells story all the time and you're comfortable and you love them no there is something in you that is craving for that foolishness anybody care because if the holy ghost come that friend have two options either they're gonna correct themselves and change or they're gonna leave you amen and it's better for them to leave you because every day that you're sitting with a friend for five years there is no progression and you sticking with that friend and matter of fact when you leave that friend you have to repent all the time because you were talking about somebody else you were talking about somebody else you were talking about somebody else you were talking about hey push the brake and say wait a minute every time i go to sister so and so house we don't talk about we always talk about somebody else push the break amen amen push the break something is wrong let me talk to somebody if i leave his house i'm up if i leave his house i'm up if i leave the telephone map if i leave the telephone i get something god is in his church don't be deceived amen realize where you are the hardest shell i'm bidding now it's the religious shell that is making you think i have the holy ghost i have the holy ghost i have the yes yes i understand what he's saying but i don't think if i stood for this message that means i have the holy ghost the disciple went with jesus christ it was only one that left judah did they have the holy ghost did cornelius have the holy ghost i will get to cornelius down the road did cornelius have the holy ghost he saw the angel of the lord he didn't have the holy ghost which state was cornelius you see and he was doing good giving arms to the people and praying god continually until the angel of the lord came by no holy ghost you see where it's deadly and god have to send peter to take cornelius into the holy of holies and then from there on nobody talk about cornelius in the bible anymore in other words it is finished job is done let him for the rest of his life everybody that's your problem you playing too much game you're playing too much game amen did you read your bible no are you good normal examine yourself whether you're in the faith how many sermons did you listen last year not even ten zero some of you zero i know what i'm talking about zero if they push the tape it was five minutes and the phone rang and when the phone rang they pick up the phone in two hours to get the the breaking news that is going on the ongoing news in the message go ahead what happened what happened what happened two hours two hours go out and whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you didn't even know oh you didn't hear about them two hours it was the devil that blocked that tape and he's using the same sister over and over the same brother over and over and you love them no something is you is wrong there is a rotten something in you that you keep feeling and it's going greater and you're greater you don't play with the black dog you need to keep him starving that's how you control him amen don't play game don't be on facebook at two o'clock in the morning don't be texting your friend at 2 am teach them to respect you amen because young people now have a message network somebody told me they have like a message network for young people they text each other because they got their cell phone and they text each other even at night and you watch sister so and so he's texting sisters so and so they're in a group with sister so and so it is all you do is if you have a reception you will see all of them meet together no they already communicated at night they know where they're going to meet they know what they're going to do they know what and it's a mixed multitude it's it's a man young men and young women a group of young men young women get out of that ten men get out of that stay with the young sisters get out of her not young sister and young brother we just fell how many times do you talk about the word over there nothing oh no no no there is a group some men from arizona some from mississippi so and then they have like a group chat like this and they just communicated they like a hundred of them or 50 of them they just communicated and before you know you start a debate somebody put a code and somebody said this and somebody said wasting of time [Music] hypocrite stubborn people don't listen to parents arrogant they don't want to listen they don't want to go to church fighting preachers all of them mixed together into it you rather stay alone it's very good sometimes just stay alone because the same young men will see you what you're doing on that and will never marry you because they know you this woman oh she's always them the next one who nobody knows about that's the one they're gonna pick when i will talk to you young sister i wish i would show you how boys think the wicked when they don't have the holy ghost did you hear me the wicked when they don't have the holy ghost you're going to have a scar in your life that will stay with you through marriages and you still have something that bothers you till you get to heaven boys when they don't have the holy ghost the the the wicked i was a boy i was not doing wicked stuff but i was sitting there and you watch what they're talking and the plan they have for a girl it's wicked you have no clue what they're trying to do you have no clue until brother branham said they were drinking coca-cola and somebody put the pills you thought they're gonna drink beer to put a pill no it was a coca-cola before you know it use car for life you're gonna bother that thing all the time you're gonna battle with it with your husband and your husband might say no you lying you just made up that story you gotta prove the proof that they put him to custody they put him to jail to sure bring the pastor there to testify put your hand in a bible too much headache you will love me one day my friend of me one day i'm not gonna play with that devil i will shoot him i will shoot him i would [Applause] and here he leaves you alone and you clean like a whistle because the time is very bad when i'm dealing with those things and 11 years old they're 10 years old molested he make me angry it makes me really really angry and when i'm telling you stay away i know what i'm talking about because you don't know sometimes i don't talk to people sometimes you will see somebody outside asking a question and so brother robert knows what i'm talking about and i can't answer because i'm not their pastor and they're pulling questions and they're putting their say no go back to your pastor go back to your but i know i can see the answer right there where it's going on but i cannot so people are looking for help get yourself out from the mess let god blossom you prosper you open your heart don't be too rushed don't make crazy stuff god is simple he loves you he's not the christianizing you when he's showing you where you are it's only for you to be conscious and to move to the next level and to move to the next level because brother branham said the holy ghost that justify you is that same holy ghost that will sanctify you and the same holy ghost that will put you in the holy of holies but you have been turning a mountain for so long maybe you were under justification for so long you made a lot of mess you need to stop and move forward maybe you're in sanctification for so long you need to move on everybody care be conscious of who you are and be honest with yourself and be serious with yourself and you will see the god that we're talking here will leave the tapes and that god will begin to talk to you you will be praying like this and you say something came over me now it's no longer a history now you begin you can tell somebody i was praying somebody came in the room you can tell somebody i was sitting and something struck me i opened the bible it's there now i see what brother stephen usually say they both say they both say the boss now it's no more brother stephen it is working on you that's where i want you to i want you to be able to get in your marriage you're sleeping and somebody woke you up and say go around and open your daughter's door and you open the door's door and you see them on the phone mama and then you say give me that phone that's the holy ghost i want you the holy ghost that is like like like an alarm watching your house like this and comes back and say mama mama that boy over there is on facebook and mama just come slowly open the door and say what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing open this and you see or everything you say this is what were you doing don't get upset it is grace that open up the door to point you it's god watching that's the holy ghost we're talking about until you get to this church and you're afraid because somebody would look at you and say you were outside sleeping all right let's stand hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord church you need to give value to the word of god put everything aside give god's the preeminence and you will see how your life will be easy you won't push hard the way you push god will bless you read the read israel just obey the commandment and god is duty is obligated to bless you if you can do that satan will tempt you after a while you will see doors that god will open that will blow your mind up amen let's pray heavenly
