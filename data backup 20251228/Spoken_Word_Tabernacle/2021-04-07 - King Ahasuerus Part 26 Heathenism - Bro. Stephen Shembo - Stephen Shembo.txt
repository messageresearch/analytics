the one i'm waiting for cause every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before [Music] amen amen every day with jesus is sweeter than the day before thank you lord amen i was thinking uh sunday last sunday while the brother was preaching her brother shango was preaching i was thinking uh when i grew up in church they always tried to move everybody like the young people especially to the front row they said get closer to the fire get closer to the fire and something i appreciate appreciate about this church is i tell you what we got fire in the back with brother robert and brother kelly and brother shango and brother chim and all the brothers back there and caleb man he could barely sit still the other day i was about to tell another brother to grab the mic and interpret because caleb was all over the place and i'm like we got fire in the front brother lamont the brothers and we got fire in the back so no matter where you sit in this church you're trapped between the fire so if you're missing something that's your fault because we got the fire in the front we got the fire in the back you can try to hide in the back but you you're going to be stuck between the fire i'll tell you that this is the air i breathe [Music] this is the air i breathe i can't remember is it g this is the air i breathe [Music] this is the air i breathe [Music] your holy presence living in me [Music] this is my daily bread this is my daily bread [Music] you're word [Music] spoken to me oh i'm desperate for you are you desperate this evening pull on the gifts [Music] i'm lost without you oh this is the air i breathe it's every part of me oh this is the air i breathe your holy presence your holy presence it's living in me living in me we can't escape it oh this is my daily bread this is my daily bread [Music] this is my day not just sunday and wednesday but daily your very word you're very word if you're listening he'll be speaking to you each day spoken to me and if you're desperate for him sing and now oh i'm desperate for you and as our pastor comes this evening oh i'm lost without you singing i'm desperate for you [Laughter] and i'm desperate for [Music] without you amen amen let's just hold the music and sing it one more time to him i'm desperate for you oh and i'm lost without you lift your voice church sing it to him raise your hands this evening sing and [Music] oh i'm desperate for you [Music] lord i'm lost without you hallelujah amen amen amen blessed be the name of the lord amen is that the air you grieve his holy presence you know without him we can do nothing amen especially in this hour we are super desperate for him we want to hear from him we want to walk with him we want to breathe with him we want to talk with him we want to do everything with him amen blessed be the name of the lord thank you very much physician i saw online that there was a a prayer request from sister rose mary she said that their two cents went home to be with the lord in kenya and she has to remember the families in prayer so when you go home in your car in your deep prayer so please remember those family in prayer even though we have a blessed hope but separation in the body always hurt amen brother kalima also lost his brother-in-law up north so his family wife and children are in canada but he passed away in the u.s so there is no way for the wife to come into the u.s to be part of the funeral so it's a little bit tough on her so remember the family in prayer and i believe to the best of my understanding the funeral could be next week so remember brother kalima and remember the family in prayer and ensure coverage your prayer amen for the house meeting it's going to be a brother john porterhouse that's what i saw in the church of announcement right it's on the 17th at brother john porter house i believe brother david down the road we might have to send a mass text for his address for those who have not been there they have remodeled their house so that would be a good opportunity to start with amen blessed be the name of the lord so you have your question brother abel already spoke about it get your question fill in the box i saw some of them some are tough but we'll get through them amen but if you would please write your name then he's going to help me amen don't be shy just put your name it's going to help me and if i feel like this question doesn't need to be answered in front of everybody then we got to make an appointment and sit and talk with you versus you shoot it in the air and i don't know what's going on and some of them need to be answered in a different setting amen blessed be the name of the lord the last thing i believe the building fund brought the mica daily is it this coming sunday the building fund offering just to double check so those online that are not here or those that are going to stream because they are work just remember this sunday we're going to pick up the building fund the lord has been working powerfully in that building farm amen it's growing little by little but it's accomplishing a lot of stuff amen yesterday [Music] somebody sent me a text and what happened the person was looking was changing clothes or trying to pick up a certain clothes and wear it and he found out that he had money in the pocket that he completely forgot about it amen so he sent me a message and i didn't respond on time and he sent the second message and he told me i'm just paraphrasing he said you better respond quickly before i use this money the lord put it in my heart for building fund so i respond quickly i say you can come on in so he drove all the way to my work and handed me the envelope do you want me to keep it secret that's the problem since the seal are broken amen there is no more secret right so he handed me an envelope everything cash i ask him i say how much is this can you imagine it was two thousand dollars [Applause] somebody who had two thousand dollars in the pocket and forgot about it amen i called the treasurer i said look at what happened he was like wow i went straight to the bank put the money in get the receipt snap a picture send him and send the treasure for accountability so the lord is working powerfully don't get discouraged we're moving on amen blessed be the name of the lord that's just the testimony to encourage you that god is working amen he is working in people's life he's working financially he's working everywhere i've seen people getting delivered one after the other amen so remember when a damn when a demon is gone don't relax fortify yourself by the holy ghost because he will try to come back and test if the house is still empty amen you don't want to be found empty let's go to number chapter 23 praise be the name of the lord we touched on a major key which was the god of variety there are certain keys in this message if you miss them you're gonna have trouble in a message you're gonna have trouble understanding brother branham amen so it's important now to begin to share all these things so it's going to help you navigate through the message and tonight lord's willing before we progress a little bit deeper i'm going to touch one more just to help you out because if you miss it then it might turn into legalistic view because you didn't understand the very mind of god amen it's easier when you there is a certain avenue of the black dog when you begin to enter there it sounds like it's legalistic if you don't understand correctly or if you didn't catch the vision this message have a vision once you catch the vision no matter what court they're going to bring to you you will navigate without any problem if you never caught the vision you're going to have question after question of the question spinning around and you don't understand the prophet once you catch the vision even though you don't have a scripture you will feel the holy spirit can navigate easily without any problem amen so tonight we're going to touch one of them let's go to number 23 verse 7. if you dare you can say amen i could continue down with the high heel if i go it might be tough on somebody so we want you to understand what is really demand of god what is the mind of god toward us once you get that then you're going to understand why this is wrong why this is wrong why this is wrong everything becomes easier amen like when you understand the god of variety if you bring me any quotes where brother branham is talking about mixed marriages i'll sit with you and go through it without any problem because you already grasped the concept if you lose it you put it on brad branham then you begin to attack him not understanding that brother branham only caught the mind of god to count i mean to grasp the concept of god once you get it that's why the message is like a channel of inspiration once you get it you catch the mind of god then everything becomes planned without any problem amen number 23 verse 7 if you're there you can say amen this is balaam prophesying he say and he took up his parable and say bella the king of moab has brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east you might be seated saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel i believe everybody is familiar with this scripture this is the king barak israel was coming out of egypt going to the promised land and moab was jealous toward israel so he hired a prophet by the name of balaam to come and to curse israel and also to defy israel in other words to curse them to destroy them amen verse 8 how shall i curse whom god has not cursed that's why no weapon form against you shall prosper if god put you on a certain category no matter what's going to happen nobody will move you from that category amen how shall i curse whom god has not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord has not defiled in other words the devil always need permission to do something in your life that's why before the devil attack job he must be granted permission and that permission always have limitation and that permission will not be above your strength because the bible says you cannot be tempted above your strength so if your strength is 10 god will never give the devil 11 permission amen god will give the devil either 10 or below 10 knowing that when he's coming to you you are already equipped even though you don't think you are equipped but that's why the bible said resist the devil how are you going to resist the devil because you already been built against certain things if you recognize yourself the devil will be powerful will be perilous blessed be the name of the lord amen so how shall i curse whom god has not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord has not defied this is the key now verse 9 for from the top of the rocks i see him he's looking at jacob he's looking at israel and from the hills are behold him lo the people shall dwell alone the people of israel are not supposed to be mixing with other people you follow me not a mixer but it's a people that would wear separated alone anybody clear come on and shall not be reckoned among the water the nation so israel cannot be put among the nation the lifestyle of israel the the the custom of israel the way israel is living its own life will be completely separated from any nation on planet earth amen so nobody can fit israel and israel cannot fit the world this is the earth the earth is filled with people anybody follow me out of this earth god picked a bunch of people that are called the jews amen and he pulled the jews out from the world amen and then when he pulled them out they are called the israel of god they are jews and sometimes they are referred to as hebrews everybody clear everybody else that remain in this setting are called hidden oh pagan or gentile anybody can yeah praise be the name of the lord so when they look from the top of the rock i see him as israel and from the hill and behold him lord the people shall dwell alone that's why god separated them amen and shall not be reckoned among the nation this is a peculiar nation a peculiar people a peculiar country that must live a different lifestyle than anybody else on planet earth everybody clear let's go to james chapter 3. amen james chapter 3 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen this wisdom this wisdom descends not from above but it's earthly sensual and devilish so right here there are two wisdom there is a wisdom from above hope good one there is a wisdom for a from above which is a godly wisdom everybody there and there is a wisdom from the earth which is earthly but the description the bible gives is the wisdom from the earth is water it's essential do you know what it means five senses anybody clear it's connected to lust and it's water devilish it's from the devil do you see the wisdom you've got he said the wisdom is earthly it's sensual it's devilish verse 16 for where envy and strafies there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first water pure this is a different kind of wisdom it's pure number two it is peaceable three gentle and easy to being treated full of mercy and good fruits without personality in other words it's without favoritism it doesn't favor certain people against other that's why the church needs to be ruled with a heavenly wisdom amen and without hypocrisy meaning whatever they tell you in the mouth it's exactly what is in the heart right here this wisdom are represented in eden as two trees the tree of life everybody clear and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we clear let's go to first john chapter chapter 2. israel is a nation but it's a nation that is not reckoned among the nation of the world no wonder abraham when he went he was looking for a city not an earthly city but a city whose building and thunder is who god not reckon among the cities of the earth it's a heavenly city which is jerusalem which is the mother of us all first john chapter 2 verse 15. if you dare you can say amen love not what the word here is not israel love not water everybody clear now love not the world neither the things that are in the world so not only the world itself but even the things that are in the world don't like him that's god amen if any man loves the world the cosmos we already explained this the politics the fashion remember on sunday if you love those things the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world we explain you this the last of the flesh the temptation of jesus the first one the last of the eyes the second temptation of jesus christ and the pride of life is not of the father but of the water so there is three categories that are in this kind of life that is left here god pulled israel out of here but whatever is left there is living under those three categories the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the proud of life everybody clear verse 17 and the world passes away in other words what you cling to in the world one of this day is gonna be burnt out completely it's gonna pass away heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away amen the world passes away and the last day of so the world has lost everybody there but when the world will be cleaned up pericomia completely wiped out then that last also will be taken out sin will be completely removed and the world passes away and the last thereof but he that does the will of god a bad for water so you want to stay with the word of god because heaven and earth will pass away but the word will remain so if you do the will of god you become the word the the heaven and earth will pass away but if the word remain you gonna also remain forever because the word of god abideth forever everybody clear let's pray them heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father for giving us another opportunity to gather together in the midst of the week around the revealed world of the hour father your children have been at work some probably in school or many different things lord but lord they made it all the way to your house lord sacrificing lord father their desire or their their feeling of being tired and everything but willing to give you preeminence lord father because this is the hour where you ask and you are looking for preeminence in your blood father we thank you for your divine love in the heart of your children and we want to commit this service unto the hand may you help me and move me completely out of the way may you seal every spirit that is contrary to your divine nature away from this place lord but may only the holy spirit and the angels of the lord be the one ministering tonight to your children lord may you unfold lord the door of revelation to your children so that they can really catch the mind lord father of the lord because your prophet told us lord that revelation is the work of the spirit it is now revealed by flesh and blood but it takes a supernatural action of the holy spirit in the heart of your children to open the eyes of the heart lord so that they may receive the engrafted word of god that can save their soul father we committed unto the hand and asked in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you tonight we are continuing on this subject we on part 26 everybody clear amen when we got on ezekiel chapter 16 let's go to genesis chapter 3 then i'm going to build back up from there that's where we were on sunday and we're going to blend it with ezekiel and go to where we want to go tonight genesis chapter 3 verse 5 if you dare you can say amen for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open man and a woman in the garden of eden were not children they were adults completely adam was not a baby adam was created a full man in a full stature but adam was there with a holy veil him and his wife to the point that they could look at one another being naked but they could not recognize that they were naked they were there with a holy veil everybody clear now the bible says in verse 5 for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened god created adam he created eve he created them as gods already but that deity according to god god decided and god chose that it was better for his deity to be failed from something anybody clear he didn't want them to be acknowled to have the knowledge or to have the conscience that they were naked now the devil came in and tried to break into that veil to open their eyes not to something that is good but to just open their eyes to recognize that they were naked everybody clear and you shall be as god knowing good and evil which is the tree we explained this on sunday and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired and to make one water wise that's the wisdom right here that james was talking about he was a tree but that tree has a wisdom and that wisdom he look good to eve because the devil always masks what he's gonna do with something good but if never knew that what she was partaking on is going to be a devilish wisdom ever clear blessed be the name of the lord then the tree to be desired to make one wise a tree to be desire a tree that can cause lust she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did it verse 7 and the eyes of death of them both were what opened and they knew that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves apron in the garden of eden we had a full man and a full age mature woman both of them were innocent and they were veiled by the veil of god it took a sexual act to break the veil of holiness and open their eyes and once their eyes were open in other words once the black dog was turned on in eden the first thing that happened he brought them conscience about their nakedness and they became concerned on how they need to dress themselves make sense so when we look at this stage of human life in our part here we didn't come like adam adam was created if was created and both of them came automatically mature people in our way we are born through sex that sex brother branham said he talks about the blood amen that's why all able have to offer blood in the garden of eden everybody clear so when we are born in this world we don't come like adam adam came completely a full mature man but we always come like babies but even though we come like babies we go through the same process that adam went because as a baby god also put a veil unto you that you don't recognize good from evil let's go to deuteronomy chapter 1 verse 30 time if you dare you can say amen if you don't want to turn on that it's on the board the bible said moreover your little ones not the adult one not the big one your little ones which you say should be a prey and your what children we know the age brother branham described to us that it's one all the way from zero all the way to 12 years old and we found even in the life of jesus christ so your little one which you say should be a prey and your children which in that day had no water knowledge between water and water from the scripture ever clear so when adam was created god blocked the black dog no knowledge of good and evil but we come through sex as children born in sin shape and iniquity but when we come as children god also blocked the black dog by putting a veil upon us that's why the scriptures say the children the little one they have no knowledge between what good and evil they're under the state of innocency automatically the blood of the lamb is claiming them and speaking for them if something ever happened to one of them they're going straight to heaven ever clear so far blessed be the name of the lord which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go into them and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it in other words israel seeing god say oh that generation they have their eyes already open all of you are gonna die i'm not gonna take you to the promised land i'm gonna take the edge of the children that have not opened the door to the black dog yet that's the generation i'm gonna take to put them into the promised land amen this innocency is different than the innocency of babylon because just like there are two wisdom there are two trees they are also too innocency if you go in the message power of transform of transformation and set an eden if you read or you listen to those two messages brother branham explained that correctly so if you go to john chapter 4 verse 11 the bible said that and should none should not i spare nineveh nineveh was the capital of water who knows babylon ever clear now we are not in israel we in babylon so there are two trees two islam we also have two veil everybody the veil that was in the garden of eden that protected adam and eve and if brother branham said he was a holy veil of the holy spirit anybody clear but the veil that comes from babylon brother branham said it is the last veil you need a coach you see me and should i not spare nineveh babylon that great city are more than six quarter thousand persons that cannot discern between water their right hand and their water in other words they are living any kind of life they don't even know what is good and what is bad again they're under a veil but that veil is not a holy veil it is a different veil because god sent a prophet by the name of jonah and told jonah to go preach in the city that if they don't repent god will destroy them ever clear so to break the veil of lust you need a prophetic message are you there he took a prophet by the name of jonah and jonah spent three days in the belly of the world and jesus when he came he said as jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of a whale such as the son of man spent three days and three nights in the heart of the earth he was speaking about the resurrection the miracle the son of jonah was a sign of resurrection so when you want to break the veil of lust you need first a prophet you need a prophetic ministry not any kind of ministry you need a prophetic ministry with the power of resurrection everybody that's why paul said i must know him in the power of resurrection paul was a prophet with the power of resurrection i come with you not with the word of wisdom of man but with the demonstration of the power of the holy spirit to break the last of babylon you need a prophetic ministry that is bringing jesus christ out from history everybody so far in revelation chapter 3 verse 17 because that says i am water reach and increase with goods and have needs of nothing and know if not that they are wretched come on and miserable kama and poor kama and blind this blindness doesn't mean everybody in this world is blind this is not a natural blindness it is a spiritual blindness it is a spiritual veil called blindness that's the reason why when the syrians were looking for elisha elisha just told them that i am who are you looking for they didn't know that he was elijah something elijah something came on their eyes they could look at elisha but still they can't recognize him because they were blinded with something everybody cleared so far so that noise that they are righteous and miserable and poor and blind and water and here again in the midst of laodicea in the midst of babylon again great babylon the mystery we found again the people of the earth under a different blindness under a different veil but that veil also they are naked but they don't know it is not a holy veil because god is condemning the age the veil of nineveh was not a holy veil because god sent a prophet to condemn that's why laodicea needed a prophetic ministry with the power of resurrection that's why brother brother must come because we were under the veil of laodicea and that veil needs to be broken by the prophetic ministry with the power of resurrection because god does not change everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord let's go to genesis chapter 10 now let me see where we are good genesis chapter 10 you need your bible today anyway any days in this church genesis chapter 10 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen now we're building up genesis chapter 10 verse 8 everybody there and cush father who nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter remember when we talk about the zodiac he was oriented anybody remember he was a married uh maddie hunter brother branham said he was so skilled in the art of hunting that he uses the art and created a powerful army and through the army he conquered the entire world and put everybody under him anybody corey okay he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord so he was really renowned and the beginning of his kingdom was water babel baba is the name for babylon anybody clear and eric and arkad and counting in the land of water so we found here that when the earth started the people there was a family of god after a while sin was introduced when sin was introduced something happened there were two seed the seed of cain went on the way and then the seed of god continued on set and ebola sad ever clear then after a while they begin to mix together and then the world was completely polluted then god sent a prophet by the name of noah and by the noah and by noah came the flood and the flood destroyed everybody else and the only people that stay on the planet therefore was eight people and through those eight people they begin to multiply again and among the people that were multiplied there was a man now that is called nimrod everybody clear now now this name road the bible says that he built babel he was the one that built babel or the city of babylon and this city was in the land of shanna what does he mean where are we heading amen watch again verse 11 out of that land which land is somebody sleeping look at your scripture let me go back to verse 10. and the beginning of his kingdom was babel babylon and eric and arkad and carne he was the one building those city in the land of shanna out of darling went forth a shoe and built minivan we just saw nina video everybody clear now and they and the city rio boat and carolyn everybody clear go to genesis 11 verse 1. you there verse 1 and the water everybody in the planet earth without exception because there were only eight people that were left and they all begin to multiply and all of them begin to live into the same place called the valley of what the land of channel now the half i want you to get it no expection israel is not existing here okay there is no israel amen the all heart was of water so everybody before god started the nation of israel let me pull israel out everybody had the same language i want you to get this so you understand what is the mind of god and of what one speech so do you don't need any translator verse two and it came to pass as their journey who journey the whole earth they were moving together as a unit as their journey from the east that they found a plan in the land of water so for you to understand genesis 10 that we just read you need to start with genesis 11. make sense genesis 10 already tell you they are in the land of shana but genesis 11 is giving you the background that everybody was in one place they were all moving from one place to a certain spot and that's what was in the land of shana that's the land that nimrod raymond anybody clear and they dwell there verse three and they say one to another go to in other words come let us make bricks and burn them totally and they had breaks for stone and slam her dead for murders they say come let us build a city and a tower who stop marriage what the heaven what a unity and let us make us a name a denomination the first denomination in the bible that's why in the book in revelation the bible says you have a name that i hate anybody clear let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the world we want to stay together we want to stick together let's build something let everybody stay let hold the denomination under our own name who was doing this you go back to verse 10 to chapter 10 you're going to see nimrod verse 5 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built everybody together remember this is after the flood this is not before the flood everybody else already died this is the generation after the flood and the lord say behold the people is water so everybody in the earth not only have they the same language the same speech but they also have the same mind but not under god under amen beyond the people is one and they have water oh no exception i want you to get clearly no exception have one language everybody speak english i'm just taking an example and this they begin to do and now nothing will work when unity is there there is power amen whether it's under god or without god they still have power because it's the laws of god you commit adultery you can have a child you get married you can have a child because you're going through the laws but one is bad one is good yet both get children make sense somebody asked me a question can a woman preach what about if a woman preached and somebody said i say no problem you can have a child through adultery said the child will leave but adultery will be condemned i said you can get saved but that woman is condemned by the scripture hallelujah and nothing will restrain from them which they have what they were working by their imagination not inspiration noah built an ark with the inspiration of god but now these kind of men were going with their water so everybody one language one mind which is an earthly mind imagination to do god said come let us go down and there confront them god came to confuse them when the church goes in unity they therefore want to come and confuse the church this one said this one did this this one say this one this this this one say this one to bring confusion and break the unity recognize the devil in his tactics then we're going to overcome when somebody brings something you stop you say wait a minute you talking about sister so-and-so hold on right there let me call the sister i'm going to pick sister brilliant sister bridget god bless you i have sister x here she just told me that you said this this this this this realize the system you're going to drive the devil out they have two choices what brother said either they're going to be converted or they're going to leave you and go somewhere else anybody clear go to let us go down and they'll confirm their language that they may not understand what one another we're not talking anymore the same language what's gonna happen so the lord scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth and they left up to build the water so when we are not in unity speaking the same thing that's why you go in the new testament paul was telling the church to have one mind because you want to stop the progress of the work you're trying to achieve by having 3 7 twenty forty miles anybody here and therefore is the name of it called water bevel meaning confusion because the lord did there confined the language of the earth of all the earth and from there did the lord scatter them abroad from the face of the the earth so from here we found out that this unity was broken in pieces everybody went to their own place but carrying the same knowledge under a different language do you get me that's why you can look at the deity of the greek the gods of the greek the gods of the roman the gods of the indian the god of the egyptian you're gonna find similarity in those other worshipping because the scatter but the concept were gone differently you go in the east you're gonna see mother and children you go to the egyptian mother and children you go to the roman mother and children they all were living in one place they got scattered the language changed but the doctrine remained the same if they were condemned when they were in unity even though they scattered everywhere they scattered they were all condemned if they were condemned as united states are you following me when they become separate state they were still condemned because they carried the same idolatry and doctrine of nimrod everybody clear now let's go job to verse 31 now watch now the beginning of your faith i hope time is not flying on me let's go verse 31 and who ah we're talking about abraham so brother stephen abraham came right from the midst of this there is a key i want you to catch tonight then your legalistic way of the message will be gone then when god gives you a command you will understand it is not a law but it is actually mercy when they say don't wear high heels you won't take it anymore as a lord you follow me right in the midst of this where was our father abraham how can our father which we preach all these years came up from the midst of that he was supposed to be living separate a good man he came from there amen and terror took abraham his son and lord the son of heron his son's son and sarah his daughter-in-law his son's abraham's wife and they went forth with them from water of the water so abraham came out from babylon everybody scattered but abraham remained in babylon in the very center of it abraham never moved and god went in the center of the devil headquarter and pick abraham and pull him out of it god did not go in the one that scattered in africa he didn't go to the one that went to america he went to the one to the very headquarter just like when jesus died he went to hell and in the very corner of the headquarters of the devil he picked the old testament said and pulled them out of him are you there there is no limitation for god to rescue his child amen no matter how deep you are in the mark of this world amazing grace will reach down go down go down pick you up and pull you up again are you there it is easy to think maybe he can take abraham out of egypt no he went to the very corner and left a predestinated seat there to prove to the devil that i can give you moses and you can take care of me you can let him grow let him in enjoy life and train him the bible says moses was trained in all the what wisdom of egypt yet i can come and break that wisdom and turn that prophet against you you might be trained under somebody i hope you get it are you there you might be trained under somebody and god let that person train you and turn around and use you as a weapon to bring it it's down the scripture ever here and he went forth with them from all of the counties to go into the land of water now somebody called abraham left this branch of group everybody here and went for the land of canaan but abraham was not a christian let's go to genesis 12 verse 1. now the lord has said to abraham get out from your water for the first time when god began to deal with an individual that was under the leadership of the system of nimrod god told that individual to separate from his country you follow me number two separate from your kindred your family i was born with them leave them and from your father's house cut off oh my god to a land that i will show you everybody will scatter in their own land but you i am the one that's gonna choose your lander i will show you the lamb verse 2 and i will make you a water abraham left this jurisdiction and god want to make abraham a great nation but nations already existed nations were scattered babylon existed nineveh existed all over the earth there were people scattered but god said i'm gonna bring a nation in the world that's gonna be different from all of you you follow me i will bless you and make your name water great and you shall be a blessing and i will bless them that bless you and curse him that curses you and in water in you shall all the water are you following me all the family of the earth was under the devil anointing you follow me i am pulling you abraham and i'm gonna make you a nation and through your door i'm gonna enter the world and i'm gonna rescue all the nation of the earth back to me because nimrod took them away from me you follow me are we okay drop to verse 7 and the lord appeared to abram and said to your water now not only is he promising land is he promised to be a blessing to the entire world now abraham is promised also a seed so abraham came out from here and went over there and god said out of this little circle i'm gonna use it to rescue the entire earth anybody clear job to value to genesis 22 then we move on faster now genesis 22. if you dare you can say amen genesis 22 verse 18 the temptation of abraham everybody clear verse 18 and in your water always singular not seeds and in your seed shall all the water again all the nations that are left that i didn't want to deal with them i'm gonna use you and through you abraham i'm bringing a seed and that seed will go into all the world through the means of the gospel will go all the world to rescue all my children that have been scattered back to me do you follow me amen all the nation of the world the earth be blessed because you have done what obey my voice abraham abraham is there god call him he took his family out he moved from uh of the cardin he went to aaron and when his father died he went to the land of canaan a back here then god gave him a promise that you're going to be the father of many families many nations what is going on let's go now to galatians 3. are you okay i want you to get something then you're going to understand everything even on your christmas we never been taught about christmas give me only time tonight and you're going to see what's going on why you do why we don't do certain things not because of a legalistic approach we're putting people in prison we're putting people in prison missing the mind of god galatians 3 are you there verse 6 everybody clear even as who abraham believed god and he was accounted to him for what for righteousness brother kelly know you there for that day which are of what god now begin to speak about the faith the faith you already sent the law they don't know of faith the same are the children of water abraham so the jews that are born by abraham having faith doubts are the children of abraham because they automatically they are jews watch this clearly verse eight catch it make sure you read it yourself verse eight it's not on the board are you there and the scripture for seeing that god will justify the jews remember everybody that was here was water heathen and what pagan or coward the people of the world worldly people but what god was doing with abraham was a preview to what he's gonna do to who to the hidden so abraham was also a what are you there that's why god told him i'm pulling you from hedonism you follow me i want to clean you up separate from your country separate from your family separate from your father's house i'm gonna take you out somewhere why the scripture for saying that god will justify the hidden by who by through faith preach before the gospel to who how did he preach the gospel to abraham what is preaching the gospel who preached the gospel to abraham did he have a pastor preach the gospel before to abraham saying in who you shall all the nation be water so right here abraham was a hidden not a jew not a christian job to verse 14 that the blessings of abraham may come on the who the hidden through who i have a seed that seed is called jesus christ it's one seed i'm gonna use that seed through your door abraham to go back to the gentile and to carry them out because out of every kindred every tongue every nation i am pulling my people back you follow me hallelujah that we might receive the promise of water who's going to receive the promise of the spirit not the jew the who can you say it aloud oh praise god the gentile true faith everybody follow me present i speak after the manner of men do it be but a man's covenant yet if he be confirmed no mendizano or add there too watch verse 16 now to abraham and his what singular where the promise made paul very detailed he said not and to his what paul is saying to you that go back in the old testament you will notice that god never spoke about seed in plural not seed as of many but as of water and to your seed which is who so that seed of abraham is the man of galilee which is the son of god who is god in other words i am gonna enter the world through the door of the jewish people as a man who's gonna be called jesus christ and i myself will die for them be buried resurrected so i can go all over the world and preach the gospel and as many as believe and will receive him shall be called sons of who everybody here so far is the bible lovely yummy blessed be the name of the lord job to verse 22 but the scripture has concluded who oh you follow me everybody the entire earth was under what or have seen him come short of what you were created for his glory make sense make sense remember on sunday amen verse 22 but the scripture had concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe everybody god puts you down you are sin verse 26 you there for you are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus by the day something is working amen for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on who there is neither water you see now you see now the jews are no more privileged i only use them as a door there is no more jews no greek there is neither bond nor free check that by the way if it's okay yeah the battery is pretty much good brother caleb you got the battery when he gets yummy that's when he start bothering me amen so there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond no free there is neither male no water for you are all one in who everybody clear verse 29 and if you be christ then you are abraham what and hell according to the abraham eden let's go to roman two now we get really deep to them honey let's go to roman two if you dare you can say amen where did you learn the bible like this it is the message of the hour amen amen one second let's bring you amen if not i can use that one just like market daily say this amen everything clear let me get the bazooka thank you everybody clear ah blessed be the name of the lord let's go to roman 2 verse 29 everybody clear everybody there let me look at the time yeah i won't take you too long even though kids don't have school [Laughter] romans 2 chapter 28 you there for he is not a what now paul is removing everything from israel you see now you give credit to the jews i'm removing that i was only using them as a door there is neither no jews which is of outwardly in other words it's not natural it's not the flesh neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one water inwardly so the true jew is not the natural man it is the inside man and those jews are everywhere not only in israel amen and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose presence is not of man but of who god amen go to chapter three verse one paul we know that we gave credit to the jews we know that the jews the gospel came to the jews they're the one that have abraham they have isaac jacob so do you mean that what they did is nothing ever clear roman uh three verse one what advantage then has the what so paul is asking if the jew is no more connected to the flesh so what is the advantage of being a jew or what prophet is there of what circumcision paul is answering much every way chiefly because that to them were committed the oracle of what god used them as a sample to work something through them but it was a dog god he was using to enter the world to rescue all his people anybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord verse 3 for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect in other words if all the jews did not believe in the law it doesn't make the law of non-effect if some people don't believe the message it doesn't make the message of non-effect the message is still god provided way for this hour whether you believe it or not the message stand [Applause] hallelujah your unbelief will not hinder god it will hinder yourself god will continue his program and does that have the love of god will receive the truth of the hour be changed and ready for the rapture hallelujah jump to verse nine blessed be the name of the lord what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before prove both what and what that they are all around the world you see now everybody under sin you see now no more privilege hallelujah let's jump to verse 10. as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand there is none that sick after god matter of fact the jews crucified the messiah they are all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that is good no not what nobody hallelujah jump to verse 19 now we know that what thinks whatsoever the law says it says to them who are under the law that every month might be stopped and all the water all the water watch here oh the world might be underwater guilty before who so everybody's guilty abraham came from there everybody clear verse 20 therefore by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophet ever clear verse 22 even the righteousness of god which is by faith abraham of jesus christ to all and upon all that believe for there is no word for i have done what and come what short of the glory of who everybody on the planet is completely short from the glory of god yet god created you for his glory now he's coming to redeem you so that you can manifest that glory therefore glorify god in your body hallelujah verse 27 where is the busting then it is excluded by what law of work nay but by the law of what therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deed of the is he the god of the jews only is he not also the god of the gender yes of the word you understand the jew was just a temple amen saying it is one god which shall justify their circumcision the jews by faith and the uncircumcision the gender through what both of us we are equal you understand now let's go to roman four now amen jump to verse nine comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision only the circumcision are the jews they were the one that was circumcised they are circumcision are the gentiles the hidden or the pagan everybody clear for we say that faith was welcome to abraham for what now we're going back to abraham how was he then reckoned watch paul when he was in what circumcision or in what in other words the promise of god of abraham was given to abraham when he was a jew or was he given to him when he was a hidden you see now i'm going out from the jewish back to the original america for we say abraham that faith was of verse 10 how was he then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in our circumcision not in circumcision but in what and circumcision and he received the son of circumcision as a seal a confirmation in other words god called abraham when abraham was a hidden not a jew and god gave him the promise when he was not circumcised yet he has nothing to do with jews that's why jesus was not a jew he was not a gentile he have no father no mother no beginning of days no ending the blood of jesus was created by god everybody clear job 2 verse 13 amen uh oh my god let me go to verse 11 and we received the son of circumcision a seal of righteousness of faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not what even though they are gentle what matter is the predestinated seed that's all i'm looking at i'm not looking at whether you are jew or gender my children are scattered that's why i gave abraham the promise when he was not a jew because if abraham was a jew the jew will kick you all out now i gave him when he was a gentile so the jew will not boast if he begin to say abraham is our father we're going to ask a jew was abraham a jew or he was a gentile he was a gentile so i am part of it you understand now god took it away from the jew everybody clear verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the step of the faith of our father abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world now not only one one uh one person but the whole world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of what faith job to verse 17. as it is written i have made you a father of many water one person i'm gonna make you a great nation but out of you i'm gonna go toward the nation and carry them before him who believe even god who makes alive the dead and call those things which be not as though the way ever clear who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many what according to that which was spoken so shall your seed be ever clear go now to ephesians 2 i might have to stop somewhere i thought i'm going to get this finish let's go to ephesians chapter 2 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord ephesians 2 verse 11. are you there wherefore remember that you being in tampa who pagan and circumcised hidden in the flesh not in the heart because now god is now looking at the flesh who are called on circumcision but that which is co-op in other words when the jew sees you they call you on circumstance that's why david look at goliath and say on circumstance philistine now paul say let's put the ball down let's start from the beginning you claim abraham to be your father was he circumcised or not no wonder they kill him are you there by which is caused circumcision in the flesh by hands that at that time you were without who being alien from the commonwealth of who and stranger from the covenant of promise having no one and without him in the because everybody was under the idolatry of me murder are you there everybody shut up there everybody clear but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were a pharaoh are made near by the blood of jesus for he is our who has made both we are no more separated no more jew and greek and has broken me the wall of what partition between so when jesus christ came that difference jew gentile jesus broke it say my children are everywhere nobody can boast anybody clear having abolishing his flesh the enmity even the law of commandment contained in ordinance for to make in himself of to one human so making peace and that he might reconcile both to who in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a pharaoh and to them that are what near verse 19 now therefore you are no more don't be complex don't be complex when you meet a jew ah this is a jew let me see a jew oh this is the first time i see a jew the real jew is you are you there the real jew is of the heart [Applause] are you there you are no more stranger and foreign but fellow what when we meet we say hey how is our father david you are gentle saying david yes what about my father abraham abraham your father yes by faith hallelujah but fellow citizen with the saint and of the household of who what are we glowing by there are you there jesus met the woman at the world our father worshipped in this mountain and he say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto a woman believe me the hour cometh when it shall be neither in this you the samaritan no in a i'm crossing everything up nor in jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what in other words i'm not gonna decline that i'm using the jews because you samaritan you don't know what you worship are you there we know what we worship for salvation is of the jew of the jew means from the jew because that's the door i used amen but the allah cometh and now he's one the true worshiper so was israel not true worshiper you see now the true worshiper shall worship the father in and in what for the father seeketh such to worship him in other words i'm making a transition i use you temporarily now i have come it is no more a place no more a nation no more a race no more a culture it is god hallelujah hallelujah he that believes in the son of god has the witness in himself he that believeth not god has made him a liar because he believed not the record that god gave his son and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son not in the jews in christ are you there he that has the son has life and he's that has not the son of god has not life that's why brother branham said to know him is life are you there are you there amen let me go back on this one what about that philadelphian age and yes the other ages too did they really accept this reality of christ no sir which reality even though luther brought the truth of justification the romans church and its eastern counterpart the orthodox church still come to what now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is christ or water it is no longer jewish it is in the person of christ [Music] and it is not even quest and work it is crushed alone this age begins begun the years of armenianism that does not believe in christ as the reality he does not sing nothing but the blood for it seeing nothing but the blood and my own conduct now i believe in good conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not jesus plus it is jesus alone salvation is of god from start to finish it is all let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleans me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his trap that heal me let it be jesus and jesus alone not by works of righteousness which i have done no sir christ this man amen hallelujah hallelujah what is the key brother stephen you're trying to draft tonight god is calling us for a separation from hedonism and gentile lifestyle you understand now everybody condemned shut up and sin every single nation in sin there is no nation that you can prove that is better than another nation all condemned in sin are you there so when god is calling you out god wants you to live a different life different than where you came from different than the life of the hidden because the jew to begin with their father was also hidden are you there so when god say don't wear makeup it is not about the law it is a separation from hedonism that's why brother branham said make up come from the zulu it is a hidden thread so when i'm separating you i'm not giving you a law i'm separating you from hedonism are you there let's finish by this why do you separated me from hedonism why at 26 and i said who are the lord and he say i'm jesus whom that persecutes but rise and stand up on their feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee hallelujah hallelujah to make thee a water and a witness both of these things which you have seen and of those in which i will appear unto thee this is paul delivering thee from the water those people were the jew god is talking to paul that i am picking you up i am separating you from the law from the pharisee for the sadducee from everything that is of israel are you there and i am also separating you from the gentile i want you to be a nation that is not reckoned on the earth when you look their city their city is not here abraham was looking for that city it was not an earthly city you representing a different nation i want you to behave different i want you to talk different i want you to dress different i want you to live different because my nation is not represented here my kingdom is not of this world you understand now delivering this from the people and from the water not the gentile because when you say dental yes gentle was out of worship no gentile and jews are you there unto whom now are sandy i'm sending you to who to gentile why do you send him to the gender to open the water so the eyes of the gentile are caused by the veil of babylon you understand now so when the gospel comes is coming to open your eyes when you used to wear paint then you look you take the paint away not by law but by separation from agenda you follow me that's why the message is not a law we put a woman in bondage no we actually telling the woman the way she was supposed to live are you there to open their eyes and to turn who who's them gentle them from water so gentiles under darkness [Applause] [Music] to light and from the power of who gentiles were under the power of satan through the will through the gospel of nimrod he polluted everything that they may receive forgiveness of sin an inheritance among them which are sanctified by what again abraham back to abraham and circumcised that is in me oh my god i'm trying to get something take one of them and then we stop go to act 15. who you who miss this you better get it so you're gonna understand sunday because it's easy i know how that devil comes yeah yeah he's bringing them back again to that legalistic in the message it's been a long time we don't hear stuff like this we're bringing you back to the foundation because when the foundation has shaken woke and the righteous do and this foundation has been shaken let's put it back in place let's go back to the message [Music] it is not easy if you take it as a legalist but if you take it as the god that is coming to move you out of the kingdom of the world then it's a different story amen act 15 14. are you there you there simeon has declared how god at first did visit the what now we are dealing with the gentile i have already come i already use israel i did the work of redemption israel kicked me out now i'm going to the gentile because that's what i was looking for now i'm going to go to the gentile to get my children out of every nation but the gentiles are under darkness the gentiles are under hedonism the gentile or other

love and for your mercy father surely your children were tired coming from work but lord we thank you for giving us such an atmosphere tonight that we can fist lord father on the reveal manner and to understand lord father just like us stated we could go through this channel and continue lord further to uncover the black dog but lord you the one that touched me to come back to give a key to your children to understand that i am not unfolding this to put you in a bondage i'm unfolding this i'm actually delivering you from the power of satan from the kingdom of the world from all the lifestyle and the threat of the hidden that are represented in hell that's why my prophet went to hell and saw those straight and saw the women with eyes like cut and saw those women back in jesse penny and he understood that those three originated from hell they were expressed lord in the scripture through jezebel there was expressed through many people lord father it's not that your people want to be strange into a law it is not a law our law is love lord father it's love that constrains you that comes lord bringing those things out for your children to to all to to have their eyes open to be completely free from the lust of the eyes from the lust of the flesh for the proud of this life lord father made you help the young people understand lord that lord father lust is the wrong thing may they watch the picture the posting on whatsapp on facebook what kind of poster are they taking where did you learn that poster did you copy that poster from a magazine and you want to take a picture like a magazine and post to people you are actually coping a lifestyle of the gender where did you copy what you doing where did you copy what you presenting where did you copy what you are portraying father may the revelation drop deep that it's not a bunch of code of ethic but it's nothing but the unfailing body word of the son of man because when you send your word your word come to heal your children father we commit them unto the hand and are breaking of the devil every spirit that is trying to bind this church and these young people made that turn loose lord by the power of jesus christ father may you granted may you protect us tonight lord as we go into our respective place father touch us remember those that are seeking the body and father touch and continue to minister to us lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless your body able [Applause] church we love you i hope you got the concept we're gonna dig a load to be on sunday then we get back to where we were to finish this up so you understand there is a concept there is a key it is not legalist when you present the message in the legalistic way you miss it it is love amen thank you my brother [Music] amen that was good thank you lord i was thinking i wrote something down uh sunday evening um brother shango mentioned something it was either wednesday or sunday evening but i was talking about when the serpent beguiled eve in the garden of eden it actually might have been brother tim cross last wednesday but i was thinking about it and he was trying to deceive eve and say i like basically hear what i'm saying and you'll be as gods and she missed that she was of gods and that was something brother shango where brother tim was mentioning the other week so i thought about it i was sitting in my seat and i'm like she didn't have a revelation of who she was because if she did she wouldn't have been deceived and i don't know it just hit me like never before that same in this time if we don't have a revelation of what we're here for what god places for what we have the message the truth of the message and get a true revelation of it we could be deceived and even the prophet said it'll be so close that would deceive the very elected if possible and how many is grateful that it's not possible for us to be deceived in this time because we have a true revelation of the word so as the preaching is going forth every sunday every wednesday or if you listen to a tape or whatever it is just make sure you're getting a revelation of that word that's being preached and if you don't understand something ask brother shango because you want to be grounded in that that revelation of the word so you don't you're not deceived like eve and i just wanna thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to deserve such glory revealed in me thanks for that special night when i saw your glorious light came face to face with eternal life and lord i thank thee sing it with me church just wanna thank you lord for letting me hear your have i done to deserve such glory revealed in me thanks for that special night when i saw your glorious light came face to face with the eternal light and lord i think y'all are dismissed this evening my god go with you oh and i just wanna thank you
