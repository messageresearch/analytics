we thank you amen still reading your Cod book your church ages you should be able to finish now hey man so let's make an effort before the coming of the Lord so we make sure we finish amen glory to God we have a wonderful Fellowship yesterday in our appreciation dinner it was really really really really good amen I wish all of you are always there but we needed the people that do some work here amen so we appreciate all your effort all your work God richly bless you if you missed yesterday and you one of the people working in the church just see brother Robert he will handle it amen glory be to God Amen everything will be okay our question and answer will be January the 21st so just hang tight we'll let you know where it's going to be we had a another secret fellowship hall yesterday but brother Kelly told me that the fixing the other one so if you get fixed before time so you know where we should go if not though then we have to do what we got to do amen at the end of the service we have a water baptism so I won't tell you who it is you see him after service amen and uh for local ministers whenever you already scheduled to preach and those on the technique uh the technician just remind me they need to give their title at the beginning so it get loaded and we don't have to go back again and search for the title so if you know you're preaching uh maybe 30 minutes before the service just send your title so they can upload it and we don't have to catch up later because we still have to catch on the other title amen and if uh those who are behind on my uh queue so just be patient with me I did the best that I can last year and those online who send me emails I'm sorry I'm loaded right here as soon as I clear what's going on here then I will reply to your email so if you have you need a counseling with me you're already sent your request and uh you need to talk to me just be patient I have a whole long queue and I did the best that I can some counseling uh 30 minutes somehow two hours some uh three hours and it depends on the category or the nature of what I'm dealing with and when they say three hours that's just the counseling by the time I go home I feel like I'm completely worn out because virtue I'm not a prophet I'm just a preacher but virtue you can feel like you are fighting with spirit because people are getting delivered amen so just be patient some of them take I accept if there is uh an emergency have you been to the emergency room amen they will make you wait but if somebody got shot what did they do to the person so they always have a room somewhere where they just bring the person back quickly so if yours you can still breathe you can still walk so just be patient we handle you but if it's a matter of life and death so then quickly I need to jump and then uh do what I gotta do amen so be really really patient on the email on the text I'm trying the best that I can do on last week of December I closed the office but it was just catching up left and right and there's no way I don't even call it a vacation because it turned up to be a counseling week and things like that amen so stay tight everything will be okay amen so you be patient with me I already retrieved the video for December the 3rd so I assume everybody in this church have watched the video you know what it is I have to restructure certain things with brother Robert the way we operate so we can make things better once I get everything squared away then we will schedule for the voting amen but I have to do a lot of switching a lot of things left and right so we make sure when we get here everybody stay on board amen and every technician anybody who's going to be here you need to follow that order if you come late or something you were not part of the praying before going into the service unless there is an exception or something happened on the highway do not operate just come and sit down because we want everybody to be consecrated and be ready because the Lord is well pleased with it everybody okay again remember separate me from the order I have a responsibility to show you the word where they strike you or you uplift you I have to say the truth everybody okay glory be to God whether you are ready or not here we come let's go to ourselves to our scripture this morning amen I don't know who is struggling that's the boss have to load me last night uh maybe somebody got a poison for what is going on into the message people attacking the message and the Lord some poison somewhere so the boss have to give me scripture and things and a different route to kind of break that completely so pay attention um I was trying brother Robert already laid it out in the song that he sang and if I finish that song here it will be a miracle amen so whoever is struggling online or in here just stay up so we see what we can do because the Lord really loaded a lot my wife can tell you I went to sleep around 3 AM yeah past 3 A.M in the morning because I have to continue loading what the boss is giving me so somebody somehow I don't know who you are friends with because some of you might be friend to the people that already departed from the message you need to be careful amen amen amen can you give me a little bit of microphone so I don't have to worry about it praise God so you need to be careful amen what you fellowshipping they already showed you their position you know what they believe you know what you believe so let's respect to one another amen don't engage into something when you're not even strong yourself amen everybody okay so I don't know what the poke somebody but I gotta handle it yes handle Genesis chapter 2. glory to God amen verse 21 I can't even move past the scripture you can see the scripture keep coming up I can't even move because of the Lord that is there the Bible says and the Lord God cause a deep sleep to fall upon Adam you all know this pretty good you might be seated amen glory to God thank God we didn't erase this so we got everything here amen and the Bible says and he slept you know what he means and he took one of his ribs which doesn't look like a woman it's just a real you cannot marry a rib to a person amen the rib if you pull a rib outside of a person do you have life in that rib it is dead so whoever started with the rib must wish to attend and to the resurrection you forgot two weeks ago you forgot Paul he said if I can only attend to the resurrection in other words Paul knew he's not going to reach there he will die everybody okay and he closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib one rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a water so there was a process as we know which are the seven Church ages and he brought her to the man so if marriage must take place God have to bring you God must take you to your husband nobody else can take you to your husband everybody here if your sister your father or your legal Guardians have to take you to your husband somebody must bring you into the arm everybody okay glory to God made he a woman and brought her to the man Hallelujah and then the Bible says in verse 23 and Adam says this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a woman because she was taken out of her man remember it's only born and flesh and what we emphasize here is Adam have a a reason why he says born of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh because Eve looked just like him amen so whatever state Adam came out from his resurrection that's exactly the way evil looked like amen you can hand it to either everybody that's fine we have a one amen praise be to the name of the Lord amen let's go to roof chapter 3. glory to God it looks like you read it you say I got it when you read it over you see something else amen verse 8 and he come to pass at midnight you will even memorize this scripture that the man was afraid and he turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet you know what he means now and he said who are you and she answered I am roof your hands made spread Therefore your skirt you know what it means over your hands man for you are a near Kingsman amen and he said Blessed Be You of the Lord my daughter for you have showed more kindness in the ladder and then the other beginning so the roof at the end is better than the roof at the beginning it is still roof but the end of roof is better than the beginning [Applause] the Bible says this in the book of Hagar he said the glory of this water a lot of house shall be how greater than off the water former says the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace Shalom say the Lord of host so the glory of the last house [Applause] is better than the glory of the first so the roof of the end time [Applause] is the one roof but the roof of the end time the roof that is asking for marriage is better than the roof of the beginning everybody okay [Music] in as much as you follow that young man whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to you all that you require for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman she had the testimony that she pleased God because somebody had the testimony that she pleased God he pleased God and God did something to that person glory to God verse 12 and now it is true that I am your near Kinsman however there is a Kingsman near the night in other words there is nothing about getting married bearing married I will do it for you but before me and you can get married we gotta deal with something amen and that's something that person is also a near Kinsman as long as that person has a right on roof everybody okay no marriage will come so we got to kick him out everybody okay kick him out kick him out you know that song okay praise God verse 13 He says Terry this night and it shall be in the morning it's still the same day remember that it is still the same day the same age we're not moving to a different age the same age but the timing is different amen Terry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform to you the part of the King's Men well let him do this part this Kingsman part how can you even say that but if he will not do the part of the Kinsmen to you who do they have to redeem roof they have to redeem Naomi right amen amen but Boaz is saying not if he refused to do The Kingsmen to Naomi we got two women we got roof and we got Naomi roof is a gentile you heard brother Robert she's not a Jewish woman Redemption how are they going to redeem magenta they are redeeming Naomi but Boaz is saying if that man doesn't want to redeem you not Naomi scripture don't play with words not Naomi so Naomi is not the problem the problem is roof you will see it shortly amen then will he will I do the part of the King's Men to you as the Lord live with what is he doing he's swearing by enough you know whosoever I know amen so this is like Revelation 10 Happening Here somebody's swearing who's swearing Boaz himself because he cannot swear by no greater than him [Applause] as the Lord live a flight down until the morning and she laid at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came in the floor into the floor it's a secret it's not a public show also he said bring the veil that you have upon you she has a veil amen Ruth has affair that she cover herself now the veil is removed okay and when she held it he measured six measures of water barley and laid it on her and she went into the water he didn't give seven measure he gave six because the seventh one is himself everybody okay it is the seven that opened the six amen everybody okay glory to God let me deal with this thing here go to chapter four so somebody will catch it he looks like brother John's time goes slowly and my time runs quicker as soon as I start here it's like the clock does something by the polycarb we need to stop time like Joshua roof chapter 4 verse three if you dare you can say amen amen we're talking about a Kingsman near and he said to the Kinsmen Naomi that is come again out of the country of Moab they're talking about Naomi everybody okay sells a parcel of land which was our brother and limelicks everybody okay and I thought to advertise you saying buy it before they inhabit it and before the Elders of my people if you will redeem it the word is redemption bringing back if you will redeem it redeem it but if you will not redeem it Boaz presented Naomi he didn't present the roof amen watch carefully then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem to redeem it beside you and I am after you everybody okay so the kids man will be always the first in your life everybody okay the King's Men this near Kinsmen will be always the first to have a right in your life amen and Boaz will be always the last to come in your life so when your life starts when you're coming out of Mama the first one who start with you is this Kingman [Music] he wait to ride on you because the way you are born is wrong [Applause] everybody okay because you were born in sin shaping water coming into the world doing water so he's right there he has a right on you [Applause] the problem is if we ask him to redeem you that's where we want to see him everybody okay so Boaz always will be last everybody okay are we together amen glory to God verse uh four he said that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside you and I am after you and he said that Kingsman he said I will do whatever redeem it so Boaz is like oh my God is that what you think is that what you think that was the first weapon Boaz have a second one everybody okay when he said Naomi then he goes yes Naomi I have a right everybody okay Watch Who's Gonna who that these Kingsman doesn't like you ready watch verse 5. then say boys everybody okay what day you buy the field in the hand of who Naomi you must buy it also of who roof the more by this the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his water as soon as they say roofs [Music] when they say an army I will take it when they say roof so really the intent of Boaz was not Naomi Boaz didn't want to marry Naomi Naomi was already old [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay let's see his response when they brought you into the picture when they brought the Jewish boy say wait a minute there is a gentile woman when they bring the Gentile woman let's see how the King's Men behave everybody okay verse 6 and the King's Men said water I cannot I thought he said he's going to redeem it so the kids man doesn't like you that Kingsman doesn't like you he doesn't want to hear about you everybody okay why he doesn't like you why the Bible says verse 6 and the King's Men say I cannot redeem it for myself lest I do water oh my everybody okay so you are the Destroyer [Applause] of his inheritance everybody okay if he takes you and puts you in inheritance you're gonna destroy everything the problem is you don't know who you are the devil is more afraid of you than you even think you the one afraid of the voodoo doctor you are the one afraid of the sorcery you don't even know yourself the day you're gonna understand yourself amen death witchcraft will begin to run away from you [Applause] um yes let me help you up a little bit when Jesus went to hell what did he do in hell what did he do in hell remember in the pyramid there is a Subterranean that was completely destroyed everybody okay what did he do in her he destroyed everything there everybody okay so if they touch you and they put you to hell what is gonna happen in here everybody okay everybody okay the devil cannot associate with you [Music] that's why you never stuck in the world because they don't like you you're not a good fun person he doesn't trust you you might be friend with him today tomorrow you turn around and say in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay you need to know who you are when it's Naomi no problem when it's true not that woman that ain't a woman what was in roof that make this man scared everybody okay verse 6 and The Kingsmen say I cannot redeem it for myself lest Amma are wound my own inheritance redeem you my right to yourself for I cannot water redeeming so it is roof that will kick this Redeemer off everybody okay it is the name of roof that would destroy these Kingsman not now me not Naomi it is amen as soon as your name is revealed that men have no more right and power in your life the name I'm talking is not what you write on your ID it is not what you receive from your family that you brag we are destroying so we are destroying so that is not you heard that name and the devil keep beating you there is another name that you have when that name is unfolded [Applause] [Music] that's the name of your true family because the family of Heaven and Earth is called water Jesus Christ that's the name [Applause] everybody okay oh my god let's go to Ephesian father Glory Glory good to see you brother job and the family we don't have visitors we only have family members so you're a family member amen Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23. if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God Hallelujah the Bible said for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body we found out that Christ did this in the first coming as the son of man everybody okay therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husband we went through this in everything for a woman to believe you or to respect you in everything you must be in everything good I already went through that in other words you must have crushed you cannot tell your wife go still she cannot do that you can review the sermon we already went through this husband verse 25 love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it he did it under the son of man verse 26 that he must sanctify and cleanse it we went through this with the washing of the Water by the word what's the purpose that he not somebody else ma presented to himself a how glorious church we went through this you see that right there a glorious Church you will see what glorious means today by God's grace a glorious Church having not water spot spot with speaking about the Inner Man the sin which is a portion of redemption remember a part you remember do you remember okay praise God with that spot our water and Winkle speak of the water the body or the flesh everybody okay with that spot on wrinkle or any such but that it should be how holy and without water blemish why this characteristic why we must be holy why do we have to be without blemish why everybody okay job to verse 32 and 30. for we are members of his body of his body Kama of his flesh and of his water bones we are members of his body of his and of his water bonds no blood remember that amen verse 31 for discourse shall man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall be how one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning hope Christ and the church everybody okay now let's pray and we can take off Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me Lord we are surrendering everything and asking you to move us completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children Lord father come in Lord unfold your word yourself because you the one that can interpret your word Lord father we rebuke everything that is contrary to your word against father the kingdom of the devil may he depart from this place in the name of Jesus Christ be the half and the Omega in the name of Jesus Christ amen everybody okay so far glory be to God my subject this morning is on the board it's the four phases of roof this son of man and glorification you must have a body that is glorious hey everybody okay I gave this startup because we didn't finish last time hey man I could call this body change part two but it will be confusing amen so in reference for reference I switch a different terminology but the terminology always means the same thing everybody okay so when we say body change when we're talking about glorification we're talking about the same thing everybody okay so there's four phases of roof the son of man and glorification we're still on our reading in the threshing floor and we will God willing deal with the second all a little bit more deeper in our Tabernacle we are in the holiest and we found out that roof has four phases just a refresher that brother Branham said from the four different phases of roof I got it wrote here roof doing what deciding making her decision roof serving roof resting roof rewarded as we come back roof making the decision roof after she made her decision then roof is serving then roof is resting then roof is water rewarded so if you notice the Tabernacle only have three parts everybody okay not fall apart everybody okay because the rewarding have nothing to do with the Tabernacle the rewarding is enough sin in the Tabernacle everybody okay everybody okay are we together everybody okay so when you go roof deciding we're right here roof surfing we're right there roof resting we were there but roof roof rewarded will disappear [Applause] all right did you get me did you get me everybody okay can I start back again if you're going through the step of the Tabernacle we have three steps number one roof deciding then roof serving then roof resting and you don't see anything else but yet there is another step that step when you enter there you disappear tonight amen everybody okay so in order to disappear you must make sure you are already resting everybody okay because they're resting of roof is a preparation to The Disappearance glory to God brother Branham saying that is what the church did reviewing he entered into water justification right there under who looter is right there and he went into water sanctification right there under who Wesley is there went into the water baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last day and now resting with the water Ernest the down payment the earnest is not the full price that's right everybody okay everybody okay many of you here already have a home that you already bought everybody okay probably none of us here went with a cash money to buy the home at one time everybody okay but they usually check your credit to see your credit score whether it's good for you to qualify for a home or not if your credit score is bad you need to go work on your credit score everybody okay you need to go back to some step in your life and go correct certain things go fix certain things in your life everybody okay and the more you repent the more you get away from things the more you are correcting things your credit score begins to go up everybody okay until you qualify for the home but when you qualify you don't bring the full price you only bring the down payment everybody Kia that down payment give you the authority to have the key he give you the authority to enter into the house he give you the authority to call that house my house if somebody trespass you usually say get out of my house but you have not paid the house yet [Music] everybody okay you only have the earnest the down payment but the Earnest give you power already hey everybody okay the earnest when they give you a house they already have confidence in you [Music] [Applause] that you are going to pay the house but it's not the full price yet it is only a portion that gives you access to the house any question any question brother Branham continues he says he's resting for the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something has water happened where in us we have passed from water and to water and we are doing water waiting and doing water every time you pay your mortgage you are groaning there is no bill that Disturbed like a mortgage foreign [Applause] because every time you make a payment it is reminding you that that has still have not belonged to you yet [Music] everybody okay it is a growing pain foreign to lose the house [Applause] another word that bank have still essential in your house so you must go all the way to the full payment then you and the bank have finished thank you when you see a phone call from the bank and you have not made your payment you are already nervous because the bank become the Tormentor [Music] [Applause] reminding you that you don't have full ownership everybody okay welcome to 2023. everybody okay he said we've been growing with water nature for that time when we will receive a water motor life an immortal house fullness no more the down payment but we are receiving the water fullness because the first part is in our body will be held everything is redeemed and we are just waiting for him to do what we turn back from the water because Boaz went to the gate Amen to finish Redemption I already have the sixth measure of Bala that I'm eating every day and waiting for the return of us from the gate meaning that God has already finished our water foreign that is that's what God calling you that was God calling you those who he has come he has done water justify and those who he has Justified he has water glorified the son of man and glorification now you are in the stage of water glorification what is glorification the moment you accept Jesus Christ as your water savior you are not glorified yet you only on the step you are only entering the Tabernacle in the stage toward water glorification damn go in the room there where they shall be seeking the water Holy Ghost and God will pour out the Holy Ghost upon you and then you shall be filled with the water spirit that shall give you power the down payment he give you the key to go into your house to live as water you are living like the owner of the house until the time of the water restoration of wow all things when Jesus will be water comes everybody okay he says brother Branham says this here glory to God he said now we are waiting for water the restoration that Resurrection well now do you understand say Amen if you do what I mean by saying the water Earnest I already explained it to you congregation say what amen follow me we know that we have passed from Death until life because we are water lifted up you're not a rental anymore you're not living in the apartment no more in the apartment amen when the kids are jumping and they were and there and the neighbor is upset in the house the kids can jump everybody okay Branham say we are lift up not in ourselves but lift up from the water things of the world that we love how everybody and God loves us and we know it and we watch our lives and see that it is there holy spirit because we don't no more care for the things of the earth well there you are as long as you love the world all the figs of the world then the love of God is not in you yet you know yourself but as long as you are above that then you know that you have water your inheritance you are on your world to what the fool with them

here everybody okay glory to God we already went through this amen God is first the word and then he is the flesh everybody okay keep that in mind let's go to Roman 8. verse 9 if you dare you can say Amen but you are not in the flesh you know what it means the body but in the water spirit is so be that the spirit of God do whatever dwell in you everybody okay when the Holy Ghost dwell in you amen you are not a common man anymore everybody okay now you are a spiritual man you are living above the things of the world but yet you have sin in your body remember Paul was crying he said when I want to do good I found out that evil is with me everybody okay verse 8 now and nine now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his if the Holy Ghost is not there yet you are missing something in your life you need to go work on your credit amen your credit score is bad they can't go they can't qualify you for the home everybody okay job two verse 10. and if Christ be in you remember the Inner Man the body is wow dead remember you are an inside man amen and you also enough amen this is the Inside Man and you are also the outside man the inside man we call him the soul you remember that and the outside man we call him the body everybody okay Paul is saying that if Jesus Christ is inside of you everybody okay it's sad you are already partially with him you are good you are a son of God but Paul says that the body is still dead can you repeat what the scripture said you will still have death here but on the east side you have life anybody care now life and death are riding everybody okay everybody okay it looks like the two trees the Tree of Life and on the outside Good and Evil everybody okay everybody okay the Bible says and if Christ be in you the bodies have dead because of water sin so this body is death because of sin that's why Paul was crying that when I want to do good I found the law in my body there is sin in my body that is telling me to do wrong your body talk to you your body can tell you don't go to church [Applause] it's not talking loud it just makes you tired and you feel like you know what I'm just gonna stream and before you know it you get into the habit of streaming until you forgot to come to church anymore foreign but the spirit you see right here is water life right here you are death on the east side you are life because of water righteousness watch carefully now but if the spirit of him that is water the spirit of Resurrection everybody here from dead dead dwelling house in you if you already have the spirit of Resurrection in you if you already have the done payment everybody okay be assure of something everybody okay you are not fully with him yet but remember something what do we remember he says but it's the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead do what dwell in you not anointing you because he can anoint you and tomorrow you can go and sleep with a woman [Applause] it's not your wife we don't want to pay the coastal anointing you want that Spirit to dwell dwelling means that the spirit made you a home you become the Temple of the spirit you become the house of the spirit the spirit of God can call you this is my house this is my temple in other words when you sleeping and when the devil is attacking you you know they want to fight [Applause] because you don't belong to yourself the boss himself will come out and say Satan what are you doing here this house belonged to me you need to get out of this house [Applause] everybody okay who protects you when you sleep yourself there is an owner of the house because he already paid the down payment everybody okay and he doesn't Slumber no sleep it's a 24-hours camera with a security watching over you everybody okay let's go now but if the spirit of him Jesus Christ there is Christ from the dead dwelling you he that raised Christ from the dead shall do what also quickens do you know what quickens mean it will make a life it will resurrect you make a love something that doesn't have life and Paul already says that the body is how dead that's why they need to Quicken the body they need to turn on the body in other words whatever happened to your soul must also happen to your body [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay he said that it shall also Quicken your water if you notice that body is Mortal mortar means it's subject to death your mortal Body by his water spirit that water dwell in you we okay so far glory to God let's go to drop a job to verse 15. watch carefully for you have not received the spirit of water bondage again to the water fear Don't Be Afraid Anymore because perfect love but you have received the spirit of water adoption what does adoption mean [Music] why why do they have to adopt you you know when we say adoption when we say adoption we usually think like you were born from another parent okay then they bring you up and there's some kind of a custody and they say so and so we have a child mother is drunk dad is drunk they cannot take care of him so you go ahead and get that child that's how we understand adoption let me correct your Pentecostal understanding watch what adoption does to you he said you have received the spirit of water adoption what does the spirit of adoption do are you watching your Bible whereby in other words the spirit of adoption amen is what you are using to do something with it what are you doing with that spirit we ready whereby we cry we cry water and water how about father what does he mean Abba Father [Music] yeah you know we don't understand the scripture usually we say Abba Father we're looking like oh God my father God is my father so now I become a child of God that's why I'm crying to my father what does why does the spirit didn't say God why didn't the spirit say my creator why didn't the spirit say this great being that is greater than me the spirit is saying Abba Father in other word when that Spirit come on you when you look at God the spirit will make you call god father we still have not understand when we say calling god father you looking at brother Charles and brother Charleston keep your finger right here let's go to the Book of John chapter 5. it's a dangerous things to call god father very dangerous you're going to understand it let's go to John 5. brother Robert I was aiming for 70 miles I'm going 25. everybody okay [Laughter] let's go to John chapter 5 because when we say father father you don't understand to call God the Father it's dangerous you still have not cut me when you call God your father it's very dangerous you can get killed don't worry if you and John 5 tell me yes look at verse 18. let's change your thinking now aha let's change your thinking now therefore the Jews saw the more to love Jesus they wanted to do what you kill him why do they want to kill Jesus [Music] why do they want to kill Jesus Karma because he not told me had done water walk in the Sabbath but said also that what God what is water father let's stop there just stop where we are the Jews when Jesus said God is my father they pick up the stone they say let's eliminate him stop you calling God your father is dangerous [Applause] what does he mean God the Father when you say oh Jesus said God is his father what is the problem they just look at you you're not a Jew are you Gentile you didn't understand we have Abraham Our Father okay when you call god father he doesn't mean Abraham and Isaac it doesn't mean brother Stephen and and uh and Isaac that's not what he means what does he mean calling God your father the Bible says but said also that God was his water father come on making himself God let's go back to Roman chapter 8. So when you say God is your father you are saying that you and God you are equal [Music] when Jesus was saying my father he was saying that I am God that's why did you want to kill him now when the Holy Ghost come in your life there it is everybody okay the Holy Ghost give you the power not only to live a Christian Life but when you looking at God you are calling god father [Applause] meaning you need to change your prayer buddy me mean you are telling God me and you We Are One [Music] [Applause] I have something for the future but let me pull it from uh two months maybe down the road and pull it up today let the mind [Applause] [Music] that was in Jesus Christ being in water you what was the mind [Applause] brother Robert which scripture is a Philippian what let's keep our finger there I'm preaching something different than what I prepared let's go to Philippians oh my God two five let's go to Philippians Philippian to water okay let's go thank God which mind which man the man which was also in water Christ so God wants you to think like Jesus [Applause] I don't know if you're getting me the problem is you have you you are afraid of what belonged to you you're just afraid this man is killing you it cannot be right but you can't fight me because I'm in the scripture if you punch me you punch in the Bible you punch me you punch in the Bible and you will find yourself fighting against God everybody okay let this man that was in water in that way do we go in Jesus Christ I'm just explaining it this way we open Jesus everybody okay we take the brain of Jesus [Applause] we open we do a heart surgery we remove his heart and we pull them out amen and we take your brain we remove it from you and we take the brain of Jesus Christ we put it we build a brain transplant and a heart transplant [Applause] so when your old boyfriend speak to you thinking that I'm speaking to her he will hear someone else speaking to you the way you thinking have already changed because you have a mind transplant [Music] how was that mind how is the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is how we okay jump to the next verse which was also in water Christ Jesus who Jesus Christ being in the water form of God foreign let me stop here which form do you have [Music] let us make man in our image an hour so you look like who [Applause] [Music] so you also you are in the form of God you say you're a woman God is buff now any problem we okay now we're okay now I'm just removing the smoke and we okay now now let's go back he says but he said who being in the water form of God it's not water rubbery do you know what a robbery means so Jesus in his mind let's read it don't eat nut water God so when Jesus said I am God Jesus was not thinking like I am stealing something from God belong to me [Applause] everybody okay write a polycarp when you call yourself polycarp did you steal something you steal from who his name is polycarp Jr when Jesus said I am God Jesus didn't steal anything it belongs to it the title of God Emmanuel which means water [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so the mind of Jesus Christ when Jesus said father it is not the way you think Jesus was saying I am God everybody okay and when Jesus say I am God he is not even doubting he's not even complex people who say ah you making yourself like a god no Jesus was proud that's right let's go back to Roman 8. now you understand things differently we okay now verse 15. so we have not received a spirit of water bondage bondage bondage bondage huh my father oh God my father oh God my father slave mind slave man oh master I come to you come on come on you need to be like Esther they say if you enter there you're gonna die SSA if I die or die by the time she entered when the king look he said who's that Esther [Music] [Applause] the law is finished the law is finishing [Applause] that's why Paul said when we approach the throne of grace we are brought how boldly [Applause] it says bondage again to the water fear they go no no if you touch the mountain they will kill you bondage Israel bondage bondage everybody okay Karma but we receive the spirit of water adoption whereby we cry water so the Holy Spirit give you the Badness to call God equal forever let me put the last screw stabilizing okay look at the second verse the spirit itself bad water witness to our spirit that we are water children of God you understand now children of God is different stop a little bit here I don't know who's pulling put your finger let's go to Psalm 86. that's yours Lord help me my God what a Direction you there let's go to Psalm 86. I believe that's it which Psalm is it God 87 82 there we go ah go to hell preacher attitude everybody okay everybody okay because they say that we are how children of God when we say again children of God both of you so God the Father God the father because it's many children let's see you there Psalm 82 verse what six I have said God is talking I have said yeah how gods and all of you are house Children of the most high so the children of God means you are God [Applause] this is what trouble you verse 7 but you shall do what die like water man that's why you get trouble because you die like man you think you're not God question did Jesus die so what is the problem was Jesus God yes did he die amen so what's the problem let's go back to Roman 8 again foreign now children of God father you understand who you are now watch now Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are one children of God you understand children of God means water Gods Gods amen and if children because you call him father what are you going to inherit from God [Music] everybody okay stop you inherit something when somebody die will God die everybody okay everybody okay we are hairs of God and how John is joint hell with who Christ that Christ was God so we and Jesus we are not like one on top of the other we are joined we are equal 50 50 [Music] you put it together you have God in one hundred percent [Applause] everybody okay we are joined hair man shall leave his father and mother and shall cling with his wife and the two shall be held so with that me Jesus is not one flesh oh yeah [Applause] let's continue it will suck later on some are still struggling with deflation don't worry amen if children then have hair of God and how with Christ if so be that we suffer with him comma that we may also how glorified together so if Jesus was glorified let's finish the problem in other word whatever happened in Jesus Christ must happen in your life everybody okay job to verse 18. four I reckon that the suffering of this water present time are not water worthy to be compared with the water Glory the son of man and glorification with the water Glory which shall be have revealed where in us so there is a glory in you that will be revealed everybody okay everybody okay verse 19 for the water earnest you see the earnest expectation of the water creature wait for the water manifestation of the water sons of God creation is waiting to seek gods but you still behave like human beings because creation was married with Adam the guy used to Adam when Adam is there everything is good Adam is no longer there so they are waiting for Adam [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay verse 20 for the creature once made house subject to vanity not willingly amen they didn't sin but by his son of water him who subjected the same in water hope because the creature itself also shall be how delivered from the water bondage everybody okay the bondage of water corruption corruption happened in the body or it happened in the soul everybody okay because this body comes from the amen through the corruption to the from the bondage of corruption into the house glorious Liberty the Liberty is glorious a church that is we okay now the Glorious Liberty of the water children of God so you are not free completely you already been set free in here but your spirit your freedom is not glorious yet everybody okay because there is a glory that will be revealed in you everybody okay so there is something glorious that have to happen to you verse 22 for we know that the whole creation do water and water in bed together until now and not only day but ourselves the children of God also which have the water first fruit of the water spirit the life inside everybody okay even we ourselves grown well within ourselves stop we are groaning look here we are groaning where in ourselves this man is crying he's crying for something amen he's not comfortable because there is something sticky around this man all the time troubling him the white dog is barking too much because the black dog is all around everybody okay everybody okay watch versa Versa we ourselves grown away within ourselves one thing for the water adoption the adoption that we already knows our claim we want for that adoption that we waiting for the adoption that is the Redemption the water body everybody okay not the Redemption of your spirit the Redemption of the water body everybody okay everybody okay jump to verse 28. Hallelujah the Bible say and we know that all things work out together for good to them that do what love God and to them that are how according to what this purpose push the brick get ready buckle up verse 29. for whom he did water for new to be conformed to the water image of his son so do your transformation is predestinated [Applause] it is not something that may or may not happen it is already loaded [Applause] you already have the software in you for transformation transformation in the image of who son so that you and his son will look like because you must be born of his born and flesh of his face so something must stretch from you to make you look like him [Applause] everybody okay let's jump that he might be the water first remember he was the first one you remember he might be there first of all you remember the first one he have to be the firstborn from the dead you remember that he might be the first one a mom baby water so he's a brother he's not God when we meet we shake hand just like you said brother Charles [Applause] this body killing you you are resisting everybody okay first study whom he did what we Destiny them he also did what and him that he called whom he call then he also did what justify watch your title and whom he justify he also done water it is a Cascade of events amen thanking you from one step to another to another until glorification your glorification is already loaded because it's the spirit of him that God Rose Christ from the dead dwell in you he will also do what we can [Applause] elephants okay what shall we then say to what if God Be Water for us now what who can be what else do you have to worry what else do you have to worry listen to brother Branham now brother Branham say he says this he said but as long I believe we already read this brother pranab says this he said we are water waiting for the water fullness of adoption remember adoption the fullness will be the change of the body he said we are waiting for the fullness of water this will take place when requested [Music] I love brother Branham I really love Whataburger it would take place when at the water first resurrection that is one hour bodies will be changed from these wild creatures that we are and we shall have air by the black is on glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appear we appear in his water politeness we will have a body like yes air glorious glorified body and the other trial and struggles of water will fade off will Fed off into a leader Miss and water blow away and to never be no more foreign [Applause] so when your adoption come something will leave you like a little mist [Applause] you say that you you the one that was creating this [Applause] don't worry I have enough vaccine buddy everybody okay and these are free water Tabernacles which we now grown in remember Paul we are doing water waiting for that so that water Earnest off there for the Salvation fully in its fullness to come it is not come yet amen but now in this Tabernacles of clay we wait we have something that tell us we have something inside that is telling us that we have risen up so far it's only a part amen we have not reached the end yet everybody okay you don't have to come up here around the altar Jesus said he that will hear with my word and Believe on him that sent me has water eternal life that's settle it you either believe or don't if you believe that with your heart you have done Water Pass from Death to life now you are enough growing procession everybody okay you are in the first field the field of powers now glorification everybody okay everybody okay [Applause] for no man could raise his hand except my father called him and all that the father has given me will do water and those who heal for new he has called and those who he has he has water justify and those who he have Justified he has water no if I am calling what scriptures that is right body and when he returns back this Celestial body will take on water glorification and we will be like him and we shall live forever in the body what has anything else matter it's already water settle just anchor right there stick hang on already all right where are we heading brother Branham say the next one in the parable because in the parable we found out that boas talk to Ruth and boys say you know what there is somebody that is near Kingsman to me everybody okay that person is blocking me from marrying you and we found out that when they brought the name of Ruth the men back up who is that person brother Brian I'm saying this the message water the Kings the next one in the parable the head option on you was who the devil [Music] he was the right-hand man of God he was the near Kinsman he was Heaven in the Book of Esther [Music] he was Judas Iscariot close to Jesus he's always me [Music] everybody okay and then he said because you had water and you first and first you belong to who him because you you are his water property for you are born in sin shaping water coming into the world speaking lie and he could not redeem it see he could not redeem it so Christ come and May and was made how to take away and the other man could not do it the devil could not die for sin [Applause] because he was the very perverted that man he couldn't do it he would do it more his inheritance the other fellow and Satan would water mark because he is the devil what are you talking about by the devil the Bible says this for as much then as the children APA take care of the Flesh and Blood he Jesus also himself like was took part of water he became human like you that proof he might destroy him that has the power of them that is water the devil the devil the devil in the flesh not in your spirit the Bible says in Revelation 6 and I look and Beyond a pen horse and his name that sat on him was water yes okay his name that sat on him was water yes why is the last stage dealing with death [Music] in the college we didn't know his name and when you didn't know his name colomba didn't know his name Paul was crying out but at the end time the son of man must come to decode his name because to administer the proper treatment you need to identify the disease everybody okay you need to identify who has been riding this horses who has been troubling the church who is he what is his name where is he coming from and throughout the ages nobody picked him up only an eagle anointing everybody okay and the eagle have nothing call his name water and death we find his way outside the body the purpose of this message everybody okay everybody okay and the Bible says that his name was death and hell did water and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to do what killed with sword so what is blocking you from seeing Jesus is death everybody okay Paul died the Saints die and when they said die we usually say they're going into the presence of the Lord everybody okay but when brother brought him ahead in its field okay and he went there he looked you follow me he doesn't see Jesus he only see the people that he preached to this is brother so and so this is Sister so and so this is a hope my first wife this is who and by the brand I'm stopping say wait a minute where is Jesus [Applause] why was brother Branham unable to see Jesus I am there is still a blockage even in the sixth Dimension because Redemption is not in fullness yet [Applause] everybody okay the only way you can see him face to face Redemption must be completed that's why they without us cannot be made perfect [Music] I'm just charging [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay glory to God the Bible says this brother Branham says this in this body is who death and death we find that who have the power of death the devil everybody okay everybody okay this devil have a power on your flesh anybody okay as long as the church everybody okay have not reached full Redemption yet the devil have access in heaven [Applause] let me help you up the reason why the devil is accusing you because of your flesh your flesh is what give the devil right to enter Heaven and say father he did this look at him he did this what makes you sin is not your soul because he that is born against sickness no more you need to grow upper body everybody okay it is the body when somebody gets you upset it is not the enemy it is this man that get upset let the one day in a man will come back and say do you see the way you talk to him that was nothing you talk bad to your wife you need to go apologize and he's staying a man but this one you will hear him saying no she got what did she deserve d have you heard that before you tried to repent and you hear somebody saying no if you do that they won't respect you they will do it again let him get to what they got and someone else is saying you need to repent it is your body and yours feel that are fighting together the black dog and the white dog [Music] the greatest battle ever thought he begin now in US brother Brian I'm saying everybody okay so in order to stop the devil from going into heaven Redemption must take place in the fullness we Okay we okay yes let me change again said the church is water taken out and Satan is water why are you Satan is cast out because there is nothing else there is no more access the day we receive our body change the access code of the devil in heaven is fires [Music] [Applause] come on foreign [Music] this is where he operates so when we move into the glorification his past God expires [Applause] brother Branham say when the church goes out certain does water calms down everybody okay why is Satan coming down only when we go up what was he doing up there watch brother random but I'm saying notice he shall be given the heart of the water peace at that time and Satan we love you will incarnate how himself because when the church goes out Satan is water it is done damn it is all his water our water's done [Applause] that's why your body your spirit is crying is running for Redemption so we can kick the devil out of the body Australia because when you have redemption in the body your spirit is in redeemed your body is redeemed then you are 100 ready so as we are going up Lucifer is coming down we are saying bye bye we meet you in Armageddon we are coming back thank you oh you're lying that you are doing in heaven no more [Applause] [Music] if you knock at the house anymore God doesn't open it is the bread who opened it out are you here [Applause] before I call 9-1-1 [Applause] everybody okay my garden let me find a way to end I can't touch with even where I'm going Lord help me up you fool oh you want me land to the airport just a little bit more okay we found out that when he's coming down that's the reason why when he comes down he's coming with three things not only one because one will not finish the thing he need to couple the Shout with the voice of the resurrection and then with the Trump because the Trump will con will change Resurrection only bring back but it doesn't change so if the Trap will transform you amen so that Redemption is completed brother Adam says this let me try to skip this because you already know this but let me handle this part here and then we go Amen brother Branham says this we know that there is a shout which is the uh the message and the search out also is the messenger and the messaging his messenger are one we already went through that we talked about the voice of the Resurrection we found out that when he cried out not all descent arrows only some of the sin because your body was laying on Earth just to make sure you vaccinated good I have to put this it's after the seal but I'm saying on this ceremony in this the somewhere laid our bodies so your body was already laying here even though you were not born yet everybody okay at that time for we are the dust of the water the Earth and In Heaven There was a book of memory and his attribute was in him knowing that because this son of God raised he would also rest there life every son that was followed then to this greater he knew he would be but it was not your time that's why only many of the Old Testament Rose not you everybody okay so far everybody okay so far now let's get to this and then I'm gonna stop God we found out that he is the word back up so I can lay this and I'm going to stop somewhere I can't get to what brother Robert uh sang God is the word the word we found out that it was invisible everybody okay and the
