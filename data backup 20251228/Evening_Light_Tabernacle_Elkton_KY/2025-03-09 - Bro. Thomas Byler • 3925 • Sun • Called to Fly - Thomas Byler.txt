with the Wicked with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but Mischief is in their hearts because they regard not the works of the Lord nor their operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusteth in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise him save the people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever amen God bless you may be seated brother Steve just wanted to announce the results from the vote we had all the offices will remain the same that they have been so and I know I've never explained how we do that uh I'm the only one that sees the ballots uh nobody else does and they are put in a envelope and sealed up up and if if there's any questions they'll be able to anybody can ask you know to see them it's not but we have them sealed up nobody has ever asked but I read through everybody's ballot and uh any suggestions that I can help with I try to do that and so there have been some good ones this year uh and and I'm going to try to step up my game and uh be able to to do better at what I'm supposed to do and if there's anything that brother Thomas needs to address I go to him with that but other than that nobody ever sees anything is turned in uh it's it's just kept it's kept quiet and I think it's how it should be uh but I appreciate each one of you that did vote and uh and everything because we're we're here as a group and and that's what keeps everything together Amen brother Brian morning brothers and sisters if you turn with me to uh you have to forgive me on the change of seasons got me going Clos aans the third chapter but I was uh thinking this morning you know the world you know we talk a lot about the world in its current condition but it is a crazy place this morning and the world could you know it's so crazy that the way we live right now it could be different when we wake up tomorrow morning and like brother Thomas was preaching on Wednesday and Sunday and all the other brothers it's really important that your first love your first commitment is to Jesus Christ this morning and I was just thinking you know waking up this morning I guess you all people know in the last couple of days they've been killing Christians in Syria and I sometimes As Americans we take for granted our religious Liberties that we have in this country not realizing the the way our brothers and sisters some places in the world are persecuted they're killed they're driven out of their homes and their places that they live and and we have you know we have more than enough where we live and it's hard to imagine what it's like for them but I was just thinking you know that you know there's a there's a a thought you know in in any society they say you're you hear them say for us here in Kentucky would take longer but if you live in a city they'll tell you you're only 3 meals away from Anarchy so when people can't eat and they can't drink fresh water you'd be surprised what your neighbor will do to you just to keep himself alive in the morning and and I as I wake up every morning I was listening to brother brandom you know as I get older doing time changes isn't the easiest thing to do but I was listening to his message a couple of these messages last night and it really struck me that um it's really important that everything we you is dedicated to Jesus Christ this morning and I was just thinking all our brothers and sisters in the religious world are celebrating the lent season and I was just thinking you know it's more than just a season you should be sacrificing your prayer life and your physical body every day for the Lord it shouldn't be just a certain season in the year but I was reading this I'll just read a few scriptures this morning out of Colossians the third chapter yall have to forgive my voice and I'll just read a few verses here I'll say something but you all probably think I do this every Sunday morning anyway but um if you then be it's a third chapter first verse I know I don't give you all time sometimes to get to where you need to be uh if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where where Christ sth on the right hand of God and it goes to what I was just saying a little bit early if it's if your heart has been changed and your life has been changed when you wake up in the morning you're going to seek those things that glorify the Lord every day doesn't mean you don't do your your daily work J job that you got to do there's we all got things we got to do every day but we're more than that we're more than that we're Christians we should be wanting to push the wow as they say for this this time that we're in he goes on to say set your affections on things above and on not on the things of Earth excuse me and then it goes for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God and what I'm going to read from the voice of God this morning kind of speaks to this when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory mortify there Therefore your members which are upon the Earth which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness ordant affection evil forgive my pronounce compass and Covetous which is so he's saying flee all those things for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of Disobedience and I'm probably going to just read what Colossians has to say this morning and then it says here in which we also walked the same time and lived in them so we you know we've all made mistakes we all all lived in their bad aspects of our life but it's by the grace of God that we we're able to stand this morning as redeemed in the lord it's nothing we did it's nothing that makes us better than anyone else it's just something that God did for us because he loved us you don't have to you don't have to struggle for it you don't have to fight for it all you simply have to do is let go and let God do it and he goes on to say year I lost my place uh at the eth verse it says but now you also put off all these anger and I as I get older I find I know I say this but I find myself waking up sometimes in the morning you know we all have in our family we all have attributes and I say and Janette hears me say it sometimes I I think I'm becoming more of my father every morning as I get older and I don't want to be what my father was when he was in his 60s and 70s I I find myself saying that to myself and he goes on and for we know we put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy Communications out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and I put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him wherefore there is neither Greek or Jew circumcision or uncircum cision and I'll finish there and read this because I'm having a hard time breathing this morning but this is with on the uh on the uh brother on the uh voice of God thing this morning this this quote kind of speaks for the time of we're in right now this is what brother brandham had to say in this message excuse me here everything on Earth the beauty the sweetness excuse me the Earth nothing there's nothing else in the world but an answer to a far better than that that awaits us when we leave the world so he's going to say that everything that we see here that's good in the world the trees the animals the birds the the scenery that's just a type of what's waiting for us on the other side this morning and he goes on this when we leave this world for everything in the earth is just a pattern of which is in heaven as and that's really true everything that's good everything that's righteous and that goes back to the scriptures there everything that's beautiful that goes this you could take this quote and go back to Philippians the 3D and fourth chapter and and he goes beautiful trees Birds everything it's just a pattern of what's in heaven and as you wake up in the morning and you start a new day all the goodness in life that's a pattern of what's going to be on the other side and it should make you want to desire it more and he goes on our own life life is just a pattern it's just a shadow not the real thing it's a negative side it takes death to develop picture and you all heard brother banam talk about this in Preachers for years you know God has a snapshot of you from the foundation of the world and that's what you're what you're maturing into this this morning what God how God seen you in the foundation of the world and he goes on to say it takes death to develop the picture to put us back into thop with came from and then in Resurrection we come in his likeness a resurrected body what a be excuse me what a beautiful not only beautiful but it this real solemn truth of God Eternal world word that we want to be like him and I was just thinking this morning as I read in Colossians and I wrote some notes down here but I'm not going to get into them because I'm have a hard time talking right now but I would say as I wake as I get older as I wake up every morning is it realer to me this morning than it was yesterday morning is God closer to me today than he was yesterday and I find myself you know sometimes we get all caught up in the things of this life and we really don't put the important things first in our lives and as we come further in excuse me as we come further into this year this time as the world's just going crazy out there the church is going crazy but you all have a foundation this morning where you don't have no worries you don't have to worry about it if you put in your trust in him this morning so I would simply say that it's not important whatever you're holding on to that you can't bring through God's word it's not important you you need to let It Go Don't hold on to it whatever it is I can only speak for myself if it can't go through God's word or go through the message of the hour then we just got to let it go and let God have way in our hearts and lives this morning brother man let's

disobedient though we be arrogant he still provides for us just the same whether we be good or whether we are bad he gives us food to eat clothes to wear a house to dwell in oh he is so good if we could just look around and count all the good things that he is to us we don't stop to consider that what if you had no eyes what if you had no nose what if you had no mouth no ears what if you had no

the bread of life amen if any may eat of his flesh and his bone uh blood drink his blood and eat his flesh you have eternal life amen so we're glad that we have amen uh such a wonderful table that God has spread amen and it's all ready the supper is prepared all things are ready now he said and he invited uh the different chosen ones but they were too busy with their land their houses or their mules or their wife or whatever it was they all made excuse ain't that right he says and go out in the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in amen because he wants his table full amen and

come to the Lord amen so this morning if you will let's just bow our heads and go before the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're Lord just want to be wise enough father to talk to you the author of the book first before we open the word Lord Jesus and we ask God that you would help us to understand Lord Jesus that any human being as your Prophet has taught us can turn back the pages of this Bible anybody can open it Lord but father truly it takes your Holy Spirit to reveal it to us and to make it real in our lives Lord that's what we want above everything is the reality of the word the reality of God that we all know EX exists and that is alive and well we want the reality of that Living God in our hearts in our lives father so that we could bring it right down to where we live Lord for what is a god that is a god of somebody else or somewhere else if we don't know him personally Lord and we just ask God that you'll just bring personal revelation of yourself today bless the meditation of our heart the Direction Lord we have we have felt led to go Lord with your word this morning now we commit ourselves to you now in Jesus name amen amen and amen amen all right we're going to start with Revelations if you will The Book of Revelations we want to start with Revelations 4 don't have very many scriptures this morning but amen amen you know I ran across this quote preaching preaching on Comm andine and and Jesus having a TBL spread we talked a little bit about how we all love good food and brother baham says it this way he said all the natural are types of the spiritual like we had good food that we eat at our table it's a type of the good food that we eat from the word amen praise the Lord I always like to see that whenever you preach on something amen and read it and realize that it's certainly backed up with what the prophet said amen Revelations the 4th chapter very familiar scripture for us and verse will begin with um verse six six and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like into Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like like a calf and the third Beast was like the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and for the and the four beasts had each of them six wings I'm going to move this down a little bit each of them six wings about them and they are full of eyes within and they rest not day nor night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and which is to come and when those beasts gave glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever and the four and 20 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and power and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen praise the Lord may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated I'm going to have to figure out a way different way to say that amen amen it's almost become a tradition amen amen praise the Lord amen all right so tonight this morning do you have my title up amen called to fly called to fly simple little message a't that right amen if you know notice now I want to do just go back here without back here for just a second again if you'll notice uh the first Beast was like a lion the second was like a calf the third like a the uh third Beast was like a face of a man and the fourth was like a flying eagle ain't that right a flying eagle how many knows it took the prophet of God took brother brandham God Almighty come down and actually revealed to brother brandham what those four powers were is that right and that there were four anointings down through the last 2,000 years that was upon the church Ain that right and those folks they could only operate under those anointings amen right like for example amen would you get me my mortar Mir book right there off of my my desk right there and I want to recommend a book that you're your children everybody you parents can use your discretion on when you have them read this but I think everybody ought to read this book Fox's book of Martyrs is that right Fox's book of Martyrs amen it talks about uh down through the Dark Ages over in the church ages you know for you know you know sometimes sometimes we don't think very much we just think here we're living in the 1900s and so forth and when you really begin to focus that there was 1900 years there was a lot of years folks is that right that is a lot of years and for the longest time all the way from the time of Paul all the way over to uh the time of Martin Luther is't that right Catholicism how many knows Catholic ISM ruled it was a terrible the dark cult the Dark Ages the Medieval Age or whatever it was a terrible age because those folks in that age they lived under that calf anointing isn't that right or Ox brother say that calf anointing amen which was M meant that they were uh uh uh they they they labored they were under labor that's what an ox or calf does it labors and they had to give their lives right just to be able to call themselves a Christian ain't that right that's why in this book I think you know this one here is one and of course I've got another book back there on the Holocaust on the Holocaust the Jews and everything that happened there World War I and World War II and so forth but you know there's things that our kids in America you know they need to be taught and this just comes but didn't brother bandam say you know Abraham Lincoln he was formed he had had a good mother and the two things that he had was the Bible and the fox's book of Martyrs why because it showed that back then just to be called a Christian amen you was he was in danger you know if if some sometimes they would be uh riding along and a priest and they would say the wrong thing to a priest he'd find out that you was a Christian and you wouldn't go home you'd be arrested he would say hey policemen come in here and arrest this guy those priests had that type of authority oh over the police and then they would take them and do whatever they chose to do with them they lived in catacombs and caves and so forth and all because I'm going to be a Christian look how nice we have it and people can't be a Christian this night what if you had it rough hello what if people come into this church and says if you don't if you don't denounce it and all these folks had to do was denounce Christianity and take itead rip by steak and nice and and a good life but rather than having a good life they chose the hard way they want it to be a Christian cuz it meant more than life to them how many believe that's the way it ought to be with us this morning amen it ought to be more than life to us it's more dear than breathing it's more dear than walking why because it's preserving your life knowing that you're going to live throughout eternity you going to die anyway someday amen it out might you might as well die for the right reason you might as well live for the right reason and for the right thing but they lived under that calf age Paul is age there for a while was the lion age under Christ and then it was the calf age then it was the face of man Luther Wesley and amen and the man age but the last age your age my age woo Glory I don't know about about you but I'm glad to be living in this age I am glad that God chose me to live in this hour folks if you ain't happy about that I don't know what you can be happy about God chose you he could have had you down through the Dark Ages he could have had you martyred he could have had you burned at the sake he could have had you thrust through with a sword have your head CH up chopped off like you did Paul he could have had you that time but he has you here this morning how many believe that you are here here for a special purpose you are here for a reason I'm here for a reason and if you are called to be an eagle guess what you can't help it you're going to be a [Applause] eagle and you are called to fly fly where flying to this morning I want to take you with the help of the Lord we're going to take take you about a a mile deep into the ocean we're going to start about a mile deep into the ocean and then we're going to go into the outer space all right would that be okay all right and then we're going to tie this in with the help of the Lord even with Wednesday night's service but boy I tell you when I got to studying this I need a two weeks of studying on this amen because it's it was just it's just good and I realized how little bringing out am mean in my study okay so let's go a mile deep brother B says I seen that long ago I was standing in a lobby waiting for an airplane and I seen where they had sent down a mile deep in the sea they went down there and where those fish had no eyes how many know that down that far is probably complete darkness light can't even penetrate that far they don't need I they don't even have any eyes and they had a light there and they was showing the most hideous looking marine life and some of them had phosphorus on the front of them and I was thinking one come by and it looked like it had a stove pipe hat on I've never seen such a idiot looking thing in my life weird looking creatures way down in the bottom of the ocean and the thing had no eyes but yet it has another sense that its direction it can find its food some kind of little sensors and Radars brother bam called it and I was thinking when I was looking at that what if I could use my eyes and let that little fish surrender itself to me with my little sense of with my sense of sight how I could guide it and I could see its food over here and say don't you pay no attention to that old radar viers or whatever you're going by cuz you have to be close to it he said you have to be close to it in order for that to work now I can tell you where your food's at and it would just listen to me my sense of sight so much greater than his sense of how he directs himself how much better off he would be how he could feed he'd be an odd little fish but he'd be following a sense of sight that was far better than the sense of that sense that controlled him and that's the way it is by the Holy Ghost if we can just let the holy ghost that great sense of the Holy Ghost lead us it'll show us things to come it'll way far beyond our natural senses amen what would it be like and he goes on to talking about what if you take that little fish and let him come amen and come the come on to land perhaps and see the sunshine and see the beauty of it all what how much greater a thing it would be how many knows that when you're born again amen it is like you have been transformed amen that I once was blind but now I see I was lost but now I'm found I mean I had a sense my my feeling see taste feel hear and smell amen my all my natural emotions all of those things will lead you the wrong way but God if we'll let him come in and let him control us let his sense be in me let his sense be in you am mean you'll see things you've never seen before amen you'll enjoy food that you have never enjoyed before you'll enjoy the peace of God the love of God the faith of almighty God the joy of the Lord is my strength how many believes if you'll just surrender yourself amen praise the Lord or what is I think brother B said one place he said what if we because we was once the hog is that right we had a hog nature that's right we just wallered into every nasty thing you could ever imagine hello what if a hog what if a hog would one day oh my I don't know if you have ever seen it but if you ever had a big old hog Waller a big bunch of mess and the stuff they'll wer in and eat and carry on it's nasty that right just nasty but if they' ever become a human if they ever become a human said Bo I don't never want to go to that slop again I don't know any none of y'all do that right no we don't do that why because you're a human being you have no interest in that type of thing now how many knows even the human beings in so in in a spiritual sense they like to go in the slop of the world and the filth of the world unregenerated humans they like the slap of the the world but get you transformed amen into a Christian one time and you won't have a desire for that old slap why you get a lamb nature then brother bam used that God used that to the Propet of God he used types and so forth and shadows amen he was a typologist he talk about if she ever got that lamb nature that's why I preached on the Lamb of the dove how many Knows Why brother bam preached on the lamb and the dove he preached on the lamb and the dove because his church amen had got a little bit there had gotten away from God and there was a lot of fussing going on there was a lot of Gossip going on and what did he say during that time he says if you got to get rid of that wolf nature you got to get rid of that snarl that you got that grow oh I don't like that person you know because of what they did amen get that snar get that Meek and gentle nature again get that lamb nature again praise be to God that lamb nature hallelujah praise the Lord all right that's right so from the depth from the bottom from the darkness how many knows that God has translated us from Darkness into the kingdom of his light that's right we came from that Darkness from way down amen I like that song when he reached way down for me I was lost and undone without God or his son amen but he reached down oh my hello I got saved when I was 20 20 years old I'm 63 and I I love this stuff as much as ever it don't ever get old I'm as happy as I ever was why because amen I've become one of his praise be to God hallelujah okay let's I want to have one quote before I go into this next one but I want to talk to you about amen how many believes that we've been we uh we've been given good food you and I this is where it's really deep but we've been given Eagle food where the carcass is there the Eagles we've be gathered together the kind of food you eat the churches don't eat they can't handle this food it can say it right in the Bible and they still won't want to believe it even better bam says I'm amongst Pentecostals you say predestination is a bad word you know why it was a bad word because it just didn't make sense with their brains and the way that they wanted to think it hello how many knows God don't come and adjust his word to your brain in the way you think it ought to be no uhuh you've got to adjust your brain to what the word says W Glory it don't matter if you understand it or not you hav been called to have to understand it you have been called to believe it amen am and if God help helps you to understand it praise be to God that's wonderful amen praise the Lord so we've been given good food and I want to say this brother bam says he says if you give your canary bird all the Orthodox food that you could give him and then keep him in a cage what Good's it going to do him if you give him good food make him strong Wings if you don't give him room to fly so that's what I think that Christian has been caged up we ought to be free amen we ought to study the word believe the word give me room let's get out get moving exercise our faith then brother B say he went to the Cincinnati Zoo and he found they they had caught a my gracious caught an eagle now that's a terrible thing to do if you going to have a eagle in a cage at least get the egg hatch it and have it in the cage from birth it'll never know any different it' be a lot better but this Eagle was crap it knew what it was like to SAR the heavenlies Ain that right it knew what it was like to be free so when it got cage he said that thing would go and it would fly against the bars and flop back bars fly against there and flop back and fall on its back and everything else bloody and Feathers loose or whatever just tar up because why it wasn't meant to be caged how many knows you weren't meant to be caged I wasn't meant to be caged I was meant to SAR the heaven I was meant to be free you was meant to be free free indeed amen so give him all the right vitamins one other place in other words she says you know you know God look at what God did with David man God was with David and he slew Goliath look at what the three Hebrew children what God did there look at the Old Testament but say they're always pointing to a historical God they're feeding him food but they're saying that he doesn't do that anymore and that's caging him up it's caging them up if you and I could just realize if we could just get that in your heart to know for sure we hear it all the time but God is alive God is real folks the one that made it all he is real he's here now and he's here to liberate you he's here to set you free he's here to help you fly above the things of the world Fly Above sin Fly Above Temptation Fly Above every trap of the Devil he's here to help you do that God is not dead God is alive that's right aren't we glad thank you Lord Jesus I'm glad God that you are alive and we clap to you because we love you and appreciate you God cuz you're a living God you're the I am amen we want to get down to a little bit of detail on what this flying means what it means amen praise the Lord and we look at of course the eagle a't that right we look at the eagle and the food that the eagle eats of course but we know that the eagle is a special bird isn't he so much so that God chose to re to use it as the illustration of the Believers in this age prophets are likened unto Eagles aren't they and Children of the prophets can I say are lik an unto Eagles we are eaglets how many's a eaglet amen and if you know who you are it makes a big difference makes a big difference if you know who you are if you're not sure about who you are I hope before you this service is over you'll realize who you are recognize who you are you're not some Pawn of the devil you're not some I'm slave of the devil no you're not you're a Son of God and if so God is going to complete his word in you the eagle flies higher than any other bird goes beyond any other bird it leaves the ground amen you know first let me say this let's look at the scriptures that enable us to fly because it's one thing I like to do one thing I like to do even as an older guy that's imagine I like imagine I like to stretch my mind I like preachers that stretched my mind a little you know yeah imagine okay now I've got a scripture for it because God can do things that's beyond our imagination how many believe that much much greater than what you can even imagine that'sa Paul he said it this way in Ephesians 3 and 20 says now unto him to him that is able to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or thank oh my you know what you know if it wasn't for the fact that Joshua told the Sun and the Moon to stand still you and I probably would never believe that it could be done or would be done Ain that right but since it happened we can say you know God is able to stop the sun stop the Moon it's beyond what you could even imagine how does that work I thought we were all supposed to fly off or you know cause a major disruption God's got everything going in a perfect time everything perfect cycle and he can stop it you mean he can stop it and not have a major problem yeah he can God can do anything woo and if he can do that for Joshua what about you and I here hello God can do anything this [Applause] morning beyond what you can ask or think I love what Paul said he didn't say just a little bit more than you think he said exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask with him I mean you talk about pouring on the Molasses he was pouring it on let's stretch our imagination a little stretch your mind a little believe a little bit more in Matthew when the disciples couldn't heal that demon possessed boy chapter 17 verse 19 it says then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you that if you have faith as the grain of mustard seed you shall say to this mountain remove hence y place if he can stop the sign of the own amen you can move a mountain and you can pick up a mountain and throw it in the SE no no no I don't believe he was talking figuratively I believe he meant just what he said don't you if he said you said it that mountain go into the sea that's what he meant woo that's pretty big but it's little for God oh my praise the Lord are you ready to fly let's fly do you realize brother Braham said and it was him it was a prophet of God that came and told us that every Redemptive blessing every Redemptive blessing that that that Adam lost amen the believer it's been restored to you you can speak to a bull you can speak to horness you can speak to a storm you can speak the word just like Adam hey tree I don't like you here move over there you got that same power got that same power hello how many believes that he's taking us up a little higher you shouldn't need restoration you shouldn't need Redemption brother B said our soul is already redeemed how many believe you're already saved you're already redeemed this body is the only thing we're waiting on changing from glory to glory he's already changed me he has better changed you this Bri this Eagles amen they're going to have to get into a Rapture condition they're going to have to fly higher this message hello there's rapturing faith in this message it's there we'll either get it and go in the rap rure or we'll be left behind Lord help us to become this word right fly how many know brother bam said in his Eagle story he say God is determined that his his Eagles aren't going to be a bunch of Earthbound chickens he is determined you're not going to be Earthbound you're going to get higher than that we're going to get higher than the Baptist the Methodist Pentecostal higher than all of that amen you're going to fly so high that nobody can touch you they can spit in your face they can slap you they can do you wrong but they won't touch you how many knows that's why brother Bram said it takes perfect love to put you in there if you haven't got perfect love you're not going to go there if you still got bitterness in your heart you got unforgiveness because of bitterness amen bitterness is unforgiveness amen if you haven't forgiven you're unforgiving you haven't forgiven somebody and you're holding that Grudge and so forth you're not going going to take perfect love to put you in there that's why I say when you've got that it don't matter what anybody does never hold a grudge that means you're above that you're flying above that you're in the place that you can't be touched you're in that place of perfection oh cuz we all know living in this world we're going to do each other wrong that's right that's right I'm a mess up you're going to mess up but the good part is we know how to forgive up a't that right that's right we're a human amen fly high so we find that brother B said when the God has these little eaglets that he makes that eagle makes a nest way up in the Cliff of the Rock Amen up in the Cliff of The Rock amen I tell you when you're born again into the house of the Living God there's something comfortable about it how many knows when he makes that Nest he puts Lamb's wool in it rabbit fur makes it all nice you get born again amen I remember going to Ohio preaching when I was B first born again come in the message and I says I don't know any divisions in the message I don't know of anything real bad in the message everything's good whoa until I found something out later hello I thought it was all cozy all nice that's what we think when you come to the message when you come to God you've got that piece that passes understanding down in your heart you're in the you're in the nest we're still to speak in the nest become in the nest I love that shouting screaming hollering running to house and praising be to God and climbing up into Spears and the revelations of almighty God how many enjoy is that but that's not where you learn to fly that's not where you learn to fly amen I mean know you got to learn to fly it's a lesson that's got to be taught ch what happens after a while after all of that coziness the comfort of it all oh when you're born he says God makes it so he makes it nice for his little eaglets when they're born I'm so glad to be one of them and then after that one of them is born and they got a nice and cozy bed to lay in just everything nice and going good hello ah praise be to God the first thing you know the mother eagle takes a otion after she sees some feathers coming on them Eagles and so forth she's determined she takes a NOS that they're not going to be Earthbound and what does she do amen she begin after them feathers are about fully matured she begins to jerk away that rabbit skin amen and that that sheep skin or whatever pull all away to comfort out of you oh my there's a sticker here a sticker there brother Braham says did you ever get in trouble when the doctor says you can't live any longer and man you think you're gone hello or this problem comes up and that problem comes up and brother does this that way sticker sticker sticker everywhere why cuz we're going to find out whether you're a chicken or whether you're an eagle hello a chicken can't handle the pressure of an eagle a chicken can't handle the pressure coming to church all the time and deal with Hypocrites the imperfection in the church chicken can't handle it no I just I got to get out of here come on folks things are going to get a lot hotter than that God puts a trial on you he puts test on you and after he gets it all uncomfortable and he's got feathers what does she do she picks you up and takes you on a solo flight she like to take you on a solo flight folks I don't care if you're just a young Christian or what stage you are if you're going to be a Son of God you better get used to trials and me you better get used to hard things [Applause] you better get W get ready for the winds to come the winds are going to blow Charles are going to all I can tell you is welcome to life oh it's just so hard it's just so wrong welcome to life even when I was in the world there was one boy that was always complaining boy it's just too hot here in the Florida and it's just do this and that and that and complaining he says somebody else told him he says well if you take if it's too hot in the kitchen get out of the kitchen tired of the whining and the complaining huh praise the Lord but he takes that little Eagan on a Sol of fly why because oh my but first let me go back a little bit there's so many lessons in here before she does that what is that she do she do she comes up to that nest after she's got all that out and she sees all those loose feathers laying around she comes in front of him and flaps her wings ain't that right and said that all of that wind just shakes those leaves out and and they look at her and they say look at Mama eagle and look at Mama eagle look how she can fly and so forth and he says that's what you and I do when we come to church amen we talk about David we talk about Samson we talk about shamgar look at that what God has done look at his mighty power that he had with them and we say Oh What a Mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve we look at the Mighty [Applause] Wings the faith that David flew with the faith that the three Hebrew children were faced with death you're going to be thrown into the fire it's easy to have faith when somebody else is dying oh just believe brother just believe sister just have faith in God wait till it happens to you you'll find out it's a different sow let's hope it's not is that fair to say let's hope it's not a different story let's hope at that time you can say well God is more than able to take care of this here hello God is more than able praise the Lord there was the Old Testament David facing boy but you know what the good thing about it is if you've proven God before in your life if you have proven him before in your life I'm telling you right now you're going to look at that old Goliath and say you don't look so big to me all right cuz I made an angry lion and a bear and kill him and you just look like a mangy giant to me I'll cut your head off why because the god that delivered me out of the hands of the bear and the lion he will deliver you out of my hands also God is more than able she sliding look at them Wings he's alive this morning he's here to deliver you this morning he's here to fill you with the Holy Ghost right now if that's what you want right now woo they say mama you are something else you are something else I'm glad God's not dead I'm glad he the same yesterday today and forever and he's got Eagles amen I love it don't you Timeless Timeless stories like Timeless songs something that just doesn't go away it just never gets old it inspires our faith faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God Amen I pray everybody in here learns to say Lord Jesus I need you to be my guide Amen to be my guide cuz the one thing that we have to learn learn if we're going to fly that is to rely hello to rely on God to lean on him finding more power than I ever dream I'm learning to lean on Jesus amen amen we're no more having to walk everywhere we're no more having to drive a bicycle around no more are we having to drive a horse and buggy we're not living in another age amen no longer are we just driving a car brother BR says Pentecost was a type of the airplane the right Brothers during that time leave picking up off coming up into the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus woo that's right come into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you come up there speaking in tongues and so forth driving an airplane I've had the privilege of driving an airplane one time brother Weston I actually drove one he's got his pilot license over there I guess amen praise the Lord John Keith one time we went down there and preached for him and brother Joe you went with me I think went down there and he took us up in the airplane he had a stick over there and I had a stick over here he says you want to drive it a little I said yeah yeah yeah I want to drive a little yeah yeah just all right put your foot down there put here that that and the other we're going to kind of take a Ser curve over around this side and sure enough we went over there and you know flying that thing it was pretty cool it was no time Thomas he called me rumus and for no for a reason you know I got the buzzers the beep beep beep beep beep okay we're gonna have to change a little bit I got this I didn't know why I was beeping probably probably going too steep or something you know but listen you still have to do it let's go on we still have to control it is that right you still have the controls and you're above it Glory so much better so let me stop there a minute and we'll pick it back up how many has ever jumped out of a perfectly good airplane Adrian is what I thought about I thought that she did you can ask who Troy did w was it a thrill quite a thrill was it a thrill Adriana would you say it was crazy yeah a little bit crazy right woo just falling how about these guys that CH Cliff jump you know with them shoots on and fly like that and go down anybody want to do it no but you've been called to [Laughter] fly but we can sit here and we can imagine what it'd be like to be a bird right or a airplane not an airplane but let's say eagle amen and go way up there I don't know about you but if I was sitting up like these buzzards up here on the top of our roof you know if you sat up there you sure sure wouldn't jump off the edge now would you but them guys ain't got no problem just here we go we've all I don't know about you but I've have imagine what it'd be like just to to do that just to fly everywhere I've dreamt I've flown many times many times I've went up into the air about 20 30 ft and I had the power in my mind just to keep me there but then I begin to realize hey you're dreaming and oo down okay cuz I didn't want to come down this is too much fun amen but to think the fly on those Heaven those up there how free that is it's much different in an airplane not Earthbound anymore you don't have oh my road rage right people cutting you off this that or the other find out we'll find out if you got perfect love and drive down on the road a little bit but go up there a little higher and so forth but we have been called how many we've been called higher than that to a higher calling even than the airplane you and I have been called to the astronaut Age and what is that age brother Bram says you go out there and I read it about two weeks ago if yall remember he says when John Glenn got in that shuttle he didn't have to do too much he didn't have to do anything just get in there and strap in and enjoy the ride and I want you to know that's where you and I live just get in the shuttle of Jesus Christ and let him can do the controls cuz he's got the controls he's got this he'll put you where you need to go it's not by your ability not by my ability but it's him that liveth in Me Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world [Applause] amen that's where we're to live by the grace of God Amen but we have to learn the real power the real power in this church isn't in everybody screaming and shouting having a good time in God the real power is created when God takes you on that solo flight hello God tries you when he tests you every son that comes must be chasen how many beli that said every son that comes to God you've got to get to that place to where you don't know if you can go on hello this is just too much almost comes out of your mouth is that what brother Braham says if that's how God's going to be almost came out of his mouth but he held it and he said the lord gave the Lord taken away the wife the love of his youth hello how many know that love is special woman that he fell in love with and then to have a little Sharon Rose a little baby is that right his wife passes away and then he goes and says God she didn't do this and there she was flies flying around ain't that right pain so much until eyes was crossed so much Agony she was in God have mercy and he just felt the black sheet didn't hear him didn't hear him not that he didn't hear him he just wouldn't answer he wouldn't give him his heart's desire because he didn't go he was disobedient ain't that right and he paid a dear price very very hard thing amen but that's where he learned amen that's where he learned that's where he got his strength the others ask him later on the doctor says did you keep your religion no but it kept me amen how many believes that's how it is got put you on trial put you on test but if you're really God's child you're ego you're made for it you're pressurized for it you're made to handle that pressure even when you don't think you can I can I dare say that if you have come to the place to where you think you can't then you still haven't gotten into a as hard a condition as a lot of people have amen but what's it do what do winds do they make you stronger they give you confidence in God look how strong David was he flew over the line Flew Over The Bear stood on top of that J not to fly over and the word over come how many Overcomers have we got see an overcomer he's above it he's over it David sit over that John cut his head off we had Victory he was an overcomer flew above it because of his faith in almighty God God just used him ain't that right to overcome same way with Samson got over a thousand Philistines if Samson could kill that many if shamgar could kill 600 I think we can kill a bunch ourselves no matter how many demons how many depressions no matter what comes with you just learn to rely on God but you've got to be surrendered to God how me that's all you can do is surrender yourself to God Amen he'll take care of the rest he'll do it many of us I have many of us has been at the place many times where you can't get over it you can't get under it you can't get around it then stand still and watch God take you through and who gets the glory not you not me he gets all the glory he flies you above it God help us don't you just love it when you're above bitterness you're above for unforgiveness you're above that you've got that love doesn't matter what anybody ever does you're going to forgive them you're not going to hold anything because it will affect you it'll mess you up and it'll bring you under why do you think people want to make you mad get you upset say something mean they want to get under your skin they want to bring you down oh my Lord help us I said you know you would never have you would never have perfect love you'd never get perfect love if somebody didn't do you wrong ain't that right cuz this character only comes through trials real character only come through that you'll never know if you really got perfect love unless somebody does you wrong and many times many of us would have to say boy I messed that one up many times that right oh yeah takes a while sometime it takes a many a storm sometime we got to be that little Eagle sometimes that's blown down in the storm I mean know sometimes the Eagles get storm they don't get above that storm like brother bam said he was out there there was a storm come by and afterwards he was there sitting by a tree and he noticed that there was a a squirrel just a chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter what are you chattering about looked around and he said oh wow look over there over there's the top of the food chain you're the btom for the food chain that was the chatter that was what the problem was a that right there's an eagle over there he kind of flopping around spread his wings a little bit getting them dry and so forth brother Brandon had his gun didn't he he was drawing those wings the storm had brought him down amen that's what happens with us Christians sometimes the storm brings us down the trial brings us down but if down on the inside you are that scripture of that eagle age you are a eagle you know that it's time to dry amen the wetness amen and the conditions of the situation take it to the word and let that word Shine On You amen God I have failed I have failed but you said that we're to forgive each other 490 times a day I believe God that you'll forgive me of my shortcoming my failure where I wanted to bust that person where I had bitterness against that person I believe you'll forget me dry those feathers cuz I'm here to tell you come to church folks come to church that's where you get the dry that warmth of the Holy Spirit here woo glory and let it dry cuz you'll dry them things and if you're a deer hunter you know that when a deer comes close don't move don't no no you didn't messed up don't reach that fast for your gun or your bow don't do it when I move this is how I move all right I'm going for my Bo cuz he's right there he's right there right there huh real slow because they have eyes unlike not not like you and I they got eyes that can see about everything they'll notice everything and it's the same way with the eagle they got eyes when that eagle was down and brother B says I could get my gun and I could shoot you let me tell you that eagle could see way better than the prophet of God CU he he said he knew that out a second that he would have reached for that gun bye-bye the eagle have been gone he wouldn't have sat a chance why cuz he had trust in his Eagle wings praise the Lord amen he Trust trust that you trust in those wings back to our story again that eagle sees that those eaglets are ready to fly we're always saying you know brother brandham did this and God did this through brother brandham and Perry green and Eddie bcll and all these other brothers but what about you what about God in you he's just as great can do just as great as stuff in you hello it's not always about the other person you've got to apply it to yourself amen sometimes we look at this and mama takes that eagle grabs and puts them out on her wings ain't that right goes out there and what does she do they ain't never been out of the nest before she shakes them off shakes them off let me see if I got this quote ready that's right and let them fall Free Falling woo I don't know about you but I hate to fall out of a tree don't you I hate to fall down anywhere where you don't have control and you don't know how it's a nightmare until you hit and then it's all over with but these guys they're free Fallen how many know sometime s God takes you out of your comfort zone and lets you free fall how can this happen how can it get this bad why because you've never really you've had a Hallelujah time a glory to God time you got the sweetness of the Holy Spirit and comfort of and joy and all of those things but you've never had it to where whoa where's this coming from why but the one thing about it is them little eaglets after a bit they'll take that little wing probably flying like that for a while right falling like that for a while toling brother B says topping over and this that of the other let me tell you something it's all right to toble a few times it's all right to to mess up a few times but eventually you better learn to set your wings we don't need all of that toling we don't need all of that flopping around we need people that's got their Fai set not to hurt each other not do things that's wrong hello not to be a chicken amen glory to God my mind goes back to the chicken yard of that farmer that put the extra egg for a Full Nest is that right and that eagle and you know what this this this message this word here could bring people out of denominations cuz that eagle was in there and packing around and eating that chicken food and it never tasted right to him he never could understand why there was something special about the chickens that look good to him hello but he he just ate with them scratched with them until mama Eagle come across the top and she went something like that is that right come out of her my people sounds right to me denominations man-made system is all of the devil sounds like right to me the word of God is the only thing true 4500 different churches and different ideas it's wrong thus saith the Lord woo that sound like a ego scream to me come out of her my people that you partake not of her sins that you receive not of her plagues how many's heard that cry aren't you glad to have heard that cry come out of sin come out of the world come to the Lord

when it's going good for you everything's going fine you're on the Mountaintop you're on the flowery bed of EAS so to speak you don't have to learn to fly just chill and enjoy it but when it's going bad when it's going hard amen that's why I said with me and my wife we've had a lot lots of different tests and trials but I felt like this was the biggest one yet this is the biggest one yet between life and death hello a fight to the death death and guess what he's loser the devil is [Applause] loser wo GL and that's God's grace that's God's [Music] grace I'm looking for something to jump on why

Hallelujah I'm so happy amen cuz I'll be honest with you I didn't know I'd have her till Christmas at one time I says I don't know if she'll make it to Christmas and that was that's when I was tore up it was it was you learned to set your wings in that you learn to set your wings and I have I have learned to set the wings and we all have haven't we I say we but we all have this church here you've set your wings and believe for her churches thank you everywhere all the churches that H up on prayer requests every week thank you God bless you God hears our prayer amen how many's glad for that but he sets you on a solo amen nothing you can do and just learn to set your wings make makes it to where you've got to either fly or die ain't that right or you're going to hit the ground but you know this is this the one quote that I pulled up that I really like when she sees that some of from Topsy Turvy and this out of the other they're dipp in going a stride she brings him right back up again notice and places him in this where they're supposed to be now they go so high and she can she can fly so fast why she can fly a hundred times faster than they can fall I like that don't you he can fly much faster than what you can fall he'll come underneath you and he'll pick you up I'm so glad that he has many times had to pick me up he's had to pick you up he will never let you go Mercy said no he'll never let you go when you're Topsy God will come and pick you up he'll swoop under you he can fly faster than you can fall how many's glad for that this morning praise be to God Amen Let Me Wind It Down just a couple good things this message that we have is a astronaut age message ain't that right it's a eag message fly higher than anybody has flown before why we have to I mean know we barely have faith for a toothache brother Bram said how are we going to have faith for Rapture then he goes to talking about that seeing all the things that we've seen and the healings that's been done ought to give us rapturing Faith he said that many times it ought to give us rapturing Faith one place I do believe he said that the the rapturing faith lays in the message how many beli that it's there but you got to climb up to it I got to climb up to it now you didn't realize I thought man there's a lot more than just rapturing my faith in this message amen how many believes that wedding garment that we're to wear when we meet him is in this message he said you know I counsel thee buy me gold tried into fire that thou mayest be rich and have white rment is that right that you me be clothed upon so if we come out and S with him and he with me amen we're going to that's what we're doing this morning coming and supping with him and it's going to close us it the word closes us dresses us of course we know that true that true dressing brother Braham said what what is what is the true clothe that we leave here with it's character amen the gold that God's looking for is character in his people I just I truly believe believe I truly believe that God through the prophet through the prophet restored the fullness of the word to us don't you wouldn't it be something well no it wasn't quite enough we need another one no no no no no no that means this wasn't complete but I believe it's complete that's right to restore us restore the understanding of what Christ is really coming back for the understanding of Revelations 3:18 amen what the real goal of God is what the clothing of God is what the eyes have is to be able to see amen and listen to what El he said he said you notice not only that not only are you Justified as though you never done it in the first place if you're believing every jot every TT you stand there The Virtuous sinless spotless bride of Christ how many of these that's in this message that's where we fly to that's how high we want to go to be the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and our sins are gone as though we never did it in the first place that's higher than any other preacher I ever heard tell me about it but not only that but she said that we're going to a wedding in the sky and you are also wearing your wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace how many's got the wedding band off Hallelujah of unmar Grace not of your own selves but God did it God chose you [Applause] Hallelujah Lauren did you ask Weston the Maria you didn't Weston asked you to marry him he chose you a't that right Lauren can I go on a date with you will you go out with me sometime right he chose he made that move and she responded it wasn't her choosing him he chose us amen and he puts the wedding ring on us unmerited favor is in the message of the hour that's how high we go Hallelujah you don't want to know what else in the message you want to know what else is up here I love it when you get way up here but B says Eagle man when you get way up there you can see so far that right doesn't do any good for an eagle to get that high if he can't see well my goodness if everything down on Earth was a blur he wouldn't do no good down there just have a joy ride but he can go way out there and he can see a rabbit or something at a long distance and here he comes our Prophet was the eagle he went plumbed back and saw what C Eve's hair was oh that ain't nothing that ain't nothing he went back before he even made the first star the first moon before he was ever made he went seen way back there and seen God Alone thinking some thoughts and you and I were in it that's how far back he's so woo and that thought has transferred down into you and to me and we you realize if you ever are going to make it you already made it your name was already written and we can fly high devil don't try to tell me I ain't going to make it devil don't try to make me I ain't going to make it I am going to make it wo that's right cuz I already did those who predestinated he called he justified he glorified even glorified already Fly Above these fusses and stews of churches and doctrines and little bitty things that the devil tries to do amen I so told you another thing I want to show you you know what else is up here all right praise the Lord May me something let me see something else beautiful up here he says and that's the way it is with a Christian I love it be I love being a Christian how many loves being a Christian how many is happy with being a Christian I don't know what I would do brother Bram says if I wasn't a Christian I'd almost be a suicide case almost be a suicide case if he wasn't a Christian because God meant for us to have his holy spirit in our hearts to direct us in everything that's our way of a Christian we are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out everything we have need of in his life's journey amen Divine Healing the power of God all these things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you are planted Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for this life's journey and other plac he says and for the world to come [Applause] what should that do to us oh my didn't Paul S Paul said everything's yours all things are yours things that are present future Angels leaving the world to come death is even yours she said everything is yours everything you have need of is in you amen and everything you have need of love that even the Rapture is in you right then brother B says don't you resent that that's the truth how many knows where he went he went to Romans 8 he says some whom he has called Justified he has also already glorified so in God's mind you are already raptured you are already glorified in God's mind amen when you receive that baptism of the Holy Ghost don't resent that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now amen I like what Brother Brad said he says the coming of the lord it's not something we're just looking for we're living it we're living the coming of the Lord we're living out the Rapture right now amen praise be to God don't resent that the Rapture is in is now I will prove it by the gospel Those whom me Justified Justified has already glorified then in heaven today we are glorified in the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out into it Hallelujah we done left the Earth we done left Pentecost we done left all the church inity amen we left that cage of every unclean and hateful bird hello we've left that and went into the heavenlies and we are keep pushing on there's no limit to our speed there's no limit to our power God is able to do more than you can ever imagine he can stop the moon the stars don't you never limit God in your life God is able to take care of every problem that you have every situation that you have all you have to have is him all you need is Jesus all you need is the Holy Ghost leading and guiding you and you'll be an eagle saring in the [Applause] heavens all the way to to the translation cuz without this Eagle age you're not going to make it in the Rapture you'll come up maybe in the second Resurrection Christians may make it under other circumstances but to be in the Rapture to be the Bride of Jesus Christ you've got to be in the message of the hour because brother bandam said it this way he says we know that the church the Pentecostal Church could by no means means by no means carry out the last day message in its present condition hello why they're not flying they're fussing about whether he's coming on a white horse or on the cloud the Oneness the Tess the threeness the United Pentecostal this that or the other I that was the latest move y'all quiet why we can't even agree on one or two words in the Bible wouldn't it be bad if I had to come up here and preach and none of you said amen half the time and I'll tell you what' be even worse if I'd say stuff that you couldn't say Amen to well that sure ain't what the prophet said that sh ain't what the Bible said wouldn't you hate to have to sit there probably wouldn't sit there very long I wouldn't sit there very long I wouldn't listen to myself oh that's right why because anytime the devil tries to talk to me here I said don't you listen to that ain't that right oh praise be God we got to agree how many we got to be unified aren't you glad that we can have Unity thank you Jesus for the unity at evening light Tabernacle that agrees that we will say what the prophet said we will eat this Eagle food and it will translate us it'll take us out of here we're going to take a part of change one of these days but first he has to work on us and teach us to Fly Fly Above sin doubt oh my that chatter chatter chatter chatter when you get down listen when you get down or you backl now where you ought to be you don't listen to the devil telling you well you're not really a Christian you're not really a eagle huh you can't never overcome this don't you listen to it it's the LIE of the devil yes you can you can fly higher how many knows this flesh is very strong it's very powerful and you won't overcome it by yourself that's right no you've got to have the Holy Ghost to overcome the desires of this flesh the Holy Ghost gives you power over the desires of your flesh that's right that's the only way it's when you're focused on God God gives you the power he actually gives you a nature change a't that right he gives you a desire change a nature change cuz you're going to do what your nature amen so don't listen to the chatter of the devil praise be to God Amen you love the Lord learn musicians if you'll come do like David learn to lean on God Amen do like any other prophet but any other child of God learn to lean on him let's stand this morning with our heads bowed play something softly sister Becky if you would I feel led maybe there's somebody in here that you feel like you're that eagle a Storm's got you down you're not flying above this and you're not flying above that this still affects you still holds you you still don't have power over this you're not an overcomer you haven't overcome some things and you'd like to do that by surrendering your life this morning a fresh maybe you've did it before I don't know God knows everybody's heart I just want to do as the Holy Spirit leads me to do if you want to come up and rededicate your life to God and say God I want to recommit myself to you this morning I got to fly higher than what I have been flying I have to live higher than I've been living and I refuse to listen to the chatter chatter of the devil telling me lies telling me I'm not a son and daughter of God that I can't overcome this whatever it is in your heart you can't overcome that yes you can you can be victorious some many believes that you can be victorious by simply surrendering your go life right now aresh to God next week I'm believing here next
