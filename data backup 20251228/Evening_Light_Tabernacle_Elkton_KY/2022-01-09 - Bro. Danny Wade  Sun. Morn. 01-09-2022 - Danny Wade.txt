========================================

i use irvin and mars they're not here this morning but they know that when i was younger and anybody knew that when i was younger and i had a i've i had a terrible time remembering stuff short-term memory i just and it's not so much my memory i don't think it is i need a good pound in the head to try to you know try to remember stuff same way with names you know it's hard to remember names i got to try to sound somebody's name over and over again or identify them with a certain number whatever not a certain uh letter or something you know to try to remember their names when you first meet somebody how many has to do that try to let's try to remember this person's name but the other day caleb says dad you just have a terrible short-term memory i'm like nah i don't have a short term what are you doing you know but i went to lowe's i bought one of these uh drills uh known as a jigsaw a jigsaw and a sander and they they were on sale from 69 to 49 a tractor supply for it wasn't the ryobi but it was porter cable right and i said wow that's a good price for a good sander and a good jigsaw and i'm going to have to cut some lights out so i need to exhaust i got home and i said boy honey i got a good deal and i began to look at it and open the box got it out and i said where's where's the battery in the charger you know there's no battery charge i don't know about you i said how can they do that to a man i think that's left almost upset yet you know but anyway and so to make a long story short i had of course go back and buy something i was in the store and and and i went back to well i was down in tractor supply and in clarksville and and i said well that's where i got it and uh you know first i was looking for iowa i said i gotta i called caleb i said what was it that i bought was it ryobi or what was it he says no it's porter cable okay thank you thank you thank you and it's porter cable so i went over there and sure enough they had the same uh porter cable they were selling the same thing and i went and talked to the manager basically the main guy there and i said at first i looked around everywhere and i couldn't find it i'm talking he looked on his computer no we don't have that at the time so all right so i went to home depot down talking tonight and and i got to looking around there and and for uh what was it again railby or porter cable you couldn't remember what it was i i couldn't believe how many times i forgot that folder came what's the hardest thing to remember the world as is i was i was discussing with myself how many times i forgot and what that was i remember seeing the chop saw and they had the bigger stuff as a in a porter cable but and i went back to that aisle three times to remember the name of that porter cable because i couldn't remember either kept going right over i said you really are there's something wrong with you but anyway you know but uh anyway so we didn't get anywhere they didn't have it lowe's didn't have it nobody had it but it's probably what they have is aquatic sales gimmick anymore but anyway just to think about that you know and i said boy i last another 10 years and you know what am i going to be like what's it going to be like i won't remember how to get home but no let's not do that amen we won't confess that but look i thought about you know that for a believer how many knows a believer like abraham it says that abraham look for a city whose builder and maker is god how many know that we long for something that that is eternal amen something that lasts forever that doesn't change that's the goal that's the ambition of the believer is to have something that does continue how many knows that like we spoke here about a week ago or so talking about we do have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken right but we have a kingdom within us how many knows the kingdom of god is within us and that kingdom cannot be moved it cannot be shaken so we have a hold of something that's eternal aren't you glad to have a hold of jesus christ that even though the outside fades even though the outside fades away and and so forth that one that on the inside you have confidence that it doesn't matter how wrinkled this get it don't matter if you draw your last breath you have something that's eternal not we'll have but have something now that's eternal and it's the same faith that abraham had when god spoke to him he left his city he left his country he left his kin folks because he was in pursuit so to speak of that eternal city whose builder and maker is god amen isn't it nice to see people that are solid and that don't change many knows a real christian they don't change you know now i know they change for the better right but they're not they're not up and down and in and out amen sometimes we in our flesh sometimes we do that but overall in the long run you realize that person is just solid i could name names and i'm not gonna but you know when you see somebody that's just for the last 30 years i've been here about 30 years and for 30 years just like a rock just oh yeah i did storms come storm go but that person their anchor is in christ and they don't move that that doesn't change it shows that they have something that does continue amen praise be to god amen so i was thinking that i was just thinking you know we're thankful for uh something that does continue amen and whether it's our strength brother branham looked at his dad and i i don't know i've never been sunburned so badly until the shirt stuck on the back of my my my skin have you but i think brother uh ram talked about his dad heist his dad had you know he was so uh he had worked so hard and so forth and i guess son or whatever that his shirt was stuck to his his back you know he was muscles and he could lift a 900 pound log and so forth and just strong men thought he might have been live forever at 52 he was gone amen i think brother bannon was about 56 when he left i think brother tommy sent me that the other day he made 56 years old and he was gone you know and i'm thinking i'm turning 60 that's 22nd that's gonna be in two weeks and then i told my wife i says in two weeks it's my 60th birthday on the way to church and and she kind of i don't know she acted different than what she normally does when i tell her my birthday she like really he was like wow really for real and with you know what i'm doing and building the audition and all the work that i do now he says well you're just young yet you know and i was like thank you honey i love you too you know but anyways as i hope i have many good years left but anyway i'll tell you what when you have a big old 6-0 staring in your face you know you're not just too young anymore amen but we do thank god for his eternal amen like that song says there my home shall be eternal amen how many likes that just be anchored in christ going through his life not having to worry and knowing that this fades away but guess what he doesn't never fade away and we know the one that is the same yesterday today and forever amen and we look forward to that because eternity what eternal life what eternity is is when brother went beyond the curtain of time what did he say he says there was no yesterdays right and there's no tomorrows it's hard for us to imagine that but everything is right now and it stays right now it stays that way amen i'll say what whenever you i think it'll be like uh the prophet of god when he was overjoyed out there in the woods and running around the tree and just shouting and praising god you know i mean that's what it's going to be like when we get over there amen or when we get to worshiping the lord singing songs to him and we sing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved the wretch like me you're getting that atmosphere and you just want to stay in there in the atmosphere amen and you'll get to one of these days we'll get to amen and i look forward to that i thank god that we have a kingdom that can't be shaken and we have a city and then in a life that's eternal that doesn't change amen that does amen so we appreciate god amen so praise the lord if you will amen we'll just turn it over to brother david at this time to worship the lord and let's do that let's i know like i said i really i believe in worshiping the lord how many believes in worshiping lord and when we sing the songs it's not just a sing a song it's if you express yourself how you feel amen in that song to god amen and what is that song uh talks about let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear how many wants your worship to be sweet in his ear this morning amen god bless you amen i'll just say a couple more words this morning amen remember like i said with brother danny i mean how many will pull this morning amen make it easy for him to preach amen and to bring the word of god let's do what we can for our brother amen somebody i've i'm very glad amen and very proud this morning amen i know the way family we have appreciated them amen all these years amen and we've watched their kids grow up now to see one of them perhaps becoming a minister i believe it would be the

with the lord this morning and amen i don't know i don't know why that it it is upon our minds but i was sitting there in my chair this morning and i just started laughing and uh jenna said what and i

can't be here but there's just nothing that takes the place of being in the house of god i you know and i know our our system is trying its best and i i thought well the song service when i watched the other day it would kind of circle out but then when brother brad began to preach it just leveled out and i said well thank you lord there was no interruptions and i thought well lord you just help that to work because you know there's a lot of benefit some people can't come to the house of god and it's good that they can and i guess all of us abandoned brother thomas wednesday night he had to do everything so we appreciate by the thomas this morning and but you know god is good this morning and i was i was sitting there in the office this morning and the songs that last couple of days and

all for the music [Applause] so um i believe uh me standing here today um is prophecy being fulfilled because my mom told me that when i was being dedicated that she heard god tell her that i was gonna be a preacher now i didn't understand it then because i i was i was young and i didn't want to be a preacher either neither was i ready and um but god always has it planned out so one day uh i heard a voice tell me something is going to happen today that is going to change your life and i didn't know if that was god or not i thought that was strange because nothing like that ever really happens to me every day so like um and like later that day i was i was watching a video of a witness of the miracles of william branham and i was getting quite emotional and i had i'd started praying and what my mom said and about when i was being dedicated came into mind and and i i started thinking like should i ask god for a sign if i meant to be a preacher or not and then ju just then um i heard the the voice of god tell me in my head that um someone will tell you that you meant to be a preacher and i thought that's strange because it's like um the only um place i was going after that was like my parents place and how is that gonna happen i was like and and so when i went over there um i started talking to god and to my sister because like that was um well that was what uh i was doing i i had a reason to do that because of something i forget what we were talking about but um but then behind me my sister annabelle tells me that danny's probably meant to be a preacher and i thought that right there i i was just i was just praying for that sign so all right um so i'll just get um started uh i'll start let's pray father god i pray that that you helped me this day to bring a message to your people lord help me to to um show them and um how to get closer to you lord god because we all want to get close to you lord and i i believe that at this day we all will get closer to you lord because i believe that that is your will lord and i i pray that you help me to get closer to you and get the people to get closer to you lord because that's our desire lord god and and lord i pray that you'll help me to preach what you wouldn't preach lord lord just help me and help the the people to hear you lord god lord i pray that you'll speak through me lord that that the people might hear you lord god i pray this in your precious thing lord jesus christ amen all right let's uh turn and your bible if you will to um psalm 1 and we'll read verse 1 to 3. blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the sea of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doeth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper and uh also another verse proverbs 4 25-27 let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy waste be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil may goddess blessings to the word you can be seated now i read this uh a while ago um and it caught my attention when i read this when distractions overtake time with god it leaves the door wide open for the enemy to drop temptation in and i wrote down on my notes uh like that vision that brother branham had as the bride marching that he had of the bride marching onward toward the sky and as they were marching some of them began looking around they started to get distracted or or something like that now um like like he said um uh well i i put this down but um don't look left don't look right keep marching forward that's that that's what the devil does sometimes he he'll create a diversion to get your attention and get you off guard and then slip temptation in and it will be easier to get you to fall because you are off guard see and you'll begin to start backsiding if you're not careful and sometimes satan will send a diversion to get us off the path we are meant to be on and it'll be so subtle sometimes and seems so innocent we'll be blind to it and it it may seem like such a a small thing that seems like it don't matter but if it consumes all your attention or brings or it may just have a part of your attention but if it brings you to a place where you're no longer fully focused on god you better watch out now now see distractions are everywhere because we get so caught up with the destruction of this world even a cell phone we um get uh focused on on on other things like sometimes we'll we'll put on a tv or something and uh we'll begin to start start looking at other things and and and we'll get sidetracked and something will come up and we'll and we'll forget to we'll begin to forget to read the word of god and we'll forget to to focus on god like we should and we're all guilty of that sometimes if even me because because i know how hard it was and as this week to to just fully focus on god and i i begin to to realize that that we we get so caught up with focusing on other things that that we don't i mean what we should really focus on every single day and that should be our main focus every day i mean sure we got our jobs we got things we do every single day and and and but sometimes we let that get a hold of us and we we begin to to start looking at other things you know if if we can if we can only see where it takes us sometimes and and get it back focused on god again now um distractions are all around us we've got to be what about it we've got to have self-discipline otherwise it will control us and consume our time which our time is our most valuable asset our time is limited distractions and pleasure is unlimited but not eternal if we focus all our time on god how we may serve him we'll get closer to god and get to that place where we're in his perfect will and and sometimes you know we we we just you know sometimes we don't feel like you know reading the bible or listening to william brandon tapes and stuff and we get we we get um side tracted you know and and if if we if we keep doing that then we'll we'll just get it further off and get in a worse place than we were before now i i found this out the other day the the number one cause for accidents in the world is distracted driving not being focused on the road we we need to stay focused on god so we don't get into accidents along the way that's the leading cause for backsiding distractions overtaking people's time to where they stop going to church stop seeking god and start and start focusing on the things of the world it could be something to happen i don't know but it could simply be something that came up it isn't always something that is sinful that comes up just something that diverts your attention don't ever let the devil divert your attention off of god he deserves all of our attention we need to develop a mindset that any time that we should spend with god but don't is an opportunity to spend with god wasted not an opportunity to do something else that seems more enjoyable sometimes we will always choose to spend time doing something else that we like to do because it's fun and picking up that bible and listening to brother brandon preach just just seems so boring sometimes excuse me i was i was sick yesterday so i still got a little bit of um mucus in my system so this generation has the most dopamine highs you can get you can get everybody it um wants to do what what makes them happy it seems seems that no one wants to even pick up a book because they got their phone we we need to put a stop to staying so focused on doing what makes our flesh feel good and start disciplining ourselves to do what our flesh doesn't want to do amen we get so distracted focusing on ourselves that we forget to focus on god we need to get back focused on god i mean i mean this you know sometimes sometimes the the devil always does that like like we um we get so focused on other things and and get so caught up with with these other things and you know it that's what what happens we we get off track and we start focusing on on the things that we shouldn't focus on and um and one one thing is we we just just need to get back focused again you know and and uh i mean there's a lot of us that that uh have a television in our house i mean it it does depend on what you watch on it but but if you're if you're sitting there watching it all day long and is is having all your attention and everything when we start to to do that when we start allowing these things to to get our attention to to focus on those those things like like uh for me i i was focused on on watching tiktok because it becomes an addiction these things like that like this our phones our devices are our tv it becomes addictions that we get so focused on it we get we get so focused on these things because it becomes addiction and we enjoy doing these things but but that then we allow it to to um take the place of the the bible we even say we got we got the bible app on our our phones let's just read the bible on our phones but but then another notification will will come up and we'll go on on instagram or tick tock or something like that because because uh someone messaged me it better takes back someone someone someone ends calling me right now i was reading in the bible but i gotta take this call i don't know who it could be it could be important sometimes we can't put our phones down because because we we we get so um focus on our phone that that we begin to allow it to overtake our time and overtake what what we should be doing we should be focusing on god every single day more than anything else more than going on our phones and our devices and more than than doing any of these other things because these other things like phones and and i don't know your tablet your um tv it's not as important and but it feels a whole lot better to do those things because we enjoy doing it but if only we could just enjoy reading the word of god and and focus on god enjoy getting into prayer and really just as praying to god and and focusing all of our attention on god that that's the most important thing i pray that that each and every one of us can get a closer walk with god and focus on god more instead of focusing on these other things that don't matter that we always get our attention on because we like to do those things we like to sure it's it's all right to do it you know because a little bit but when it overtakes all of our time to where we can't focus on god then it sometimes it just has to go right instead of uh getting rid of the time to focus on god that that our attention and gets on these devices and so forth that that we that it overtakes time with god instead of letting this get dusty why don't we let this get dusty instead and focus on god again instead of doing these other things you know i mean it's it's great and all that all the devices we got i mean but when when you think about it satan uses these devices more than god does and and and if satan can get our attention and if he can get our attention even if he doesn't cause us to sin but if he causes us to to um to focus on these things instead of focusing on god then he's got us and we need we need to to get back to focusing on god we need to to get back to doing these things rather than focusing on our phones and devices and so forth because i mean you know um who who uh which one of us doesn't have a phone in our house which one of us i mean there's a lot of us that don't have tvs and stuff because willie and brandon preach against that but it's it's what you watch on this is a tiny little tv screen and and what what you go on on it that's that's what counts because see uh you can watch really innocent movies and stuff but but uh what you watch on on this phone what you go on that that counts it's tuned for sure i mean um you could have a tv screen in your house and and all you do on it is is um i don't know you listen to william branham that then that that's all right i say that that's fine because you could do that the same thing on these little devices you got here on the screens and stuff you can and use it for for the glory of god or you can lose use it for for satan and and uh this distracting distracting you from focusing on god and we do that every single day we focus too much on these devices because we like going on these devices and ed and sometimes they can be simply devil the devil's devices we need we need to get back to focusing on god instead of these other things i mean you know sometimes it's just like um we have uh important things to deal with and all that that's all right but when it over takes your time and and distracts you that that's where you're going and wrong another another word i was thinking of the word diversion an instance of turning something aside from its course something intended to distract someone's attention from something more important and and that's what these things can be diversions that that satan and and technology is one of satan's biggest weapons against us sometimes satan will send a diversion to guess off the path we are meant to be on but it will be so i think i read this one but um yeah it'll be so subtle and so innocent that we'll be blind into it what happens when water isn't heated or cold it becomes lukewarm that's what happens when we don't focus on god when destruction is overtake time with god we start becoming lukewarm we become like lukewarm water just sitting there we need a good heating to get back focus on god regardless of what we feel like doing peter had what water what peter when he had walked out on the water looking at jesus he was focused on jesus and he he asked jesus if he could um walk out on the water towards him and and and jesus said come and and uh he he he walked out looking at jesus he all of a sudden and became uh focused on the wind he started looking at the wind he got distracted by the wind in the storm he his focus drifted from jesus to the storm and he became fearful and started sinking in the water we we we get that waste sometimes we start we start out focus on god then then storms and trials come up we begin to get fearful and start looking at the trials rather than keeping our eyes on jesus now uh i got i got this this uh story um that i wrote down in an ancient indian stage was i mean indian sage was teaching his students the art of archery one one day the stage wanted to test the skill of the students in archery so he called out he he called out all of them he put a wooden bird as the target and asked him to aim at the eye of the bird the first student came who he was asked to describe what he saw he said i see the trees the branches the leaves the sky and the bird in its eye the sage asked the student to wait then ask the second student the same student he asked this the other student the same question the second student replied i only see the eye of the bird the the sage asked him to release the bow the arrow went straight and hit the eye of the bird if we if we start begin to start looking at other things and and uh and and you know get start getting distracted and looking at other things and and then say we're focusing on god as well in the midst of it and then and when we when we do that we um we will miss if we we're trying to to shoot the the arrow and and we we see the sky the wind everything else and and and and then and the eye of the bird we'll end up missing but if we just stay focused right on that bur the eye of that bird will hit it and no matter what so just stay focused on god and not these other things and not that's what happens with with the nominations and stuff they they get um so focused on the little things and and uh different theologies and stuff that a man came up up with on his own own and without the the spirit of god leading him and then they begin and to go by man's traditions and theologies and so forth that that they missed the mark the uh when william branham came they and and they they didn't know him just like the pharisees didn't know no jesus when he walked the earth they were so focused on their traditions and so forth that they didn't notice yes the the the god that they were serving they turned him down sometimes we'll get so we'll get so focused on our on our past that it'll prevent us from being a brighter future because we're always looking distracted by our past our past will haunt us and and keep trying to get at us and we need we need to let go of those things and and forgive ourselves for those things because we've already been forgiven why are we holding on to those things so we need to just stay focused on god and not these other things that that we we ourselves put in the way that the devil doesn't even have to do anything when we're when we distract ourselves when i was uh younger maybe uh 10 years ago or so we had goats and we we would let them out and let them eat grass everywhere but they weren't allowed to eat the fruit trees but they they would always try try to eat them we would take turns watching them and and i remember it was my turn and i had this caught an innotab and as uh i was watching them one one of them would inch closer and closer like like she she was just eating the grass that then would look at me and made sure i was distracted that then the goat would start eating as fast as she could knowing i was i was going to notice and chase her away any moment that that when i when i chased her away she begins in grass again close by like nothing happened and and began began sneaking there again but but she would wait till i was distracted she would wait till i was distracted and and then and then uh and and then she'll go and eat them not not when i'm looking if i'm looking then i'll go chase your way real quick and uh but um that that's what what the devil does wait wait till we're distracted then he'll pounce a lion waits till his prey is focused on something else not alert and aware of its surroundings he'll he'll wait till till we're looking and over here and we'll we're sidetracked for from god and we begin to focus on ourselves or something and we'll focus on on uh different things and then he and before we know it then something will come up so so it doesn't have to be something that's that's uh right in front of us like oh look the devil is trying to uh cause me to send here it'll be very subtle it's always subtle because satan's smart he knows we're getting we're getting closer to god and stuff and we're we're when we're focused on god he'll he'll wait and he'll put uh distractions that we'll want to focus on he'll wait till we we distract ourselves and then he'll come in and then and then while we're we're unaware while we're we're focusing on something else that's when he'll strike that's when he'll he'll get at us and that's when when he'll he'll try and cause us to sin and cause us to do other things that's what that's what the devil does he causes us to fall in sin and and everything else like that and and and we'll do it to ourselves when we distract ourselves and focus on something else when we should be focusing on god and we do these other things and and and then you go and say oh it's the devil's fault well you you put it on yourselves you you um you distracted yourself you did made a choice to focus on something else rather than god would put these other things before god and focus on something else you're making this to be an idol and we do that we do that sometimes we we put these other things before god instead of focusing on god like we should we put stuff like our phones tvs and everything else they become idols to us and we we begin to get focused on these other things instead of focusing on god like we should instead doing these other things we get so caught up with uh with our own own pleasures and stuff that we put in front of our face that we put to distract us and and make us fall away it's not always the devil that does it it sure he he he probably made it and he knew that we would choose to distract ourselves sometimes and then and know that that we choose it and and ourselves and then and then he'll wait till we we're distracted and like like a lie and like i was saying when when a lion is is trying to get prey trying to sneak up and really be quiet um you know and then uh that little antelope or whatever eating eating grass you know in this normal appetite it's not doing anything wrong it's just eating grass but but that antelope knows that it should be aware there's always always an enemy ready to strike it right ready to to um palace on it instead of being aware all the time we need to be aware of these these things we need to be always aware that satan's going to always try to strike us and if we ain't focused like we should be it will make it easy for him now i got a few verses here um all right uh what one corinthians 10 12 to 14 if you would turn with me wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take he lest he fall that there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but we but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it wherefore my daily beloved flee from idolatry and that's what it is distractions become idolatry if we let it these distractions like there there's some people that that will sit and watch tv all day and and um not bother to pick up this bible or to read it or maybe even and uh she he could say whatever could say um well i i do read like a little bit uh you know like at the end of the day but the rest of the day watching is sitting down watching tv on god and we we just do these things we just put god to the side and and and have it as a side thing where we're focused on on worldly things and then on the side we follow god we we do on the side we and we we get that way sometimes where where we focus on on god on the side it's just a side thing where um our main focus is on a job or on a on something else and this will be a side thing god doesn't want to be a side job but of that that you you focus on god part of your life he wants to be in all of your life in everything and focus on god and and those that do focus on god god are blessed usually because blessed are those that seek god and this verse lamentations 3 25 the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him so if we we wonder why why god is is uh it seems like god's just putting me to the side and i'm just a side thing that god deals with what are you doing when you put god to the side and you say god ain't listening to your prayers and budding and focusing on you maybe we need to focus on god more because if we ain't focusing on god enough and we're focusing on these other things then then how how is who is god to fight to um to how is god to answer your prayers when you ain't and praying enough and you ain't focusing on god enough and and you putting him to the side even though we do these things god is still faithful even though we put him to this side and stuff he'll stay telling prayers when when in reality we're just being impatient he hasn't answered it yet he will answer in his own timing and but we get get that way sometimes we we put god as a a side a side thing that we do do on the side and we focus on god on the side and and we don't need to do that we need to focus on god more instead of this instead of focusing on him on the on the side he's not a side job he wants to be he wants to be surrounding our entire life that that we need to to meditate on him daily not on these other things we get our thoughts are full of what's going on in the day time what's happening at work and what's what's going on and stuff god wants to be a part of all of our our thoughts he wants when we see when we love something we think about it and when when we love something so much we'll focus on it and if we love god we'll focus on god so so those that that say i don't got time to focus on god you can make time you can if you can make time to watch television and do what you want you can most definitely make time to to to focus on god 1 1 chronicles 16 10 and to 11 glory in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually amen we need to seek god continually that's what the what the bible says we should do we should do that we should constantly seek god with all that we have in all of our strength we we pray god let me be in your perfect will let me let me do what you want me to do let me um get in your perfect will well if we want to get in his perfect will his perfect will is for us to focus on him fully focus on him first focus on him with all all the time that we can because time is running out as well there might may come a time when when they try to take this bible away from us and they try to try to tell us we can't focus on god and tell us that we we can't do these things i don't know when the end that's going to happen then but but god does and and we need to focus on god as much as we can because that that's how we get closer to god read the bible and pray that's how we get closer to him so if we read the bible and pray every single day then then we know every everything will be all right and we begin to worry less we begin to get closer to god and we begin to to um and to have that peace that passes understanding if all of our attention is focused on god and if and if we've been born again then our desires will be to focus on god with everything we got and we will desire to do these things we will desire to focus on god instead of instead of these other things sometimes we we we just get so caught up in these things though and and and our focus becomes on these other things when they they shouldn't be and and these other things are merely distractions anything that that is distracting you from god that brings your attention away from god is a distraction and we need to get back focused on god and sometimes we'll we'll do that without even noticing and what we'll begin to to look at um you know what's going on and i mean that's that's all right but i'm saying is i'm not saying you can't go on on your phone and you can't do these things but i'm saying when it when it becomes a higher priority than god and it becomes a distraction that you're no longer fully focused on god that's when you need to when need to put this away sometimes and and for me it really does it really does become a distraction sometimes even for me because um because i'll have like um when so many notifications come up and all that and i want to see all the likes i got a post and stuff and we we get we get those those dopamine highs from from looking at the likes that we got and all that stuff i mean dope the word dopamine um if you don't know what that means that means a pleasure hormone we get it from drinking water we get we we get it from um from anything that we enjoy doing so there's nothing wrong with getting dopamine it's just getting in the wrong things too too much and it becomes an addiction in and see i had to put a restriction on myself i put screen time on on in the settings because i got tired of it becoming a distraction and and me focusing on that and i'll be like okay i'm just going to scroll through instagram just a few minutes turns into an hour or something that's how it get that's how it goes sometimes when you get like that and if if only we could could get get like that about reading the bible and stop it from deciding i'm going to read the bible for um a few minutes and then it turns into an hour and and i'm going to pray and then it turns into an hour or two hours or where however long it's it's a whole lot better to be addicted to the bible and addicted to following god and addicted to to seeking god that's the addiction i want to get to get closer to god with following the scriptures and and seeking god with all of our heart and and we we see that that verse a lot of people misinterpreted that um if if uh i forget what it's it is uh says specifically but i think it it says um uh yeah it says delight yourself in the lord and and uh you will get your heart's desire and but but some people think oh oh if i delight myself in the lord i'm going to get this really nice lamborghini and i'm going to get this big manchester no no you ain't going to get those things that doesn't mean that it means that when you delight yourself in the lord your once will will be what what he wants for you and then you'll get those things that god wants for you because because you've your hearts your heart will change our hearts will will change if we delight ourself in the lord and we'll want what he wants for us and we'll well that's that's that'll be our full our only desire is to the perfect will of god to be done in our lives and and that's what delight yourself and the lord will do and you'll get your heart's desire because your heart's desire will be his will in your life amen but we get so caught up with these other things we get so consumed by these other things that and then it may not be sinful but if it gets our attention over following god it becomes sinful just give me a second i guess sorry i said all my notes okay uh i got um william brandon's quotes here here's a quote by william brandon that's the thing that broke the fellowship in eden is because that eve failed to keep the focus of her looking on god's word and listen to the reasonings of the enemy see see if if she she just stayed right with god said so that settles it god and god said so but but she didn't want to do that see she changed the focus of her class and begin to see instead of being just one way that there become two ways and see we we do that sometimes what ends we we change our focus our focus at first we might have our focus on god he's going great and all that and and then and then other things will come up maybe god will bless you okay and then you focus too much on that blessing that you begin to stop focusing on god and then things will start crashing down because as maybe it's god trying to bring your attention back to him again and and we we do that sometimes we focus on these other things that do not matter and we we begin to look at these other things you know and and our focus is off of the things that should be on and i should be on god and focusing on god and sometimes he'll he'll do that to us and we'll he'll bring us to a place where it might be even even be as bad as the place where job was at where he he was as in the worst place he could be but he focused back on god again so if if we we do that and we start him drift our focus starts drifting god might try and bring our attention back to him and by bringing something like that to happy you might wonder why is god letting this happen to me why is why is that this curse come upon me it seems like why am i no longer being blessed because you're focusing on the blessings rather than focusing on god oh my and that's what we do sometimes we need to get back to focusing on god we oh my we we need to get back to that place where he's our only focus that that these other things don't matter these other things that don't matter won't take our focus and we'll we'll start thinking about god again and we'll start focusing on god again like we should but but we we don't we don't always do that because sometimes a distraction might seem important to us we really you know we like this maybe it could be someone that you're constantly texting all the time that can be distraction could you imagine um you you're praying to god all the time and then and then all of a sudden maybe uh for me or for for a young person you begin to start texting that person all the time and you're texting that person almost all night and then you begin to start forgetting to focus on god and that's what that's what we do sometimes that's that's what we do sometimes and young young people do that all the time text people so much that they're all they're thinking about is their girlfriend all they think about their girlfriend because they love them so much and and we love them so much that it it takes all of our attention and all of our focus that it becomes a distraction and if god is at the center of that relationship it will fall apart because god demands all of our attention he demands every bit of our attention and if we we're getting so focused on these other things like that we we begin to to to go off of god's perfect will and because our tent our test is tucked in by something else and and we we do that i'm not i'm not sick by the way i was just sick last week and i was getting get mucus and stuff but but that's what that's what we do we we always do that because because we our attention goes to what we love and when our attention goes to what we love and we begin to love something more than god then we'll focus on these other things instead of focusing happy all of our focus focus on god we need to get back focus on god not our girlfriends i mean sure sure your focus can be you have to even it out you can't just have all your attention to you your girlfriend or your if you're a girl boyfriend or something like that once you're all your tension is is like that and you're no longer giving all your attention to god that becomes your idol when we do that and i i got this this um another verse as wrote down it's and it's about um distracted i put wrote down here distracted because of marriage there is a difference this is what paul said 1 corinthians 7 34 to 35 there is a difference also between a wife and a a virgin an unmarried woman careth for the things of the of the lord and she that she may be whole both holy holy both in body and in spirit and and she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband and in this i speak for your own prophet not that i may cast a snare upon you but but for for that which is comely and and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction see so even a marriage a distraction that's how it is and sometimes sometimes when you get married your your own spouse becomes a distraction and that's why he said here because you're always always focused on your wife and stuff but there's has to be a balance there has to be a balance there you have to still focus on god more than these other things and constantly be thinking about god if you're constantly thinking about the other person or these other things then then our distre our focus goes on on things that sorry that don't matter as much see what we do that and that's why even in marriage is it says it says it's better to say stay single basically than to get married because because your focus will stay on god i'm i'm not saying no you should stay single but but but if it becomes so much of it as a distraction that you're not focusing on god as much then then you need to write and get back on god again because that's what truly matters not these other things that like that i mean we we do do that sometimes we we get so caught up with the other things like i mean uh if you're you're um uh just get married or something go on a honeymoon and stuff and you you'll focus on on your spouse excuse and me that's that's what we'll we we do when we love someone of course that that's all right and and that's how how we what we do we focus on the ones we love and we give them all of our attention and we focus on on the the people that we love we we go to our uh visit our parents or grandparents or and stuff because we want to see them and and you think about people you love and you pray for them and and we we do that and sometimes we forget to focus on god when he's the most important he's more important than any of these things if you put but people above god than your earth you're idolizing them anything you put before god you're idolizing them anything anything that uh demands your attention more than and god didn't give them and that attention more than in god then and it can become an idol if you if you go too far that way and and we do that and we do that all the time and and sometimes we can't help it because that's how we are that's human nature we focus on these things and and we we get so focused on on other things and and sometimes like a uh a hunter when a hunter goes um and the hunter goes hunting if if he isn't and uh focus on on uh his hunt focus on the deer then then the deer is probably gonna get away and and so so we have they focus on our target what is our our target when when we're trying to focus on something get closer to god and and stay focused stay focused on god if you won't get closer to god don't let these distractions overtake all your time and and that that's what we do we we let these distractions and so forth overtake all of our time and uh here's another quote by brother branham disappointments happened to show victory oh if we could only see that see you'd only see that these things that seems to be hurting it seems to be burying you and upsetting you these are trials they are things to stand still focus your glasses on the word of god and speak the word and then just walk forward and that's all there is to it and uh another another quote we got our we got to get ourselves focused till whether we live or die sink or down it's calvary christ that's the thing that god wants us to come back to we need to get back focused on god we need we need to get get all of our attention and i don't care if it's just a little bit more time that you focus on on reading the bible and focusing on god more if it's the it's the little things that count too if you don't if you miss out on the little things always to see all the big things and and that's that's what we we do and we think um you know maybe a few more minutes reading the bible maybe a a little bit of time in your day lunch or a time or something to to pray a little bit more to see god a little bit more that's what we need to do we need even in the little things just a little so closer to god just a little bit more focusing on god just a little more if only we could do that and then a little more the next day than that day and then a little more and a little more until until our focus becomes fully on god again instead of on these other things because as where our attention and gets our attention satan wants our attention if he can get our attention then then he can get us off the path that we should be on because because he satan demands attention and god demands our attention and and they're both fighting for our attention but we we often choose is to focus on the things of this world and stuff like these devices and stuff over god because we are flesh enjoys doing it and if it seems not sinful to do that then we'll do that all right because we don't we don't want to sin we don't want to sin but we we want to you know we don't want to sin but if it's like something that don't really matter but if it's getting all your attention then you you might be idolizing it it could be very small and and um very hey subtle with that satan does that and sometimes he'll go a little step by step a little focus more on these other things focus more on going on facebook and and doing these other things focus a little bit more on that and you know because let's say you know whisper in your ear you know you like doing those things more than reading the bible you know you like to doing these things more than following god turning on an episode on disney plus or something right rather than following god seems innocent and everything to do that it's just it's just um a little bit of um you know something to to um to get your mind off of work or something you know it's just even in the little things satan will get us in the little things he'll be focused on the little things because because we know it's just small and and if we think it's just small uh we think oh it's okay and then it becomes more and more and more it demands more of our attention more of our attention until well we we've fully forgotten to to read the bible and it becomes like at the end of the day okay let me just get my bible out real quick it's like what time is it it's oh it's almost midnight i better reverse real quick and then every goes in one ear not the other and then you think well at least i read what at the bible tonight and then they go oh i gotta pray as well i mean it's late and stuff i still gotta pray because you know you do every single night and then and then you just have a simple little prayer that that and then it becomes where you're not not in a conversation with god you're not talking about what happened in the day it's just a little prayer because you're tired and then you go to bed that's that's how it how it becomes where we put we put god at the the last thing that we do in the day we put god in as a little small thing up to the side i have this big job to do or something and then you wake up in the morning and it's like you gotta rush around and get ready and then you you just like i said read a little verse because in one year and out the other or something and then and then uh and then and uh say a simple little prayer and you get out the door and go to work because because you're running behind and and we we did we do those things and we we don't think about them but the little things do do count at least you put in the effort to do something i mean some people just get right out of bed and and just go to work and or go to sleep and forget to pray and read the bible at least you're doing something but but if that little small thing is the only thing you do every single day it's just a small thing like that every day and and um he isn't our main focus and throughout the day we're always focused on other things and never thinking about god and then it becomes a side thing following god this christian thing becomes a side thing and that's that's what what happens to it to too many believers there's i mean there's there's people in baptist churches and stuff that the entire church goes to church on sunday and the next next day everything in the sermon goes in one of you not the other and then and then they begin living the the same old life they've always been living and don't change and just smoke and drink and all these other things because there there's the this they call it this christian thing their side thing they do on sunday and do it on sunday and go maybe sometimes on wednesdays and sometimes we do that in the entire week we just read a couple of scriptures or something in the bible pray a simple prayer every single day and then and then um go throughout the day like and focus on other things and then and then on sunday you focus on god just on sunday just on on the weekend just on on wednesday maybe and sometimes we we do this we get we get so focused on on what's going on in our lives in the weekly like every single day and then and then only focus on god on sundays that's what a lot of people do a lot of people do that and then they claim the title christian and whatever but but they focus on god if they focus on god then they don't really love god if they if they ain't always thinking about god and thinking about these other things that shows which they and what things you love the most is what you think about the most and and that's why the bible says we are to to we should meditate on these things daily that just like that verse i i i read earlier in in his law doth he meditate day and night and and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that that bringeth forth his fruit and his season in his leaf also oh shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen that and that's where we need we need to get to where where we're planted by by the rivers of water when our where it gets so focused on god and seek god with all of our hearts and we're every single day instead of just saying uh god thank you for this day um i pray that that uh everything goes all right amen instead you get on your knees and pray out to god and say god i pray that that your will is done my life god i pray that that you'll let your will be done and and actually seek god and actually try to serve him instead of being so focused on the day-to-day life that what happened at work i hope this person doesn't um do what they did the all the other weeks be really annoying whatever and and and uh and actually they think about god on a daily basis and instead of thinking about that person being really annoying and whatever they're so annoying instead you pray for them and and say god help them to not be so annoying maybe and and and uh just be real kind to them in in every thing and and not not be like just try to ignore them all the time because they're so annoying and and so once you once you become so focused on god that people people at work begins to to notice it they'll notice it they always always do when all your thoughts are on god even when you're working whatever you're doing you're always thinking about god anything like man i remember that verse and or other people are just like oh i remember that post that funny post on on instagram or something i read last night that's so funny instead instead you think um it's that you think about you think about god and those those verses that you read this morning and you think about uh man god is so good instead of instead of being so focused on these other things like that and you're always thinking about god and always thinking about doing his perfect will and stuff and and just talking about god that's that's where i got to that point when i i i was at work and i began to always talk about god i always wanted to talk about god and people said so why why are you always talking about god all the time why don't why don't you talk about other things and or they'll tell me you uh if you want to preach why don't you just be a preacher that's what they told me and i said i mean i don't i don't know it's just what god's timing that that's that's why i said because um i would always talk about god and they didn't always like that but that that's all i could think about i mean that's all i wanted to talk about these other people talking about other things i always want to talk about god i don't want to say how how great i am for doing that because i know how many times i focus on other things instead but but and then i can focus on on work and stuff but when i can and i always i tried to to think about god all the time because because that that is what what um that is who i love the most and he's he's my savior he he's he's my my king i i should focus on him because i love him and and we need to get like that we think about him all the time because we're thinking about how good he is to us how how great god is and when we do that we get closer to him and we get closer to his perfect will for our life and and we need to get more like that amen we we need to get closer to god and and to be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen and and in that verse that i read this morning let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight forth ponder them and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil sometimes we'll do that we have our foot on on one one thing okay focus on god here and then we're going to focus on god over here i mean focus on the world over here focus on god over there on the side and we we we begin to and when we do that we're we're taking one one foot on on the things of the world we're saying okay let's focus on that on and then we'll focus on god on the side don't need to do that we need to focus fully on god and instead of being so caught up with these worldly things and that's what we do these things like that instagram facebook and all that is worldly stuff and we get so caught up with those things that that our focus drifts from god and it becomes on these other things and we need to get our focus back on god amen we need to get our focus back on god man um another quote by uh brother branham uh then this quite long one oh my goodness okay um now now listen real close mark faith now don't forget to get this now faith is designed to see what god wills and wants there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and get to and give to the human race to find out what the will of god is and you take your faith with a word then leave it alone you got the wrong faith but when in your god-given faith focus you with the word of god you're directly in line and zeroed oh my god help us this hour or the great hour that we live in faith designed to see what god wants how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise this is the full revelation of jesus christ you know um that when that faith that's in your focus you you too this word your focus away from all denominations and creeds and everything your focus right straight on the word of god you're zeroed in it only needs a little touch off amen that prayer flies straight in the presence of god then i won't read that whole verse but but we need we need to to to focus on on uh god more amen um musicians if you come sorry and then we need to get back folks focused with god again man how many believes died and and we get so so distractions and stuff it becomes so so that that um these these other other things overtake time with god and it needs to it needs to change amen we need to to start to start focusing back on god again because because i i know myself that i haven't been focusing on god like i should i i need to give him more of my time and and and i need to and just really really focus on god more and and that's why i begin to see this this this week um all week as i was preparing to to preach and stuff i was thinking how we all need to focus on god more and and we all need to to be more focused on god man uh if everyone could bow your heads and you know i'll just pray lord lord god i pray that you'll help us to get focused back on you again lord god because i know sometimes we get so caught up on these other things and these things in the world lord god i know we we do we get so caught up with these other things we get so focused off of your word lord god and lord i'm sorry for that i'm sorry for not focusing on you like i should lord and my hand is rave sword i i know i ain't been focused on you like i should i know i ain't been focused on you lord god i've been looking to these other things i've been looking at these other things and it's not all sinful that's what i was doing but it it it brought my attention somewhere else for god i know i've been like i should focus on your word fully planted by the water fully focus on you lord god fully focus on you all my attention lord god i know i i should be more focused on you lord lord i pray for every hand that is raised i pray that that that they can just get a closer walk with you lord god we can just focus on you more lord god that we can really just put all of our attention towards you lord god i know i've been saying that way too many times that we need to focus on you but it's true lord we do need to focus back on you lord i pray that each and every one of us will bring our focus right back on you lord god lord help us i pray this in your precious name lord jesus christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] stand with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you mean you love the lord this morning amen i think brother danny did good this morning don't you amen and i tell you what i believe if we all searched our heart and uh and ask ourselves if we actually do what that bible says how much god has asked us to do it same way with joshua remember the book of joshua he says you know he was to meditate on it day and night and so forth i believe we're all guilty of getting distracted way too much i think about myself and amen and and having been when i was younger like danny and irritating uh i think it was brother ivan and brother daniel dennis and irvin and and irritating my crew because all i would do is talk about god you know and and so that's wonder i didn't get fired but that was all my heart's desire and when i see that in danny you know not just to preach but whether he's on the job or wherever he is it's what's in inside of him he wants that amenities you know express that so that's a real good thing a real good sign that somebody loves the lord and i appreciate that amen amen it was better than what i expected i won't i won't tell him what brother branham's pastor told brother madam hey man remember brother branham's first compliment from his pastor was the worst i ever heard [Music] oh my because brother man said he would tell him sad stories had everybody boo-hoo and crying oh my did that in the other and uh what was his pastor's name roy davis i think roy davis wasn't [Music] i'm thinking so but anyway he says well yeah it's kind of like a lawyer he used to be a lawyer and he says yeah he can go up there and say to all of us this woman was done wrong and just out of the other but the lawyer never used any word or any law and that's what he said about bible is you got to give people word amen not just emotion amen and so but i think brother danny did good don't you amen so praise the lord god is good amen let's just bow our heads one more time lord jesus we do thank you for that service this morning lord and i truly do believe that you're calling on your children father lord not to be distracted and not to look from the right side or to the left lord because of all the inventions because of all the uh all the different tactics and all the different gizmos that the devil has and traps that he has set lord jesus all the carers that we have lord all the pleasures of life all the things that's out there lord now more than ever we as believers need to watch that we are not distracted and that do things don't become an idol to us lord to where it is more prevalent and more dominant in our lives in what you are lord do forgive us father for what we have failed you lord draw us closer to you lord and we know that the only way that it will ever get closer to you is to read our bible and pray more than what we do so lord we ask god you'd help us from this day forward lord to focus more on you lord we just thank you lord jesus for brother daniel for laying it on his heart that's what he spoke this morning because this is just what we have need of the lord once again we ask those that are not feeling well lord jesus that you would continue to touch him and raise him back up lord in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen and amen um i tell you what i looked a while ago and it was 20 till 12. and i was like boy but brother danny goes to 12 o'clock he'll be doing good i look back there and it's 12 30. where did time go amen anyway praise the lord so and we do want to hand those things out but um and next sunday i know brother tom is wanting to give his testimony next sunday so me i might speak for a while amen and so maybe half of the service will be dedicated next sunday morning so if anybody else really wants to give a testimony also next sunday amen just be praying about it because i know god has done a lot of things for a lot of us amen and so if you do have a testimony you might be want to be pray about it and i know tommy does amen and i tell you what i like that i want to show him that clip that she showed me oh man of you being out there and talking about the lord and what he's done so sometime i want to i
