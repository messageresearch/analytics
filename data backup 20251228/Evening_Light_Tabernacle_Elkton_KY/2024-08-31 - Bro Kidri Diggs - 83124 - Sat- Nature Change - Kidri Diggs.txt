you out of it so we're just happy to be here it's good to see everyone those that I've just met some that I've already known you know we just love the Lord let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God Amen you have a need you can acknowledge it to the Lord by uplifted hand man let's pray Lord Jesus father God here we are Lord and just believing Lord that we're in divine presence CU your word says Lord wherever two or three are gathered in your name there will you also be in the midst Lord and that's a promise we take you at that promise that right now Lord that our savior is looking upon us he's he's in the service to to to be everything that we stand in need of so Lord help us to be attentive to you Lord and acknowledge your presence Lord and father just forgive us for any sins and trespasses Lord you you know the need Lord that's behind that hand Lord that desire Lord that's on the heart before we can even ask for it so Lord we just pray Lord that in asking Lord that it'll be your perfect will done in our lives Lord we pray you just bless both speaker and hearer in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this service unto you in your name we pray church say amen amen amen praise the Lord let's let's take our Bibles and let's go to um first second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 blessed be the name of the Lord second Peter chapter 1 thank you brother let's just start reading at verse three if you have it say amen amen the Bible says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen let's go to Psalms 51 Psalms 51 Psalms chapter 51 I want to start at verse let's start at verse three the Bible says for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden Parts Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with his up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide my face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats you know I I believe tonight is kind of geared towards the youth but I think what we're going to talk about all of us you know have to come down these roads and tonight by God's by God's uh Grace I want to use for a subject change of nature a change of nature amen you know uh the Bible says in in the verse we read it it it said that we're going to be partakers of the divine nature of God but before we get there we have to have a nature change amen but uh I think um when it comes to the youth you know something about the youth you know uh uh there's a breakthrough that has to take place you know because even as parents one thing I want you to understand our job and and and and we've done a good job of this putting our kids in a good atmosphere you know in a good church and and you know where the word of God and Truth is being preached we've done that Hallelujah but you know what I think another thing we've all we've also done we've assumed that they've changed because they're in the right place you know we we we assume that there's a desire for God because you know they they they may dress right or they may you know they they they they may participate and sing and all these things in church but what are their desires amen and the only thing that can change their desires is when they meet God hallelujah and that has to go beyond just coming to church and you know coming to church is fine but you know uh each individual here each parent Hallelujah you know your children better than most of us us hallelujah you know the things that they Crave You know what they do in their rooms you you know what they like to watch you know the gam they like to play you know you know what they do on the internet and a lot of these things tells what their nature really is but you know a lot of times in church young people are good at being uh uh if I can say it like this chameleons Hallelujah you know what a chameleon is a chameleon is able to change hallelujah it's disposition to hide Hallelujah and fit in and a lot of times young people are very good at that hone they can come to church and they they know how to fit in they know how to play the part they know how to look a Christian amen but really on the inside there has to be a nature change and young people I want you to understand this tonight that all of us had to come that way brother digs had to come that way because I went to church for years and didn't know God hallelujah but I sang sometimes we got to church on time you know I clap my hands sometimes but then I walk out of church and go right back to doing the same thing I would do why because I wasn't converted and young people I want you to understand unless there is a true conversion a meeting with you and God where God overpowers you Hallelujah that's what has to happen amen you can't just be a good church person but God has to dominate you God has to overtake you God has to impute his thoughts his ways his nature everything about you has to become the desire of God and until you get there you continue to do things Hallelujah of another nature Hallelujah and you know uh uh the hardest part about this is uh brother B the hardest part about preaching these things like this because young people look at their life and they'll say well I ain't never did nothing wrong I'm I'm a I'm a pretty good person I ain't never shot nobody the Lord I ain't never stab nobody even when I get in a fight fight I say I'm sorry you know what they begin to do they begin to look at themselves morally and then they'll say well I'm all right but God's not uhh dealing with you on the surface God's not dealing with just you and the mor things that you can do God wants your heart Hallelujah God wants your being God wants to live through you Hallelujah and until God can dominate you and live through you you'll desire the things of the world Hallelujah and you can sit in church for years waiting for an opportunity to get away from it why because you never got converted and even as parents and church people as parents and church people we've seen this already in our churches we've seen young people that grew up in this church and got a certain age and left why because they never met God but they sat here they listened to the word they even clap their hands they even sung specials but never got converted but what we want is a nature change and it ain't just the young people they're adults Hallelujah sitting in church for 10 15 years and then all of a sudden they say I'm just tired of it never got converted never got a nature change and we know what the prophet of God said the Prophet The Prophet now if you listen real close Hallelujah I might not read a lot of quotes but I'll quote a lot of quotes Hallelujah so you got to know your message amen when somebody like me is preaching Hallelujah but Church you you you what the prophet of God said he said hey and young people I want you to catch this we're out here in Farmland amen beautiful country there's a lot of farming going on Amen you know but one thing I haven't seen it may be somewhere I haven't seen that good old shiny pink sloppy Pig somebody may have a a a a hog farm around here somewhere and you know what you can do with a hog you can wash him up clean them up real good you can even if it's a female you can paint the to match the skin put baby oil on it shine it up and even put a bow on his neck and you say oh you can put a you can put a rope around his neck and you can walk down the street with it and you can say hey man you see my pig my pig is so cute my pig is so cute she even smell good I put some white diamond on her I put some white diamond on my pig she ain't stinky no more She's Fresh she's clean you know I I got her nails done you know I even give her breath mints and you can do all that to a pig you can clean it up you can make it look like something different but I guarantee you you leave it alone for a day by a pudle slop and I guarantee you you'll come back your pig will be dirty nasty Nails will have Clay all in it and it'll be eating slop you know why because that's it nature Hallelujah that's his nature it'll look at Mud and it'll say oh I can't wait to it raise cuz I want to get [Applause] dirty you know the pig the pig it hates a drop it wants rain so it can be muddy so it can get sloppy and gooey and nasty and then say oink oink I love it that's its nature and the only way you can stop a pig from being a pig is if you change its nature but I haven't seen Hallelujah a pig sitting at the dinner table these as long as I've been living it's always been what eating slop why because that's its nature and it's okay with that and I want you to understand young people adults Hallelujah that's also your flesh Hallelujah your flesh it want something sticky and nasty Hallelujah your flesh Hallelujah it'll keep running back to the thing that it shouldn't have but it craves it and I want you to understand young people until you are converted you will continue to go back to sin you hear the preacher come and preach on some of the things I'm preaching on which probably has already been preached in this church and it'll keep coming and keep coming if you're a child of God why because God wants you to surrender you know you take a young lady who grew up right you know her parents had her in church and you know she kept herself and she did all these things and she may look at herself right now and say I'm a pretty good girl you know I've never been touched I'm virtuous I'm just I'm just pretty inside no you've been shaping in iniquity that's what the Bible says the Bible says in Psalms 51 behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me Hallelujah if everybody in this place has a mother you were born in sin Hallelujah and if you are here and hadn't been and and hadn't been born in sin that means you're a supernatural being Hallelujah but most of us everybody in here has a mother and we were born in sin that means our nature is Fallen Hallelujah we were born Hallelujah automatically lying if you watch a little baby you don't have to teach it to lie it's already in it you know why because we're born with an attribute of fear and Adam and Eve hallelujah what did they do because they fear God hallelujah they lied they did different things why it was the nature of sin after sin came into their lives and until you meet God hallelujah there are things that'll come out of you whether you like it or not why because you're a product of your birth and until your birth with the Holy Ghost you always go back and do things of that fleshly nature Hallelujah you love your Xbox more than you love God why it's your nature Hallelujah you love YouTube videos dressing up and putting on your hair and eyebrows and all this other stuff you'll love that more why it's your nature but when you meet God God will take those things away God can change those things H when you meet him he becomes your sacrifice your Supreme sacrifice amen and we take on the nature of God and you know lately as I've been traveling one thing I've been realizing brother B there are young people in the church who have never even repented young people people in general we're just religious we're here we come we listen to the word but we've never felt sorry for the life we lived we've never come to God and say Lord forgive me for living below the standard of what you revealed no we just find a seat amen the word and it's all good and you leave out of here with the same old desires Hallelujah and we have people and young people and people in church who have been baptized and never got the Holy Ghost you know why cuz they never repented there's nothing wrong with the product there's nothing wrong with the formula repent be baptized and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so you ask yourself tonight Hallelujah if you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and haven't received the Holy Ghost there's nothing wrong with the formula there something wrong with your approach Hallelujah you know I've been noticing young people brother Pat young people in church faithful in good homes good church you know you go to their houses and the prophet is beinged played All Day scriptures being prayed played but there hasn't been a conversion so what they're doing they're being a chameleon they'll come in and they'll play the part they'll sit down they'll wear the clothes you buy them they'll listen to The Commandments you tell them Hallelujah that that we live by don't cut your hair you know don't weigh pants don't do all these things they'll conform to these things they'll become a chameleon Hallelujah but if there's no nature change when they get a certain age they'll get tired of it and we're not painting a picture that all young people want to go live in the world we're painting the picture that everybody needs to be converted Hallelujah we won't make it to Heaven hey I'm not going to make it to heaven on my good looks can you believe that Hallelujah man I'm not going to make it like this no not I got to be converted Hallelujah you no matter how Charming you are your charm is not going to work with God you say brother JS I'm gifted I play instruments oh brother JS I got a good voice I can s that will not get you into Heaven wheny Houston could sing James B could sing Elvis pry could get down but none of that was good enough he needed a conversion church and let me tell you something Hallelujah he was a man who wanted to serve God but he couldn't why because his flesh dominated his life and I want you young people to understand you can overcome you just have to surrender I'mma pass on something to you that my mom told me when I was young and like some of you guys she would say to me son when you talk to God don't talk to him like he we out in space somewhere talk to him like he's your friend talk to him like he's right there have a conversation with god tell God God or ask God hallelujah what you want him to do for you Hallelujah but what we do and what we've done we've relied on good morals oh they had a meeting and I love I love oh we're going to have a meeting praise God and some of you came some of you came for the pizza in the good chocolate chip cookies them cookies was good now Hallelujah we thank God for that but you just being able to show your face ain't good enough you being able to sing a special ain't good enough you being able to pay your tithes ain't good enough Hallelujah and that's all that God required hallelujah hallelujah he have to let all the denominations in cuz we have people in denomination who charactery are more faithful than we are we are shapen in iniquity in sin did my mother conceive me Psalms 58 it says verse three it says the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies oh my that's the nature of man speaking lies committing sin doing everything that is wrong that's the nature we're born with but thank God for Jesus Christ come on somebody I said thank God for Jesus Christ I said thank God for Jesus Christ cuz because of Jesus Hallelujah I don't have to be a product of sin Hallelujah I can be a product of Calvary hallelujah how Jesus came and took my place and washed away my sins and now I have the ability to live his life inside of me that's what we want we want to be so surrendered that Christ can live his will through you Hallelujah think about it acts chapter 2 when the day of Pentecost came and we know the story how how the fire fell and all that but then Peter came down and started talking to the unbelievers and by the time he was finished he said he said the same Jesus who you crucified he's Lord of all Hallelujah and then he said repent and be baptized every one of you for the missions of your sin Hallelujah and the answer that was the answer to to them asking the question what shall we do H and the reason why they asked the question what shall we do Hallelujah after Peter started talking about his conversion his nature change Hallelujah don't y'all realize Peter had a nature change Hallelujah he was a he was a cursing fighting cursing fighting denying the Lord Jesus disciple curing fight denying Jesus in church he did all this while he was walking with the Messiah but I want you to catch it morally he look like he was good he was Healing The Sick raising the dead even walking on water oh my you see the things he can do without a conversion oh my I don't know about you but I want to know Jesus I don't want to just be able to to to to slide by or Glide by with just good morals and Peter was gliding by you know he was Healing The Sick and raising the dead and and feeding 5,000 doing all she doing some Supernatural stuff without the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is everything to us what good is your walking on water what good is your Healing The Sick and raising the dead Hallelujah if it can't get you to the other side Hallelujah let's look at Peter a little bit one day Jesus saw Peter and he began to talk to him and discerned his heart and told Peter come follow me Peter said okay left everything stop following Jesus right there he stepped into the supernatural stepped into the supernatural following God so where whether he was an unbeliever or not he couldn't change who God is hallelujah brother what are you saying whether you're converted or not if God want to do something Supernatural in this church he will do it Hallelujah he will do it whether there's a true conversion or not God will do it Hallelujah why because he will always show that he's God hallelujah he will always show that he's God now you know he's following the Lord and there's a lot of Miracles and different things taking place but let's just go to the scene where Jesus told Peter he said Peter you know I'mma die I'mma give up my life on three days I'mma raise up again now this man who didn't walk with the Lord and all these things he couldn't comprehend the resurrection so you know what he says Jesus said I'm going to give up my life and all these things and Peter said no master you shall not surely die at that moment Walking with God and all the things he saw he could still be anointed by a demon W you mean to tell me you can come to church listen to me young people you can come to church sing on the choir play instruments play volleyball Hallelujah be nice have a good have a good time Hallelujah and still get to a place where you get anointed by a demon cuz remember when Peter says to Jesus you not going to sh die Jesus said what get behind me Satan that man Hallelujah who look like a Christian act like a Christian at a space in his life he could be anointed by a demon and the demon could speak out of him oh my Lord is heavy what's going on why this kind of message because God wants somebody to really get converted see let's understand something tonight Church Hallelujah God doesn't speak something just to tickle our ears or say wow I've never heard that before no it's here there needs to be a conversion tonight remember the word does not return unto him void and I know we read the flyer and the flyer says there's going to be some food after the preaching but let's eat the spiritual food first let's get some food in our system to where we'll never hunger again hallelujah oh my Church Peter you just take that part there there's another space with Peter Walking With Jesus Jesus says they come to Jesus he said who you seek they say Jesus Nazareth everybody fell down but Peter pull out his sword young people get angry sometimes Mom and Daddy Mom and Daddy have to chastise you and tell you don't do this or God forbid take your cell phone oh my boy you want to see some horns come out their head take that cell you want to see some eyes rolling back in their head take that cell phone W boy I this generation can't live without it if you want a punishment take that cell phone they'll show you who they really is they show you how much of a Christian they are take that S I guarantee if you got stairs in your house them stairs will be rocking they'll let you know how angry they are you take that cell phone hallelujah look Peter they came to get Jesus Peter didn't say n y'all leave my God Alone Peter and I don't believe now I don't believe back in those days there was Ninja and jusu training I don't believe there were MMA fighting and training and all that stuff so I don't believe Peter was so skillful he could just cut an ear off I you don't believe that D I don't believe he was that skillful I believe he was trying to Hallelujah cuz back in them days they didn't pull a sword out just to [Laughter] fence no they pull a sword out of that if they pull that sword somebody was going to die Hallelujah and now they coming to Peter they talking about they going to take his master Peter pull that sword out a man who was walking with Jesus a man who was called to walk with Jesus who still got uncontrollably angry but in Jesus so rich in Mercy even in your anger Hallelujah he'll get rid of your mistakes he'll get rid of your wrong if you really belong to him H why to give you a chance to keep seeking his face Hallelujah I don't know about y'all but I messed up plenty of times but God kept and kept and kept and kept giving me another chance he kept and he kept and he kept giving me another chance even when I messed up he gave me another chance even when I didn't deserve he gave me another chance and you know what that makes me that makes me grateful Hallelujah cuz we can give up on God but God never gives up on us Peter cuts off an ear Jesus comes and put his hands over that spot and gets rid of the evidence that he ever did any wrong young people I want you to understand something if you are a child of God do not bathe in your mistakes it's up to God to get rid of the evidence w w Hallelujah I don't have to worry about my past it's up to God to take care of my past I don't have to worry about my future it's up to God to take care of my future all I have to do all we have to do is [Music] surrender and he'll be who he's supposed to be Peter cuts off here then it goes on a little bit Peter gets to another spot he says Lord I'mma follow you wherever you go I just love my pastor love my pastor he hardworking he do good thing oo he just got us a playground he's a so special I just love me some Thomas Hallelujah I ain't never going nowhere I just love me some some some brother Thomas until he preach something you don't like H didn't the real you will come out if there's no conversion but if there's a conversion Hallelujah you won't be like Peter Jesus told pet Peter said Lord I'm going follow you wherever you go I'm in for the Long Haul I believe this message I ain't going nowhere I don't care who leave I don't care what happened I don't care about believe the sign and this sign and that sign and stop sign and yield sign whatever kind of sign I don't care I'm going with Jesus and then Jesus said Peter you going to deny me three times before the crow C three times you going to deny me Peter like not me Lord I love you I'm mean I'm all in I didn't seen all the great things you've done I was right there with you how can I deny it I was right there playing volleyball smashing with the pastor ah we won three times Jesus said you going to deny me I want you to see a nature change because he hadn't received the Holy Spirit no matter what came out of his mouth he always felt subject to the nature inside he had a pretty good confession Lord I'mma go with you everywhere Jesus said you going to deny me not me I'm a message belie I'm a Believer I grew up in church not me they say hey there go one of them right there he Peter said not me not me I don't know them a little bit of time went by somebody else came up and say take go one of them take Peter said not me not me Healing The Sick raising the Dead Walking On Water now this is the sticky part because the third time he didn't just deny it he could give himself over to cussing everybody out that was a disciple that was a man walking with Jesus that was a man who sound a supernatural Hallelujah Time After Time After Time but with no conversion his flesh will still overpower everything else I want you to understand no matter how strong you think you are morally without the Holy Ghost you will always fail Peter not only does he deny it he goes way down inside he said I told you bunch of cuss like he ain't never cured before right and you parents may not believe this but some of your children cuss like Peter when they go to school oh I didn't told your secret and some of y'all looking at me like not my child they've never heard me cuss they ain't got to it's a part of the nature oh yeah three three words you don't never want to hear a parent say about their child not my child you look at your little angel when your little Angel's not around you and she not converted your little angel turns red you look at your little Prince When Your Little Prince is not around you Hallelujah he turns into something else if there's no converion version Hallelujah you say oh my brother de you painting a very dim picture no what I want us to do I want every parent in here every person in here that has the Holy Ghost remember who you were what you were before you got it could you hold your tongue could you stop with the tobacco could you not go to the are no it was who you was why because it was your nature and until you get a nature change there's no more desire for tobacco there's no more desire for alcohol and all the things that this flesh wants the Holy Ghost what does it do it pushes it down where it's supposed to be Hallelujah puts it in place the only thing you can do that is if there's something inside your spirit that can dominate your nature and the only thing that can do that is [Music] Christ Hallelujah even when you preach messages like this people hear you but then they'll start examining themselves and say I ain't did nothing wrong I'm I'm pretty good Hallelujah okay God sent us what a Vindicated Prophet right amen Church a man who was Christ centered really loved the Lord you know and one thing I want you to understand about our prophet he had to get the Holy Ghost he had to have a what nature change cuz he even said it on tape he loved the fight but you talk about God getting rid of evidence one day he some boys he was going some boys beat him up beat him up bad you know what he did he went back and got his gun that was his nature he went back and got his gun hid in the bushes and waited on everybody to come because he wasn't just going to shoot him in the foot he wasn't bluffing he was go shoot him in theot foot he was going to kill somebody that was his nature he loved to fight Hallelujah he said I got Irish blood in me a little hot leprechaun oh my you know every every every time I hear a prophet talk about he got some Irish in him all I think about Conor McGregor oh my wow Irishman some of y'all might not know who that is but I think you do you just trying to give me that look like you don't know what's going on in the world it's all right we are in this world but we're not of this world Hallelujah but look he waited everybody all right he waited on the on the boys to come and he jumped out the bushes with the gun with the bullet in it he said the boys start streaming he said don't scream now you going to meet your maker and you know what he did he wasn't bluffing he pulled the trigger it was the nature of an Angry Young Man who got beat up who was ordained to be a prophet you know what we call message purist they don't believe brother Brenham had this side but he had this side before he got converted he was just like any other angry Hallelujah Reckless individual and it took God to shap and more hold him into the image of his mind Hallelujah because without the Holy Ghost he jump out the bushes with a gun Hallelujah pull the trigger but God jammed the gun just like he did Peter Hallelujah got rid of the evidence he put another one in there jammed the gun again and until all the boys got out of his sight he picked up the bullet put it back in there and the gun fired what was it it was God protecting his seed God is your protector we don't have to walk tipping toeing I don't know I don't know what kind of Christian I'mma Be I just don't want to fail I just don't want to upset God I'm just so scared to get my life God is the savior not you God is the deliverer not you he wants you to give your life to him it's his job Hallelujah to make you out to what he says you are Hallelujah but God changed his nature there are times when a prophet got so low so sad he wanted to commit suicide but God so rich in Mercy kept him through all his pain through all his ordeals all the things he went through Hallelujah to give him a nature to press on with him Hallelujah to where he could be preaching the gospel and a man who who won so many fights with his fist you know who was a boxer who was a hunter and all these things could stand on the pull pit and let somebody spit in his face and not do anything but feel sorry for the man think about it the only way he could do that is if it's nature was changed cuz we talk all we want we talk all we want about oh I got the Holy Ghost you know I just love you brother now let me put this on record I don't want nobody spitting in my face I believe that Paul was for the prophet and he did good with it that don't have to be duplicated by Brother digs I'm good Hallelujah but it happened to him just like it happened to David and David forgave the man and the prophet forgave the man also what was it it was the spirit of the Lord upon them amen but it had to be a nature change from somebody who would always fight his way out of it to now just standing there and letting God take over that's what we see that's what we saw but we see that in the prophet we saw what God did through the prophet and how his nature was changed but I want you to understand something because he was the prophet that doesn't mean his children were born with the Holy Ghost his children had to come the same way Hallelujah okay now we going to get into something I ain't going to be too much longer but I want you to be attentive and listen to this listen the prophet is f to talk about Billy Paul we know who that is right listen what he says and parents I believe when I read this we all share the same the same sentiment of value that the prophet is f to say about his son about our children listen he says when job was the oldest book in the Bible and when job an old man and just before the disaster happened in his home he got kind of worried and he had a bunch of children and they were wory going out mingling with the things of the world and and all of and all of we parents know what a feeling that is when your children your very heart young people you hear that when your parents are strict and they're trying to keep you away from everything it's not because they're trying to be mean it's because you are their heart they love you they don't want to see your life messed up so mothers and fathers they get into protective mode he says listen your very heart begins to mingle with the World Get Out Among the unbelievers I don't suppose Billy is present on this time I think he's out maybe talking to brother woods but in our city we don't have a Christian school and I know some of you are going some of you are homeschooled why that's because you are your parents heart they want to protect you listen what the prophet says we don't have a Christian School and there's a bunch of worldly children girls and boys too and when I thought of sending my boy to that school can I get an amen parents see what we're doing we're thinking about what you're going to meet when you get there all the different things you're going to have to go through when you get there we're not trying to keep you from socializing we're not keep trying to keep you from being ball players and track stars and all this stuff no we thinking about all the things you may have to mingle with listen he says when your children your very heart begin to mingle with the world Get Out Among the unbelievers Hallelujah he says but in our city we don't have a Christian School and there's a bunch of worldly children girls and boys and when I thought of sending my boy to that school knowing listen young people listen real good now I'm talking about the prophet's children Hallelujah he said knowing that everything that I drilled into him unless hallu what he's saying is I raised them up in a Christian home I raised them up going to church I raised them up talking about God and now he says knowing that everything that I drilled into him unless he be he becomes really converted now he's looking at his boy Billy Paul who's in church giving out the prayer card and he's saying my boy ain't converted but he was right there with the prophet white there pring under the prayer CS doing all those things and wasn't even converted my look it goes even deeper than that Billy Paul was on the other end of the prayer line God told Brother Bram wake Billy up so he could see the angel of the Lord because he's a part of your ministry but right here the prophet of God is saying he's not even converted he said unless he becomes really converted really come to Christ that is all of his nature would be changed he'd be swept out from under my hands even though being right there in the prayer line even though seeing the angel of the Lord and all these things even though being connected to the ministry he says unless he gets truly converted he will be swept out into the world really come to Christ that is all of his nature will be changed he be swept out from under my hands as soon as he got with that worldly bunch you are no match for the world without Christ inside of you Hallelujah we are no match for the Devil Without Christ inside of us you may think you strong enough to have a worldly boy friend without Christ you are not a match amen he said he be swept out under me as soon as he got with the worldly Bunch because the very nature in him no matter being a good boy that doesn't having a minister father a religious home he saying none of that matters unless he's truly converted unless he meets God but we don't approve of world somebody's house we don't approve of worldly things in our home we try to live by the grace of God like Christians are to the influence set before him I known if if I known if he be lost parents this is what we have to stand on he's talking about Billy and he says I know if he be lost he' certainly walk over a righteous home to be lost by parents if you living the way you supposed to it's up to God to save your children Hallelujah he said and I want him to have to walk over my life Hallelujah that's what he's saying he's saying I got the Holy Ghost amen I've been converted and for my child to go out in the world they got to disapprove or they got to not acknowledge my change they got to not acknowledge that I I am a real Christian that's where I want to be that's right I want to live so much like God that if my children decide to go to the world they have to walk over my life Hallelujah and I want him to walk over my life he have to walk over walk over the Bible he have to walk over the blood of Jesus Christ because I certainly by the grace of God presented in front of him hallelujah what are you saying parents we present the nature change unto our children but if his nature is in change he will go right on just the same and how I think of the day that Billy entered high school and how I thought oh my and knowing that he yet he had oh had been baptized certainly but never ever made a full surrender and if you ever heard Billy Paul's testimony he smoked he drank he went to bars did all that while he seen the angel of the Lord he saw Miracle after mirle traveled to Africa seeing healing after healing going with his daddy all over the world but with without a conversion he still was pulled to the bars oh my without a nature change Church couldn't save him and I say to you young people ask yourself do you really love God if you really love God you'll want to serve him if you really love God there will be something inside of you saying I want to get closer I want to get closer now Billy Paul got to that place but there was a time in his life where he didn't know God he was a chameleon come to church pass out tracks do all that stuff do everything his daddy would do and a lot of times you listen to the tapes he'd say where Billy Billy was outside talking to somebody while the service would be going on he wasn't even interested seeing all the things he saw parents I want you to never take it for granted just because your child is in church that they are where they're supposed to be spiritually but that was his boy Billy but he felt that way about all his children listen he says I think sometimes in going to school now I think seeing Becky and Sarah and Joseph that's all his children all of them had to be born again all of them had to have a nature change and look at how candid he spoke about his own children he didn't put them on a pedestal because he was a prophet you know what he said they need a nature change listen what he says he says Becky and Sarah and Joseph and these high schools and things where all this goes on at he says I think I'll take them and get them back in the mountains and raise them up there where the Indians live and then he has a thought he says now he want to take them up there with the Indians let them live with the Indians where the atmosphere was more pure in the mountains because he saw so much filth in school but then he comes back he says but here is what it is what's in the kid is going to come out he's talking about his own children he said I can take them up to the mountain let them live with the Indians but if they want to drink they going to drink if it's in them if they want to party they going to party if it's in them what he's saying is if my kids are not converted it don't matter where I take them he said what's in the kid is going to come out no matter where it is it's got to it's is going to come out if evil young people listen to this now he says if evil is in there it'll come out in the Indian camp Oh my he said if good is in there it'll come out in any Camp if you go to BCF and CBF and ABC and NBC no matter what camp you go to whatever is in you is going to come out he said it's what's in the kid that makes up the kid that's what's inside of you and what you are is what you'll probably be the rest of your life that's why we are not to play with God because you think about it I could be preaching like I'm preaching right now preaching hard and you could be looking down at your shoe not paying me no attention that could be you cutting God off for the rest of your life that's how important it is this could be a sealing moment for somebody he said you're on a changing spot but then he goes on he says you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and as you think of course your mind is presented in your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it Hallelujah that you're going to do it and then you and then your Ambitions drive you to it but what are you saying the things that dominate your mind usually will control you now I'm about to close you make yourself when you young and to all of us we have to ask ourself right now what dominates my mind what dominates me is it you may say Brother D I just can't wait till I get married when I meet that tall dark and handsome boy of a person if that dominates your mind this is what'll happen you'll get that man tall dark handsome and he'll become your replacement for God and then your whole life will revolve around him and then what God have to do is show you that he's always supposed to be first place not second place Hallelujah so you have to think about what's dominating your thoughts and what you want to be and what are you trying to achieve now right now in your Christian Journey you said brother Jesus I'm too young at the age of 12 Jesus was in the synagogue teaching at the age of 12 the prophet of God said the only thing that stopped me from receiving the Holy Spirit Spirit was an evil spirit that's what he said Hallelujah even in moments like these where God is being so direct and talking to us so direct why because he's trying to get somebody to climb up higher he's trying to get a young person maybe to acknowledge Him stop being religious and acknowledge God come into a personal relationship with God know him know his voice know his touch you're not too young for that Hallelujah you're not too young to feel the presence of God you're not too young to Hallelujah to be pricked in your heart to say Lord forgive me for living below the standard remember the Bible says when they heard these things about the gospel they were pricked in their heart and asked asked uh Peter what can they do he said repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but that's where it starts starts with true repentance but if you feel like you all right you'll never enter into repentance if you feel like you've never done anything wrong because you've been in a good home and you've been raised right and you haven't been out in the world let me tell you something you still a sinner all of us hallelujah we could have been raised in the best homes had the best schools the best teaching all of that but until we repent we're nothing but a sinner amen so we all come musicians come we all have to come to the place young people what are you saying what am I saying I'm saying hallelujah come to a place in your life where you say to Jesus Lord I accept you as my savior I receive you as my Savior by faith and I want to serve you out of the abundance of my heart I want to give my life unto your will and until you get there you're just a good church member Hallelujah listen I tell the story a lot y'all play something soft I tell a story a lot I know a young girl who would when you have meeting she would come up and sing with the choir at this time she was 18 years old she get up and sing with the choir and they shake the place Bo the anointing come down and be so powerful we be in there having such a good time but there one time they church group came up and on her way up the same with the church she dropped dead right there in church in a meeting just like this she dropped dead right in church and y'all know this brother real good brother Jewel brother Jewel told everybody y'all sh be be quiet prayed for her and she got back up Hallelujah she got back up but she didn't go to her seat she finished the mission she went up and finished singing with the choir and she went back but you know what all those 18 years of being raised in church and coming to church and singing in the choir up until that moment she was never converted she never knew the Lord and that shook her in her boost that she could drop dead at any time playing church so she went back home nobody knows what really happened inside but she went back home on that Tuesday they had a testimony service about you know you ask the young people as they come back from Camp what did you learn from Camp where they asked her they asked the the young people what did you get out the meeting this weekend and other people telling testimonies when it got to her she smiled and she said I just thank the Lord for being here and she dropped dead in church but this time she didn't get back back up God gave her space to get truly converted even though she was raised in a good home she was faithful on the choir she'd go to the meetings and all these things she still wasn't converted she still didn't have a nature change why get to the point to where you meet death to get serious with God why not like the ible says the day you hear my voice hard not your heart Hallelujah don't be a person just playing around but let God change your nature cry out to the Lord say Lord help me I don't want to be just religious but I want to know you I want to know you in the death bury and resurrection of who you are how many believe it how many believe it we believe it amen sing and renew a right Spirit Within Me created me cre me a CLE oh God and renew and renew a right Spirit
