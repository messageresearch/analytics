have a word of prayer now Heavenly Father Lord you you see each and every one of us that have gathered here tonight Lord you know the needs that are represent presented Lord you know Lord what you've just laid on my heart to speak tonight and I just pray that you'll just help me to step aside father and Lord that you'll just speak and direct each word Lord to to your people Lord I'm very cognizant tonight of the fact that there's nothing that I can say or do Lord that's that's going to benefit your people but if I'll step aside and allow you to speak Lord then Lord we can be lifted up into Heavenly places I pray now that you'll just grant it that you'll take control Lord that you'll bless the reading and the preaching of your word Lord not only anoint me I pray but will you anoint the hearer as well so the that the word tonight can take full effect I pray father in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles with you and you'd turn with me tonight to Revelation 10 the 7th verse chapter 10 the seventh verse and as you're turning there I just want to say how much I appreciate the opportunity to be here how much I appreciate your your pastor brother Vier and and all the different ones that you know just in the last couple years I've read really come to have a lot of uh wonderful friends here in this local assembly and I just say we love and appreciate you all very very much amen amen so we're going to read tonight Revelation 10 verse 7 we're just going to read this one verse it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen if pray the Lord will add a blessing as you take your seats tonight amen a't God good to us it's wonderful I always enjoy coming coming in the house of God midweek service and just laying aside what's what's happened already in the week and just allow the Lord to come and speak to us and refresh us amen and amen I'd like to speak to you tonight for a moment on on the thought committed to finish committed to finish you know it it what we read here is a a a very familiar scripture and and it speaks of of a finishing that's that's going to take place and and we believe that the voice of the seventh angel has has already sounded and it was the end time message amen I I I think if you'll just take the condition of the world around you and and come back and investigate in the scriptures and and begin to look at at the way it describes the end times I I believe that you'll that you'll begin to recognize we're definitely in the end time if if you haven't seen it already just just just look around a little a little bit and and you're going to see that that we are in the end time and so I believe this is the end time message amen the message of Malachi 4 is the end time message and and and it came and it it it finished up the restoration of the word it it finished all the Mysteries and and not only did it do that but it anointed a people and this message came and it anointed a people to finish and you say well to finish what brother Aon to to finish the race to be the last Runners on the course to to finish all that God has called us to be and also to finish all that he left for us to finish because he wants things done and he expects his bride to do it but the prophet of God says it like this he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time what a responsibility what a calling that we have so we we can't just get it in our head you know well I receiv received the message so now I'm just going to sit back and wait and the raptures coming that's not how this thing works there's things for us to do there's an anointing for us to operate under he says the works that I do shall you do also there's something for us to finish we can't just sit back we're not going to cross the finish line sitting still amen amen you know I I was fellowshipping with brother Tommy the day and I said you know the the message that called us out and I'm so thankful that we've been called out but the same message that called us out is the same message that's going to take us in to the promised land there's got to be a coming out and I'm thankful for that come out of her my people but how many people came out of Egypt and died in the wilderness how many of them came out of Egypt and they weren't willing to go into the land but I believe there's a people on Earth tonight that says I didn't just come out but I'm going to go in I'm going to possess everything that God called for me to possess in my life amen amen to finish the works of Christ and I believe in order for us to do that we're going to have to be committed to it we can't be halfway we can't be like sadical about it we got to be sold out to the word we got to be sold out to his will totally committed as as you might say we have to be Allin you know Satan's had 6,000 years to build a world of evil the the whole world is evil brother Bram says that God's Eden was established in righteousness but Satan's Eden is established in sin think about that it's established in sin the very foundation of the world that you're living in today is established in sin it's a it's a scientific Eden that denies the very existence of God it's an Eden that feeds from and it worships from the Tree of knowledge and in this environment you must be totally committed to the word fully sold out totally sincere because because the currents are so strong that that think about something that doesn't have any life of its own and you stand next to a raging River and you take and throw a piece of paper or something in there lifeless and what happens that piece of paper in those currents it's just Swept Away or you take somebody not strong enough to stand and put them in that same river and what's going to happen to them they're going to be swept away and what I'm telling you is that the the currents of this world the currents of unbelief the currents of sin they are so strong that if you're not anchored down if you're not sold out tonight that you're going to get Swept Away by those currents but I'd like to announce to you tonight there is an anchor that holds there is a rock that you can tie to tonight that you won't be pulled here and pulled there and Swept Away to destruction by the world but when the floods come and the floods go you'll still be standing there because the anchor hold tonight Hallelujah I always say if you're halfway in you'll eventually be all the way out you can't be halfway in tonight or eventually you're going to look around and say how'd I end up where I'm at tonight how did I end up so far down how how did I end up in this situation why is my life listen will take you further than you want to go well I'm just going to dabble in this and Dabble in that and pretty soon you're not just dabbling you're gone get all the way into the ark tonight get all the way into the ark tonight push your way in push your way in with with with desperation you got to be willing to fight tonight committed to finish Amen in Revelation you know they describe it describe all the spirits and the things as as a smoke coming up from a bottomless pit and you know how smoke is it gets into everything it ruins everything you you you go on a on a camping trip and and you know and you pack your bags up and come home and you're at home you're eight hours away from that campfire but open them bags up and what's it smell like smoke it gets in everything and Revelation describes this as a smoke out of the bottomless pit because that smoke will infiltrate every that's not sealed it'll get in and affect everything that that isn't sealed and and what's happening this day is it's beginning to get inside of people's minds to where they can't think clearly their mind is completely insane you don't believe me just go to Walmart just read the news if if you feel like fighting depression go go read the news and you can't you know trust that either I I I heard it said it says says a man who who don't listen to the news is uninformed and a man who does listen to the news is misinformed so what you going to do I'll tell you what how about the good news let's keep ourselves in the good news tonight it'll always lead you in the right way it'll always lift your spirits you won't read this and come out depressed I guarantee you but the world's going completely insane you just look around and and and and the world's falling apart at the seams it it doesn't even really take a spiritual person to recognize that you know I have friends you know nominal Christians and and you know 15 years ago or so you I talk to them about the end time or the coming of the Lord and they'd be like well I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime you know and and it was always just this uh almost the Rapture was a fictional thing that maybe one day but even they're starting to say it's the end time it's the end of time so I'm telling you you don't you don't even got to be spiritual just wake up and open your eyes and thank God tonight listen this message was not a message of judgment this message warned of judgment so that means it was a message of Grace it came saying Grace Grace and it's telling you tonight there is a place of safety there is an arc you can get into you can be committed and sold out and sealed with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and not swept away in the currents of this modern world Amen the world's falling apart people don't know who they are and we've gotten to the place the world don't know what they are listen there's a thing brother Bor they called furries y'all ever heard of furries yeah where people it wasn't at my school when I was teaching school though there there was a teacher in the city that had a a legal battle and thank goodness they want it but they was getting in trouble because they they wouldn't meow back to a person that thought they was a cat the world's gone insane listen they look at us and go y'all are odd y'all are weird well listen if that's normal then call me odd call me weird I'll be this all day long before I go around meowing to people the world's lost its mind but thank God there is a seal of God that'll seal that out from your life tonight people don't know what they are and you know we look at it and we say those people are nuts those people are crazy and yet if it wasn't for the grace of God yeah if it wasn't for God's hand on our lives if it wasn't for his influence in our lives we could have lost our right mind as well because it's permeated everything in our society and and you even watch people who fall away from from from the word and fall away from the house of God and and it doesn't take long before their thinking about things begins to change their attitude towards sin begins to change and so it gets to the point that not only are they accepted of it but you see begin to defend it and promote it things that we would just automatically like like abortions and things of that nature and and all of a sudden you know somebody falls out from underneath the Godly influence and it's not long at all and all of a sudden they're for those things what happen they began to feed on a different influence they began to allow a different influence to take over their mind and and take over their their thinking they begin to view things through a different set of eyes amen and you say well brother Aaron I I would never do that I I never would if it's not for the grace of God not for the Seal of God you can say that tonight because we haven't given ourselves over to that mind we haven't given ourselves over to that type of thinking so you have your sanity tonight thank God your influence is from a different Source I say tonight let's stay in that Source let's get into the message listen listen it ain't just for the preachers or the deacons to get in the message it ain't just for them to read the books and listen to the tapes that was given to you behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet it's for you to dig it's for you to study it's for you to let God listen I've said it before if a preacher can stand there and preach false doctr to you for five years and you don't know it that's your [Music] fault you should be drinking the water yourself that way when you recognize that water coming over the pull pit you go yep that's what I've been drinking from if there's poison in the water you'll go nope that ain't the fountain I've been drinking from how you going to get LED astray if you've been drinking yourself and feeding yourself get into the message get into the word feed on it that's the source drink from that Source sell out to that Source it's a source of life tonight commit to his word and his thinking let this mind be in you tonight we got to lay us deide what we think because this flesh this mind no matter how spiritual we are we walk through life we walked through this world we were raised by in different homes you know we can all be filled with the Holy Ghost tonight brother Bor and still look at things a little different look at this situation different or act different in this situ cuz we all raised different we all got different DNA we're all wired differently to tonight is that right so so we got uh we got to lay aside what we think because if it comes right down to it we'll all operate differently what we think will get us in trouble if I look back in life at all the times I've messed up and done things wrong if IID have checked here first if I have searched through the message first if IID have followed his will first I wouldn't end up near bad a place as I ended up you know I believe with all my heart you can just chalk this up from from Brother aon's opinion so if you don't you know you can throw this away if you want to but I believe with all my heart that if you seek the will of God if you seek Him for every situation and then somehow through human ignorance you still mess up there's Grace for that there is Grace for that because God understood you were but look if you just go well I'm going to do this on my own because this is what I want to do and I don't care what pastor says I don't care what the Bible says I don't care well then when you end up in a man God's going to say you put yourself there now you're going to suffer the consequences and it's a lot harder to dig yourself out of those places just seek God's will put him first lay aside your thinking tonight and say Lord I want to be committed to your thinking amen lay aside the thinking of the world they're constantly trying to push things on you Daniel 1 and8 tells us says but Daniel Pro purposed in in his heart that he would not defile defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself listen just like us Daniel was in a foreign country he found himself surrounded by Evil by by by Traditions that were against everything he believed in by a culture that hated him and and a power that wanted to break him and mold him into their image I think Daniel's somebody we can all relate to today I don't feel home at home here anymore we're pilgrims and strangers we're just passing through this isn't this is not our our home and and society today is against everything we stand for you know if you went back in the 1950s you know and there were still elements of society brother berer that that were christian-based you could still hold your head up say this is a Christian Nation you know we had a president uh President Obama one of the few things he ever said that I agreed with is he stood up and said America is no longer a Christian Nation I said amen he told us the truth for once yeah amen it isn't no longer a Christian Nation it's drifted from its foundation it's drifted from its morals and it's it's got It's lost tonight and it's not a place that I can feel at home and Society is against everything we stand for and constantly there's a banquet of ungodliness placed before us and we're instructed eat from this feed from this well I don't have television in my home brother Aaron oh I know think about it and we feed and we feed and we feed Hey listen I'm not throwing ston at I spend way too much time on that stupid thing I I get it but now I think we might I just I I don't want people to compare how much time I SP spend on on devices and how much time's wasted versus how much time did you listen to messages this week sometimes I'll get that weekly report and I'll go I'll go God forgive me y'all ever look at your weekly report that comes through how much time you spend on your phone does it ever make you go I'm not listen I think I I'm thankful for technology I'm just saying let's don't be fooled into into thinking well I'm not touching anything of the world I'm not I'm not watching movies I but I watch two hours of reals okay I'm just saying let's be honest with ourselves that's all I'm not I'm just saying let's be honest with ourselves what what influences are we allowing to come in and this banquet of ungodliness is laid there and saying eat from it eat from it but Daniel purposed in his heart he was committed it doesn't matter how much they ridicule it doesn't matter what they offer me it doesn't matter what kind of trial I'm in I'm not going to let this world influence my thinking I'm not going to feed on what they're feeding on I'm not going to feed on their filth I'm not going to feed on their ideas I've been given something to feed from in this day we've been given a seven course banquet we've got all the messages you you can imagine if books and tapes and the same thing it's accessible right here we all have it we have the Bible we've got something to feed on in this day let's get back in there and be committed to the word of God committed Daniel desired a different diet he desired something different he didn't say well I can have just a little bit of that and surely I can have just a bite well come on Eve surely it's not that big a deal he said I will not defile myself with the king's meat and I'm committed tonight like Daniel I'm not going to defile myself on those things when he's given me the most wonderful thing I can feed on the message of the hour the restored word let's be committed to that tonight oh think about it those th those ones that were supposed to be molding Daniel said you're going to starve to death you're going to look bad if if you don't eat from from from from these things and what's wrong with our food you need to experience these things young people no no no no you need to try this the king of Babylon says this is what you're supposed to eat you need to be well-rounded you need to see what it's like in the real world no no no I will not defile myself I'm not going to eat with what that King saying I I'm like Daniel tonight compare us to those eating that King's food compare us tonight look at our homes look at our lives look at our young people well what what's so different how is this possible we're eating the diet of another king tonight we're feeding from another kingdom tonight and it's molding us not into this world's image but it's molding us into that Heavenly image Hallelujah glory to God Amen compare us we've been given a seven course spread in this day but you've got to eat the book what it say there in Revelation it showed a a little open book but it said you go take the book and then eat the book listen it does us no good for the message of the hour to have come for the Mysteries to be revealed for truth to be restored if you don't eat it it doesn't do us any good if we're not feeding on and we're not letting it mold us and change us and make us into his image amen amen God go God honored Daniel because of his commitment that I will not be defiled that I'm only going to eat what God's called me to eat and God will honor you just the same as he did Daniel Amen it's it's time as a church of a living God it's time for commitment God God has brought a people right to the crossing over right to the blending of Time and Eternity we're right here at this place and you know if you go back and look at the children of Israel right when they came up to the River to Cross into the promised land there was two and a half tribes it was uh Gad man half tribe of Manasseh what was the other one either way there was another tribe and they got there and they looked around and they said this is good enough for us this is good enough for us and they came to Moses and they said you know this land is better for cattle than the promised land and we've got a lot of cattle think about that we're right here at the crossing over don't start looking around at things to keep you here I don't care what you've accumulated in the journey I don't care how many cows you got there ain't no pasture on this side going to keep me from going to that side you're never going to be fully blessed staying on this side I say tonight it's time to cross is over it's time to sell out it's time to say Lord wherever you're taking me that's where I want to go because if you want to be fully blessed you got to be in his will and it was not the will of God for them to stay outside the promised land we got to be committed to finish we're right here at the wrapping up of all things others have run their race others have done their part they brought it up to this point but somebody's got to run the final laps somebody's got to cross over and possess the promise well who's going to do it brother Aaron quit looking around it's not for another age to do it's not for somebody else to do it's for you to do you're the one called to be the final Runners you're the one called to be the final voice to the final age you're the one called to run the to be the Overcomers in Satan's Eden yes it's evil everywhere and God said I'm going to have a people that overcome it and they're on the Earth today they're sitting in this church house today you are the people that's going to overcome Satan's Eden you're going to run this race despite all the fear you're going to run this race even when you're hurting oh yeah it's not always going to be easy you're going to run this race whenever you want to quit come on now you're going to run it when it feels like you're the only one running listen Overcomers keep going even when when they don't understand Overcomers keep going even when people hurt them Overcomers keep going when everybody else quits that's right what about it Tommy quit never we heard that at our meetings last weekend was a title of brother Ron's sermon quit never I can't quit what am I going to go back to Jesus said you going to leave you going to leave also where El I'm I going to go I done told you everybody's crazy where else am I going to go you alone have the words of eternal life you alone promise me a body change you alone promise me a Rapture you alone Are the Healer you alone are the deliverer I can't leave I can't quit I'm called to this I'm chose for this this is who I am Hallelujah you've been tasked with running the race through the most Wicked age and it's going to take commitment something this age knows very little love it's an age of quitters think about it something isn't easy quit something doesn't cater to you quit marriage is difficult quit Church upsets us quit people offend us quit the path got hard quit we got to get to the place where there's no quit in us because you're going to be presented with opportunities to quit you're going to be presented with easier paths easier ways things that don't hurt so much things that don't take such a sacrifice but I want to ask you to do this examine where that road leads needs this may be the hardest Road you've ever walked but let me tell you it's got the most glorious outcome it's got the best ending and I'll tell you what I wouldn't trade this life for any other life there is oh brother a what if you get down to the end of the line and and there is no Heaven I choose this life I choose a life with with wonderful loving families and marriages that last and friends that stick with you I choose this life where there's joy and people that got your back I choose a life where I don't wake up hung over I choose a life where I'm not strung out on drugs I choose this life Hallelujah yes sir don't take an easier path it's not easier it's a deception that's right stay the course what was it that was told to brother brownon because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast walked of your own choosing thou H has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way I say Lord I want to go your way I want to walk on your path I don't care what I suffer here Lord just let me end up there with you Hallelujah Psalms 37 and5 says commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noon day brother Bram uses this scripture and he says God can't move for you in any situation until you let go of it until you commit it to God you want an overcoming life I I I do you want a Victorious life but you're still holding on to your wants and your desires listen it's probably one of the most well-known you know scriptures there is but we so often forget it seek ye first notice it didn't say you're not going to get all these other things it didn't say it's wrong to to seek a career it didn't say it's wrong to want to have a nice house it didn't say it's wrong to want to advance in your job it said don't do that first put God first be committed to God first he'll take care of the rest of it you want to be blessed seek God first give him everything first it don't work that way way to where you're like well I'm going to do this this this this and God when I get to you no it's not going to work out for you put God first you have to commit everything to him brother Brown says we're always wanting God to run errands for us or do something for us but when we're willing to say thy will be done commit ourselves to him commit our ways to him all that we have committed to him that's when God will move when you're willing to let him work on you not you work on him God work on me God work on me you know so many times we we we look at things in a way of well is is is is this sinful or can I get away with this and how instead of just saying God does this please you God is this what you want not what can I get away with yeah God's a loving God he's not there looking going wh got him I'm sending that one to hell yeah yeah will God forgive you I'm sure he will but this is supposed to be a love affair right this is supposed to be God how can I please you that's when we get away from looking at the message in the Bible as rules and regulations and start looking at it as a love letter and you read and it's you know people say well why can't I why can't I why can't I go ahead you can he's telling you what pleases him that's right that's right what what pleases God is that you dress this way what pleases God is that you act this way what pleases God is that we live a life this way it's not rules and Regulation and him up there thumbing you down and you're going to do it's what pleases him and because we love him we want to please him amen amen but it seems like we commit so many we commit to so many other things other than the things of God look and I believe in Comm being committed in all things at your job you should be committed you should be committed to be the best you can be at your job as a daddy you should be committed as a mama you should be committed a as a friend you should be committed in all things we should do if you're GNA do something be committed but what I'm all I'm saying is quit letting your commitment to those things or anything outshine your commitment to God we commit to everything but then we won't commit to the things of God well I'm I'm committed to be a Christian but you won't commit to his word I'm committed to be a Christian but you won't commit to coming to the house of God let's be committed to the things of God Amen let's be committed to to to to the house of God and to the word of God and to the works of God whatever we have tonight let's give it all to him let's commit it to him let's sell out to him is what I'm trying to say because see God and the devil are both trying to get you to sell out God and the devil they're both trying to get us to sell out but in two different ways see God wants you to sell out all you are to him to give your all even the parts that you find insignificant the the little things because God can use the little things listen to this quote but if you're honest and sincere God can appear to you yet in a dream it goes to show that anything that you have anything whether it's your mind whether you can whistle sing testify or whatever you can do if your whole being is committed to God God can use it if you'll just let him do it but brother Aaron I don't have much to offer okay well then take that little bit you don't think as much and offer it take that little bit and give it to him see because we don't commit to God just so we can make it over to heaven we commit to God so that he can use us while we're here that's right oh well brother Aaron it's my life no it's not it's his life lent to you that you're supposed to use to bring glory to his name that's right you're life is on loan from him it's his life amen take that little thing and give it to him God will use whatever you give him even if any people around you don't think it's much that listen there's there's there's a scripture John 6 and8 and we're going to go into a little bit brother brandham tells the story he he dramatized it and illustrates it so well like only brother brandham can it's the story of of of the of the Loaves and Fishes and brother Brown talks about the little boy skipped school that day said he was going fishing and he was going fishing and he skipped school and he happened to notice this Gathering and he's drawn over to it and and and he's looking at he's listening for a little bit and it says it came time you know for them to eat and they didn't have food in John 6 and8 says one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley Loaves and two fishes so let's just equate it to you that's what you have to offer and you over hear a deacon in the church say what the disciples said to Jesus but what are they amongst so many in other words the disciples said here's what the boy has to offer but that's nothing you hear a deacon in the church go not that you're Deacon what I'm just saying this is one of the disciples so I'm trying to make an illustration here are you hear a brother say yeah I mean yeah but that they can they do this and this but you know they're not really that important they're not really that needed how hurt we would be but brother brandham says that when they did come and ask him for it he said if it's for that man then you can have it think about it you ain't giving your gift to help me you're not giving your gift for those run you're giving it to that man and Jesus says I'll take it tonight I'll use what you got I'll use what little you can offer Let Jesus have it he says if it's for that man I say Jesus can have me tonight whatever I can offer it may not be much to anybody else but if it's for that man he can have it tonight hallelujah oh but my gifts just so insignificant so meaningless how could I ever impact others I even heard his disciples say what is this amongst so many but I love verse 11 John 611 starts off and Jesus Took the loaves he wants you he wants what you have to offer he can use what you have to offer he's looking for somebody give him some loaves tonight it ain't much but Jesus you can have it you can have every part of my life cuz I know you'll multiply it and you'll bless it and in your hands little is much so I'm going to turn it over I'm going to commit everything I am to Jesus tonight whatever you have to offer just say Jesus can have it whatever I've got Jesus can have it Amen brother Brown says here's what it teaches us God can use every faculty of our being if it's committed surrendered to him he can use our mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes my everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God see everything that you are committed to God he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his purpose and calling Hallelujah God's looking for people that will sell out to him now Satan's looking for sellouts too sure he wants you to be a sellout what's a sellout a person who compromises their personal values Integrity Talent gifts for money or personal advancement or an easier path to success to make a deal that compromises loyalty a traitor he's looking for people willing to compromise on the word he's looking for people to lay down their rights and just walk away he's looking for those that give up some of their standards for an easier path whether at work or school or trouble in the home well you know if we just give into this a little bit it'll bring peace don't don't don't don't you back off of one thing don't make deals with the Devil he's not going to honor his side of the bargain anyway he's just looking for a foo hole list when he comes in and says I just want your joy I just want your peace you can still be an overcomer I just want to take a little bit of your peace and give you a little bit of this anxiety don't you back off he's not that's not what he wants he wants your soul and he's just looking for a Toe Hold to get into your life I don't care where it is if it's a one toe on my property it's trespassing don't give up nothing listen don't wait till the devil's ins your house the minute he steps on your property blast him he don't have no rights on your property he ain't got no rights in your yard don't wait till he's in the house and go how'd you get here well you gave up Joy and you gave up peace and you gave up your worship and and church just became a tradition and and you weren't really committed you weren't really sold out you woke up one day and the devil's living in your bedroom deal with it right now pull the root up right now Little Devils grow up to be big Devils deal with it right now commit it right now to him Satan's looking for bams that'll sell out he's looking for Esau that'll sell their Birthright he's looking for those like the 10 spies that came out under a prophet saw the supernatural went through the Red Sea followed a pillar of fire but then said we can't take the land it's too hard I don't think we can do it we look like grasshoppers in their sight think about it how'd they know do you think they walked up to them excuse me what do I look like to you where'd they get that from they didn't go talk to the Giants it was their own imagination it was listening to what the devil told them that's why the Bible tells us cast down imagination and any High thing that exalts itself against the word of God so tonight that Devil's saying you ain't going to make it cast it down you can't be healed cast it down your children ain't coming back cast it down see because all of that goes against the word of God that says I've already made it by his stripes I'm Healed I'll be there and my Offspring with me that's what the word says I'm not asking the devil if it looks possible I'm not asking the devil you think I'm going to make it no sir the word said I'm going to make it so I'm going to stand with the word tonight committed to the word hallelujah he's looking for people that'll sell out you know brother Aon maybe we should back off our expectations a little bit maybe we don't really get the new birth like they used to maybe God don't move in the Supernatural anymore don't back off your Birthright brother Brown says and how many tonight how many people people has sold out their Birthright to the things of the world and got away from God stay with the word he says those spies that went over to spy out the land came and even eat the grapes that Joshua and Caleb brought back and yet what did they do they sold their Birthright you know in the message and and I understand why brother brandham dealt with him specifically a lot talks about Elvis sold out for money and riches and Cadillacs and we like to point to him and use him for an example and Bash on Elvis whatever my deal is many of us sell out for way less there's a lot of people sell out their Wednesdays for a $2 an hour raise you were like Elvis sold out for Cadillacs and a million records and I sold out so I can make 1750 an hour there ain't nothing worth selling out for God your provider God your provider put God first and trust in him him and watch him provide for you Way Beyond any 1750 or whatever that man's offering you to miss church sell out to God don't be a sellout for money I believe God's got a people on Earth today that's purposed in their heart I'm not settling for less I'm not settling for less than the new birth they got in the upper room I'm not settling for less than Divine Healing that that's been restored in this day I'm not settling for less than my children coming back to God I'm not settling for less than Resto restored families and restored marriages and a church on fire for God I'm not settling for the tribulation I'm not settling for white Throne judgment I'm not selling for anything but a body change and a Rapture of the church that's what I'm going to have cuz that's what the word promised me Hallelujah yes Lord he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the very theme of the message of the hour how can the Supernatural message that ever struck the face of the Earth how can we claim to believe it and then deny it at the same time that's right he's the same he did it once he'll do it again brother brandham said if he did it one way one time he's obligated to do it the same way this time Hallelujah I'm not going to settle for anything less than everything I'm going to have everything he promised me amen it's hard to go back to talking about the world when you start talking about the good things of God but but the currents of the world blow and the currents of unbelief blow and Satan tries to wear you down over time how many has experienced that absolutely we all do he tries to wear you down and when he gets you worn down to a place that he thinks he's got you weak that's when he begins to offer compromises and then we're not a people who can get by on compromises we're not a people that can settle for compromises because the truth and the light that's been granted to us God expects us to stand he expects us to stand he expects us to overcome he expects us to be committed to what we've been given listen in this world today and you all know them I heard the wonderful testimony my brother Brad gave about the the Baptist Church that that donated so much and is doing so much for for people there are a lot of good people there are a lot of people live Christianity to the best of their ability with what they have and what they know I don't never want to take anything away from those I I say all the time I wish there was a lot more Baptist in this world it'd be a better place I don't know how it is up here but back home there's a lot of people I was like man I wish they was a Baptist I i''d be a better person so I'm not here to take away from what they have I'm thankful for the stand that they stand but how much more should you be willing to stand with what you've been given and what's been revealed to you in this day amen but they stand with what light they have and the Bible tells us that they're going to be granted life for the testimony that they held they're going to be granted life but but you've been given great light the message of Malachi 4 as you know restored the truth you know the truth of the church ages you know the truth of baptism the truth truth of serpy the truth of godhead we could go on and on on all these things have been restored to you you're the recipients of all that he committed that into your hands what a commitment that he has given us but because of that what a commitment he requires from us think about it we're not going to get by on well we did the best we could with what we had brother Tommy we don't have an excuse of not knowing we can't plead ignorance we can't plead ignorance maybe as those who didn't know or even other ages who who who only had partial light and lived in the fullness of what they had listen to what it says in Luke 12:48 I want you to get this but he that knew not so Jesus here is talking about ignorance he knew not and did commit things worthy of Stripes shall be beaten with few stripes in other words they're still going to be punch punishment but it's been reduced because he didn't know it was worthy of Stripes but he did it in ignorance so he's only going to be given a few stripes for unto whom so much whosoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more notice it's still punishment but it's lightened you find this actually it's based in numbers 15:29 listen as I read this you shall have one law for him that sinth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them notice ignorance excuses them there's actually a totally different law for a man who sinth in ignorance okay there's still punishment like I said it's just not as severe so so there's going to be punishment but lighter there's somewh of an excuse there they didn't know better think about it even the Jews in their crucifixion of Jesus you find that in their defense over and over ignorance is mentioned acts 3:17 and now Brethren I what that through ignorance you did it as did also your rulers 1 Corinthians uh 1 Colossians 2:8 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory ignorance think about what Jesus even say as their defense father forgive them they know not it was ignorance and he's sighting ignorance but look at those now I'm turning it to you who know and choose not to do what's right I read you numbers 1529 saying there was a law for the ignorant but now 15 and 30 says but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously you knew better whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off from among his people Church we're not going to get by saying we didn't know better we're not going to get by with compromising and being halfway in others may receive a lighter punishment and and then go through the tribulation and be granted life at the great white Throne judgment and giv eternal life I'm just saying I'd hate to stand there that day knowing what we know that's right once again I don't I I don't know everything there's things I don't understand brother Tom but I've just always said it's going to be awful hard to be a foolish virgin sitting in a message church I'm telling you you better make the Rapture and I'm not saying that to scare you I'm also telling you he gave you everything you need to make the Rapture he's not rooting against you he's rooting for you he's saying here take it there's a Rapture for you there's a there's a token for you get on board there's a way of Escape he's not saying no if you missed the rap he's saying no come on come on come on the the spirit and the bride say come and drink of the Water of Life freely listen he's expecting you to make it he said I go to prepare a place for you he didn't just just go do that for himself he's waiting on you to show up he knows you're coming he's already seen you there from before the foundation of the world he's expecting you to make it and he sent a message to make sure you make it Hallelujah Lord For unto who soever much is given of him shall much be required we got to be committed to truth because truth has been committed to us standing for truth defending truth Walking In Truth living in truth you got to be committed you said that a lot tonight yeah I'm going to keep saying that's what we're preaching to you we got to be sold out we got to be committed committed to it against all adversaries committed to it against Liars committed to it against all the currents of society that would try to erode it not waver in it not back up on it not water it down but say what the prophet said he delivered it the way it was meant to be delivered well I think what brother brandham meant was I think brother brandham said what he meant take all of it look there's Parts where're all wired different there's parts of that might be hard for me to take other parts might be hard for you to take you know before they left Egypt they had to eat all the lamb all right eat it eat it and it might make your belly bitter that's what the that's what it says that just means it's going to stir some things up there's parts that ain't just going to sit exactly well with you eat it anyway let it change you anyway let it prepare you to leave here anyway Even If It Don't Fit with what you think that's okay let this mind be in you lay it down lay down and eat on it don't waver on it take all of it stand for all of it be committed to all of of it because all of it is what we have to have all of it is what we have to have listen I'm not saying this like I said I want to make sure you understand not in a negative way or to to to scare you oh no no no no this is a glorious thing this is a wonderful thing he gave you exactly what he knew you needed to overcome and so therefore he expects you to overcome he expects you to win the battle he expects you to Rapture because he knows that he's giving you exactly what you needed to make it listen think about this countries are constantly advancing so militaries are constantly advancing if if you're still fighting with the same things you was fighting with a year ago you're behind they say during World War II it Advanced so so quickly that if you was at fighting at the end of the war with the same stuff you had literally months before you were behind so so so armies Advan and Technologies Advance athletes are advancing because of all these new technologies and new trainings and new and new and new and yet God can never have a new thought he doesn't have to go well now let me give them this and now let me give them he gave you the best at the very beginning he gave you the word at the very beginning because he knew that this right here would defeat Satan anywhere any place anytime it didn't matter if it was Ephesus or Le AA this will do it it's the atomic bomb it's time to get back to the word and drop on the devil's head tonight oh but you're sick boom I'm the Lord God that Health thee pick up the word tonight you don't even got that well I don't know much of the Bible that's okay pick up what you can Samson looked around there was a Jawbone you may not can quote much but by his stripes I'm Healed and go to killing Devils with that one scripture swing what you got tonight pick up what you got tonight and be committed to it and use it Hallelujah God is infinite and he gave us the best to begin with and that was his word it still defeats Satan anywhere it still defeats him any time under any circumstances okay let the devil change his tactics let him change society let him go about roaring like a like like a roaring line let the world fall apart God don't have to think of nothing better for us he already gave us what we have need of he restored it in this age so that we could stand so that we could overcome we don't got to improve the gospel guys it's perfect amen God gave us the very best so I say hey let the storms come they're coming anyway might as well not fear them the trials are coming anyway you might as well not fear them the anchor is going to hold the storm's going to pass by and you're still going to be standing on listen some of y'all he's been telling you for 20 years you're going to quit you're not going to make it you're going to leave you're a failure and you look around you go in the most evil time in the worst time on the face of the Earth despite all that I'm still here I'm still standing I'm still fighting it's time you let the devil know I'm still here I ain't going nowhere I'm going be standing on my feet one day and there's a sweep going to come over me and I'm not leaving till he takes me out of here and the devil can't touch a hair on your head until God's through with you he ain't nothing but a bluff Hallelujah wonderful we're going to Crest every wave Amen in spite of the evil in spite of the age in spite of the unbelief in spite of everything against us we're going to finish this race because we're committed to finish listen Devil's going to punch at you every day you're here that's right he's going to punch at you and punch of you he's going to throw everything he has at you cuz he don't want you to make it he can't stop it but he's going to punch at you you have never understood people that get upset at getting punched when you're in a fight can you imagine the boxer coming back to his Corner that guy hit me oh yeah that's what he's supposed to do it's a fight it ain't about how many times you got hit listen I just want to tell you maybe you're not in I'm not really into boxing but I know a little bit about it at the end of the day don't nobody go yep I know you won but you lost the third round I know you won the fight and you're the champion and you're wearing the belt and you're in heaven and you got a new body and you're walking streets of gold but do you remember that Tuesday in 2024 where you stumbled nope I don't remember it at all because I'm the Champion I'm an overcomer I made it I won the fight he hit me hard but I am Ed the bail Time After Time After Time and you're going to keep coming cuz you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're going to get hit but keep fighting back brother Brown says now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth constantly just remember that you'll never have a Time listen I don't mean to ruin anybody's day but you'll never have a Time but there's a punch going on because you're in a battle he's looking for that weak spot he's probing you he's looking because we're all different what might get me wouldn't never bother you you know how it is brother the time you you've dealt with people and counsel with people sometimes the things that really stumble people you got to do a real good job and put on a serious face and make them think you understand because inside you're going what that bothered you but let me tell you what if I told you the things that bothered me you might go what because we're all different and he's probing you listen if your brother is struggling it don't matter why don't give him a what just be there for him you know mind battles is real things it may not be your problem complexes may not be your issue but it's somebody that has them it's a real devil it's a real battle it's a real struggle let's don't belittle them let's just say man I'm fighting this battle with you I'm praying with you you're going to overcome this thing cuz you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God listen it don't matter what the struggle is we're going to win the struggle we're going to win the battle we're going to fight together we're in this together I need you you need me we need each other different battles same Lord Jesus same conqueror he's looking for your weak spots brother Aaron Christians have weak spots yeah we all do and we have to keep them covered at all times brother BR said I he says remember Satan Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a he's got a right to that one punch see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now he don't got a right if it's covered if it's behind if it's been repented if it's under the blood of Jesus and you keep but he's say if you let that part get exposed he's got a right to that open place he says that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time think about it you know your nature you know you're weak weakness points and where you're weak at where you're strong you know where the devil tries to come in that's the spot you keep covered don't toy with things well I was delivered I I'll just say it and you know some people cringe or whatever I okay well brother I was delivered from pornography but it's okay if I just this really ain't pornography no don't don't dabble at all don't look at all don't think at all keep your eyes up you can't justify that because that's a place you got to keep I'm not doubting your deliverance I'm saying keep it covered he knows it got you once he's going to present it to you again it may be totally it may be something like Pride maybe you're somebody else full of Pride God delivered you from that keep it covered no matter what it is you know what I have to keep covered brother Tom smart mouth is that true Jude I before I was a Christian he's he's saying wait tell the whole truth before I was a Christian I was a very very very bad smart mouth and to me I wasn't trying to be ugly I thought it was funny right I'm thinking everybody's gonna laugh hahaa except the person that you were being smart to they don't think hahaa but even as a Christian I tell people all the time at church I said listen I should get trophies for the things I don't say because man sometimes they pop in your head and you're like oh Jesus I love you I have to battle it because you know what I I don't want that I don't want to hurt a brother even if I don't mean to I don't want to offend somebody even if I don't mean to you you know um younger people talk to each other that way and it's all fun and gam I have to be aware that there's an older generation that it ain't fun in games I have to keep it cover I'm in a leadership position and I have to recognize that's not okay well that's not that big a deal brother it is to me I really really have to fight to keep those things cover now my son probably thinks I wish you'd fight to keep it covered when we're together because I can be pretty harsh on him but he thinks it's funny like I do so it's okay but I'm just saying I just wanted to to be open with you and say we all have things that it's not always some big obvious thing I've got a drink and no no no look when you first came to the Lord all those big things fell away it's like when when when they first start carving a statue they take and they chip big chunks off of it huge chunks and man lust Falls away and maybe cigarettes and and maybe alcohol whatever your lifesty all falls away but it still don't look like a person it's just a smaller rock but then what happens when they get down to the end they bring out sandpaper and those little things like maybe even a smart mouth maybe Pride maybe a temper the sculptor starts to sand and you're like ow that don't feel good but he's going to sand until it's smooth so sometimes we're looking around and and it's like well all these big things fell off my life I'm good no you got to let him come in and work out the details let him sand here and sand there and it may not feel good but every one of those beautiful things that Michelangelo sculpted took some work to get the details in in there he's doing a work on his people because she's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power she is him well I'm just going to say Lord I believe that with all my heart but I recognize there's still work he's still working on me it may hurt and it may be sanding and it may be painful but I say Lord take control tonight put me back on The Potter's will mold me however you have to mold me cuz I am committed to you whatever it takes I'm willing to give it up how many times we say well you know it's just a temper that's my dad had a temper my grandpa had a temper it's just Family Cycle it's just who we are no it's not who you are that's not who we are God gets to decide who we are God made you a certain way God made you to bring glory to his name quit just accepting what the devil puts on it's just who I am it's my nature I know that's why we believe in a nature change we believe in a new birth where we let the Holy Ghost come in and mold us and change us it's not always easy but we got to let him work amen Satan's doing everything he can to get you to give up and stay down but we can't stay down God didn't send us here to start a race he sent us here to finish your race he sent us here to finish your race and I may get hit and I may fall down but I want to tell you tonight as the Bride of Jesus Christ we can't stay down I may get hit I may get punched but I'm getting up why cuz I can't quit I can't stop I can't go back quit never can't quit can't go back can't stay down I got to get up and keep swinging I got to get up and keep fighting because he did it for me he kept going up that hill he didn't quit when they drove in the nails he didn't quit when they put him in a tomb he didn't quit when he went down to hell he kept fighting and kept fighting and he conquered death and he conquered hell and he conquered the grave and he rose again and he said I'm going to prepare a place for you and I say I'm going to be there no matter what it takes I can't quit I got to keep pushing on Hallelujah press on hallelujah amen you got knocked down I'm just saying get up again you need more of God get it tonight and keep going press the battle you're not a failure cuz you fell down what do you mean listen in the vision brother brandom had I believe it was of the Mamba he said he have the power to bind him and the power to loose him what I love about is he bound him he loosed him and then he said just to know he says Satan I bind you

questions sure you can expect to battle you can expect if thou be if thou be if you were really born again if this message is really true if it really matters how we dress if it really matters how we wear our hair think about listen this quote brother Brown says he said now if thou be the Son of God see he always doubted it he still teaches others to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt it taught Moses he taught all of them to try to doubt it he's teaching you to try to doubt it now now now listen to this this this is this is amazing to me can you imagine having been sitting there and you that's sitting right here now if you want me to call your names Satan's been trying a long time to get you to doubt me listen I may not know your name but the word knows who you are the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and the word's telling you tonight in your struggle tonight in your trial you're not forgotten just raise up raise up where you are buying the devil and taking us you don't got to lay around in it you don't got to sit there and Waller in your pity and Waller in your failure God saying just get up keep walking ask for forgiveness and keep walking it's over that quick it's over that quick I'm G give a testimony of my my aunt my Aunt Jeanie was in a prayer line in streetport Louisiana with brother Brown she was a high school girl she didn't know anything about brother Brown she was invited there by our uncle she was a little Methodist girl high school cheerleader she' been sneaking around smoking cigarettes behind her mama's back and she ends up in this prayer line and the person in front of her brother bram's talking to him and says well you can have your healing if you'll repent of them cigarettes you've been smoking says the guy just throws his hands up you know says Lord Jesus forgive me I'm sorry and and it was you know so so my aunt jeie standing there and she bows her head real quick not knowing any different she just said she just said Lord I'm sorry I don't know you know what really going on she said please forgive me but whatever I've done she said please don't let that man Tell My Mama I've been smoking cigarettes but here's what's great is she steps up in that presence knowing he can he just did and nothing is said about it not one word is said about it you want to know why it don't take four hours praying and begging he's your father you don't got to beg just Lord I'm sorry Lord forgive me Lord I messed up it's over to where even a prophet stood there and didn't see it quit digging up your past quit digging up your failures quit Dalling in it Lord I'm sorry and I'm moving on Lord I'm sorry and I'm going to overcome just leave it there and walk away from your failure tonight move on tonight Hallelujah he still forgives he still forgives we're going to bring this down I love the story where brother Brown tells about driving in the car and and he's listening to the radio and and I think he was taking his daughter to school if I remember right and he's listening to radio and they got this scientist on there explaining how the world came to be with all the chemicals and all this and the explosions and such and he says he turned it off because he was like I'm not listening to this you know so he turns it off and he said Satan started saying to him you know Jesus was just a man like any other maybe like a Billy Graham and a few people gathered around him and believed him but now he's dead and gone and that's all of it I love what brother Brown says he says I thought how a liar you are maybe some of us need to use that Kentucky English tonight y'all how a liar you are he said says and then I turned just as I was crossing Graham Street I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things now put yourself in this conversation it's time to ask the devil a few things he says who was it that the Hebrew prophets spoke of that would come who was the anointed Messiah what was upon those men who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got there who was it that foretold it just to the letter and when he' come they said he was numbered with the transgressors and he was and he was wounded for our transgressions and he was and he made his grave with the rich but he would rise up the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left he says just give him the word he can't stand the word I say just pour it on him tonight just pour the word on him just pour it on him drop it on him tonight who is it that's going to take a Rapture devil who is is it it's me who is it overcoming in your edting devil it's me who was it said I send Malachi 4 and he did it who was it said I will restore and he did it who was it said I can have my children and I'm going to have them who was it it was him who' he call me he called me pour it on him tonight commit to it tonight Hallelujah who is it that's been healed brother Tommy it's me who is it has been delivered it's me who is that's got the Holy Ghost tonight it's me Hallelujah who is that's been forgiven it's me who did it all it's him hallelujah it's his bride it's the one he's called and chosen oh yeah he's going to get his punch in but it's time we start punching back quit just laying around taking it it's time to punch back with the word put it in his face tonight hold fast use every weapon persevere get up off the mat Hallelujah and when you do when you cast all your cares on him then he takes responsibility for you Hallelujah think about it brother Brown says he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts no man has the right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it he said read Isaiah 96 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean he says the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over on the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion she has transferred her rights to him and that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation oh Hallelujah but brother Aaron tonight I got so many heartaches he accepts the obligation I've got so many failures you don't understand he accepts the obligation I've I've got I've got marriage trouble I've got I got a sick child I got kids lost in the world he accepts the obligation he accepts the obligation so now I ask you is there anything too hard for the Lord I say even now Lord even now whatever my situation is even now you said you accept the obligation listen the creditors and those coming trying to collect on the bills and you did this and you did that H they don't get to talk to me no more you got to go through him he accepts the obligation he said I was saved he said I could be healed he said I was delivered he said my past was erased he said I can have a new body take it up with him he accepted my responsibility he accepted my obligations tonight and I lay it all on him because I've committed it all to him oh brother Aaron you just don't know how bad I've been he accepts the obligation he says I'll settle the debts throw your cares on him tonight brother Brown says' oh if we could only learn to be a trusted servant of God like that that we could commit things to God it's the most powerful thing I know of is a committal commit thy ways unto the Lord I said we were speaking tonight on committed to finish church we got to be committed we got to race to finish we got Works to finish we got responsibilities you can't quit you can't get comfortable in Le osia you got to be committed to finish you're called to finish I just want to encourage you tonight to press on until you cross the line but you know what even before you cross that line I just want to say it like this you know how people talk about I know it's true I I'm not downgrading this at all but people say there's a line that you can cross where there's no going back you crossed a line and and and you send away your day of Grace I understand that but if there's that line in the negative what about in the positive how about you push past that line to where there's no going back to that ever again I've crossed the line from judgment into Grace I've crossed the line from my past into my future I've crossed the line from my sins into forgiveness I say we cross the line tonight let's press across the line and once you cross that line then I guarantee you on that day you'll cross over the
