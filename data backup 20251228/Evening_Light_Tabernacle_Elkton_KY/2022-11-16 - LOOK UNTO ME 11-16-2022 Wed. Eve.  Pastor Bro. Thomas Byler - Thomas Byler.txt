for that I guess it wouldn't be rainy it'd be snow wouldn't it spreading a little bit of snow so amen we just might get a little snow this year I don't know it's looking like if we might it's already threatening pretty good so you know I mean we might even see some of that white stuff so praise the Lord amen God is good isn't he trust everybody's feeling well amen I know we got some sickness going around Elena I know she's sick today so Mike and them's not here but uh anyway just some this that and the other going around so I guess we'll have that but just remember them in prayer let's power his we go into the word of God lord Jesus we come before you father thank the Lord Jesus once again to be assembled together in your name knowing god that you are here with us Lord that's what makes it all worthwhile father we just thank you for this opportunity it is that we have to assemble ourselves together Lord Lord to talk about you and to lift you up praise you and adore you and and just to speak about you father we ask God that Joseph the meditation of our heart Lord Jesus that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak we ask God that you just help me to get it out of the way Lord that you might use my lips use my heart and mind father to speak just the thing that you want to speak to your children tonight Lord help each child also Father to have opened mind and an open heart God that they might receive what you have for them may you speak directly to each one father tonight come and do what you always do Lord Jesus that has caused our hearts to burn within us Lord as you speak to us along the way bless the reading of the word the opening of it now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless you turn your bibles if you will amen wants to speak on the subject I certainly have spoken on before but just want to perhaps take it into a little different direction amen Isaiah 45 Isaiah 45. we'll go begin with verse 20. assemble yourselves and come draw near together eat at our Escape of the names they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their Graven image and pray unto a God that cannot save tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who have declared this from the ancient time who had told it from that time have not had a lord there is no God help no God else besides me it's just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else I have sworn by myself and the word is going out of my mouth and righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear surely shall one say and the Lord have I righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed in the Lord shall all the Sea of Israel be justified and shall Glory may God add His blessings to the reading of the worst you can be seated tonight I want to speak on look unto me amen amen as I was meditating today on what to speak on and I was just meditating on the Lord and thinking about him you know and how wonderful he is and all the things that we've already said that he is amen like uh he's the alpha he's the Amigo he's the he's everything in between one place he says I am the whole creation and Jesus is my name amen the Bible talks about him he is all and in all so I got to thinking of how you know uh and I asked myself this question and I'm going to ask you tonight you know uh uh can we ever he says can we ever cease to be amazed with God amen can we ever come to the place to where we think well that's all there is to know that's all there is to having God amen can we ever get bored with God no amen I got to thinking that's right amen we don't we don't know uh well put it this way we don't know what we don't know but there's a lot we don't know about God amen and you can just take a little bit of God and think about him now there's a lot that we do understand about God Amen truly there is a lot that we understand but there's still uh there is no searching Bible says one place of his understanding hey man you can't even begin to imagine when you think about God and what he is and how he is his power and his uh Eternal headship and so forth and everything that is but tonight we want to just you know look at this because usually when I preach When anybody preaches usually on look unto me or looking to God and so forth we always go back to Israel and how that you know whenever they were murmuring and complaining and the serpents begin to bite them and die in tens of thousands of guests who died you know and they were all dying and so forth and they were screaming when for help and begging for mercy and and God told Moses to put up a brass serpent in that right a pole and put a brass serpent on a pole you know it kind of this might seem like a strange thing to do amen but that's what he told him to do and he did and and he he says if you're bitten you know all you got to do is look and he won't die [Laughter] how many records that God knew what he was doing when he did that he knew why to put it on the pole he knew to use a serpent which represents sin judged isn't that right and that serpent was represented Christ on the pole our sins on the Paul judged right amen judgment price means you know and and there is no life outside of looking at the pole outside of looking at the cross outside of looking at Christ there is no way that you'll ever live I am the way I am the truth I am the wife no man comes to the father but by me there's no other way no other religion no nothing else that you can look to in life and live except Jesus Christ accept the cross amen and we begin to think about how great God is and so forth amen and what he is and so forth we want to with the help of the Lord just go over some of these things you know because I believe he's uh inexhaustible Fountain of Life inexhaustible Fountain of knowledge and wisdom he's a life he's uh inexhaustible a fountain of love and grace and mercy when you think about all that God is sometimes it might make you think that he's way out there but I want to bring him down home tonight if I can with the help of the Lord amen oh my I think about it and we'll always God help us never as a prophet put it I believe it was um let me think just how I had a couple different phrases never let it become common to you but another thing he says don't never lose your enthusiasm for God the devil lost his enthusiasm he let Heaven become common to him amen people let me this is this both here and all out there think about it you know if we let Church become common to us because this is where we come to worship and praise and and adore and love him isn't that right if that becomes boring to us what's ever going to be after a while I say tonight before church gets boring to you I'm not so sure that heaven's going to be a place you want to be well I should never get boring should never I don't care how dark I don't care how windy and stormy we should always enjoy coming to the house of God always worshiping the Lord from now to Eternity so we look at looking let's look at looking people like to look huh but you know people love to look at what God made talking about the house is not greater than he that built it but people will travel you know how much money spent on traveling and going seeing places they love the Swiss Elks we love the mountains we love all of that we're going to go to look at all of that just to see the beauty and there's some places that just uh breathtaking right there's Just Breath they take Colorado into these places under these places it's just breathtaking just to look at them and and and kind of people just love to look at these the great creation huh but I had to think you know people like to look at that but you know they ought to focus more on looking at the Creator if they got they got more interest in looking at the one that made it all huh because people will go there amen people will go to the mountains that made for a little rest for a little pizza you know you might go to the uh I don't know if it's called Andrew and I can't even pronounce the mountains up into Canada Andrea uh I don't know I can't pronounce something with Acts you know way up there in the mountains way far away take a plane and go and land in the water and go back there and get a little cabin better put time in get back here and maybe and we're gonna have some peace and quiet we're gonna get some rest now people love to go and they like to get a little pieces I like to have a little rest huh but you know you can be way out there and you might think that you're having some but if you don't have it in here you still don't got it the peace of God is the peace that passes understanding amen said look more for peace and find that it doesn't matter where you are you can have a peace amen oh my and as you look at God think about it as you look at God and what he is you might wonder well what is God and how is he how does God feel how does God think huh how many knows you can do that let the peace of God the Bible says rule in your hearts now the place he says that peace that passes all understanding in other words it's such a peace when you've got God that you just can't explain that it's past un past explaining so I believe that you and I can have the peace of God the very peace that God has you have when you look at him and receive him because you can never let me say this how many you can never really know this God just intellectually by hearing it with your mind huh because even the Bible says he didn't have the son has life he didn't have not the son had not life in other words you you can't you know it's like trying to tell somebody about an experience that they never had huh it don't work too well you know and if you explain what God is well you don't really know until you have him it makes it different you have to have him in here to know what he's like amen I mean he's glad that you can look to him and become him amen people do all kinds of things to try to have a little Joy huh they don't realize that you know it's not about things that you do that give you Joy but why don't they go into Joy Giver he is George he's peace he's Joy he's rest oh my there's nothing like being in the rest of God amen all of your works is done you ain't got to worry about the future amen I was walking in the house today I said Lord I'm just so thankful that I am completely just yours I'm just completely surrendered to you Lord I'm Yours I ain't got a worry in the world not in this life and not in the world to come God is promised to take care of you we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth we should be filled with the peace of God that passes understanding we should have the joy of the Lord is my strength joy unspeakable the Bible calls it and full of Glory amen that's what God's really like [Music] hey man aren't you glad for that we'll talk about a little bit more but let me just read you the there's one scripture that I'd like to read I've got the peace and the joy and all this but you know Paul Peter says it this way blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ this is in First Peter the first chapter verse three which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope amen by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that passes that away pray and that fate is not away amen how many believes that's eternal life that God has promised you that you haven't inherent condom that's that's Eternal it's uncorruptable it's undefiled that faded out of the way reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last times wherein you greatly Rejoice no now for a season in other words you might get real happy but it may be that it might be seasonal it may not always be so happy if need be ER and having us through manifold Temptations and trials and that the trial of your faith being much precious than the gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ whom have not whom he having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen even though we don't see him yet we have joy unspeakable and full of Glory because we are trusting to the promises of God amen praise be to God do you know I got the thinking here people will go to Oceans they'll go to beaches Amen to see the beauty that God has made they love to see beautiful places but you know how many knows that if those places are so beautiful how beautiful is the one that has made him amen how many believe that God is beautiful amen and we sing the song Not only is he beautiful but if he's in you we sing the song let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me how many believes that the beauty of Christ and seeing seeing the beauty of Christ is a whole lot better than seeing mountains oceans are all that he has made everybody that goes to beach everybody loves the beach everybody looks in the ocean that's Sunset if they just begin to think about the author think about the one that's made it but how many know the whole world is blinded about they don't look try to see they don't look and see because the Bible says their eyes are blind layout as he was blind most people are blind and they don't see what you see then the Bible say bless under your eyes for they see thank God that you can see God that you can look to him and live what do we do we look to his word because remember he said look to me all you have to be saved because my words going forth and it won't return void we look to what John 3 16 for God so loved the world that whosoever believeth him shall not perish but have everlasting life so you look to him and that's how you live you're looking right straight to that scripture what God Said and trusting in it they'll look at everything else and see the beauty but they don't see the beauty of Jesus and I asked this year and wrote down what is the beauty of God amen what is the beauty of God the beauty of God is one thing is his grace my when you think about how beautiful this craze is and his love his Mercy oh my God I gotta take this slow let's talk about his grace oh my how beautiful is it God could take in the Bible times that woman that dwell which is a harlot net right and take and take all of our sins or the one that was washing his feet I believe it is another one watching his feet and cleaning them and so forth and he told Simon you know you didn't welcome you didn't do all of these things but this woman has not ceased to it and her sins which are many all forgivener see that's true beauty how beautiful that God could take the vilest sinner make him clean like the song says oh I know yes I know Jesus blood can make the vile a sinner clean people love to go and they love to see Power they like to go to trucks shows and so forth and these tractor pulls right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] jumps out they're screaming and hollering that's power no power is having your sins erased is having guilt taken away and peace brought into you why don't they look to God to get some of that power to know what true power is there's power in the blood there's power in the blood there's Wonder working Glory look at that that's some real power huh I ain't getting bored with God man I'm telling you what I have such an awesome God that well I'm just looking for him to take care of my next problem anyway man I know I'm gonna have more but God's gonna take care of him and when I slip and I fall I know he's gonna pick me up how many knows God's gonna do that for you I'm not gonna get bored with God he's an awesome God aren't you bad tonight to know him to know what he's like because he's in here you can feel you can feel what the joy of the Lord is you can feel what the peace of God is you can know what the grace of God is let's talk about Grace for just a minute that's another Beauty another one of his great Beauties when you look at him is his grace his grace to forgive well maybe this is just another part of it and you know I get to thinking about his grace how did the Bible says that while we were yet sinners she died for us she loved us I love him I love him because he first loved me while I was still a sinner he loved us amen how can we know I want to know this grace how many wants to know this grace well if you get the Holy Ghost the way you're going to know this grace is when somebody really really does you wrong huh and you don't get bitter at them huh they treat you terrible and you forgive your enemies you love your enemies isn't that right see grace forgives if you can do that then you know the grace of God but to be hateful and unforgiving and mean that ain't God remember if you're mean and man all of you might want to just chew somebody up for me that ain't God no turning around like Stephen did after they were stoning him forgive them don't let them charge God he knew the grace of God when you look to God you'll find them you'll know what the grace of God really is all about he'll test you he'll let you find out whether you really got the grace of God is that right amen The Works that I do shall you do also how many believe that the very same spirit that was in Christ if he dwells in your mortal body he'll still do the same works amen the love of God how many loves the love of God what a great wow how beautiful is the love of God it's more beautiful than the ocean it's more beautiful than the stars and the moon and the Galaxy it's more beautiful than all of these things is the love of God how rich and pure how major listen strong amen why it could forgive it's so strong that he would go to Calvary no right he showed his love when he went to Calvary and he died and he peed for everybody's sins from becanes all the way to last sinner that Everlast if it'll ever see him he paid for every bit of it oh paid for the sins of the whole world he wrote him apart and you all part and here's a here's a ticket just come and get it hand it to the officer and tell him hey I've been pardoned I can go free or he can do like that man did in the prison remember in the Civil War and and and his friend got him a pardon from Abraham Lincoln and get away from here and he didn't accept and they shot him dead well that's what will happen to anybody who doesn't receive it that's why on that day it isn't because he didn't love him he didn't pardon him but how deep how great is love of God amen praise the lord we can see God through prayer we can see God through trust isn't that right turn your eyes turn your eyes on Jesus the only the only way listen I've got down here the only way that if you've got a broken heart he can heal that broken heart but you got to look to him for it if you're saying if you're lost look to the Savior he'll save you but you got to look to him amen if you're sick you got to look to him for your healing look and live if you got trouble oh my if you're surrounded by the enemy looks like he's gonna take you down like your house effect I mean those Jehoshaphat he had the whole Army much bigger than him and capped around him and then you know tried to intimidate him what did he do he got his sackcloths and he went to the prayer he went to asking God and talking to God amen and what did God do come on to see because he turned his eyes on him let me tell you something what in the world are you going to look at worth anything in this world the streets oh my form art it's terrible the public it's terrible folks what the devil has done it's absolutely terrible you can't look to our politics for hope you folks let me tell you something we aren't the only one America is not the only one sinking huh it's not the only one uh you know that's doomed it's the whole world is doomed they're all tied together there's no hope there you can't look there you can't look anywhere you know but you know I had to think about this if you want to see God where do you look where can you see God how about this how about in his church how about in his people when somebody shows you some kindness huh shows you some love by this shall all men know that you are my disciples and I think that's one of the I wrote down here that's one of the greatest ways that you're going to see God is when you see genuine love oh I'm not just talking about patent you on the back for all your evil now love is corrective ah somebody really loves you and they tell us it's tell you something you say well thank you for loving me enough to tell me because me most times we're just too scared to say anything to anybody amen I believe that needs to go both ways don't you if you tell somebody somebody tells you you need to be able to take it just like you give it but it's love amen and God is love and that's how we'll see it remember the Bible said we're taught that he's uh his hand these hands the only ones he had let me tell you isn't it beautiful when somebody gives you a call when you're sick or does something when you're in need they're there for you when you're down they're there for you to encourage there's nothing like it I've been there I know but it's like to have somebody when you're down at the bottom of the bottom to have somebody just say something good something positive amen that's real Beauty that's real Beauty what's the real Beauty in a church what's the beauty of a church is it our trim huh is it our carpet is it the seeds is it the nice round window thank the Lord huh we're glad for everything he gave us that's beautiful huh is it how good we look we dress oh by the way you're wondering brother what about the tie right you know what you know what let me tell you about the tie I just forgot I'd rather I got the church that I was like I forgot to put a Time the Lord I thought I had taken complete plenty of b12s but my brain still ain't looking right oh my you love the Lord the beauty of the church is the character of the people and the character of the people is the nature of Jesus Christ in them because certainly nothing beautiful in us that we would look at it's what he is in US the beauty of a church is the character of the people and that's where God place is in the people's character amen praise the Lord God is in when another way to look at is to meditate let me believe that Brother Band says in preaching and influence he says let me see what you look at watch listen to isn't that right and I can tell you what kind of person you are because we know that like he said with Abraham Lincoln the different ones are atmosphere and everything about them is created because of the things that we're looking at now David you know he was a man how many knows David was a man that believed in meditation and he and he I believe he was he put it somewhere in Psalms one you know uh I will Delight in the law of the Lord and in his law will I meditate day and night amen he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water amen to actually meditate to think about him how many knows that I wonder how many of us would say you know that's what I need to do more is keep my eyes more on him keep my meditation in the night watches and everywhere amen I don't know about you but I love to lay on my bed and just meditate on him think about him amen praise be to God makes a big difference amen makes a big difference praise the Lord brothers and sisters of how good we have it amen how many believe we have at nice the Lord's been good to us we have it probably better than any other age I know we easier than any other age because I think about those Dark Ages people now that they would have to hide in the catacombs and their lives were in Jeopardy for a thousand years they killed 68 million can you even fathom that through that time period they killed them in every fashion they had to sneak out and they had to be careful not to get caught and many of them would go out and just go out and confess and so forth and go out to the Gladiators and go into the lion's den or whatever and go into the arena and be killed in whatever way that it was just terrible then I think here we have it this nice huh I was thinking today brother I was thinking you know you know as good as God is every time God pours a blessing out on you it ought to cause you to praise him more [Music] give me more praise amen Glory the fruit of your lips giving praise to his name and all the people said [Applause] all right God is an awesome God and all the people said we have a great heavenly father and all the people said he's our beginning and he's the author and the finisher of our faith and all the people said Sophia he's spoken it so be it so that the way that you look at God and become him by accepting him into your heart amen how many knows when brother Bannon went beyond the curtain time what did he say it felt like what did it feel like what was it like well the thing that he came back and told us that you've got to have right in order to get there he says it'll take it was just absolute perfect love there there was not one little funny feeling between one or the other all of that was gone how many knows that that isn't just for there that's for here that you can be in a place to where you don't have any funny feelings towards anybody you've got that perfect love how many wants perfect love well you just raised your hand okay now if you don't have it and you want it yes God will test you on it he'll let I'll allow things to come you away to see whether you have perfect love or not now let me just I don't want to say lie a little but do you find out whether you have perfect love when everybody's patting you on the back and being real nice to you and being good to you that's not how you find out no you find out when you get crossed remember brother Brahm says rub the kitty kitty the wrong way you find out what that cat's really all about isn't that right no brother Brandon didn't say the holy spirit said that's pink awesome hello that's why he allowed them to do that he says rub that kitty cat the wrong way and he says he didn't or that cat s ambitious big eyes teeth showing that little cat became a monster folks that shouldn't be message people that might be those but that's not message people when brother bam came back he says you know it's not let me scratch your back and you scratch mine but a man says you know if they slap you or don't scratch your back at all scratch yours anyway huh come on folks but that's what it was like being in heaven amen now how many knows in order to be know what God is by looking at him and becoming him you can't really know what God is until you have him in here you can't know what heaven's like unless you have it here amen and we're not just going to go to heaven we already have Heaven here I got a few amens out of that one amen why because the Bible says you know he was raised up from the dead and he's in Heavenly places and then later on that chapter of Egypt says as in Europe right you've been raising you're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I'll be glad to be in Christ you are in God you can know the joy of the Lord you can know the peace of God you can know the rest of God you can know the power of God you can know the victory of God huh you know how many goddamn victory that's right the victory of God just like uh Miriam now she felt the victory when they had come over it on the other side of the uh the Red Sea and all the enemies were drunk would have felt good well let me tell you something that's the way with you and me when you overcome you experience the victory of God brother Branham actually makes a statement he says you are God's victory how many knows God's going to conquer over evil in this hour who is he conquering it through you and me you are his victory you're the ones that he's using to overcome in this hour phrase be to God I know it's a simple message but I enjoyed it when give it to me just to think about it if you look at him you still can't really know him until he comes down in here then you can really say well I know what it's like one place the Bible says no man can't call Jesus to Christ but by the Holy Ghost so you don't really know Jesus Christ unless you have the Holy Ghost then you know him you don't know the love of God unless you have the Holy Ghost inside of you you don't know peace of God unless you've got God on the inside mm-hmm how happy we should be to know that we are completely in his hands no matter what the future holds folks I'm not worried about our political system or our money system we know where it's going to end up at all in the Lake Fire but where are you going to be after that try to Fathom eternally or just a little bit he's given us eternal life more numbers that you can imagine in your mind more year numbers infinity and beyond Infinity right 100 trillion years I said because hold on folk you'll still be you'll still be enjoying God you'll still be enjoying that very peace that you got now you'll have that joy that you got now this is a good kind of test and I didn't do you really have the joy of the Lord here's a good one that comes to my mind if you drop dead right now it will change who you are and what you are you'd be exactly that on the other side if you'd be hateful and mean and unforgiving yet that's what you'd be on the other side you'd be somewhere else but if you've got the love of God in my heart huh what was it I believe brother Bannon was told one time that he was going to be lost and he's wrong you know off he's a false prophet or whatever he's not gonna make it he says you know he says and what did he say he came back and he says you know if that's what God wants me to be then that's what I want to be this is the way I feel about it that if God would cast me on here if he counts me off at the end he'd be rightfully to do so he says but I believe I would love him anyway I would love him he said if I feel if I feel like I do now huh I love him he loves him and if God cast me off I would be loving him he says I don't think you know God's not going to cast somebody like that in hell no because he loves him I was looking up this uh loving God trying to say the love of God is in our hearts you know he says the God has shed abroad in our hearts the love of God he has put God's love in our hearts and he was talking to the Pharisees he says I know your hearts he says that you do that you love not God he told them Pharisees they don't love God amen because how can you say you love God if you hate who he sends right he doesn't doesn't that's why people think well I can go to heaven without the messenger that he sent in this hour really how can you not love what God has done and what he sent if it's the truth amen praise be to God so Lord thank you Jesus for your grace thank you for your love thank you for letting us look at you and there is so much more that we'll learn Through the Ages that is come I'm gonna believe that there is so much more we could never understand you know his ways are past finding out you can look at and you could never figure out you don't even try to brother bam says don't even try to figure it out because we I was trying to think of the word on the way of how that we try to uh make everything uh figure it all out basically and and rationalize everything and and we got to have it up and all you just can't figure it out in this human mind this human mind can't comprehend it all but now you do comprehend the love of God the grace of God the joy of God the peace of God okay we don't understand how you can just say something and boom there it is huh everything comes from atoms it comes from the invisible day but those atoms and those inside those have to be created he just speaks it and there he is aren't you glad to be serving a God Like That amen hey that's my that's my foot you know I got prayed for the other day right I had this had this uh sting in my side which just felt like I should have a colonoscopy or something you know and find out what's going wrong hoping you probably should but you know to this day I'm trying to put a pain in there and then you just constant pain so I got prayed for that's all better now Grace be to God [Applause] but now he wants to do my foot bottom of my foot I've had a pain I've been cripping the whole week almost cramping and hurting and hurting laughing limping limping just nothing but praise me to God you know he's my healer amen I'm not worried about anything of one thing comes along he's take care of it amen I mean how many believes that that's the way it is in our life if you've got is your god whatever comes your way just commit it to him and trust him and go quit worrying about it anymore but the man says when you put sow a seed don't keep digging up every morning well is it growing in it did it come out of its shall you'll kill it that way well did God heal me don't worry about healed you just go on praising God act like it's already done yeah thank be to God how many loves him tonight amen praise be to God just to know him amen just to know him and the power of his resurrection Paul said you know I have counted everything but lost and I do count them but dumb that I may know him in the power of his resurrection a lot of power you might want to see but the main power that I want to see is that power that governs This Heart it controls his mind that guides this life folks that's the most powerful thing I know of amen how many wants more of it God bless you stand with me tonight musicians if you'll come
