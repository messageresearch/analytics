everybody be all right with next sunday morning amen getting our sunday school classes packed on all right amen and then also this coming fall i'd certainly like to have the our youth uh our youth it's not a banquet but meetings amen is everybody ready for that everybody want to do that all right all right we can see caught a few hands over here praise the lord so i think that'd be good amen i

praise the lord i just i'm tired waiting and i feel that we maybe should go ahead and do that amen and so i think the first weekend in september brother john right we have that youth meetings amen so we'll plan on doing that amen god bless you amen well how many had a good week how many's had a closer walk with the lord amen praise the lord i'll tell you what there's just something down in here amen amen that's something that's moving i believe amen and amen i'm thankful for that amen it's priceless so praise be to god this morning we want to talk about when the word drops from our head to our heart amen the difference between head religion and heart religion amen would that be okay and i want to speak about the rock little phrase uh if i might that little phrase that you've heard people make perhaps in a relationship or whatever it might be people will say well it's complicated amen so we're going to talk about is complicated for a while this morning also usually i come up here and say it's simple you know it's just simple you know but this morning we're going to talk about the complicated part is that okay amen praise be to god amen god bless you if you will open your bibles this morning amen and we'll just get into the word let god have his way amen i'll tell you what you know when wednesday night service when the lord just showed me how that you know that it's on our lap and how that really it's up to us to open up our hearts and our minds except what god has done already amen amen and so but it does have to go further than just our head how many knows that is much further than just our head knowledge or accept it again to our mind it also has to drop down into your heart otherwise it will never do you what it's supposed to do amen and so we'll start out with complication part amen and that is in matthew the 13th amen matthew 13 amen and the kingdom of heaven now how many knows that when jesus mentioned to kingdom of heaven i didn't really uh go into it but i see another scripture here here's another one here uh you know i just look at this matthew here and we're going to be dealing dealing with matthew quite a bit but let's just go uh you know to um verse 44 of chapter 13. i see another one here i'm just going to read those four to because we want to talk about the likening how did jesus christ likened the kingdom of heaven to many different things somebody knows that not just one but many different things one of them is in verse 44. the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a treasure hid in the field all right down in verse 31 he says he put a pup put forth a parable for saying the kingdom of heaven is liking a grain of mustard seed which you man took and sowed over in verse 24 if you're chapter 13. now you got to kind of follow me here but here again he talks about the kingdom of heaven in verse 24. and he put it forth another parable saying the kingdom of heaven is like and unto a man which sowed good seed in his field amen and of course we know that's just a few of them what i want to deal with this morning with the help of the lord is found in chapter 13 and verse 47. same chapter down in verse 7 47 and we want to start there and just read a couple of verses there and we'll go from there again the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered of every kind how many know this is where it gets complicated not just one kind or two kinds how many knows there's more than just one kind or two kinds and then there's more kinds than just that but of every kind all right and was cast until all right and gather the very kind verse 48 which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad way and so shall it be at the end of the world the angels will come forth and sever the wicked from among the just may god had his blessings to the reagan word you can be seated this morning amen so here we look at first of all we look at this we see that there's a lot of different kinds amen that is caught in the net of the gospel amen it just comes to mind that whenever jesus preached and it talks about the multitudes followed him isn't that right multitudes followed jesus and then they they followed him and they got him out there and in the wilderness so to speak or out you know where they didn't have you know a nice restaurant to take everybody or whatever and they got in a pickle jesus got his congregation in a pickle all right they didn't have any food isn't that right and they said jesus we got a problem here we ain't got nothing to feed the people [Laughter] amen are you with me this morning how many knows you can't get jesus in a pickle ah he always comes out of it right amen whenever you're following jesus you ain't got to worry about getting in a bind oh you'll get in a bind no doubt but you've got one that'll get you out of the vine that's the good thing about following christ and there's a whole difference between amen the believer and the unbeliever amen because the believer has the same troubles that the unbeliever has but the believer has somebody that'll get him out of trouble that's so good isn't it that's what gives us joy amen i don't care i don't care what it is that's right all right no matter where whether it's financial spiritual whatever it is god always can get you out now you know you know you you know it's complicated but you got to understand god's ways that sometimes it don't seem like he gets you out of it like he don't answer your prayers like you pray and pray and pray and pray and pray he just don't answer it seems like brother bram said isn't that right you know and he is that's when he's testing your faith to see whether you really believe it or not in that right because that's truly when we find out whether you believe it or not if he tests you like that so he got him in the mind so to speak and and of course you know that's when the great miracle was done amen about the little boy with the fishes and the loaves and how that took many many baskets up after he was done with amen and then if you'll notice if you're reading the scriptures you'll find that jesus went somewhere else and a lot of different ones followed him to where he was at even over there isn't that right and jesus was a little mean jesus got a little mean and what did he say he says he didn't follow me because of the miracles but you followed me because of the loaves and the fishes sting huh that's right he said you're just after you're just coming after because of the loaves and the fishes and so forth and so unfortunately that's why some people follow him it's just the blessing of it not really dedicated because whenever he begin to say unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you from that point all of those folks begin to wander away begin to drift away amen and so that was like that net that he was talking about it catches all kinds of people it catches all kinds of people that's right we know there's three different kinds of believers there's believers there's make believers and there's unbelievers and we know that there's another category of uh the make believers that they're also hypocrites and that right pharisees and so forth they're hypocrites there's the class of being wolves in sheep's clothes amen is it complicated yeah it's kind of complicated you have to watch it because i'll tell you this right now as you amen get caught with the gospel net and you come into amen to the saving grace of almighty god you're gonna find that uh it's not just everybody that names the name of jesus is really a christian i'll tell you what right now if hypocrites and so-called believers can throw you off you're fixing to get thrown off [Music] because there's plenty of them around amen but you know the one thing i will say about this is i even begin to get into it that sooner or later you show what you are by the fruit that you bear your folly sooner or later is made manifest it'll be made manifest just as janus and jamboree's folly was made manifest so all make believers and unbelievers and so forth sooner or later do you manifest what you are praise the lord and that's what it's all about it's about what you read out in here to him that have for him shall be given unto him that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he does have you've got to have something down in here amen it's got to be down here not just up here because so many have it up here people have it intellectually they understand that they can quote you the quotes but it's not down here and it doesn't matter how much they try it doesn't matter what they do they end up not being able to live it amen because you're going to live what's down in here you're going to follow that nature amen and we realize that this next gospel net amen we could say that it was the gospel of this message amen sister angie god bless you it's good to see you this morning amen we're praying for adam amen in this gospel net amen this message and it catches every kind amen and me my wife was talking we were thinking about how that there's so many amen that can absolutely listen to the tapes and they can hear jesus come down and to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart amen knowing that that is god almighty doing that and they can be raised in that and have their mom and dad teach them all the jews and adults and everything about the word of god they can teach all of that but never get it down here and i can name you names of people that even came to this church that went out there and became lesbians that's right attended this church for a long time folks you might think oh that's way out there folks you don't realize that if you get it just in here and it don't come down here ain't nothing going to hold you it's not enough even the prophet talked about moses his mama had taught him and taught him and taught him and taught him and he tried to go upon what his mama taught him and he killed that egyptian and he ended up a complete and total failure why because he was head knowledge and not a personal experience with almighty god how many know god don't have grandchildren amen you can't go by somebody else's experience you can't go by what the preacher says it has to be your revelation a personal experience to you your mom and daddy they teach you and that's good they should amen but i'm here to tell you if it doesn't something happen somewhere in your teenage life you get a backside of the desert and you meet god amen and he changes your nature he changes your desires amen he baptizes you with the baptism of the holy ghost there ain't a thing in the world that'll hold you amen you'll wiggle back out into the ocean amen it's complicated so you see folks there's all kinds even jesus said when he said about the sower that went forth the soul the word of god is that right it was complicated some fell on stony places some did this some did that some did did some did that not always so simple amen he said it this way hear you the parable of the sower when one hear the word of god of the kingdom he understandeth it not now notice how many knows that understand is something that you do with your heart not just your head amen then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart and this is he which receives seed by the wayside but he that receiveth heat on stony places the same is he that heareth the word and annoy with joy receiveth it i don't know i've seen it i'm lived long enough now to have seen where people can rejoice and shout and witness and testify oh my and die and before they die they have strayed so far out into the world again that they say there is no such thing as a christian amen folks it may be that there's just a few real christians but i believe there's christians amen and if you're looking for a perfect christian never make a mistake well guess what your eyes are going to get real sore looking because we all make mistakes don't we amen we're mistakes but we hate our mistakes we repent of our mistakes isn't that right but we do make them amen and so you got to be careful what you look at because you think it's not so simple mean he that per that person was no doubt not perfect but with another man somebody that would reach out and oh just try to share the message try to get people to christ is that right then eventually go off way off into the field amen and have to die such a terrible thing i think the believer has to make sure that he understands these complicated things a christian has to understand these complications amen a complication like matthew 4 24 24 all right it's complicated for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible it would deceive the very elect come on folks now we understand through the prophet of god that that christ is the holy spirit so false anointed ones isn't that right people can get anointed on the flesh they can get anointed on the spirit they can shout they can speak in tongues they can prophesy they can even do miracles things like that when they get over there the bible says that heaven we have cast out devils and then your name and done many mighty works he don't deny that they did it and they're right he don't deny that because he was perhaps just on their flesh or in their spirit but it's got to get deeper than that you know right yeah it's complicated people you think oh he's a real spiritual person that person's real spiritual person amen and we like to see that in each other i believe a real christian will be a spiritual person but see folks how many knows that it's an endurance contest he that endureth unto the end it's about getting a hold of something in our age young people listen i got a hold of it or god it got a hold of me i like to put it that way let something get ahold of you because when that something gets ahold of you it will seal you until the day of your redemption amen it might look like no there's no such a thing as eternal security there's no such thing as salvation once once saved always saved huh jesus said when all that the father has given me will come and i will lose none of them he didn't say i'm gonna lose a few huh if he is gonna lose a few he's gonna let you know huh he says haven't i chosen you twelve and one of you is the devil and you're gonna betray me yeah you're going to be gone but he already knows that and he came up to the place of justification come up to the place of sanctification but never went on to the baptism in the holy ghost he couldn't go on amen so you got to make sure that it's not just on your flesh a good sunday morning hallelujah dance in the spirit kind of service not just something that cleans you out and gets his eyes of the world away and makes you a new person but you've got to make sure that that gets filled with the holy ghost down in your soul down in your nature though you would want to walk away from it god won't let you walk away amen you might want to fall but god won't let you fall praise be to god what did brother brown say after he lost his wife and his child and god put a black blanket and refused to hear his prayer and the devil said you know god doesn't really love you and he was about to think amen if that's how god's gonna be but he didn't say it he says god you gave you taken away blessed be the name of the lord his doctor friend says hey did you keep your religion brother adam he says no but it helped me we're living in that time folks when everything around us is shifting sands we don't know what in the world is going to come up next we don't know which way these things going to shift next do we folks sometimes i want to go to help tap fox news i still watch the news sometimes but i says no i ain't worse than that i ain't getting depressed no that's all i don't have to know what's going on why because i may know the more oh boy here we go are you ready for this let's message folks got it all up in it you're all up in this politics and i know we're in parsley and we care about our country we care about where we live isn't that right amen even the prophet says certain things but listen those things amen if you get your eyes on those things it'll depress you it'll take you down but we don't have our eyes on these shifting hands folks with my eye on the world and the way that it's going we know it's got to go that way i don't know i'll go ahead and do it i know y'all can't see this up here but me and my wife we went to lowe's he's not lowe's but smith over in smith springfield and uh we went and got some more of these rocks how you all like them rocks out there pretty good and we was loading those rocks and the guy come walking up the street come walking up the street i'll be honest with you this is not to make fun of the person but i'm telling you what people need god this guy needs god and it was i thought why does he work here is he going to live in the truck what's going on but he went by and i said sir i don't know you might not think i should have but i said can i take a picture and i thought this was only in california in los angeles yeah that's what we're going with shifting sands look at that and caleb done seen it he thought i only fought you know on his fingers you look up close you find evil evil i thought lord and this isn't suicide we go down here by elkton and two girls walking down the street holding hands in our little town folks this place is certainly corrupt it's getting worse and worse isn't it but lord we don't look at that and i look at that man and i think that's some mom's boy that's some mom's boy that needs the lord jesus christ that needs to know what real joy is huh think about it he's a soul amen and i you know outside of the blasphemy of the holy ghost you wouldn't what if you were your son got in that condition you think about even around the message folks you know becoming lesbian different things you know you just feel so bad you're like why why and it's only one reason that's because of the grace of god that is in your heart that you aren't looking like that that we aren't acting like that it's only the mercy and grace of god i'm saying god thank you lord jesus and help these poor people as the prophet said they're objects of pity you pity them they try to have some kind of joy and they can't find it it's not out there amen but there's all kinds listen all kinds and even jesus said and i don't think i finished let me can i read this but here uh so we find matthew 24 there of course that's where he says you know that it would if it was possible it would deceive the very elected amen back to the seed but he that receiveth the seed in stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anoint with joy receiveth it yet hath not root in himself i mean please that's where it's at it's about what's down in there way down what kind of roots that you have you see people and you want to say why why can't they see it why can't why can't people just know that surrendering to the lord jesus christ it's the best thing you'll ever do get baptized in his name give your heart to god and i'll tell you what life is gonna be good oh i don't care if it's troubles trials i don't care what comes along it's still good but you have god in your heart to know that there's something that holds you an anchor that holds you when we talk about what that anchor is how many knows what that anchor is amen all right now notice and he had earth for a while for when tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended so jesus talking about this net in heaven the gospel net that catches every kind amen by and by he is offended by and by he wiggles back out and he also which received seed among the thorns is he which heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choked the word and he becometh unfruitful you know as a christian as a christian i think your worst worry is that you just have no fruit in claiming that you're christian amen i have a scripture that just comes to mind i don't have this wrote down but i'm going to go to it if i can just for a minute is that okay in second peter in verse chapter 1 in verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ amen but he that lacketh thee things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins amen so he says there that we make sure if these things be in you they make you that you are bound and that you're not unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ amen moses i want to use moses as an example for just a minute there was two parts to moses one of them was and i heard about the man said he says you know moses he tried to do things just upon what his mom had told him what he knew mentally what his mom told him no doubt but his mom told him now son because i'm gonna know is that he got to be raised by his own mother pharaoh's daughter and he know that she told him that you were born a proper child there was something special at your birth that took place and we knew that god had a purpose for you and god revealed to us that we're to put you in this little basket and then we'll put you in the nile river among the crocodiles amen if we trusted god he's going to take care of you amen and sure enough you floated right down by the palace amen and the current took you in in one of the little backwashes perhaps and uh pharaoh's daughter wanted a little boy wanted a child and she seen that little baby and she went out there and grabbed that little baby and it was you and they went to israel and they began to ask and for a wet mother amen and i volunteered and i got to raise yours and i want you to know god has a plan for you oh he knew all of this that he was called and he believed that he was supposed to be the deliverer and he did it with his own carnal self now how many know the complication of amen even the gospel is is there's always a spiritual believer and there's always a carnal believer amen by the bible says every revival produces twins oh my wife it gets complicated every revival produces twins there's always a person that just understands it naturally and that there's a person that has it down in their heart and in their soul amen oh my and every revival moses naturally understood it amen and he became a complete failure he completely failed amen by his natural senses and by his own ability his own thoughts how many thankful for the grace of all almighty god because if you know him on a spiritual level on a spiritual basis it's not something amen that flesh and blood has revealed to you but it's something that you've had a personal experience with almighty god and upon this rock i'll build my church i mean that's a rock that every individual we as christians have to make sure that our soul has been anchored to everything's shifting there's all kinds there's all different things but there's also a rock that our souls can anchor to if it ever anchors are you are looking at a living testimony of when a soul that is anchored in christ that anchor holds it's that anchor holding it's not you holding it's him holding amen how many is thankful for that we're going to talk about moses other side here in a minute but in matthew 16 a familiar very familiar scripture for us 16 and verse 13 jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying who men who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some of them say that thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah or one of the prophets amen he saith them with whom do ye say that i am amen and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god remember peter had a revelation of who jesus was and when all those two all those other disciples left him 70 of them and he says are you all gonna go away too he had a revelation to whom shall we go is that right he had something that held him in there right held him in that time amen all right he said peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven amen how many knows that was listen and he says and i say unto you that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now the catholics say that peter was the rock it took a prophet of god in this generation saying that peter was no rock he forsook him and denied him three times that's not a whole lot of a rock and they're right he had the keys to the kingdom sure he did but it wasn't this at all it took his profit to pull out the fact that flesh and blood had not revealed this to him amen it was the revelation of who jesus christ was and how many knows that anybody ever come in contact with jesus you can never be the same again you'll either be worse and i don't mean just a little bird worse but you'll be a lot worse because you reject him like the rich man did or you accept him into your heart and he changes you forever amen and when you get a revelation a revelation is when god makes himself known to you personally what did that prophet teach us that the bible amen and salvation and god deals with the gentiles as a what individual as an individual he deals with even though we're a group of here and there's certain laws certain things that affects everybody and so forth but when it comes to dealing with people god deals with every one of us individually that's why you can have a service and you're bored stiff but the next person will come and say that's the best best message i ever heard it just spoke right to my heart thank you brother huh you know and it can be that way because it just depends who god is dealing with because god deals with each one each one of us is as an individual and i want you to know that you can't be on geek god don't have any grandchildren that's a second hand experience it don't do it won't work you can't go by a second-hand experience and listen how many knows that we need a daily experience with god daily experience yes some people well tell me what the lord's done for you well i tell you what 20 years ago 15 years ago he did this he healed me he healed my uncle a man or whatever it is you know 20 years ago that's wonderful but tell me something yesterday he spoke to me and said this or he showed me this or he showed me that i want you to know that yesterday's experience is no good for today amen how many knows you know we go well when's the last time you pray well two weeks ago i thought that i prayed lord i'm praying here now amen and i'm going to make this good for the month does it work that way no every day you pray every day you have that relationship it has to be a personal experience praise be to god flesh and blood so revelation how many knows we all know what the prophet said about revelation amen that can never be over emphasized we need revelation in our lives we know the truth of the word we know i understand the word but in the reality of it isn't real to people i don't know about you but i believe that one of these days when our bodies change when we begin to see our loved ones and loved ones up here and so forth i want to be in tune to be able to see them i want that to be revealed to me so that i can take a body change i want that body change to be a revelation amen even faith is a revelation something that god reveals to you a personal experience with god and i believe that this is the this is the uh kind of the hardcore of it that is that it is divinely given amen how many knows it's divinely given i'll show you how many members brother bam saying he says that the man told him that uh he said you know well i don't accept revelation he said then there ain't no way god forever to deal with you because that's the only way that god deals with you is by revelation by revealing himself to you amen in matthew chapter 11 and verse 25 at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid thee things from the wise and the prudent amen so how many knows if you're resting upon your wisdom or your prudence you're probably resting on the wrong thing now you're resting on what god shows you and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father i believe he also says you can't even know god then there's no way for you to know god if you don't believe in revelation no man knoweth the son but the father needed knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whom the son will reveal him amen somebody knows you can't really know nobody it can't be called a called uh call jesus a curse so far speaking by the holy ghost and no man can call to jesus to christ but by the holy ghost you might say i know him folks if you don't have that done in your heart you don't know him at all you know him by this down in here amen so he says you know he hid him from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes such as would learn isn't it something how that jesus in his time could heal the sick raise the dead and i just listened to it yesterday listening to the bible where that young man came and told them pharisees you know here's a man that opened my eyes my blind eye and you're the spiritual leaders and you don't know from where he is in other words you don't sound like you're doing your job you're supposed to understand where he's from because they would boldly set him we don't know where he's from he says well isn't this a marvelous thing you don't know where he's from so people amen unless god showed him and revealed it to him they couldn't see him amen let's talk about another kind of people for just a minute let's talk about the uh we know the unbelievers is just like what i showed you just nothing about god just pure evil just serving the devil unbelievers right but you know there's a kind that's a make-believer now a make-believer that's where it gets complicated that's where you know sometimes you boys sure looks like they're a believer they kind of act like a believer they dress like a believer but what's way down in here amen oh when i think about this about how that a real genuine believer needs to be able to be able to detect and see what's coming at him because if you aren't you're going to be deceived and you're going to be deceived you have to that's why that's why you want to you want to how many knows you want a preacher huh you'll be able to tell if i preach the truth or not you'll know whether it's a bride material whether it's the truth or not amen but you look at the pharisees and how that they were and they were make believers and they loved they loved to be a hypocrite they didn't it didn't bother them being a hypocrite how many in here know that there's some things in your life that's hypocritical that's right and what does it do to you it bothers you it makes you get on your knees and say god take this away from me if i live like this it's going to be a bad reflection on you lord forgive me take it away that's what you and i do with our faults our failures and so forth but these guys they were completely content being a hypocrite and the outside of these guys and then jesus say be careful amen beware of people that come to you in wolves that are wolves coming to you in sheep's clothes and so forth be careful because in this world how many knows there's wolves there's sheep and then there's wolves and sheep's closed that's where it gets complicated amen because you realize hey you know it looks like a sheep huh for us turkey hunters we know what it's like to take a turkey tail up in front of our face it never worked for me i put that turkey tail up there and they right tail it the thing i can do is hide behind a fence in some bushes but anyway you know they put that in front of them these people have no problem putting on his sheep clothes amen and the beaver jesus said look on the outside you guys look good you enlarge the borders of your garment you look holy huh on the outside but on the inside it's a different story it's complicated they're full of and then what he's typing with he says you're like a sepulcher where on the outside it appears beautiful now i don't know i guess this upper curve would be the graveyard or grave whatever but for me it would be your casket how many knows that whenever y'all put when we put people in the car i ain't going to say when y'all put me in there i don't want to be in there but when you put people in there you can stripe it with gold and put flowers and eyes so beautiful that is a beautiful casket such a beautiful casket such a nice casket yeah but he got nothing but a dead man in it and he said that's what the pharisees were on the outside they appeared holy and righteous and oh my they said long prayers and prayers and mind it just you know appeared so holy but he says inside you're a different story you're not what you claim to be amen you're full of dead men's bones another place he said full of extortion and hypocrisy and so forth extortion and evil and wicked hello we can come into the house of god and praise be to god and so forth it's complicated the crow can come into church and amen preacher and go out there and feed on a carrion get out there in the things of the world and they're right they can eat it in both but the dove comes in here says praise the lord preach it motherbowler huh but when it goes out there it can't feed on the dead things it has to have seed to feed on praise the lord oh my when you think about that amen because why it is a something on the inside here that takes place we're taught that there's three different anointings one's flesh one spirit one soul amen and i believe it is in souls in prison now but the ban brought it out how that and it's very it's almost hard to believe brother ken but people can actually do miracles they can actually do miracles in the spirit even the bible says isn't that right men done many wonderful works but yet down on the inside they were false christ false anointed ones amen but how is their folly made manifest how do you know give it some time how many usually time will tell just just be patient just wait just wait wait wait be patient because a crow cannot follow an eagle is that right a hawk cannot follow where eagle goes they go so far up what did the prophet say that they would do if they go that high disintegrate that's exactly right they would disintegrate amen if they went there i say that if they try to follow a believer they will fail they will fail to be able to because you try to be a christian amen and i'll tell you what when somebody smites you on the cheek we'll find out if you can turn the other we'll see if you can go the extra mile well see if you can pers i mean pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you i'm here to tell you if you make believer if you're a hypocrite you'll be doing the persecuting of the real spiritual believer you'll do everything in your power to destroy the believer it's in your nature you can't help it that's what a meek believer will do that's what a hypocrite will do try to destroy you he'll come and try to discourage you he'll try to do things that stumble you amen remember in israel it was always that kind it meant always the kind of a spiritual side and then there was this natural side amen so a believer climbs high a make-believer can only go so far and his folly is made manifest lord help us how many beliefs we need to still be looking at our fruit see what kind of fruit we're bearing because it tells us who we are praise be to god i believe it was pharaoh right fellow pharaoh it says how does it say it i can't say it exactly but a saying to go and do as the israelites did going through the red sea how many nose was destroyed he thought hey they're spiritual they can go through these well i can too that was his mistake no that water was parted not for the egyptians it was parted for israel and when they thought they could do the same thing isn't that right that's where janice and jamboree's that's where their folly was made manifest when they begin to make snakes also and they're right sure they did but what happened to him there's got to eat no [Laughter] oh if pharaoh would have been smart right what should pharaoh have done after he's seen them other guys as snakes get eaten i'll tell you what he should have done he said yeah you're right moses you win i better let him go but he didn't did he and he cost him his army all washed away cost him all that because of that i mean it was the seven sons of sea but they also tried to follow somebody a real believer they seen paul cast out devils to do all these things and they come up into somebody's house they were going to kick out some devils i cast you out in the name of jesus christ whom paul preaches even use jesus name i believe whom paul preaches a second hand experience young people all of us a second hand experience isn't going to do you any good it's not going to work for you what happened to them they've got all tore up bloody bleeding stripped of their clothes them devils got out there and said hey you know what i need to go back to the altar and i need to get a personal experience with my god amen a personal anchor amen in an anchor or god comes into your heart he changes you and you're never the same again and then you go out and say the name of jesus christ not stop what somebody else says amen oh my how many believes we just need a closer walk we need to amen listen to that still small voice that's on the inside and have a personal relationship i truly believe this that god is looking for us to amen to have a daily i want to say this a daily revelation because there's nothing that will make you any stronger that'll give you more strength than when god is personally showing himself and revealing himself to you on a daily basis how many knows that when you go to looking for a wife or a husband it has to be something that got absolutely reveals to you and that you know that it's absolutely god yeah you want to know the same way with the church how many folks let me tell you something when you choose a church that you want to go to i believe it needs to be a revelation hey i believe that this church is of god this is where he wants me there's lots of churches that's of god and they're right but where does god want you that way you can sit there and you can know no matter what comes or what goes you are where you need to be amen and then there's nothing that can move you what is it it's not me telling you not your parents telling not somebody else pulling you but something that you know something that god tells you because i truly believe this morning this will be my final final comments and that is that god is wanting to have a deeper relationship with each and every one of us he wants to speak to us daily i believe he has a desire to have fellowship with every one of us but if we aren't careful we can't hear that still small voice folks i have learned that in searching for a message and so forth amen i'm not looking for a great thunderclap no but i find that what god gives me most of the time is during the week but i've been meditating meditating upon him amen it'll be that still small voice it's that little something that he touches you and tells you and shows you amen and then i pray about that and if god wants to speak me to speak on that amen he'll begin to pour it out and pour it out and pour it out not it just goes nowhere i've had many of them that was dead shut up but others where god begins to say yes that's what i want you to speak on amen but i have to learn to listen to that still small voice amen how many knows that how to get revelation revelation comes by getting in the spirit i believe that god we would hear god's voice to us in every this is real personal now in every one of our lives if we would be in the spirit more we would pray more like brother bob says you got to pray you got to read find it upon your bed post the bible says when you go to bed at night be listening to it when you get up in the morning and during the day wherever you are always have god on your mind all right and god in that time frame he'll speak to you he'll talk to you amen and you'll understand better and everything that you need to do and you'll need to you'll know how to do it a lot better amen because god will lead you and guide you with that still small voice and it'll give you anchor how many thankful for that anchor i said the last thing but think about moses afterwards how many knows when moses had that experience on the back side of the desert that right when he met that burning bush when he met god and brother-in-law says thomas byler does not have any right but the brad powell doesn't have any right behind this pulpit and left and met that god on the back side of the desert no not not literally all right because there's no desert around here but we all understand that somewhere in your life you come in contact with god amen and there isn't a man that convinces you different men can't talk you out of it they can't persuade you out of it they can't persecute you out of it you know that you met god and there isn't enough devils in hell that will ever shake you from that young people you need that more than anything in this world it's for god to have a you've got to come and give you an experience with him that it's going to be the rock upon that the whole church is built and it says the gates of hell all of hell will be against you but they will what not prevail against you without that revelation god the devil will prevail against you amen so god bless you this morning amen we're very thankful this morning amen we had to fill the baptismal back up again this morning and amen brother david advised me and and said well maybe we'll just keep the baptismal open for a few weeks so we'll do that amen but anyway so we're very thankful for sister bethany right bethany wants to be baptized this morning amen so we're real happy for her amen praise be to god i believe whenever a sinner comes to the lord gives heart to the lord the angels rejoice let's rejoice praise and say praise be to god hallelujah amen it is always a great joy to bury somebody in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and see the hearts amen be given to the lord amen and i'll tell you this right now it is the best choice best decision that you'll ever make in your whole life you can make no greater choice than to give your heart and your life to god unreservedly amen amen because you are his then and he is yours amen so god bless you this morning musicians if you come up we'll change the order to service stand with me if you will i'm going to read a scripture and then sister debbie you can take bethany back here in this back room then get ready let's read the well i read that this morning let me see if i still have it yes upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the next thing he says and i will give thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven we believe that's acts 2 and 38 don't you when peter was preaching amen after he preached to israel he had the keys to the kingdom he says in verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do amen then peter said unto them i have the keys to the kingdom of heaven amen so to speak repent every one of you how many believes that's the number one thing there is to repent from your sins turn around and be baptized to every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and he shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is to you and to your children to them that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen god bless you this morning you can be standing i'll let brother david see you if
