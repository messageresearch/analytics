anxiety and depression and we went to a a sales conference about a week ago up in Philadelphia a man Ray's asked the people to raise their hands how many dealt with anxiety and so many different ones raised their hand I began to realize that is the tactic of the devil is to put anxiety and fear and depression on the people and they don't know where to go and where to turn but I believe God's people are free tonight I believe God's people have a right to be free they have a right to not be under anxiety and a spirit of the devil and under depression but God's people can be set free denied

to your way how many feels that way tonight God bless you again nice to be in the service of the Lord tonight we want to take our Bible if we could quickly to in turn if you would to for Samuel chapter 12 First Samuel chapter 12 certainly appreciate all the songs how come that my daughter-in-law hasn't seen yet are you going to don't know she sings so tomorrow y'all can get her to sing and then this boiled one hand Zachariah he sings as well I'll start telling on all of them there's Abigail sings so I'm at home so it would hurt them to sing too so do something for the Lord I called my son one of my song leaders um I was going to miss church tomorrow he has to go out of town and so he said can you get somebody to Elite song service I called my son Jeremiah and Mama asked him said daddy wants to know if you'll lead song service he I listened to him as he's talking to her he's him hauling around pause and pause and pause and pause and well I really don't want to Tim said forget it I said um I'll get somebody else I said if I'd ask him go golfing he said sure when you want to go I said when it comes to do something for the Lord they get nervous and get scared and I said but you know that's what you you called upon to do something for God it's an honor to be able to do something for the Lord so I called it text another young man to church so how do you like the lead song oh absolutely so I said okay then you lead song service amen first Samuel chapter 12 if you have your Bibles I want to read verses 1 to 5. and then I'd like to read Galatians 6. you know I I said this I had six Sons and one daughter and people ask me all the time ever since I was young they would ask me um any of your boys called to preach I said how am I supposed to know daddy don't call Sons to preach I said I don't know if they're called to preach out between them and God I said if it's up to me I'd never call them to preach said really I said no I said man I know what I've been through I said I don't want them to have to go through the same thing I said if man's caught of God that's up to God to tell him if he's called to preach none of my sons ever showed any uh like sort of an interest into the ministry or feel like the Lord's called him until about four months ago Zechariah came to me and told me he felt like there was a call of God on his life so I said well son that's what you do if you feel that way you pray and you just stay before God and you read your Bible and you just stay right there and I said if it's there God will burn your heart with something and it'll be like fire shut up in your bones amen but if I call him then there's a lot of trouble for him down the road if God calls him and the lord always takes care of those whom he calls amen so we do appreciate God calling young preachers I first started when I was 13 years old started preaching first time I ever preached was 13 years old preaching in a church that was about just the size of these pews here preacher asked me to come down and preach and I knew it was called as a young man and and he asked me to come and preach and I said sir I can't even drive I said my brother my oldest brother will drive me so my brother Chuck drove me all the way down about 40 miles from where we lived and I went down to preach on a Sunday night to the youth and I preached my first sermon was about I don't know maybe 10 to 15 minutes is all it was and I preached on faith it was such a powerful message because I preached on how Moses built the ark some some old lady said on the front row and I kept hearing her while I preached going no and I was like what is she talking about not preaching longer how Moses God spoke to him to build that art and he did it by faith every time I'd say Moses she'd go no at the end of my message I finally figured out what she was saying I said have I been preaching Moses she said yeah it's not Moses son it's Noah so you got to start somewhere amen so we appreciate the Lord for God still calling people that means he's not done yet amen if God calls you just to bring one and bring him to maturity you've done a lot for the kingdom of God Amen SEC first Samuel chapter 12 beginning with verse 1. and Samuel said unto all of Israel behold I have hearkened unto your voice and all that you said unto me and have made a king over you and now behold the king walketh before you and I am old and gray-headed behold my sons are with you and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day now that would seem like a a great scene but to be honest with you the old man had come to a place where God had used him to be their Prophet really to be their king and leader and priest and judge and all of those things but they got their eyes on the other nations and they wanted to be like the other nations and they wanted a king God told Samuel one day he said Samuel Samuel was weeping he said look they've not rejected you they have rejected me from ruling over them give the people what they want and God gave them Saul and he said this behold here I am Witness against me before the Lord before his anointed whose ox have I taken whose house have I taken and whom have I defrauded think about this whom have I oppressed or whose hand have I received any bribe to Blind my eyes there with and I will restore it to you in you and they said thou Hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hath thou taken art of any man's hand he said unto them the Lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this today that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is Witness turned me again to verse two if you would and it says behold the king walketh before you and I am old and gray-headed and hold my sons are with you and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day terminally Galatians chapter six if you would I'd like to read from verse six and misread through verse 10 and then I'll let you take your seats Galatians chapter 6. beginning with verse 6. the Apostle Paul was writing he said let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things be not deceived God is Not mocked but whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall love the spirit reap life Everlasting what a wonderful promise let us not be weary in well-doing for induces and we shall reap if we faint not and as he have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are the household of faith I want to speak tonight if I could for a few minutes and I'm trying to direct my thoughts mainly to our young people but it may feel like it's across the board but this is some of the things that's upon my heart and I'd like to speak as a title if I was going to put a thought in your mind it would be sowing and reaping but really my background thought would be um that you'd live such a life that you wouldn't be haunted from the decisions that you make from childhood let's power his father or the great privilege it is tonight to be in your presence Lord and I thought today every person that would be here tonight it's your ordination his service was predestinated from the foundation of the world and Lord of just one person life has changed it would be worth every effort that we have made Lord we come now to speak upon your holy blessed word means more than life to us father as we broke the bread now we've read from its Pages we're asking you to come and break the bread of life to us may you speak to every heart help every individual Lord you know what we have need of Father you know what's upon my heart May Minister grace to the hearers tonight May lives be changed may we leave this place closer to you than what we were when we come in and we'll give you praise for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the whole church says amen God bless you you may be seated sister Claire that young man they mentioned Trevor was that the one that you brought forth last night so they're taking him off the is in a positive good way that's wonderful praise the Lord he's still the same yesterday today and forever isn't he in our text tonight we read of an age prophet a gray-haired old man who stands before Israel the whole nation and he looks at every man every woman every boy and there were some in that crowd that had watched him from a child witness life as he came through as a little boy in the temple watched him come developed into maybe what we would say a teenage seen him come into a married life and a little bit older and come into His more adult years and then watched him come all the way into his old age seen his hair grow come from a little maybe we would say a little black-headed boy a little brown-headed boy and come on up and watched his hair change colors and see him stand there as a gray-headed old man and he looks at the whole audience the nation said you have watched me ever since I was a child and I want anybody that's among you that's ever heard me say anything that was not right according to the word of God I want you to stand up now and if I've defrauded you if I've done anything that I shouldn't have done you tell me and I'll make it right before you now and all the nations spoke back just to think about what they spoke back said Samuel you're right not everybody could say this and watched him as he's older but there was some in that crowd maybe was his age that come up with him some may be a little older that watched him and seen his life from a childhood all the way up said you're right we've watched you as a child we watched you develop we watched you age and we have never seen nor heard anything out of you that was not right when I think of that I think of what a powerful testimony that is that it wasn't after he got old that he decided to do the right things he started out as a child and as a child he developed up into becoming an age man in his entire life was spent to try to please one person and that was the one that called him all Mighty God now think what a testimony that he had to stand there before that crowd really is almost at times a sinful nation and yet he was never caught up in their sin I'm sure he saw a lot of bribery saw a lot of compromise that took place but yet in the midst and I'll prove it to you in a minute but it's the midst of all of it he stayed true to God even as a child all the way up to an old man never compromised on the principles that God placed within his life that's a powerful testimony for somebody to have and I'm sure tonight if you're here that would be your desire too that you would never compromise on the principles and the convictions that God has placed in your life he carried a testimony that he pleased the Lord for a few minutes tonight I'd like to introduce a couple of principles to you young people to think about it's things that I have used as a guide throughout my life and this was one of the pre principles that life is not a chalkboard life is not a chalkboard what that means that you don't simply erase the mistakes and the failures and start all over again [Applause] why why is that because here's the facts you can do some things that while you're young that you certainly can be forgiven of by the grace of God but you'll have to live with those things the rest of your life don't misunderstand me because I'm a firm preacher that God is a forgiving God doesn't matter in fact if he wasn't we might as well walk out these doors get in our cars and go home tonight because none of us got no hope if God wasn't a forgiving God that's a fact he is a forgiving God and that's the reason we're here and we read last night and spoke of how he's a god of mercy and not just the god of Mercy he's a god who's rich in Mercy Hallelujah and though we're sins blessing closely now may be washed away that's a fact but if we do things while we're young God can forgive us of those things but if we're not careful they will bear scars in our life that we will carry to the graveyard not my health when even as a boy I didn't look at my mother and father as legalism as law but I looked at them as God's voice to me when I couldn't hear God I knew that them parents was placed over me as God's instruction to me I used to get up so upset at my mother and I didn't understand I had an older brother that really made me mad because it come time for the school and the school would have these dances and my brother and I would like to go and really what met we would dance because we was too embarrassed to do that but we want to just kind of be around our friends and I had a little Praying Mother that she wouldn't she'd always tell us no you're not going to those things at that time they started out all this bright dancing stuff you know looking like their bodies are breaking down spinning around and I had a mother that refused to let us go and I used to say I wish so and so was my mama I'd say something like that and some of the boy I spoke about last night that's been in prison all these years I was talking about his mama look where he's at today look at the mother I had look where I'm at tonight you say it's not because of that yes it is I had got the influence upon my life and when I couldn't recognize God and I couldn't hear him for myself my mother and father was God's voice to me now Look Back Now on the things that they told me know about refused to let me do when they wouldn't let me miss church when other kids would they wouldn't let me stay at other kids house and they'd run off and do this and do that list the house of God I had to come when I didn't want to they brought me anyways but I look back today and I speak the decisions that my mother and father made even when I didn't understand it today at 52 years there's a lot of scars that's not on this old boy's life because somewhere God put some Godly instruction in my life they wasn't trying to just keep me from doing what everybody else was doing they was trying to keep me from living with a lot of scars that I'd have to deal with the rest of my life now I'm going to be bad playing for just a minute and I'm going to try to be as quick as possible let's talk to the young sisters just a minute I speak of this at my home Church matter of fact I got a whole generation of young people that I have preached to in personal ways for many years ago that I hadn't spoke to these young men here in these young ladies they hear me preach but years ago I dealt with young people a lot and dealt with them and dealt with them and and today there's a crop there that made right choices and today they're enjoying the benefits and the reaping from the righteous seeds that they sowed and decisions that they make and I'm telling you there's decisions that you're going to make tonight decision you'll make tomorrow decision you'll make this coming week that you will reap the benefits of those decisions for years to come now brother Branham spoke of young lady this is what he said to you young lady you have something that is a sacred Trust that has been given to you that sacred trust brother bam said are certain characters that she must not defile a woman is a sacred trust to that then he said she's also been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption she's got characters that she must not do oh the Apostle Paul shoulder picked this up in Timothy they're the second chapter verse 12 and talked about how he suffered not a woman to teach her you're some authority over a man I remember years ago I told some of them women preachers they found out my daddy didn't believe me when preachers but I preached for a few women preachers y'all forgive me for that but I did and then they found out that my daddy didn't believe in winning preachers and my daddy said now if they ever know that I don't believe in them preachers they're probably going to shut you down but you just give them first Timothy 2 12. he said I promise you if you give them first Timothy 2 12 212 is boiling temperature and if you give them 212 they are going to boil on you and they did and they did I've had some shut my meeting down but as I read on there Paul said but she shall be saved in childbearing the reason he says that is because that's how the fall happened and the woman received a mark against her because she brought a child in the world the wrong way but he's saying when you in faith and you got sobriety in those things and you bring children correctly in the right way then you save that character that marked against you you remove that by doing the right thing you can bear marks against your light by making the wrong choices and you can also put marks on your life by making the right choices it's simply sowing and reaping sowing and reaping now brother Ben says this she must not defile that but listen closely if she admire them she is defiled for a life time and what that simply means if you give up your virginity prematurely you can never take that virginity back God did that to you I'm gonna be praying just for a second brother Ben said she could be forgiven but she can't be justified that don't mean that you're not righteous in the sight of God it just simply means that Mark is against you and you could never go back and get your and I'm gonna show you the repercussions of that just for a minute but remember so they got scripture on that in a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement but cannot be justified in this life it's always with her so you got that little Mark against you notice she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified now let me tell you what that means young lady what that's tell that doesn't mean that you can't never be with a man but you gotta be with a man in the right time and prematurely before marriage is the wrong time it's called in the Bible and I should have got a big Amen on that that's called fornication is that right and if you give that up what I'm saying doesn't mean you can't be forgiven but if you let some young man defile You by convincing you that if you love him you'll go to bed with him prior to marriage oh yes if you I love you then you realize the property God said if that young man goes off and he's not man enough to marry you now that Mark is against you you so I can hide it from then I'll know you can't the properly God said so against you that if you were to meet another boy and you were to marry him you would have to confess that thing prior to the marriage now you say well that's easy no it's not upset with several that I've had to stand between both of them and allow her to confess this thing and it's not an easy thing it's like a knife in his heart and it's a knife in hers because she has to keep bringing it up she has to say it to him she has to now and I won't get into all the details but I'm simply saying this that you have to confess that thing because it's a Mark that gives you if you fail to confess it and you hide that thing and he marries you the prophet said for the saving for the cause of foreign attention he finds out later think of the hurt think of the trouble that comes to your life if he finds out the puppet said he would have a right to put your way in divorcement and remarry another look at the hurt look at the trouble that such a decision brings to your life now let me just say something to you young boys just for a second you should respect that young lady in such a way that you would never ever lead her down that path if you say you love her then respect her if you take her to bed prior to marriage you don't love her you left her is what you do and you you've confused and the difference between real agape love and lust of the flesh am I right you date that young lady as I've told my sons you date that young lady as you would want a young man to date your sister I got a daughter over here and she's not dating yet when she gets 30 her and I and him are going to have a wonderful time on our first date and I've got a little pistol that she's going to have as her own dedicated from her father and I tell him if he climbs over Matthew Mark Luke or John to get to you you put that pest on his rep and say I will not judge you but I will set your appointment now listen that's just a little joke there to lighten you up because some of you is already turning your faces a certain way because of my subject but I know people don't take this seriously enough the reason I take it serious is because I know that there's repercussions that that thing leaves behind for years everybody else is going on with their life that young girl has to constantly deal with that and when the young man as I said a couple down not too many months ago and and she confessed and he said I forgive her I said listen my brother I want you to understand something if you can forgive her don't you ever ever bring this thing back up again nowhere in your marriage if she represents the bride you represent Christ and if you say you forgive her you wipe that out now listen as a man he can't wipe that out of his mind but he can have enough hope oh Holy Ghost about him to never bring that up don't stick in your back pocket and when you get upset somewhere down the road you bring that thing up on her I'll tell you what's going to happen it won't be hurts and no more it'll be your sin [Applause] but you see the great repercussions that comes from that let me give you an example there's a man in the Bible that we all love and the Bible speaks so well about him and his name is David and the Bible said is a man after God's Own Heart but did you know there's a mark against David that when you read the scriptures everybody knows it there was such a failure in neighbor's life one day when there was a woman on top of the house taking a bath and her name was Bathsheba and David saw her she was such a beautiful woman I don't understand it I can't understand it probably never will understand how a man could have 500 wives and one another one I can't comprehend that that means I could see Lisa today and not see her again until a year and a half that's mind-boggling but you understand David had 500 wives that don't mean that he loved them all the way he should have loved them but he saw this woman and he plotted a certain thing and you know the story I won't have time to go into it you know the story how it went not only turned adultery he turned to murder he plotted a murder of her own husband because he knew the law you don't touch another man's wife he could have had a thousand and wide and all them women could not have but one husband but David could never even though he could take as many wives as he wanted he could never take touch a woman it's already been given to another man so what he thought was I'll kill your husband I'll free her and then I can take her now he might have puddled out all out but in the eyes of God it was something altogether different because what God did you know the story he got her pregnant and that's why he partner knew what he did he committed adultery and he plotted her husband's death and he died and I think of that man when David called him in you know the big plot I'll call him in I'll get him and go see his wife when David goes to bed that night he's thinking oh it's all settled now he'll go home and have relationship I'll bring the baby on him when he wakes up and open his doors he looks down and there lays the man wouldn't even go home and have pleasure with his wife while his brother right there on the bed finally David realized I can't get this man to go you talk about a soldier's heart you talk about a faithful spirit finally David said there's only one thing I can do I'll have to send him with his own death warrant and I don't know about y'all but if a king called me in and and wanted me to go see my wife or my little mind start working and David ruled out a really what he did he wrote out a death warrant handed it to him you're right wasn't it he goes back to the battlefield I don't know about y'all but my quizlet of mine would have went to work and I would have wanted to open that and read it let's say the man didn't open it then he was carrying his own death warrant and ignorance not knowing that he's going to die when he gets back to the to the captain but what if it did open how much more of a man was he that knowing that he's walking to his death but for his King oh God Lord give us a spirit like that if I have to go to death I'll do it for my king he goes down there and he dies and David's thinking it's all settled one day there came a knock on the door David opened that stood God's prophet and they begin to tell David a parable and when he told David a parable he said what should we do and David said the man should die and all these words that just so like they rushed out of Eternity these words said you are the man and can you imagine from that came these words David was forgiven God forgave him for his sin he did he spoke in Psalms 51 when he wrote Psalm 51 you have time to read it he writes that because of the sin with Bathsheba he said created me a clean heart o God restored to me the joy of my salvation but then he said this against thee and the only have I sinned he acknowledges sin before God he was forgiven that didn't mean to go God it's an okay David you're forgiven we'll wipe it out no longer have to deal with it no God said you're forgiven but these are the words that came from God the sword shall never depart from my house because thou Hast despised me and have taken your eye the hittite the white from your eye the hiptide to be thy wife and later on God told him you caused my enemies to bless me Lord Brother we think about that things we do we don't realize the outside world that's watching our actions the things we do and we think they just speak against us no it brings a reproach against the very Christ and the Very gospel the very message we claim to represent try and God told David the sword shall never depart find later on that sword started waking awake making its way through David's family David live with a lot of heartache over one naked woman one decision that he made that sword cut that sword severed caused one of his sons to take one of his wives out on the house not before all Israel committed to that with his own father's life and another son that raped the sister the sword was just cutting through that family and I'm going to tell you something long after David was forgiven long after David lived David had to deal with scars from one decision that he made I want this to soak in tonight I wanted to soak in good God's not trying to keep you from pleasure God look the bed is undefiled landing is a white coming together in sexual relationship is a wonderful thing in the eyes of God he's not trying to torment you he's not trying to keep you from that he's just telling you wait till you're married why because the marriage is Honorable among all and the bet is undefiled but prior to that it's going to put a scar in your life that you'll take from now all the way to your grave it's a sword it leaves scars behind it's a womb that has to be dealt with don't be deceived by thinking in your younger years you can sow all of your Wild Oats so to speak then because you're staying it erases the scars no it erases the sins but the scars will remain what I'm saying sip is this I want you to know that it pays to live for God and make right decisions while you're young having a good time we're trying to keep you from wounding yourself maybe because of immaturity maybe because some young man works on your emotions listen young man I know I'm no dummy I was your age at one time that's the reason that pornography is so powerful on young men because young men are moved by what they see and a young lady is moved by what she hears that's why young lady you can you've got to be careful of a slick talker you got to watch them double tongue boys I'm not talking about these church kids I'm talking about some of these guys maybe out there in the world that will talk to you behind your father's back you use your father as a shield against that that's why God put him in your life as your head to protect you young men be careful like David buried David said I'll set no evil thing before mine eyes our parents have to be conscious and be aware of you know it's sad brother um our pastor here it said when we think about it that when men were in these things years ago it was hit today it's at the fingertips of your children right on their phones they can mines can be defiled imprints can be placed upon their mind that they wrestle with their whole life that's what's important to guard your heart to guard your mind guard your spirit y'all with me say Amen I'm aware of the fact that you can live it up but I'm also aware of the fact you may never live it down brother Madam said some of you young men sitting here right now the decisions that you make will affect the sea that's in your Lawrence in years to come I honestly God believe in all my heart my soul and body that my children today are enjoying the benefits of decisions I made when I was a young man you young men are going to make decisions by the Holy Ghost and the word of God that's going to pronounce blessings upon your children if God should carry in years to come because you're going to sow the right thing and if you sell the right thing you're going to reap the right thing God ain't mocked if you sow to the spirit you will up the spirit reap everlasting life but if you sow the flesh you shall of the flesh reap corruption I'm not trying to be hard I'm trying to be honest with you we cannot sow to the Flesh and then when we see the crop coming up and the Harvest of what we sowed all of a sudden we start praying for crop failure may not be popular may not be popular but I promise you if you live by just what I told you you're going to find out the most happy years of your life God gave you the best years while you're young and you'll reap the benefits of While You're Young making decisions that please almighty God I told you last night I gave my heart to the Lord at 13 years old and I did and I said also I'd never regretted that momentous decision that I made and I have reaped the benefits of what I call Amazing Grace but there were so-called friends of mine was wrong with me they thought I had lost my mind thought I'd just become sort of some religious kid I was accused of becoming a Catholic priest and that was because I've showed no interest in the worldly girls anymore I just kind of lost my appetite for that and I just dedicated myself to God take my Bible the young age 14 15 I'd go down to the river up under the bridge and all I didn't have tapes and books all I had was my Bible and I'd read this Bible and I just put the word because David said it didn't really acknowledge it all then but he said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee that's why last night when I said pray and read your Bible every day that might seem to get monotonous to you but you don't realize the Eternal effects that it has in your life some didn't think it was necessary but I should be so dedicated at such a young age some thought that I was a fanatic and they called me a fanatic for Jesus maybe I was in some ways and I was certainly a fool for Christ I got me a jean jacket on the back of that jean jacket it's 16 17 years old I painted a big fire and I had three crosses and was called Holy Ghost Fire now take my my microphone my little speaker and that's at a young age stand on the street corner and sing and preach the gospel I was thrown physically out of a Catholic church when I confronted for a priest and they they told me that I was a Protestant back then brother I didn't know what a promised it was they said you're a Protestant I said oh no I'm not I'm a Christian and I didn't realize I Protestant was somebody that protested church I said I wish I knew then what I know now they wanted me to go into a confession booth in that Catholic church and invited me to come and I said what what's what I do in there I said you go in there and preach me on the other side and you can confess your wrongs to him your sins I said well that's wonderful that's the Bible but it does say confess your fault to one to another I said so I'll confess mine to you if you'll confess yours to me I said well it don't work that way I said I know because if I go to confession mine it ain't gonna take but a second because all mine's been covered in the blood but if you guys go to confession we're going to be here all night they grab me by my shoulder and took me out to the Catholic church and pushed me out they just had finished mass and there was several hundred cars in the parking lot I ran across the street because I had my mom and daddy lived there and I got my guitar and my speaker and microphone and brother I cleared that part lock out singing there's power in the blood I started singing this a song We Sing I sang that song on that street corner son in that parking lot cleared so fast I emptied it out but seeing there's power in the blood we preached down on the streets a friend of mine got arrested and took him to jail and the next morning at nine o'clock stood before the judge and the judge says so you know why you're here he said yes they arrested me for preaching the gospel he said no because you were disturbing the peace what do you have to say for yourself brother the Holy Ghost sweeped in and my little preacher friend said to that judge said judge my Bible said there is no peace to the wicked saith God so how can I disturb something they ain't got the judge hit the podium and said case dismissed amen God has a way of doing it praise the Lord but you know that crowd that thought I was a fanatic thought I lost my mind thought I didn't need to be that dedicated son laughed they're not laughing tonight I said they're not laughing tonight no why because some of them are in prison some of their homes have been busted up many of our friends are divorced and remarried several times some of them are raising illegitimate children living off welfare son of committed suicide I've had to walk up in the yard but One landed with a gunshot wound a friend of mine overdosed and then took a gun tried to kill himself he didn't succeed but later he did succeed I preached his funeral people that thought I was crazy some of them tonight or strung out on drugs meth cocaine laying in the yards out of their mind homeless living in the woods I'm talking about people and tonight not because I'm any different not because I'm better but I've never had to put a drug in my body I've only had one pill that's ever satisfied me and that's called The Gospel every time I take it I get on a high it takes me in the Realms that they never know nothing about but when I lay my head down tonight I got a piece in my mind I don't have scars on my body I don't have a scar in my spirit and I wake up I lay down with a piece of God knowing that if I leave this world I'd step out of here into another box [Applause] you understand what I'm talking about I'm talking about a man that when you make right decision you don't have to worry about the repercussions you don't have to worry about sorrow down the road when you make righteous decisions you wake up with a peace of God the holy ghost in your heart and you've got so almost said you got something money you can't never mind they want to judge you whether you got a fancy house or a fancy car or a boat or a camper or this or that brother you don't judge Men by that you judge them by their character I'd rather ride a bicycle like brother Madam said eat crackers and Branch water no my soul is right with God you know sometimes the stuff we call blessings ain't blessings from God it's blessed day it's blessings if I could say it that way it truly curses that come from the Devil anything you've got in your life that takes the place of God don't blame God for that that's right when God puts a blessing in your life it addeth no sorrow with it well you got quiet with me there but it's right you ain't measured by how much you own by the fact you measured by who owns you tonight is not a laughing matter anymore it's a sad matter what you do now you'll reap for it down the road let me say one more time before I get into my little thought here God's grace can bring anybody out of anything deliver them from whatever but the same grace of God that can bring you listen to me young people the same grace of God that can bring people out of that is the same grace of God that can keep you from it remember years ago in a Pentecostal Church there were kids there that never drank Never Smoke never cuss never commit a fornication never went to the movie theaters we didn't do those things we love having church we never complain when we had a seven day Revival we had no problem going to church two and three weeks in a row I can remember it Mama taking me to church daddy take me under 10. night after night people still got up and went to work now if you have a three-day meeting then you're dragging on Monday we're weak but I can remember those days but it also bothered me that the only people that ever got testified was some drug addict nothing against nothing is wonderful some somebody that God delivered from drugs some alcoholic some prostitute they'd bring them up there and talk about how marvelous God was and here's that young people love God never did those things and I thought to myself one day wait a second the same grace of God that brought them from those things that same powerful grace of God is what keeps some of these young people out of those things [Applause] some of them are living with scars and I know them I dealt with them they wrestled with that see young person every time you allow something in your life according to the Lord God that brings a mark on you that's a punch that Satan's gone at you that's something he'll use against you down the road but if you stand it with a word of God and face him and put the word between you and the enemy and so right decision and so right things and guess what your your God is helping you to relieve scars from your heart and remember this I'll just say any old dead fish can go down the stream but it takes a live fish to go against the current body can go the way of the world but it takes a son and daughter of God that's got a backbone and go against the society God gets these Philistines way and stand for what is right I like the little girl I just go back to this for a second the little girl that kept her virginity she'd go to school and I know how it is I've been there and these kids any of y'all go to public schools I don't know most of ours my wife homeschooled all of ours they did associate with the public school because they played the sports for the public school and they interacted and those type of things we didn't we didn't believe in so much separation sanctification that our kids would know how to operate the world I never was afraid brother Thomas to be around Sinners that's if they're going to defile me I believe I had enough God to the center couldn't defile me I've never had enough God that I could influence the sinner and I can tell you a story about it set with a man in a restaurant while he's drinking Budweiser and while I'm drinking a Coke or water time after time trying to win that man and just show him something about Christ and I coached his son in ball and one day he came to me and he was so impressed how his son had changed it didn't become a Christian I just taught him how to be respectful and yes sir and no sir and took baseball and taught him principles about life and respect and authority and all that and finally one day he he literally asked me I'll just tell you the story for a second if I got just a few minutes and we were sitting the World Series and he came to me and said hey somebody told me you're a preacher and I said yes sir and I've coached the son all year never knew I was a preacher because I didn't go out there I'm a preacher I'm a preacher I was just a Christian that was trying to influence these boys into something that was good he took I'm gonna tell you something my son is not the same son because he played for your team he's learned what respect is he said where do you Pastor not I told him where I passed at that time he said that little place he said I've come by there and it's packed out he said you know that's against fire marshal for you to have so many people in the in that church said if what if a fire broke out and my mind was thinking we hope it does I've been praying for a fire to break out and we ain't called a 9-1-1 when it does Let It Burn let a fire break out right here tonight let it burn let a fire break out in the heart of one of these young people it'll turn this community around let a fire break out on their hearts I tell you you won't have to call a prayer meeting they'll come and lock the doors themselves to have a prayer meeting [Applause] had a fire break out this young man's heart nobody gonna have to convince him and make him want to preach I'll be a fight like fire except in his bones like Jeremiah come on now that's what we need we need some more of the five God burning down in our hearts burn the world out put Christ in there and I'm telling you you're going to have one or two fires you're either going to have the fire of the Holy Ghost that John the Baptist said when he comes he'll baptize or you're going to have that other fire you don't want that other fire hey this Holy Ghost Fire I'll keep you from that damnation fire you with me say Amen so finally he said well you ever thought about building a church I said well yeah he said what what organization you're with I said we ain't got none he said what I said we don't have an organization he said I tell you what you come to my bank and he was a banker ain't said come down to my bank when we get back I said for what he said I'm going to build you a church I said well sir he said how much you need and I said oh I don't know he said couple million dollars I said no sir not even close and I did have a piece of property I got home and I figured out what the price would be and I went and seen him and told him what I needed and he wrote a check out 450 000 dollars said you'd go build your church had to go down the attorney's office for some of the Brethren from our church signed the papers the attorney said what organization you're with what denomination said we don't have one he said where's your minutes I said we ain't got any this is his words I cannot sign these papers I said call the banker and tell him he called the banker right there in the room with us and the banker told him said you'll either sign those papers or I'll never send you any more business he got the phone so I've never done this but I'm not losing that man's business and he signed the papers for us we built a church I went by the office one day I said let me ask you something why'd you do all this for me and I kept trying some way to get to him and he said I'll tell you Luke why I did it he said any man that would treat my son the way you did I'll do anything for you and brother as soon as in words how much amount of light turned on and I said brother I said that's what I've been trying to tell you he said what I said just what you said you said if I'd done anything for your son you'd do anything for me he said yes I said that's exactly the way God feels if you receive his son he'll do anything for you tear rolled out his face he hugged me I walked out about three or four months later I got a call on the phone it was him on the other end his voice was broke up he said Luke I said yes he said I wanted you to be the first to know I gave my heart back to the Lord come on church Someone said does he see this message no but that don't mean he won't I didn't cram the message down this road I didn't cram what we bleed down his throat I just tried to be Christ to him present Christ to him and I I know if it's a true repentance and a true Faith then I know one thing the god that dealt with him to lead him and guide him into all truth hey they're not we didn't say them God did and God takes responsibility for his own children can you say praise the lord well let me get back to my message so this little girl went to school and they were asking her if she still had her virginity he said yes they mocked her and made fun of him she'd go home in the evening she'd be crying one day she was sitting at the supper table she was weeping her daddy came and sat down said what's wrong honey she said Daddy I'm tired tired of what I'm tired of being made fun of daddy they've all gave up their virginity and I still got mine but they're mocking me and making fun of me he said you go pray and talk to God about it she went in the room and she prayed while she was praying the lord gave her something she went back to school and they started making fun of her when she did she said something and the lord gave her and they never bothered her again you know what she said she said let me tell you something girls any day of the week I can become what you are but you all could never become what I am they gave it up they lost it the keppers she kept that sacred trust that God had given to her now let me bring this to what I wanted to because there's decisions that you will make now that I want you to sow the right ones and do the right thing so that when you leave your childhood and you go into adulthood and then you become married and then you become a husband or a wife and then you become a grandma or a grandpa you don't have to look down through your past and be haunted by decisions that you made when you were young how can that happen let me tell you can I have about 15 minutes how could that happen well let's borrow Samuel for just a minute Samuel was one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament but God didn't call him when he was 30 and 40. his mother kept praying for a child down the temple she prayed until she travailed until her language couldn't be understood and God opened her womb that you're with a little boy by the name of Samuel and Samuel was just a young lad she took him back down to the temple and dedicated him to God and he was raised in the temple with the priest he was a prophet but he was also a judge until Saul became king and he also performed the role of a priest and God blessed him and Sanctified him another man tried that and God struck him with leprosy God's blessings was upon Samuel saved as a little boy listen to this you say well he didn't have to oh wait wait this boy was surrounded by corruption and such filth as a little boy taking place so when he went out there in the neighborhood no right down there in the temple in the house of God Eli two boys the priest and Eli's two son Hoffman Phineas you know a little bit about them don't you started committing lewd acts unless it's sex acts preacher Sons preached his voice oh God help us help us tonight but he lived such a dedicated life separated from the world and God Favored him all the days of Life strange I was sitting at my desk there in the hotel today and brother William you put that up about anxiety now remember study on this a few years ago some of the top issues that some of our young people face Samuel faced a lot of the same things maybe different forms and different manifestations but top things that our young people face is amazing kids these age young men young ladies either dealing with depression bullying sexual activity drug abuse alcohol abuse obesity problems peer pressure social media violence on the streams then we wonder why they got them all on drugs and after doing I'm gonna tell you what they're doing they're trying to drug demons you go around the Book of Revelation you'll find out he said he'd see the whole world by sorceries look up that word Searcher there's Pharmaca that's why we get the word Pharmaceutical drugs numbs them keeps them drugged up to the idle boy Israel Israel when he was a little fellow was hyper he was just a boy really hyper some of the people in the church said well that boy needs to be on Ritalin you know they got to drop through everything no matter if your kid's just a kid just a little bit like David was imagine if David was being raised today that kid would be stoned out of his mind according to what I heard today they drug him up and one of the deacons told me that boy needs riddling I said that kid don't need Ritalin he needs a red rear end huh Thomas we don't believe in Corporal passage you ain't got to tell us we're just around your kids a little bit and we know you don't believe in corporal punishment I didn't believe in corporal punishment I believe in capital punishment we go in the restaurant my wife would get out and all these boys look like a Mother Goose all the little chicks falling and we go in the restaurant my kids I never had to say shut your mouth be still sat down don't move people would come up and they'd say it's amazing how your kids are here all these boys are on this table and you've got the quietest table in this whole restaurant said thank you it's wonderful to see that so thank you and we just and they just were impressed by how good my kids were finally one day it got enough nerve to ask me how you do it I suggest before we get out the car I said boys if you act up my hand to God I'll kill you when you get home capital punishment told my boys I'll whip you till the fire alarm goes off think of that education system rotten to the Core number one to send my kids down to the Philistines and that bunch of educated Devils teach them put their minds and mess them up and try to tell them they can make decisions what sex they are how in God's name ever heard such ridiculous nonsense that's just straight up out of hell man you young people don't decide what sex you are that was decided by almighty God when the sea neck came together and you come out of the womb he said boy girl [Applause] two dinners male and female I don't care what these bunch of crackpots tell you flies out of hell now we got a bunch of masking girls a bunch of feminine boys cause there's confusion Mom and Daddy protect your kids from them false doctrines and the Devils that's in the education system rotten to the core and duck they the mines until we have a whole generation excuse me that are devil possessed [Music] education's taking them farther and farther away from God to the devil possess not all not all not all but most praise God let me talk to you just a minute got about three or four points to you number one tell you what's different about Samuel Samuel had learned to respond to God the first time God dealt with him one day he was there and laying down and first Samuel 1 and 2 and Mama dropped him off dedicated to God and he was laying there and all of a sudden he hears something that says Samuel Samuel said yes Lord or yes yes here here am I Jeremiah because you got to realize first time God speaks to you may not be able to acknowledge whose voice that is well he went and got up and he went down to Eli and Eli Tom said go lay back down it wasn't for me you're gonna lay back down he lay down and hear it come again Samuel went to the priest could you call no Samuel go back lay down this time if you hear him call your name all you have to say is here am I for thy servant heareth isn't that good young person do you realize three times God spoke to him at the third time something penetrated into Samuel's soul there's mind and the spirit that you read the rest of the Bible and read the rest of the biography of of Samuel's life God never had to call his name more than once God never had to speak more than once the first time God would speak to Samuel Samuel would respond to the call of God from a child to an old man but never was a time that God had to speak twice he became familiar with that voice let me just tell you something I know the voice of God is on the tape don't get me wrong I know that but don't you ever let nobody convince you that doesn't individually speak to you some of you young people last night something spoke to your heart and you come down the order some of you they didn't come to our god you still spoke to your heart how many of you y'all be believed God spoke to your heart last night you just felt something all right remember that voice that ain't the devil telling you to come down here just remember how it was when you respond to that voice and every time that voice comes don't push it off one day you may be sitting in your room and all of a sudden the Temptation will come and you'll hear that boy say don't do that stop right there listen to that voice the first time they talked to you because that voice is leading you in God I knew and it's shaving you from trouble that's down the road I have a sister I hope you're not listening tonight you do I love you facts are facts I was a 16 year old boy I believe about that age I was up in Cleveland Ohio my sister and I were bumping heads over decisions that she was making maybe I was a little older maybe I was 17 18. she we were bumping heads she was making decisions that was contrary causing trouble in my father and mother's home I don't know I would I would sharply speak to her I went into the room in my aunt's house and I was kneeling down praying something spoke to me said I want you to get up and go call your sister and I want you to tell her in a respectful nice way don't do what she's about to do she will pay for her decision I didn't have no more clue what she had in mind and nothing but I know something spoke to me I got up and went in the living room I said Dad I said you think and I called my aunt's name she'd mind if I borrowed the telephone my ass said I said no no problem call go ahead do what you want to do and I called the house and when I did my sister picked up and when she did I said Tammy should have called it I'm sorry but I did to Tammy and she threw the phone and I said hello hello my mom picked it up she said Luke what's going on I said Mom something spoke to me just a moment ago and told me to call my sister and tell her in a respectful nice way not to do what she's about to do because she will pay for it down the road my sister when she heard my voice through the phone and started screaming that's why I was wondering what was going on my mother said Luke just before that phone rang your sister looked at me and said of Luke whatever tell me a respectful nice way I would listen and I said something told me I said put her on the phone and he put her on the phone I said Tammy I love you but he told me to tell you whatever it is that you're about to do don't you do it you'll pay for it down the road before my father I ever got back see she didn't want to take that as really she did at the moment penetrator but then what she did she pushed that voice off don't ever push that voice off she puts that voice up that night she crawled out the window and went with some boy he got married by the justice of peace winded up in a divorce ended up with another man had a baby out of wedlock in love with another man had another baby and today she's still weeping for one day decision she made against the voice about to her life do I love her with all my heart I do but truth is truth and it's like she told me few when 9 11 happened you remember that happened my that morning my phone was ringing off the hook I wasn't going to answer it because people I knew was one of them was her and she was waiting to hear my voice and I almost said picked up said hello you reached the Gibson house we're not here the Rapture has just happened because I knew what she was thinking and when I actually said oh thank God I thought the Lord Jesus had already come back you don't have to live that way you shouldn't have to worry about somebody else getting out of here you can live for God till you know if he comes I'm going with him if anybody's going to help tonight I'm going I told her I said it wouldn't have mattered you gotta but what it is she this is her words I feel trapped Satan keeps bringing the walls in the wall when you push that voice up and push that I got a whole message I preach on conscience how it's a gift of God and how God uses that conscience she pushed it off and pushed it off her life today seemed like it's on a path that she don't know how to turn around if it gets turned around it'll take almighty God to turn it around I can't do it my mother couldn't do it my father couldn't do it nobody else could do it if it's going to get done it'll take God or it'll never be done in other words you can go so far that you wreck your life up I got another cousin of mine God used him mightily wrote songs and played the piano just mightily started getting involved with pornography so this was the days where we had to go buy the magazines one thing led to another let's tell you something sin will take you farther than you'll want to go it'll cost you more than you want to pay took him so far until he winded up committing acts and prostitutes and different knew there was something different about him but all of a sudden he picked up a disease back then it was called AIDS they buried him one day broke the mother's heart all because he he said that voice told him not to do it warned him the first time he ever done it and he pushed that voice off he kept going and what happens after a while you create a web and you get caught in that web I thought it was always amazing when the internet came out they called it the world www the worldwide web to get you in there like brother random said at times not just think of this my wife and I was flying to South Africa one time she was scared the plane started trembling so what's wrong with you she I can feel her tensing up she felt like his things on a wreck I said you might as well die happy and why go down all stiff like a board just go down praise the Lord because we can't do nothing about it now ain't no stopping the area on that ocean I said Ain't No Stopping place we gotta go we got to go back we just kept going I said just relax it'll be all right he said I'm scared when that happens I said look if God could keep a plane down he could sure keep a plane up tell you something Mama I'm gonna land your mama Stand Out by that gate you remember that her black son in there on the bed he had the same thing I told blood of him said he caught her venereal disease from living a a a a wrong kind of life he was dying Saul was out there you know like on a ship and just groaning and groaning and there stood that little widow woman waiting that morning for Elijah to come out glad you came by glory to God hello Parson she got to talk and they went in there God held that plane up for one mother that had a desire to see her son saved but that shame God was here tonight he'll do it for her he'll do it for you my daughter's away I don't care where your daughter is God Will Make A Way when there seems to be no way you know how far my son is I don't care how far your son is I know how big God is it takes God seconds to turn a man and a woman's life around the man should not win an air and I told her to pray brother she got to pray you remember what happened the spirit of God came in there brother in the Lord turn that boy around brother bam said some time later come to a meeting hello Parson Branham you don't remember me trying to find out he said I'm that boy that you prayed for God turn him around brother mamas don't ever stop praying daddy don't ever stop believing you pray when nobody else will pray you believe when nobody else or believes breathe and die in thy house shall be saved let me say it one more time don't silence that voice respond to God the first time he speaks to you you'll be amazed at the trouble it'll keep out of your life you'll be at the scars that you will not have to deal with down the road number two listen to this run from sin as fast as you can let me tell you why I say that Samuel was living the temple with Eli Eli's voice as I said was committing fornication in the house of God it was sickening what was taking place Samuel was a young boy he was a young boy guess what he never know Daddy and Mommy around nope the preacher's kids was all messed up imagine the pressure that must have been on Samuel not fine Phineas he sons of Eli come on Samuel everybody's doing it nobody's going to find out dashboard too laid back to Blind all he is is a figurehead now we do things that he doesn't even know what's going on till the Bible said there was no open vision air the lamp of the Lord the light the Lord had went out the church had got into a backslid condition and when they got in the backstory condition sin started coming into the church I can imagine though Samuel's sitting there looks at off nine Fitness and the rest of that crowd so let me tell y'all something I've been here since a child God has spoken to me I've heard his voice I've dedicated myself to him I want you to tell your boy something I'm not down in this Temple just cause Mama dropped me off I got here cause Mama dropped me off but I don't stay here cause a mama it was her desire to bring you but it's my desire to sir him blessed be the day when you young people don't serve God cause Mom and Daddy makes you but blessed be the day when you serve God cause you want to you're dressed and ready before Mom and Daddy ever gets ready you're gonna wake up in the morning telling Mom and Daddy get up it's time to go to church that's what I told have you ever had to ask me on a Wednesday or Sunday are we going to church no such thing in my house my kids have never had to say are we going to church that's a that's a ridiculous question that's on Wednesday we're going to church we build our lives around going to church Sunday come we went to church you've been to church twice all your life on Sunday you're 70 years old always live in my house you'll always go twice on Sunday once on with and if we have Revival you'll be there every night that wasn't the question our own that's a silly question that's asking Christian homes are we going to church That Man Who Loved God will fill the seat his seat every time them doors are open if he loves God matter of fact he said if he really loves God he can't wait for them Church doors get open so he can get out there and fellowship amen is that right let me singing that we used to sing oh when a saints come marching in now we're seeing all in the same come dragon in Samuel looked at himself and tell you some boys I'm not here like here you're here because your dad is a preacher I'm not here like you're here I'm here because I want to be here there's something in my heart wants to serve God I'm going to tell you something I don't care what everybody else is doing I know what the word of God says and I'm not going to do anything while I'm 15 16 17 and 18 that I'm going to weep over when I get 25 and 30. you do what you want to do but I'm going to run from it I'm not associating with it because you know what he found out if he laid down with the dogs he's going to catch fleas he'll be hung around with skunks after a while he's gonna stink so he was willing to run from sin as fast as he could and he ran from it I'm going to tell you something else while he ran from it one day down the battlefield why them boys are laying on the battlefield in their own blood Samuel was at church worshiping God while they died in sin read the Bible they died of disgrace they died under the Judgment of God when his daughter-in-law come back and totally lie he was so big he fell over backwards and died while all the sin and the corruption and the compromise what's going on Samuel was running from sin he was responding to the voice and he was running from sin the Bible tells you young people flee flee fornication Paul told Timothy flee youthful lust then Mercury said fleas for fuss he used the word follow after flee this and follow after this it doesn't fully useful love follow after righteous Faith charity peace with them that call upon the name of the Lord out of pure heart the word flee literally means to shun and avoid my fight run for your life let me give you an example by the name of Joseph young fella handsome look God blesses you with looks use it for him don't let Satan turn that thing on you and put pride in your heart and you think you're a ladies man or you've got Beauty as a young girl and you let the devil use it to sway men the way you think you can God didn't give you a body to send soul he'd give you a body to glorify him with like one girl complained walk down the road with her cleavage hanging out in her bottom of her rear end hanging out of her shorts and got raped and I don't think a man should do that is a beast that does that but the point is if what you've got isn't for sale quit advertising it but of them said they'll stand on the dead judgment for calls and men to commit adultery you boys get enough Holy Ghost about you when you can't look left you can't look right you can't look for him you can't look backward look up keep your eyes on Christ Joseph went down there must have been a nice young man maybe her husband taught it for his wife her husband's too busy and he happened to be in the house and she come up there and maybe lonely maybe she had a little fuss that morning and here's a young man nice looking but he's a man of God Satan thought he would get him right she come to him she wanted him but he had enough thought about him you know what he did he run he run what's your name young man yeah come here for a second would you turn around face the audience Joseph had his coat on when that woman come after him I want you to run to your seat go this coat gone he lost his coat but he kept his character she stole this coat but she couldn't get his character he held that character young person when you run from sin they might get your coat they may tell a lie but God knows in the end your character holds still [Applause] run run run free you flust follow out to righteousness and faith and charity and peace with them that call upon the Lord out of the Lord's surround yourself with people that's got the same desires and the same appetite you got if you got people in your life that's trying to get you to sin run from them you got people and I'll get you in a second but you got people trying to get you to do things that's conjure this message run from it run you're soul is at stake your future is a stake your life is at stake you don't want to end up in this life with scars all over you because the decisions you make now because I'm lost remember this I'm gonna set to you boys and you girls the right place the right time with the right people you can do things in your life that will scar you later on and you remember Blackness plus opportunity equals shame stay in the light so responding the first time he calls run from sin Let me give you the third one refine your conversation what I mean by that well here's what the Bible said Samuel grew in the Lord's with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground his conversations were pure they were Godly they were holy I'm going to tell you something if you think dirty you'll talk dirty and if you talk dirty you will live dirty I told my boys their whole lives I preached Proverbs 3 to them over and over about the woman that met him in the streets and how with her eyes stares him down used to be girls wouldn't do that wouldn't stand there and just keep her eye Right In Another Man's eyes and just stare him that didn't used to be that way they had a little bit of Shame they had a little bit of uh what's the other word they lose their modesty then they're willing to talk like the world talks you just remember your tongue is like a spoon it'll dip down to the bucket of your heart will spew out what's really in there at the bun of the heart the mouth will speak your conversation is wrong your life will become wrong keep your heart your mind conversation I'll say it like Brother Band for a second I could read a lot of quotes but I just need to preach it go no place that you wouldn't be found if Jesus should come be saying nothing that you would not want to say if Jesus should come it's pretty simple that three little monkeys one cover in his eyes when Covenant is here do you remember that See No Evil say no evil do no evil do what's right With Every Idle Word and we'll give an account for number four refuse to ever compromise get your convictions in your heart you list these tapes and you hear Brother bam say things even things that you don't I necessarily understand why brother Brandon would save let me tell you something you don't have to fully understand to have The Obedience of faith believing and obedience believing obedience is a prerequisite to God given you understanding do you think whether you understand or not if the if the word of God says it do it later on God might give you an understanding why he had you to do certain things but if God ask it just do it refuse to compromise let me just tell you this quickly you got one more and I'll let you go Samuel had a friend he was a very close Covenant in Ministry matter of fact the only one we know that Samuel was close to it was the man that became the first king of Israel and his name was Saul Samuel was the one that took the Horn of oil symbol of the Holy Ghost and anointed him to be king Samuel was the one who offered up sacrifices while the armies went against their enemies their Ministries went hand in hand while Saul was in battle Samuel offered the sacrifices one day God spoke to Saul and he told Saul in the battle kill every amlicite now that been Samuel he would have took them all out Saul thought I'll Kill Them All but I'll just leave one of them alive you remember that he left one alive Saul disobeyed God that the king alive and Samuel came back and he rebuked Saul make a long story short let me tell you what he said behold it is better to obey than a sacrifice to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is Iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he had also ejected thee from being a King Samuel rebuked him sternly what was he doing listen listen disagreeing with his best friend why because Samuel refused to compromise he could have said you know what me and you've been close a long time we've been towels we've been buddies and I know God told you not to do that but you know I don't want to come against you I want our relationship to continue and he could have compromised he would have paid a great price Saul compromised Samuel let me finish the story for you the malachites were a type of the flesh God told him you killed every thing of the flesh don't you leave one alive if you read the rest of the story Samuel came and Samuel cut the results of that Disobedience cut him up in pieces name was egg egg and you know what he's saying not compromising Saul said come on let's go worship he said I'm not worshiping with you I'm not compromising with you that's what he told him I'm not I'm not going down the words matter of fact he said this you will not even see my face no more until you die you read first Samuel 15 35 Saul never seen Samuel again his death now watch this do you know what it was that ended up killing Saul the seed of the man he left alive what he refused to obey God in is what caused him his life he left an amicide alive that little thing he left alive produced and it's what ended up taking Saul's life what's God telling us don't you ever compromise with sin don't you compromise at all if God tells you to get something rid of something in your life it may be a little just obey God I tell you why because it's better because that little thing you think is so insignificant little babies little hammockites hope to be dig something big little things that you let go undone that God's asked you to get rid of they grow big and if you don't kill it it will kill you don't compromise finally recruit about your life young people be an influence for Christ let me tell what I mean by that Samuel mourned he mourned don't think because he didn't he you know you think you're a preacher like maybe your pastor your strike against something brother if you're like anything like me and I have to preach certain things in my church you ask my wife I don't go home and say well I really knelt sometimes I go home broken why did I have to say that I I get so tired of saying stuff like that Samuel because he wouldn't compromise best friend Saul dies and he knew why he died he knew his Disobedience took him there and the Bible said Samuel mourned oversaw finally God got tired of his Mourning God came to himself how long will you mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel filled on high 9 horned with oil and gold and I will send thee to Jesse to Bethlehem I like for I have provided me a king among his sons because he wouldn't compromise God still permitted him to be an influence on another king let me just say this to young people if you'll do what I'm telling them little principles I taught and you'll never compromise God will use you for good for his kingdom he'll help influence others for Christ what happened he went down there brother he was so in tune with God went down there he knew to go to Jeffy the Jesse the bethlehemite went down to Bethlehem and there you know Samuel walked up come and style peaceably said I'm coming in peace I need a son where's your sons pull all them big looking fellas out there and Samuel just stood there waiting on God he could have picked any of them Head and Shoulders big old Warriors he could have used any of them but he waited on God and all of a sudden said do you have any more well I have one but surely you couldn't be talking to him little Shepherd boy on the backside of the desert taking care of sheep oh that's the kind of men God can use one God was training him out there to take care of sheep one line tried to kill it bear tried to kill it he was protecting God you fought me God but usually protect his Nation oh at least little as much if God is in it labor not for wealth nor Fame there's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name come down there David come up the spirit of God said that's him Samuel saying sound of the anointed Saul same sounding known as Saul same Samuel they wouldn't compromise with Saul here he is again influencing another man from the kingdom of God if you compromise you'll kill your influence on others you let the bars down and I'm gonna tell you something I feel this way right here tonight if my life gets to a place that I can influence nobody else for Christ he might as well take me from this world I live to influence people for this great message in this great gospel that we have I believe God brought me out of my mother's womb to preach the gospel same with you brother I believe God brought us out to pray this is what we were born to do let me say this everywhere you go be an influence preach the gospel everywhere you go young men preach the gospel everywhere you go you young men preach the gospel you young ladies preach the gospel everywhere you go and if necessary use words did you get that you don't have to talk to preach just live no matter what they think about you young ladies with your long hair but I've been said wear it

most important message that you guys will probably hear amen because that'll help you make the right choices every scriptural example that was giving given amen by people in the Bible amen and it's so important to make those right choices amen because amen it's a blessed way or it's a very cursed way and your whole life depends on how many appreciate that message amen God bless you amen let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus amen remember that every day I don't never forget it amen the one thing you know I I'll just say is I gave my heart to the Lord at around 20 years old amen I'm 60 now and that's one decision amen because I never regret making and the other part is I mean like our brother said when God speaks through your heart he does something amen he changes you for a lifetime amen and you never regret that that experience with almighty God so if I don't have that amen praise the Lord and man one thing by the time he sent me I believe it was or he's told me amen
