we're just so thankful for your presence this morning Lord and Lord as we begin to open the word this morning and minister to your bride I find myself not competent not capable with no ability and Lord and sincerely I I ask Lord that you would just step into this vessel this morning Lord because this is your bride this is your church this is your people that deserve the very best that you can give them Lord and I'm not that [Music] I'm not that at all Lord and I know that and as I bring broken thoughts and broken scriptures and messages that I just pulled together and prayed over and and Lord to me it seems so encouraging but Lord I just want to make sure it's what you want what's your people need so Lord may they just grasp whatever little portion of this service that they need in their life Lord Lord Jesus draw Us close to you as we're here this day the Lord to partake of this communion that's set before us these days always mean special special time for us Lord and we just want to be pleasing to you Lord Jesus in our lives to be what you would have us to be and line up with you and we can only do that through the preaching of the word through the minister of the word that draws us to you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus be with us now in this service we pray amen to be in the house of the Lord this morning if you would have your Bibles turn with me to Saint John chapter 10. has God been good to you this week amen has the devil been mean to you this week well well you're in the battle we're all in a battle Saint John chapter 10 very familiar scripture we look at this and it says the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen you can have your seats may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the word I want to try to take just a portion of time and if you could stay with me and and we're going to do a little bit of teaching a little bit of History a little bit of preaching a little bit different I guess and like I said I feel like myself this is a broken message but I trust that we'll each grass what we have need of in each of Our Lives you know God is he he cares he's concerned he feels and he thinks and he wants you to get what you need in your life to get you in the place that he wants you to be so that you can have a life that is pleasing to him and God wants you to be happy are you with me I want to speak this morning if I were to title this life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I like preaching holidays I've always liked preachers I like preaching Mother's Day and Christmas and and Father's Day and Independence Day so today we're going to look at life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and in order to look at the life liberty and the pursuit of happiness we have to look at Independence and when we think about independence we look at the word independence and it means a state or quality of being independent free from the control are you with me brothers or sisters we're living in a time and a place that Satan has tried his best to put his grasp on us but there was a day over 2 000 years ago on a day on Calvary when the blood of Jesus Christ was shed and the blood of the Lamb come and says you have now your Independence and nobody no power no demon no power out of hell can have any kind of control over you you're free from that that's the kind of Freedom that I need in my life listen to what the prophet says he says just remember the omnipresent God is always present because you know I think about this and I'm going to try to take my time we got two services and I've got a lot here and a lot at home yet to get so I'm just going to take my time brother Byler and looking at this quote the prophet said the omnipresent God is always here present so why would we allow Satan to come into our lives on a daily basis and try to take control of you when God the present God is always present he says God can heal cancer God can heal paralysism whatever it is he's already done it it's a finished work and he's already done it he says if we can just get you to believe it you're not saved today that's what he said you're not saved tonight you've been saved over 2 000 years ago so why would we let Satan come in and begin to get this conflict in our mind and this vital and says you're this or you're that you're not going to make it you're not an overcomer you can't get there because uh the Satan's got his grips on you why do we allow that when we have an omnipresent God that's always present and he says if we can just believe it if we could just accept that salvation 2 000 years ago a finished work he said the devil you know has put you in a pawn shop you've heard him tell this story many times you've been placed into a pawn shop and the devil's placed you there but Jesus came and redeemed you he opened up the doors and the only thing you have to do he says is walk out and claim your Liberty what is Liberty this morning Liberty is freedom Liberty gives you the freedom to serve God to worship God to love people to have joy and peace and long-suffering that's what Liberty and freedom is in the name of Jesus Christ and he gives us that he says every Redemptive blessing was completely finished on Calvary Satan has no more power no more power he's only a bluff with it oh he may appear nasty he may appear a big and hairy and nasty with claws and fangs and horns and a pitchfork however you envision him but he's just a bluff he's just a bluff he has no power legally he says all right he said he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary now that was the price that was paid he's just a bluff he said you can listen to his blob if you want to I refuse to listen to his bluff anymore because I have seen myself in the word and mother word tells me he can't touch me he has no control he I have freedom brothers and sisters we don't have to walk in bondage anymore sin and darkness no longer has his grips on us as Believers we're living in a different day a different time a different different uh atmosphere that is going around the world and that atmosphere is preparing a group abroad of Believers Warriors who will stand up and say Satan has no more control over me because Calvary I was set free and we live in a country that we ought to be able to understand this we live in a country where we're privileged in knowing what Independence means brother Brown talked a lot about America and the country and how privileged we were and we live in a privileged Nation today that we have what many other countries do not have many other countries do not have Liberty they do not have freedom they have the government has the power to do whatever now we know that we're getting in shaky Rocky times and the government is definitely putting its thumb down on us but to the believer they have no control if Satan is controlling the government and the prophet and the word says that the the Satan has no control over us how can the government control us oh that may get you kicked out of a lot of places may get you thrown in jail but it's the truth the government can't control the Christian everything you need everything you want everything you desire as a Christian it's theirs for you and the government can't take it away they didn't give it to you they can't take it away in a couple of days we're going to celebrate this nation is going to celebrate the Fourth of July and in that celebration we're going to find will there be cookouts there'll be Gatherings there will be bonfires there'll be fireworks all over the country and they're celebrating an Independence Day an independence day that was signed in 1776. over 200 years ago 247 I'm not mistaken I'm a bicentennial baby 76. it's easy math when I do it that way but it was signed over 200 almost 50 years ago and in that declaration approved by the Continental Congress these American colonies that came over here they were they were tired of being ruled by Britain let me tell you this some morning we have no reason but I am tired of being ruled by Satan you say well you say you overcome you've got this you got that and we do but he has not done trying to rule the word told us he killed still destroy that's his job and that's what he's going to continue to do and but brothers and sisters it's time that we look the enemy right in the eyes and say devil we are tired of being ruled we are tired of you ruling in our homes we're tired of you ruling in our marriages we're tired of you ruling over our children we are tired of this and I'm going to make a declaration today there was a declaration that was signed our forefathers one to become their own country their own Nation they didn't want to be ruled anymore and we as Believers as Christians we need to look at the Devil and say we want our own country we want our own domain devil and you have no rights in it when we when we make our own domain in Jesus Christ we put up a sign out there that says no trespassing this land is my land God said everywhere The Souls of my feet tried I could possess and I'm going to possess the joy and I'm going to possess happiness and I'm going to possess life devil no trespassing you see sometimes we have to grow in anger in the world can you say that well brother Brown said it's your righteous indignation and he said for you Baptist I'm just angry sometimes we have to get angry at Satan sometimes we have to get furious with Satan and the problem is talking about shamgar we preached on him a lot but here she hears this Army coming to come and destroy his house to destroy what God has given him everything he has walked and worked and possessed now the enemy's coming to take it and the prophets that he hears those the the truths coming and the trumping of the Soldier's feet and he said at that time his righteous gets in the nation begin to rise up and come upon him and he said he got a little bit of fight in him brothers and sisters let me tell you this you can't have life liberty in the pursuit of happiness without some fight in you you don't have to be able to find in this last day you have to be able to stand up and look Satan in the face and say Bring It On My God Is Bigger Than You he said that's what you got to get you got to get a little fighting you a little Backbone in you not a wish phone but a backbone and he said I can't help but think about old buddy Robbins and he said buddy Robin stood out there and he said I tell you what God Lord give me a backbone like a saw log and give me the knowledge and the Gable end of my soul and let me bite the devil as long as I've got a tooth in my mouth and when I don't let me gum him to death fight life liberty and the pursuit of happiness don't let Satan steal your children he said that's the way you got to do it brother you got to get some spunk in you you got to get some spunk in you stand up and claim your god-given privileges thank you ask yourself personally what privileges has God given you that you've allowed Satan to control right now I ask yourself every one of you got something in your mind every one of you has got some thought in your mind and you say Satan's been taught toying around in this portion he's been toying around in this portion he's been toying around in this portion yep are you with me how many is honest raise your hands if Satan has been talking to you and toying with you hands all over the building so we're fighting the Real Enemy this morning we're in a real battle this morning he says oh shangar his righteous signing Nation stood up he looked around he couldn't find nothing because he wasn't a warrior he wasn't a warrior you say well I can't do nothing for God I'm not a preacher God didn't call me to preach God didn't call me to sing God didn't call me to do this Shanghai was not a warrior but when something began to rise up in him when something began to rise up and he must say no more Satan no more Satan and that's what we got to do as Believers I don't care what your role is what God has called you to do let that righteous indignation rise up in you and say no matter what God's called me to do one thing I can do is fight the devil he said he grabbed out of ox code with that brass lump on it and he said he must use it sometimes to clean the plow and he used it sometimes to punch the cattle through the gate he said but oh he was sick and tired with a Philistines coming he said aren't you tired mother aren't you tired sister listen he's talking to the people now aren't you tired brother aren't you tired sister aren't you tired young man young lady aren't you tired aren't you tired of God I need God to come in your life aren't you tired but Satan has come in and begins to toy and rule in your mind the greatest Battlefield he said oh my you say I can't walk I can't do this I can't do that God bless your heart now in the South that's not really a good saying that means uh you're mistaken in your in your thoughts right there bless your heart well so-and-so's this way and that way will bless their heart that's a nice way of saying uh they need to make some changes believe and shamgar said I'm sick and tired of it although I'm not a war a warrior odd stacked against me no matter how much they are stacked against you God is for you if you'll take his word oh before the Declaration of Independence was signed America was part of the Kingdom of Great Britain in the 1600s people came from Great Britain to settle down in North America ever started out with 13 colonies I won't name them you probably know your history well enough 13 colonies began to form up and and over time these 13 colonies began to grow and they begin to get stronger and they begin to get United I wonder why we're called the United States of America and they begin to grow and they begin to unite but then Britain began to look at this and said hey I don't like the way this is going and these uprising of this Colonies begin to look at this and say hey we don't like the way this is going either you're mistreating us you're treating us unfairly how many would look at it this morning and say Satan has treated me unfairly yeah can anybody say Satan's ever treated you fair I want to see you I want to I want to shake your hand and we need to talk nobody can Satan has treated us fairly Britain was not treating the Americans fairly they begin to charge taxes upon their tea you know what Britain's like tea time crumpets and tea at certain times of the day am I right brother John certain times a day we're drinking tea right they didn't like it when the government said I'm going to tax you for the things you like how many times has Satan looked at you and said you could have this this and this but you got to give me this oh yeah you know he'll do you that way because that's the way he did Jesus I'll give you all the kingdoms if you'll just give me you so Satan begins to give you anything and let you buy with anything you want and man it seems like fun pleasure is fun it's enjoyable until it's over and Satan comes in there and he begins to tax us and taxes and taxes now watch what else the the American people were not happy about they were not happy because the government said when our British soldiers come into the land of America you've got to give them free passage into your house you've got to let these British soldiers into your homes you have to feed them are you with me don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about because I know you know where I'm going with this Satan begins to creep his way into our homes it says I belong here so are you under a governmental rule are you under the rule of God you see these britons they want to keep pushing their way in taxing and taxing and invading our homes that sounds just like the Satan I know he constantly take it from me and taxing me and taking my children and taking my joy and taking my love and taking my peace and taking my job and taking my marriage you can relate to one of those and many many more and these columnists As Americans they had to follow the law they they had to do something but these laws they couldn't go anymore they said we can't do this anymore we're going to have to do something to change this and so a war Springs up and a war begins to take place but fighting wasn't enough fighting the Bible on their own wasn't enough so they decided we're going to get together oh they gonna have a church meeting we're going to have a church meeting we're going to get together we're going to bring all the brothers together and we're going to get a talk and we're going to pray we're gonna how can we take our country back how can we gain our independence and they begin to look at this and Thomas Jefferson leads a group of men and they begin to write a declaration of independence and they're declaring to France their allies and the other people around the world they can be friends with them we're no longer going to be ruled by this government brothers and sisters there's been a declaration written today and that declaration says you no longer have to be ruled under the government of Hell Satan his demon his Wizards his witches you no longer have to be ruled under that Dominion praise be to God and because of that this Declaration of Independence is now recognized around the world as a declaration of Freedom a declaration of independence and the second sentence says it all that Tom Thomas Jefferson coined he says we're created equally it doesn't matter if you're a preacher it doesn't matter if you're a prophet it doesn't matter if you're the janitor you have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness God wants us to be living vessels let me tell you brothers and sisters the only place that there will be death is hell there's where the separation takes place God wants us to be Lively vessels God wants us to be praise for vessels God wants us to be worshiping vessels alive and living and free to do what God would have us to do to praise and worship God and spread the word of the Gospel around the world foreign Jesus says a thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy bye I am calm that they may have life and they may have it more abundantly let's break us down just a little bit then we're going to get into some characters when Jesus begins to say this according to these words this thief comes in to steal to kill and destroy everything good in your life everything good in your life he wants to destroy your job your joy your happiness your health your finances your marriage your kids and he wants to ruin anything he can if he can get his hands on it and when we look at the word Thief it comes from a Greek word called klepto how many has ever heard of a kleptomaniac klepto and that word klepto means to steal it's like a bandit or a pickpocketer you know you've seen these videos I've seen videos in the past where these professional pickpocketers you don't know they've got your billfold you don't know that they've got your watch you don't know that they've got your ring you don't know that they've got your socks they're good they walk through the streets and they can bump into you and the next thing you know your wallet is gone and you're like work how often does Satan hit us in that kind of fashion how often do Satan just come and you're walking down the road and everything happy you're with your family everything's good you're joyous maybe you're on vacation and it's just a wonderful time and bump and all of a sudden everybody's mad at everybody yeah some of you looking at me smiling you know what I'm talking about you had set off on a trip and everybody's just happy we're going to Florida we're going to Disney we're going to wherever the next thing you know these two are fighting at these two and these things what happened there was a kleptomaniac got in your vehicle Satan come in and bumped into you and said Riot chaos confusion I'm taking their joy and their happiness and their peace klepto this kleptomaniac means it's a person that's very cunning and Sly and sneaky and the way that he steals from the people the devil knows if he just outrightly if he come up to you and spoke to you sister Patty said I'm let me tell you I'm fixing to take your joy what would you say no if he come and knocked on your door and said I'm fixing to take your children down a road that you'll never get them back what would you say sister Tammy no if they knocked on your door you heard about the rattlesnakes I'm going to give you a box of rattlesnakes what would you do you'd send them back same thing on this contrast if he come in and said I'm going to take this from you or I'm going to take this from you you would say no but he's Sly and he's cunning and he comes in here and he begins to work his way in and weasel his way in that you never knew it happened many times until the damage is oh now now you see why we got to guard ourselves so much while we have to guard our hearts so much why we have to be the Holy Ghost for our children until they get it oh these people letting their kids run anywhere they want to go it's pathetic well we see um I won't say I'll just say it this way little girls on Facebook dressing in such ways that would make a grown man blush where is the holy ghost in the home it's not there Satan has crept in and he snuck in and he's beginning to take and he begins to say I'll just I'll just remove this I can remove that it's just an inch here it's just an inch there and before you know it huh naked and don't even know it well that wasn't in my note so it's free for somebody that's wise parents I just keep getting the pull here that's wise parents we have to make sure whether we want to be in church or not that we are sitting in the pews every service the door is open why is that it may not be few you may be solid but your kids your little boys your little girls they need to know a god they need to know God that you know don't stay out of church your children are too important we put so much importance on so many things but your children that you are raising God do you realize God has granted you the privilege to Bear children and to be fathers and mothers to children in this day and says raise them right teach them right and when they get older they will not depart and then we wonder why our kids sometimes go down roads and we think how did they get there I went to church once a month help me help me preach foreign he don't come at you outright this word klepto is a person who has uncontrollable urges to thieve he can't help himself sane can't help this self it's an uncontrollable urge that he has that says I've got to take from him I've got to take from him I got to take from them persistent neurotic impulsive behavior to steal he can't help but still it's his impulse not only does he come to steal but he says he comes to kill now listen to this this word kill here has a little different connotation than murder stabbing shooting no this connotate this connotation here of the word uh uh to it means to sacrifice when it's talking about killing here it's talking about the old time religion where they used to have the animals to come up and sacrifice on the altar so the word kill here means to sacrifice so what is he trying to get you to do he's trying to get you to surrender oh he's trying to get you to give up something what's he trying to get you again get up something he could let me tell you he knows you better than you know you we think we know ourselves we think we know our limitations we think we know what we can do and get by with and not get hooked in come on Church Satan knows better than what you do and when he can't steal it from you he's going to get you to sacrifice it and say oh well God gave me this but this ain't going good so I'm fixing to give it back um if he hadn't walked away with your your belongings he's going to get you to again give it up you see he can't accept that you possess any kind of blessing once the devil fights you the hardest well he does that but when things are going good right business is good home is good kids are good life is good and then he comes knocking he's not a vacuum cleaner salesman knocking on your door now it looks like you're doing pretty good in life buddy can we sit down and have a cup of coffee maybe turn on the evening news maybe he can get you to turn the channel maybe you find yourself looking at things you shouldn't be looking at man is is this Micah brother Micah can can you hear me can can you turn this up a little I'm just kidding [Applause] and you find yourself involved in situations that are not pleasing to God and you are partaking you find yourself enjoying oh come on and he's he's got you there in such a way that he simply don't want you to have love anymore so you sacrifice the very things you love as Satan comes to destroy this word here means to ruin to waste to trash to devastate so if he can't take it from you or get you to give it to him he's just gonna trash it you know well man how could he do that what what how could how could he what kind of avenues could he go to our young people are vulnerable you took a young Christian lady young Christian man young man virtuous how Satan would love to destroy that virtue you say Well it wouldn't happen to mine be careful I've seen so many people around this message say if that was my kid 10 years later that's their kid what is that it's Satan coming in there and he begins to say hey I can't get them to quit Church they're there every service I can't get them to to go and do things in the world because they they go to church every Sunday can't get them to go to the movies or the bowling alleys I can't get them to go to those places but what I can do is I can get them to compromise on what they believe it's okay to cut your hair it's okay young ladies to to kiss this young man because he really loves you lie you don't know what love is until you've been married for a few months years you don't know what love is until you've been through some hard times that's why we have divorces all around America all around the world a divorce rate's higher than it's ever been ever and it continues to rise is because they don't know how to get through hard times they don't know what that true love really is they've never had to get down there and fight through it and fight and say this is my marriage Satan this is my home Satan you say man I live 20 30 years of the first 20 30 years of my marriage was nothing but hell on Earth but you made it yeah you've been allowed Satan to come in and to destroy it we have couples in this church I know couples around this country that they begin to fight and when I say fight they fought but after that fight was over they began to fight for one another they found themselves in church they found themselves in front of a pastor a god-filled pastor they got wisdom they got knowledge and they begin to pray and they thought and said Satan you will not destroy my home foreign because sometimes Satan's already got a hold of one too far you notice I said they they fought they fought for their marriage it takes more than just one if we were to read John chapter 10 verse 10 and put it into a a easy to translate interpretation this is the way it would read the thief wants to get his hands into every good thing in your life in fact his pickpocket is looking for an opportunity to wiggle his way so deeply into your personal affairs that he can walk off with everything you hold precious and dear and that's not at all when he's finished stealing all your goods and possession he'll take his plan to rob you blind to the next level he'll create conditions and situations so horrible that you'll see no way to solve the problem except to sacrifice everything that remains from his previous attacks yeah the goal of this thief is to totally waste and devastate your life if nothing stops him he'll leave you insolvent flat broke cleaned out in every area of your life you'll end up feeling as if you are finished and out of business make no mistake the enemy's ultimate aim is to obliterate you you does that clarify that scripture for you who brothers and sisters thank God that the verse don't stop there thank God that the verse don't stop there but Jesus speaks up and says wait a minute hold up we're not done yet don't get discouraged don't get depressed let me tell you ah ah say it with me I am come that they may have life and have it more abundantly when you look at that word abundant it means it means uh life Jesus's very life Zoe you heard the prophet talk about Zoe God's own life living on the inside it's God's life on the inside God's Freedom God's Liberty God's happiness living on the inside so if we would continue that scripture in layman's terms it would say but Jesus came that I might have keep and constantly retain a Vitality Augusto a vigorous zest for living that Springs up from deep down inside of me and then he came that I might Embrace this unrivaled unequaled muchless incomparable richly loaded overflowing life to the ultimate happiness let's give him a phrase clap this morning that's what God wants for you ultimate happiness ultimate maximum satisfaction in the word and God I think we're on time I think you say brothers and sisters there'll be times when the devil no matter how strong you are no matter how rooted you are no matter how faithful you are no matter how much Zoe you got he's going to come and push our buttons and he's going to push this button and he's going to push that button and he's going to encourage this thought and that thought you're not you're not up you're not a a uh immune to it he's coming for you you say well I'm in church this morning I feel the Holy Ghost this morning he's coming for you but whenever these attacks occur that's when we got to tell the devil shut up you know I hate that word shut up I never would let my kids tell each other that you don't tell nobody shut up that's that's bad but to the devil I say shut up I'm not biting at your bait no more you can go fishing all you want you can't throw enough different colors at me you know how fishing works I'm coming to find out if they ain't biting you better change bait if they ain't biting the spinner you throw a plug if they ain't buying a plug you throw a worm if any biting blue you throw red if they ain't buying red you throw clear and it don't matter brothers and sisters what Satan throws the lure in front of your face and begins to entice you and jiggle and wiggle you say Satan I'm not biting any more no fishing foreign he wants you defeated he wants you sick he wants you depressed he wants you down in the dumps miserable can we get into my fault now you say how do I get this life and Liberty in the pursuit of happiness where can we find this in the Bible how can we find somebody who let everything else go and went on a journey to happiness turn with me in the Book of Ruth I think it's right after judges it's kind of four pages there say Amen when you got Ruth don't be fibbing I still hear Pages turning praise the Lord I'm just saying if you're awake Ruth chapter one let's go to verse 14. and they lifted up their voice and wept again and ortha kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her and she said behold my sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods return Thou after thy says their law Naomi's telling Ruth go whack with orpha Bible scholars think these two were actually sisters go back with your sister go back with your sister however you want to put it they knew each other for many many years they were both moabites go back with her go back to your people go back to your Gods go back to your mother and Ruth and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wither thou goest I will go where I thou lodges I will Lodge and thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou diced Naomi I'll die and where you're buried I'll bury the Lord so do me and more also if ought but death part thee in me we're looking at the Book of Ruth here and when you look at the Book of Ruth you can see a journey of Sorrow a famine of hurt and pain and you see a journey that has taken a place and it's taken somebody uh down a road that was so much hurt involved that they begin to find life and in that life they begin to live and then they begin to find Liberty some freedom and in that freedom they begin to find what happiness so here we are there's a famine that breaks out in devastates Bethlehem Naomi and her husband they sojourn into Moab and these these uh Naomi and her husband and the two boys go into into the land of Moab and they find two young women and they begin to marry so they get married and they're going on about their business and they take these wives Ruth and orpa but after a decade or so these women are left alone Naomi's husband dies roof's husband dies orpa's husband dies and so here they are find themselves all alone and Naomi hearing about a faith uh about the faithfulness of God to his people back in her Homeland she says they beginning to prosper there's nothing for me here in the land of Moab of the moabites I'm going to go back to my land you girls stay here orpa and Ruth both say no we'll go with you Naomi then again a bag that says no you go back you stay here you don't go with me you stay right here you go back to your people go back to your gods but Ruth says don't press me to go and abandon you and the Bible says she clave and I've loved that word since the first time I've read it in the scripture years and years ago I preached this several times and Ruth clave to Naomi she grabbed the whole time her brothers and sisters sometimes in life you just have to grab a hold of the promises of God you just gotta grab a hold of what God has given you and what God has promised you and say no matter what I Won't Let Go you say Satan's a toying with my children I Won't Let Go Satan's toying with my marriage I Won't Let Go and Ruth had that passion about her I won't let go of you Naomi I'm gonna go where you go the Bible says that orpha she went by back to her old people and she kissed Naomi goodbye see you later I'm going back to my people I'm going back to my gods um see sometimes when hardship comes there's where you see where people's at do they clave to God or do they kiss God goodbye you'll find out what you're made of when you go through the hard times Brother David and I were talking he said this week's been a battle foreign and I made the mistake one of the very few I shouldn't say the very few times I've made a mistake I've made many mistakes but one thing I never do I don't talk about what I'm going to preach well we have is about a five hour drive on the road the other day and I just tell Joyce what I'm going to preach devil oh boy did he hear he began to nitpick he began to cause every problem he began to throw up obstacles my wife bless her I love her with all my heart and she knows what I'm about to say she thinks that when we go on trips you wait till you get where you're going to get a hotel let me tell you you don't do that when Cincinnati Reds are playing in Cincinnati and Taylor Swift is in Cincinnati we didn't know the Reds were playing and we sure didn't know Taylor Swift was performing we had to go pick Carson up my wife has a habit of finding us the not so nice the hotels let's just say I've been on many missionary trips in the United States of America so we we're driving she said they're in a hotel nowhere around holiday ends if you could find one within 20 miles was 600 a night Taylor Swift Ross a expensive group of people she says I found one she's talking this woman on the phone on speakerphone and I'll take some blame too because I don't like to drive around looking for hotels and Lord I don't know why I'm on this tangent it'll help somebody and so she says I found one it's a hundred and eleven dollars get it it's the only one get it get it she got it we pull up to this Motel Six the the soft it's falling off the side of it and the Lord only knows what kind of crowd will stay in there we go in check in I'm not saying anything I thought well it's gonna be all right it's gonna be all right here we go start walking up the stairs and just the smell of just the smile is enough to knock you and I'm talking open-air stairs it's enough to just about Knock You Down and we just continue to go to our room and she puts the key in on the keypad opens up the door first thing I see is the bedspreads got a tear in it not to mention the smell inside that room we walk in and I'm holding my bags I'm not putting nothing down listen I'm a nurse I've seen bed bugs I know what they do I know how they infest so I'm holding my bags I got my shoes or my bag and I'm standing there on this and I'm looking and there's hair on the floor there's dirt on the floor and there's stuff smeared on the walls I said I can't do this I can't do this she said well you're gonna have to go get their money back then so I go down there and the young man at the counter listen I said we've made a mistake I said we we the room's just not it's not okay I said it smells I said we don't smoke we're not smokers he said you got a smoking room I said no no no no I didn't order a smoking room the woman on the phone must have gave us that and so we're going on about our business there and finally he says okay you can have it back so he gives us our credit minus the fee for the booking agency or whatever so now the devil begins to poke at me you don't have a room you're gonna have to drive an hour back to Lexington and I'm thinking now there's a room somewhere Priceline Expedia hotels.com I'm going down through our 600 500 300 400 500 oh man she says I found one I said okay the dab up against the Poke is making me angry we had a very good trip on the way up until I told her what I was going to preach and he begins to poke and prod so long story short we get into one that at least we can feel somewhat comfortable about laying down in and and uh I got up take a shower the next time I wouldn't I I wouldn't pull my shoes off I was walking around in my tennis shoes all night and it's I took a shower and I put a spread of towel out in the bottom of the I said I would have took if I did if I hadn't wanted to ruin my tent I've been afraid to ruin my tennis shoes I took a shower in my tennis shoes but we made it but that's the way the devil is he begins to poke and he begins to prod and he begins to to get at you and you're in your home and in your children and he begins to get these things to bowl up and and Bowl up inside of you and and Orba chose to go back to her people to hurt gods but Ruth says no I'm not going to let go and Ruth is sitting there and she's holding on you know the easier Road for Ruth you know what it would have been the easy Road it would have been to go back with orpha she already had people there you had family there she had friends there she could have found another man and got married and went on about her own Pagan life and business that would have been the easy way but she wanted something more than what orpo wanted she has something down on the inside and said I want every promise that I've seen in the life of you Naomi I want every promise that God has to give us I'll go with you I'm gonna try to tell this story real quick stay with it yeah brother Ron towed it last night I'm taking a different aspect of it he told it last night at brother or Donnie's meetings and so if you've heard it last night that's where you heard it he says just to show that God will respect those who hunger and thirst for righteousness when we go out there and he said I was out there at these chartered buses and I heard a noise he was at a meeting as you researched he was at a meeting and there was thousands of people and to come to find out they were calling for him to come back to the platform or to somebody with an ambulance or something and he went to the ambulance and they said we need to come back to the platform and the guy that was with him and ushering through the through the meeting said no there's over 2 000 people between you and that platform you can't go back and so he's standing there in his looks and he says I see this young colored girl like nicely dressed in Arkansas and he said she was blind and she was trying to find her way around calling for Papa he said I noticed her because uh she was kind of tall she was saying oh papa where are you and feeling with her hands somebody please help me find Papa and he said I stood there and no one knew me at that place and he said they've had meeting going on in the temple and nobody knew me standing outside there and she said somebody please help me find my papa and nobody seemed to pay attention to her and I said I was standing still watching her and she come moving through the crowd and I thought that old blind Anna in the Temple when she prayed so long he said I Stood Still and this young woman come moving up and she finally she staggered right into me and said pardon me and she started again and I said who are you looking for young lady and she said sir I'm looking for my papa she said we've come over here from Memphis to see the Healer so my papa was trying to find a way for me to get in and he told me to stand still but they pushed me out of my place and I've lost where I was standing I'm blind and I can't find my way back would you be so kind to help me to the bus where Papa can find me prophesied now this seems like being being a hypocrite but I said what did you say you came over here to see she said I came to see the Healer she said you see I've been blind for years and I've heard on the radio this morning of a man who who got his sight and and Papa's Got the money and he got it ready and he charged us a bus to come over here and see this man who at these meetings and and but now I can't even get near the building and I said this is a prophet you don't believe in such stuff as that do you and I said in the days when we got such fine doctors and she said but you see sir they can't do me no good you mean to tell me that you believe that the prayer of a man would do something for you and she said and she said it like this and I'll never forget it she said I tell you what I'll what I'll do if you'll just help me to get to where this man is then I'll find my papa and he's a what a rebuke to me and he said I thought of old Fanny Crosby blind and writing the song pass me an auto Gentle Savior hear my humble cry and he said there was things going on in the temple and he said I looked at her and I said maybe I'm the one that you're supposed to see he said see how God locks things just exactly right he said while I was taken in the back she grabbed the lapels of my coat like that and she said are you the Healer can you imagine the prophet of the hour standing outside in a crowd of 2 000 people and a young black girl in the 60s 50s 60s 50s I think in Arkansas grabbing a hope to this man by the lapel of his coat it says are you the Healer I said no sister I'm not I'm just your brother I want to see the healers you said he said I'll tell you what I hope someday you'll see him and I believe you will and she said what's your name and he said my name is brother Branham she said you're the one I want to see yeah and brother Brown said I couldn't pull her hands off of my lapel I couldn't pull her off she was holding on for dear life here stands this young black little young lady been blind most of her life if not all of it and she's grabbed the hold of the prophet of the hour and she's holding on for dear life brothers and sisters that's what it means to grab a halt of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness she grabbed a hole cause she wouldn't let go and she said I she said he said all I can do is pray for you if you'll believe and she said that's all I can do all you can do pray for me and he says just he said I was sitting there and we bowed our heads and we were praying and I heard a scream he said I heard a scream and she ran out into the lot throwing people one way and throwing people another way and she was crying out and screaming I who was once blind can now see [Applause] life liberty The Pursuit of Happiness she held on for what she had need of she held on for happiness she held on for freedom from the blind eyes of Satan laughs Ruth was determined to accompany Naomi and they set themselves towards Bethlehem and they arrived in the land and The Barley Harvest was going on and Ruth goes out to glean in a field of a man named Boaz come to find out Boaz is a relative of Naomi isn't that something how God works things out and Ruth working out there Boaz looks and sees this young beautiful woman and said whose young woman is this and they said oh Lord don't you know this is the young moabite who came with Naomi I've heard her and Boaz speaks to Ruth that tells her you stay in my fields you stay in my fields and I'm going to offer my hand of protection over you Ruth you don't have to worry about nobody stealing your wheat you don't have to worry about nobody stealing your food your happiness your love your peace because I have heard what you have done I have had a complete account I've had a complete account of what you've done for your mother-in-law after her husband's death I know what you've done I know you've left mother and father and family and friends and your gods and your people I know what you have done and I'm going to make sure you find the full reward for what you've got coming oh brothers and sisters God has a way of taking care of his people it may look dire it may look like there's no hope it may look like all things are stacked against you but God will provide Ruth comes back to her mother-in-law it says listen Naomi let me tell you what happened in the field today and Naomi looks back and says did you say Boaz that's a cousin of mine that's a that's a Kinsmen of mine I'm related to him let me tell you what you need to do you need to go into the threshing floor tonight and as Boaz begins to sleep you lay down there at his feet and you lay down there on his uncovered feet let's see what happens now can you imagine this young lady in a Strange Land and her mother-in-law who believes I look different than she does she says let me tell you what you need to do you need to go there and lay your head at the feet of this man that you just met today startled Boaz wakes up and throws back and he's looking he says who are you and she says I am your servant Ruth would you spread your wing your cloak over your servant spread your cloak over you for you are Our Redeemer Boaz the prophet said representing Christ he goes into the City and he he didn't want this girl to get away and he asked who she belonged to and he said he goes down there and he says now I'm about to redeem all of her possessions thank you everything that the Satan has taken from you every heartache that he's caused you every day of depression and stress and sickness and anxiety that he has put in his pocket that belongs to you God says Boaz says I've got to go and redeem all of those possessions everything that's been taken everything that's been lost everything that's been destroyed everything that's been in Ruins I have to restore it all and the promise that here is Boaz a type of Christ and he goes down there and says I got to redeem it the law requires it and he asked is there anybody else in this city capable of redeeming this woman and the Bible says there was one could have but he wasn't capable and Boaz says they're mine all the land that her husband owned oh all of the possessions all of the cattle all of the sheep all of the oxen everything that they owned is now the and nobody can tell aren't you thankful brothers and sisters aren't you thankful that everything that you ever lost in your life is laying right there and God says it's yours and nobody can touch it he says what will a young man do for a Young Bride for he wants for his sweetheart oh he's blind he said he'll do anything for her he'll do anything for her he'll do anything she wants there's nothing that can stop him because he's got to have her and that was Boaz and that was Christ to his bride he looks at you and says I'll do anything I'll bankrupt Heaven I'll go to the cross and die for you thank you he redeemed her back to everything she had in Christ on that Old Rugged Cross hang in there and go Gotham paid the sin penalty we're about to take this communion and as he was hanging there on that Old Rugged Cross it says he was wounded yeah I did that I get that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for ironically that was me you know a lot of times people they don't want hard preaching they can't handle the prophet they can't handle those people that preach that way I was telling Joyce we got the serious radio and Billy Graham Channel and it enlightened me of what kind of man Billy Graham was he said I'm the one I'm the one that put him on that cross I'm the one that bruised him I'm the one and then he looked out there and he said you're the one you're the one that bruised him you're the one that wounded him but it was for your Liberty he hangs on the cross of galgotha everything in the human race lost in Adam is redeemed when Christ himself became Ken's Folk you say I'm Just a Nobody my family is this my family is that we're Renegades now you can't spoke if you've been to Calvary you're in Spoke if you can accept cross if you can go to the food of the Cross today and grab a host of it as Ruth did to Naomi and cleave on to that cross laughs brother sisters Ruth is an example of how God can take a hopeless situation and turn it into something glorious no matter how hopeless your life seems today I'm just getting a real pool for a struggle somebody is struggling somebody's struggling with where they're living in their life and I'm not I'm not here trying to point and prophesive I'm just telling you God's laid it on my heart if you're that person there's a Kinsman and it's never too late if God's tugging at your heart if God is tugging at your heart saying this ain't right in your life brother sister if this ain't right if your family's hurting here if your children's hurting there if you're not doing this you know to do better that's my iniquity that's my transgression and he hung on that cross so that I don't have to bear it any more I'm not only free from Satan's grasp and the clenches of Satan in my life but I'm free from the mistakes that I made the wrongs I've done the lies I've told the mistreating I said the words I've said the hurt have caused others when you look at red on red you see white foreign there's only a special people and I'm closing but I got to make this point orpa was a king was a daughter of a king of Moab and her name orpa means the nape of neck that's this part right here and the reason that she's carries that name you know every name in the Bible has a biblical meaning of scriptural meaning and the reason that she's been known as orpah the nape of the neck is because when she was addressed face to face with Naomi earned her back and showed her the nape of her neck and she walked a lonely dark Road not mentioned anymore in the Bible there's there's suggestions in Jewish writings and Jewish tablets we won't get into that but let's be a Ruth a Ruth whose name means passionate friend you know there's something about Jesus there's something about God that when you can look at him and he's more than just God he's more than just Jesus but he's friend brother Joe prays it a lot and he says Lord my friend you're my friend he cares friends care Lord Make Me A Ruth today let's stand to our feet this should bow our heads before we go to the communion turn it to brother Byler Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for the service today thank you for the words that you've spoken to our hearts this morning Lord we just trust that the blessings were received that there was tugs placed on hearts there was corrections made where people need correcting and myself included Lord we just need more of you we want to be right we want to be correct in our walk with you in all things we do in all words we say and make us have a heart like a heart of Ruth clave to what she needed to the clave for the belongings that was promised to her Lord we thank you for Calvary we thank you for the shed blood that covers all of our sins and Lord as we get ready to take this communion we just ask the Lord that you would look at us through Clear Eyes Lord that our conscience will be

Calvary right into the communion this morning if you will turn your Bibles to First Corinthians First Corinthians the 11th chapter verse 23 we'll read Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup money adds up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you
