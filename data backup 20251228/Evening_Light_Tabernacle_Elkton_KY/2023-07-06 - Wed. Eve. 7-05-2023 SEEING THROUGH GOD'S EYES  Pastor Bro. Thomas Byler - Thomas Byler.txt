look through those glasses hey man my wife will throw him away and she says you use them for the wrongs hey I don't ever want to see you again oh my God by the women's classes didn't belong on the man isn't that right but that's the glasses that people look through aren't you glad that you can look through the right glasses glasses aren't you glad that you've got eyes you've got the right the right mind folk I'm telling you right now it's just oh my I wanna I wanna tell you here in a minute I want to try to tell you but listen even the Nations listen to what he says about America let's see what he says about China Hitler look at the power he had and look what he thought he could do is that right Japan Never Was Defeated from what I understand and man they were going to fight to the last child right they had they were training the women over there sword fighting they man they were gonna if we invade their Homeland amen we're gonna have to lose a couple more million men if we have to invade even though we had all the islands and everything pretty much what we're just gonna have to lose all of that if it wouldn't have been from the nuclear bomb right but it was so bad they had to you know but I don't care what it is I don't care if it's Russia I don't care if it's America but God says it's about him behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket they are counted as the small dust of a balance oh my listen what he says all nations before him are as nothing they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity how many knows all of this hype all of these bricks of all of these great they don't mean nothing to God I don't care how powerful a nation now I don't know how much Dukes they got It Don't Mean a Thing didn't build the shades are involved those people I may remember that hour they were the most most powerful Nations it was they were having a party because they were all secured by the preached a message on them amen they thought they were all secure but at the same time there was a they meant another Army I believe it was amen there the grecians are one of them amen they were coming and they were deflecting their detouring the river and they already was coming underneath the walls through that place amen and they were coming in it don't matter to God would wipe you out you know man he'll take a one-man he'll take one man Moses and wipe out a whole Egypt he'll take one Samson and just take a whole Army on it and be a whole army with one man it don't mean nothing to God and that God is in you how many believes that that God is in me Nick out of fear nothing fear not for I am with you how many how many times that that's all you really need huh fear not for I Am With You Always even to the end of the world man just to believe that and to know that's true wow glorious is that amen God Specializes and the way that God looks is things is how you and I need to look at things amen Paul said in First Corinthians he says the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it's the power of God to one Amen to preaching you're going to church the church for some people it don't mean much but how about you tonight it's the very power of God oh God the foolishness of preaching um sometimes come on folks let's not just come and fold around well we're here on a Wednesday night again and we want to hear Brother Byler preaches Herman and so forth how many knows it needs to be a whole lot more than that foreign we need to come get something from God go a bitter people than what we've come amen oh my praise the Lord now notice down on uh but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greek's foolishness but unto them that are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men amen I see Moses coming on a mule don't you I see him coming in front of pharaoh amen and tell him Pharaoh Pharaoh it's time to live all the slaves go set them free huh can you imagine how foolish Pharaoh thought that this man was you and what army who do you represent almighty God you have no Army he didn't believe he's God isn't that right Moses said no it's just me and God that's it fear would like what he didn't take it seriously he thought it was foolish what foolishness didn't even read about him talking about Moses and and Sephora Sephora his wife's going down there hey where are you going Moses we're going down to Egypt take over honey all right praise the Lord we're going over this way oh no that's right what are you doing I'm going out and take over I'm calm down go set the captain's free God is appointed me to be the deliverer didn't even Moses mother say God has raised you up to be a deliverer God was going to use him to deliver Israel amen but God did it have to ask the Pentecostals he didn't have to ask godmission to ask everybody amen if he could send him a prophet or not God sin is a prophet and God come down and vindicate and proved him oh my wasn't nobody gonna stop him and he challenged every one of them 70 preachers with phds and llds and everything else he could have him sitting in the congregation he'd say some more llds and DDS you have that just means you're that much further away from God good and had to sting don't you ever think that brother Branham didn't preach and people were it was stinging I would sting one time he got this he went and said let's take our Bibles to where Paul said I was not a disobedient to the heavenly vision when Paul would talk about his vision and of Christ and what he said to him because they knew that he was going to say and tell him about how that the angel came and told him don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way forever work for you to do he's this whole bench or so left as soon as he mentions those things huh didn't anyone hear it and yet they claimed to love the Lord amen oh my all right let me finish this I want to go to Revelations 3 yet all right the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see you're calling better and how that that many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble or called but God has chosen to foolish things of the world confound the wise when he picked David when he let little David go and defeat that Goliath that's what God was doing he was taking the foolish things even his brother thought that he was mischievous he just wanted to come and see the battle can I preach that's what a lot of people do a lot of people just come to see the battle you come to the church maybe to see the battle and see somebody else Rejoice or praise the Lord but I want you to know I didn't come to see the battle I come to defeat the enemy I'm in here to defeat the anime I'm not mischievous I'm not the sound wanting to see the battle I'm gonna get right up in the middle of it I'm gonna go out there and say that Goliath not just facing but I'm gonna take his hand and I'm gonna stand there on the hill and I'm sure all the armies a man of Israel that you can take his hand because when God is behind you who can be against you how many please we've got the promise of Romans 8 of God before us who can be against us what can separate you from the love of God tribulation persecute look to God I know nothing will ever separate you there's nothing that we can Rejoice more in knowing that God I didn't foreign whom he justified he is also already glorified if you believe it that you're a Son of God and you are Son of God and you believe in predestination the foreknowledge but if you're not if you're not saved I dare say it's the scariest thought that you ever thought can you imagine not being saved and knowing that people are ordained to life have their names already written God predestinate them to be saved he chosen before the foundation of the world because we all know for knowledge our predestination looks the foreknowledge for knowledge she looks to Destiny isn't it right amen so we pray God don't predestinate anything but what he knew what was happening already that he can say look you know I heard Rachel weeping for her children but I'm gonna send my angels to Joseph Mary and say go go get on out of here get on out of here because fear pharaoh and them uh herod's not going to kill Jesus he's not going to get him amen so you love him praise be to God amen well I think that's 40 minutes can I have another flower bar or another five ten if I want thank you brother Glenn praise be to God quick one quick one over in Revelations if you'll remember amen over in Revelations 3 it says you know uh well let's just read it I'm not too good at my memorization notice verse 17 it says because thou sayest I am rich and increase with Goods amen boy we can stop there for an hour how many of those men there is so much Goods out there have you ever seen so many Goods did you know that uh this can big containers fall off in the ocean and people cut into them and you know they lose containers out in the ocean full of stuff I mean and just there's just stuff everywhere isn't there the whole world is increased in with Goods it's just simply increase with Goods and they say they're rich they have increased in goods and they have need of nothing amen but notice how God looks at it isn't that right that's what they see in themselves that they're okay but when God looks at them he says Thou knows not that you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're blind and you're naked how many blades that I I wrote down here let me see whether I wrote something about if you're not rich in him then you are poor there's only one true richest statement that is to be rich in Christ why because all these things will fade away but the riches of Christ is eternal oh my you can buy Chevy I bought me a nice Chevy I finally got to buy me a nice Chevy Hallelujah don't buy a parking lot and my wife says now you need to be looking for a nice doctor I like the color is it you know it didn't have the nice screen you know showed my backing up I want the backup you know and all that other stuff make a long story short it was in the months and all the paint's flaking off of my off of my hood so I'm driving around with flake flaky I got a flaky shabby nothing lasts I don't get years ago and it's all gone all right maybe that David hold that off the garbage believe yourself that's the one we did nothing you cared amen that you turn off that's what we Rejoice over things that are Eternal being rich in God that's what's important him and they saw themselves as rich and decreased with Goods but they didn't realize that they had put him on the outside of the door I mean that was the world put Christ on the outside of the door churches put him on the outside of the door oh let me preach let me tell you something when we look Through The Eyes Of God Amen the Bible I mean brother bam said you know they claim that they're making this world a better place to live in but in the eyes of God it's only a better place to sin in not all is it a better place to sit in but if Satan's actually eating amen this is the devil's heaven this is the devil's heaven we know that this is the best the devil's ever going to have it this is the best where all everything's legal they didn't want to please they don't want no law they don't want no police Brother Brad said he's lawlessness will prevail there'll be all kinds of lawlessness go on hey man they don't want no law at all they didn't want no rules at all wow and if the Supreme Court Justices don't vote their way huh did you hear that they want to cancel them they don't want them there you know it's got to go their way don't care one bit about the laws or whatever it's just their agenda huh praise be to God there he is in the eyes of God this place is the devil's eating the Satan is amen the the master of it he's got his wife the mother of harlots is his bride and Abominations of the earth that's the way God sees it oh my but aren't you glad in the midst of all that God is getting a church out of it he's getting you ready he's getting me ready you come out of that system you come out of the church you're seeing what he said about being justified is that's all you've never done amen you're not an adulteress you're not Wicked you're not all of that you're the pure virtuous unadulterate the Bride of Jesus Christ God has a church like that that's what this message will produce it will produce those who see it the way God sees it and believes it believes it thinks the way God thinks amen if you think like him you're going to see like him if you see like him you're gonna talk like him maybe it's not like him you're gonna walk like him if you walk like him that means you're gonna act like him that means finally The Works that I do shout it do who also I got written here if we live like him here we'll leave like him we'll leave like heat how did he leave on clouds of Glory amen the angel says why are you standing here gazing at him because the way that you've seen him go that's how he will return him and how many believes he's going to come back and take you in the rapture if we live like him we're going to leave like him yo Hallelujah in closing they're actually going to cut it short tonight unbelievable praise the Lord aren't you happy listen to this one one thing here said brother Bram says in his and this was just an extra of why Christ speak the next next scripture I just seen it and I got that got to read it to you listen what it says God goes to church every day God goes to church every day he just lives in church he lives in you Church you are a shirt you're the top of the greatest Revelations are deepest things that we could ever preach about is Christ in you the hope of glory the greatest thing we are is not understanding all the Mysteries and all of that the greatest thing we have is to possess him and to know that we are the Temple of almighty God and you don't have to wait to come to church to worship Him you ain't got no way you can do it when you're going home you'll be going on the job and you can waste praise him you're looking to have a church service Wherever You Are wow you can praise him at all times every well I don't care if he's behind the tree look better bro running around the tree I don't care if it's just pull that stuff up on that lawnmower hit that uh shut down cup blades off and go running around that mower why you say more because we all know that the mower is a place we all have our meditation you're laughing in the truth don't you love the mole I love the mo my wife loves America because that's where you can just kind of think about God and it's not too hard to keep the straight lines and when you think about God what did Brother bam say when you think on him he draws clothes and before you know you're ready to just have your Jubilee I mean he believes you she's just keep your mind on him keep your thoughts on him and it just creates a whole different atmosphere wouldn't it be sad if this building was anointed by almighty God and you had to come in here to get the anointing of God huh but we know that's not what it is is it we are the building we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost I mean God does whatever he does he does through you how many believes it's important the way we look at each other the way we see the way we think should be the way that God thinks the way that God sees I'm going to express me say God that's what I need I need more of that Lord I want to see the way God sees I want to think the way God thinks and I live like he thinks I'll Rejoice like praise be to God we won't Rejoice just because devils are subject to us huh why did Jesus say we Rejoice somebody somebody tell me because their names are written in heaven because you have a long range Vision you look all the way back before the foundation at my feet you see your name on that that girl life Bears record the record is right here the holy spirit is the record that God does amen his Spirit Bears record with
