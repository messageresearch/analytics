========================================

[Music] so you so foreign foreign foreign foreign alright uh you foreign uh [Music] uh foreign yes there right so so good morning brothers and sisters we'll just stand this morning bow our heads and go before the lord maybe joe will open us in prayer this morning okay is uh [Music] is [Applause] lord [Applause] children can be dismissed for sunday school and if you go with me in the psalms we're going to go to psalm 71. we're going to go to 71 and we're going to read uh we're going to start in verse 1 and i think we'll read to verse 12 there and then in the o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou has given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge ask me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters if you return with me uh to the 16th chapter of the gospel of john i have to i have to use something else because that part of my bible is slowly but surely falling apart staples aren't in it you know you know that psalm as part of that psalm in my office i was thinking about this morning you know that when you get older you don't want god to forsake you as the older you get or the it doesn't make a difference where you're at in your life it just lets you know how more dependent you're on his grace and mercy for you the older you get you realize you weren't what you were when you were 20. and i was just thinking about that this morning i was down to my office praying and just reading my bible and listening and something touched my heart saying he you know god basically i can only speak in my own words he knocked and said i told you this day was coming you know i only speaking for myself you know and everyone knows who i am and the kind of person i am you know but eventually you realize that you're not as strong as you think you are you're not as you don't have as much energy as you think you have and something spoke to me this morning let me know that you're at that time you know and i'm not in a bad way being not being humorous either just letting you know you might have been a machine all your life but eventually even machines break down even even the best the machines are eventually going to break down so sooner or later the only thing that you can hold to is god's word and his grace for you no matter what's happened you know and i've realized as i get older things that you thought were so easy to do when you were 20 are not the same thing to do when you're in your 60s not that i would ever let it affect me i'm still going to do what i did when i was 20. but you know that's just who i am but i was thinking in this gospel of john i was wanting to read this out of pilgrim's progress though before i get started this is in the second part there's two parts to it and this is the interpreter he's talking to christina and her children and mercy and the other people in this book i don't know if any you've ever read both parts a lot of people just focus on the first part and this is the second part but it uh it's this is what interpreter says it's on page 238 i don't the pages might be different in your book that you have it then interpreter began to say and that they were asking to be taught from an interpreter i said in this is riddles and you know and not getting into english but it says fatter the cell is the more she desires the mire and these are just truths in this day and they do the same today the fatter the ox is the more gamercy he is to the slaughter and he goes on to say and the more healthy the lusty man is the more prone he is on the evil now that last sentence there is really true when you think you're prospering and you've got all the wealth of the world it tends to make you even more sinful you reach and grab out for things that you know you shouldn't reach out for you just become worse there are just some people god give them riches and they just they become more profane with it and it goes on to say there is a desire in women you know this was don't i'm not trying to be funny here but this was written by 16th century so we're talking almost 500 years ago things don't change there's a desire in women to go neat and fine and it is calmly thing to be adorned with that that in god's side is a great price it's just easier watching a night or two than to sit up a whole year together so it's just easier for one to begin to profess well then to hold on as he should to the end and and this speaks to the age that we live in brother joe was praying about it you know that the sad thing is to start as a young man 40 years ago believing the medicine believing in salvation and all of a sudden to get 40 years down the road and to totally walk away from it that would be a that's to me is a horrible thing and he goes say every ship's master when in the storm will willingly cast that overboard that is of the smallest value in the vessel but he who will throw the best out first none but he that feareth not god so proportionally we have to throw out the it's basically saying what are you holding on to in your storms are you holding on to things that you shouldn't be holding on to are you willing to throw overboard in your life and then the things that don't matter are you willing to so your ship is right and safe and he goes on one link will one link leak will sink a ship and one sin will destroy the center and uh you know we're all landlocked here but if and you know lakes are a little bit different rivers are different you know you're close to shore but when you're 30 or 40 or 50 or a thousand miles out to sea and your ship has a leak in it that's a total different experience and that's the same with your life when you're out there and all of a sudden you've got holes in your experience you've got holes in your revelation you're just a lincoln ship and you're gonna you're gonna fail if you don't go back to the truth and it goes on he that forgets his friends is un ungrateful unto him he that forgets his savior is unmerciful to himself and that's a truth that can't be changed right there you can't forget who your god is and who your savior is and then he that lives and sins looks for happiness there yeah i'm a habit of losing my places he that lives in sin looks for the happiness thereafter it's like to him that's so with the cockle thinks to fill his barn with we are barley and basically what he's saying here in the sentence is that he's perverted his storage house because he's put things in there that are unclean and then this is what i was thinking about this morning it's in the psalms it's in proverbs it's in the scriptures to say this is where a lot of this comes from if a man would live well let him fetch his last day to him and make it always his company keeper so what interpreter is saying here you should live each day of your life knowing that you're going to die the next day and the way you live your life would be in a way that whatever happens the next day there's there's no shortcomings there's no regrets there's nothing in that next day and that's the problem with people you we all forget that one day we're going to have to come to that experience unless you're raptured out so we should live each day like tomorrow we're not going to be here and he goes on to say here uh whispering and change of thoughts proves that sin is in the world if the world which god sets light on by is counted a thing of the worth with man what is heaven that god commandeth and i'll finish reading with that poor i was just wanting to read a few of these scriptures here i was thinking this morning in our life you know you're never alone christians are never alone sometimes your enemy will get you so burdened down with the things of life or the problems of life that sometimes you think it's all you and there's there's nothing there for you but you're really never alone and i'll just read some of these scriptures here i i read this whole chapter you'll have to forgive me but like i've said before i can never read god's word too much it's not what i think what i have to say it's what god's word has to say and this is chapter 16. you know i spent a lot of time in the book of john i'm i'm sure all you are the same way but i had to print it out because i can't read it with these pages in my bible or tore out these things jesus is talking this is after this is after communion and after the upper room and they've moved from that and they're in further down the dave these things that i spoken unto you that you should not be offended so you have the word of god this morning so you shouldn't be offended what your neighbor thinks but the man you work or the woman you work with thinks you you shouldn't even put don't get me wrong doesn't mean it doesn't hit the heart sometimes when people say evil things to you but in the end he's warned you here he should not be offended they should put you out of the synagogue say the time cometh or whosoever kill of you will think that he doeth god's service you know we think of the reformation and we think back in the time of paul and the apostles but we've come full stage at that point right now and these things they will do on you because they have not known the father nor me and the people in our country in the world wouldn't do the things that they do have they really known the father and it goes on but these things have i told you that when the time come you may remember that i told you them these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you and this is throughout the ages i wrote a sentence between the two you know god has given in every age and every situation god gives truth to us he doesn't leave you alone and he just keeps working forward to the goal but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asked me whether this goes down because i have said these things on to you so that filled your heart and you know the disciples knew what was about to happen and they were having a hard time dealing with that fact they put a lot of confidence in jesus in a natural sense goes on to us as christians you know sometimes if you put your confidence in a man and a woman and they fall that'll shake your very experience unless you have the truth and he goes on to say when he come he will reprove the role of sin and righteousness and of judgment and of sin because they believe not me of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more enough judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have men yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now i bet when the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth and he shall not speak of himself but whosoever shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show these things and uh i was just thinking i just wrote the sentence i don't want to take a lot of time this morning but every time everything we do in life is the lord or jesus christ glorified in who you are and in your ways and a lot of times as a man or as i only can speak for myself sometimes it's hard to get that small quiet place where god can show you how he sees you i mean sometimes we get so busy in the things of life a lot of times we realize on the outside we might not be what god wants us to be and you got to get really quiet sometimes for god to show you who you really are and i'll i'm jumping here i don't want to read this whole chapter and uh i'll start about the 28th verse it says i come forth from the father and i've come into the world again and i leave the world to go to the father and this disciple said on to him blood now speaketh out plainly and speaketh no proverb and we're the same there's no problems god has spoken plainly to us in this age you don't have any doubt and he goes on to say here how now we are sure that most all things need us not that anyone should ask thee by this we believe that thousands came forth from god and jesus answered them do you now believe behold the hour cometh yay has now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone but yet i'm not alone because the father is with me and that's true for you all this morning you know you're never alone god is there for you these things have i spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world and jesus is telling his disciples this morning you know whatever the tribulations are whatever the problems in your life you can be at peace in god's word and in your experience i was just thinking this morning brother branham always said life is like a well i we would say a video but like a a movie camera he said back in his day life is like a video god is starting from the day you were born until the day you or you die and there's a video of everything you've said and done from one end of that stream to the other end of that stream and the only thing that changes that stream is you reaching out in faith and as reaching out to the savior and receiving salvation and grace so everything on that tape before then is put in god's sea of forgetfulness and every one of us this morning have to have that experience i i know i say this a lot but you can never say it enough you want that stream before you were a christian to be thrown into god's sea of forgetfulness so it won't be there on the other side you know the scripture says but i'm going the scripture says you know pete there's two type of people people that are judged now they judge themselves now so god can cleanse you and cleanse your heart and cleanse your life so that on the other side there's there's no reckoning and then there's other people that don't pay no attention to it and there are sins and those situations go to the other side and we don't want to be that group of people this morning where the ghost to the other side you want to be able to have the word of god judge you this morning that you stand pure before god on the other side that tape you know the only thing that changes that date this morning is you giving your heart and life to jesus christ this morning brother david let's stand if we could and sing that little course all my hope is in jesus this morning amen [Applause] are you thankful that your hope is in him this morning i know my hope is it jesus yes lord oh thank god my esther did god all my sins are forgiven yes lord oh i've been washed by oh thank god my yesterday's gone [Music] oh my god forgiven yes [Music] i'll sing

it's uh good to have sister martha here this morning god bless you and we don't really count her as a visitor she's kind of like john michael but he sneaks in more than what she does but it's good to

anniversaries and so brother tommy i need to see you after service amen so don't run off amen praise the lord um let me see i can't think of any other announcements amen brother jewel yeah that's not not this coming wednesday but the following if i'm not wrong yep not this coming it'll be the 12th right all right uh two weeks not this coming wednesday we have uh i know brother sean and we've he's been wanting to give a testimony and so it didn't work out for this morning but we want him to give his testimony wednesday night amen so wednesday night's going to be a testimony meeting and if he takes the service it's fine if not then somebody else wants to get up testify of the goodness of the lord well we'll do that would that be okay i have a good old-fashioned testimony meeting this coming wednesday amen um that's all i can think of praise the lord amen uh let me just let the cat out of the bag and what's on my heart i'm gonna say something about that but lebron this morning amen and also i wanted to tell you that the thirteen thousand dollar uh missionary fund uh my brother what's his name again brother berry coffee yes brother berry coffee called me and he said that they received it and it is probably already gone so he's you know he's that was about two weeks ago or so and so he's going to give it to the ukrainians and they should be being blessed by that right now amen so god bless you for giving amen and i think brother brian this morning and i've had something on my heart uh you know for us you know we still owe 70 000 on this church amen and i think it's going to take us eight more years to pay for it so i would really like to speak that up wouldn't you i may like to have maybe speed it up to about three years amen and so it's been on my heart to bring it to you it's it's all for all of us but i thought i might take one offering a year now one offering a year to towards the principal of the church amen and if we go right at 69 right now if let's say we get 10 000 in each one of those offerings for the next three years that's going to be about 30 000 and brother brian seems to think if i'm not wrong that within that time frame that three year time frame we can probably in a regular paying pay extra and get it paid for within a three year period amen how many would like to do that amen because i believe we can i don't believe we have to push it out to eight years i believe we can do it amen in three by the grace of god i mean it's in my heart so um i'll let you know next sunday on the date so that everybody can get prepared or whatever give you a date uh on uh when we want to take that offering and when we do take that offering if anybody wants to give their offering before or whatever in a check form or whatever just designate it for that and give it to brother brian amen and we'll try to get this place paid for i'm tally would that be nice and we had to have it paid for i mean and then of course we can focus a little bit more perhaps on missionary amen and sending more i know we want to try to take two missionary offerings a year amen for the lord because you are not doing what god wants you to do if you're not doing missionary work amen let's go into all the world and preach the gospel that is the commission to the church is to spread this gospel and the word of god amen so we'll do that and most likely either the first of august maybe first or next month or somewhere like right in there maybe we'll look at taking the offering okay all right god bless you stand with me this morning let's get into the word of god and we do want to have communion this morning amen and i thought it's that isn't it wonderful that this weekend we get to celebrate well i guess two of the greatest events probably in our life isn't that right and that is the declarative creation of independence and and talking about a nation perhaps that has had more freedom uh or just as much as freedoms as what israel would have had the greatest nations of freedom that that was ever in the world amen not to have to live under a dictatorship and live where we do and to this day i still thank god for my country i still thank god that i'm living where i'm living amen and we know we're going to get burned or they're going to get burnt but we have a promise that we're going to leave here brother glenn before we do get burned but there's a fire coming but amen we know that god's going to hold the future and we're glad that we know that that great god that holds our future amen we don't have to fear the future amen and his brother brian says we are not alone you don't walk alone you have somebody with you i'm glad for our present god this morning aren't you glad for god that's not just a god of history but he's a present god amen this morning i just i want to speak on when jesus comes and when jesus leaves would that be okay and i titled a very present help in trouble amen that's what i titled it but those two thoughts i want to speak on for a little while with the help of the lord this morning amen so if you will let's defy our heads before we amen open the word lord jesus we come before you lord with grateful hearts lord to be able to assemble together lord for we know according to your prophet lord that someday churches like this will be shut down father we won't have even the freedom to come and worship lord jesus and father already father they're burning down churches lord jesus so if it's at that place now lord wonder where are we at well you know we've never really heard of that much of it that way but lord now and and my father we just lord we realize it's a late hour god and we're living in troubled times lord jesus but father we don't have to be troubled father for that we ask god that you'll bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart help me just to get out of the way that you might speak to us that it would draw us closer to you and that we would edify the body of christ lord and bring it to perfection bring it to the place that we should be father lord we thank you for your goodness for your healing for all the blessings you've bestowed upon us in jesus name amen and amen turn to psalms if you will we'll read the first scripture here in the book of psalms in the book of psalms the 46th chapter psalms 46 amen it says verse 1 god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble amen praise be to god amen and then i want to read john 15 1-7 and we'll start with when jesus leaves would that be okay we'll start with the thought of when jesus leaves and over the prophet god preached the message when jesus comes amen amen when jesus comes amen but he also spoke of when he leaves the bible talks about when jesus leaves we want to dwell on that for maybe about 15 minutes and then we'll go another 20 or so on when jesus comes all right in chapter 15 of saint john jesus says i am the vine and my father is a husband every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away amen and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it bring may bring forth fruit more fruit amen this is where i get what i call that god is always working on us he's always trying to get more fruit out of us and they believe that and i'm sure that in our hearts we would say we're always trying to get closer to christ amen and bear more of christ's fruit you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i and you as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine and no more can ye except he abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen how many have you ever tried to be a christian without the holy ghost well it just don't work too good does it no it just really doesn't work too good because it doesn't matter what you do you still feel the same amen but if a man and if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and man men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen you know we're always praising god for what he has done or for what he will do but a lot of time we fail to recognize what god is doing this morning just as we are celebrating our independence we're celebrating and we're uh enjoying the blessing of something that happened long time ago amen this morning i want to praise god for what he has done amen how many knows we can worship him what he has done we want to worship him in what he's doing amen because he's a very present how many know that god is not just a god of david and goliath he's not just a god of moses and great deliverance but he's that same god this morning amen praise the lord how many is glad to have him in your heart this morning i trust you have him in your heart because it doesn't mean a whole lot if you don't have him in your heart amen it's just something that somebody else has or a story of the testimony of somebody else not of you and i want a testimony of what that i have him in my heart amen praise be to god and also the god of the future now when we talk a little bit about christ amen when jesus comes how many knows jesus is going to come amen when he is going to come he has come and he is also here god many believes that and we certainly certainly are looking for his coming in our future amen in the future in the near future we're going to see him face the face whatever joy that you have whatever happiness you have you can multiply that a million times more when you have a body change and when you see him coming in the clouds of heaven how he believes that it's going to be a amen as the song says won't it be a time i can't sing it like brother jewel but i can try huh won't it be a time amen praise the lord i've been praising god for what he's going to be amen and never going to have a body change and we're not going to have to be in this world that jesus has left let me know that jesus has left this country this country that we love and that we cherish and so far so thankful for but yet i believe it was between 1956 and 1957. brother brown said that america has left and they have rejected christ they went beyond what he called he says he went over the line so to speak blasphemy there is no more return there is not a hope left for america now if i'm not wrong he says he don't even pray for anymore you might as well not pray for him it isn't going to do any good when god declares something it's done it's over with it's finished you can pray all you want to but now god is still with individuals let me know that god is still with anybody that'll repent and turn to god but as a nation he says now you watch it get worse and worse has it it has until it's fit for fire folks it is fit it is getting ready for the fire for the burning amen oh my the lord so when jesus leaves how many knows when christ leaves things wither wilt just like a flower that doesn't get any water it withers dries up amen all right you know sin is the major cause of christ leaving our hearts and our lives we know that we can grieve the holy spirit away can't we you and i can grieve the holy spirit away but abraham i think it was in the church in its condition the first time you go to gospel boom there he goes you sit at the table and you choose a gossip about somebody remember the holy spirit left the second you thought to open your mouth to gossip about somebody he left because one thing we got to realize i want to realize that everything these hands do is it christ do it doing it every move i make them every thought i think every deed that i do is it christ doing it because if it isn't then it ain't right amen we ask that question what would jesus do everything you do ask yourself would jesus do this isn't that good it would jesus do if he wouldn't do it then don't do it praise be to god amen so we think about that sin causes him to leave amen because you know he talks about any any anybody that leaves him if you abide in me and i and you there's things that you can do that will absolutely cause him to leave your house and when he leaves trouble sets in bad things happen when christ leaves but said one place that ichabod was rolled over the doors of america the presence of god is departed the first time that we've not the first time but many times we know that when adam and eve left the presence of god when they sinned we realized that they went and hid themselves and god had to come looking for him amen but over in samuel if you'll remember how that eli and his sons were doing evil and israel was doing evil and so forth and they were doing evil and uh they were fighting the philistines all right and they they went and uh fought the philistines and they were defeated so what they did in the fourth chapter first samuel is they went back and they got the ark of god and says you know we're going to bring the ark of god and then we're going to win and then it says that they shouted with a great shout they praise god hallelujah they praise god until the philistines says man we can't fight against them we know what he did with these people we know what he did with them people and the philistines military leaders had to say quit yourselves like men and fight come on don't let don't be their servant he had that they encouraged the philistines to fight the israelites and guess what they went to battle and all of israel shouting all of worshiping and even the ark of god being there didn't save them no matter how much they shouted sin was in the camp when the sin was in the camp they were they lost 30 foot men thirty thousand foot men they lost and remember that uh eli's two sons also were killed in it and that right they were killed in the battle they came back and said you know we were defeated and not only that the ark of god had been taken away ma what a terrible things just goes to show you that it doesn't matter how you much you put on trying to be righteous it has to be right down here you got to be right not just to act israel was just going through the act surely shouted loud sure it sounded like thunder but god wasn't in it because things were wrong amen think about judas how many knows that judas was fine until he left the lord in that right and betrayed him then he was so miserable that he couldn't stand himself and he went and hung himself he felt so bad he was so miserable so dried up huh see folks when jesus leaves trouble comes in we think about our country back to our country and our independence and how that all the way up to world war ii how that we fought the great super powers of the world i want you to know that hitler was a major threat he had better tanks if you ever say the history of it us americans barely had an army even we didn't hardly have any rifles and we were untrained huh very untrained but we had like you know like they said the slopes they woke up a sleeping giant oh i love this i love this because i don't care if it's russia right now if it was mark about then if god has ordained for that country to do a certain thing ain't nobody going to defeat that country that country's going to stand because we know the japs and what they did if they rushed just as ready as they were and as unready as we were if we didn't come if they didn't come on in they probably whooped us huh did a problem whooped us if you know technically speaking with the military they had but they were they were worried they were scared for some reason and they went back and gave us all kinds of time to recoup that's the worst thing to do for the enemy let them recruit because they're gonna be pretty mad like we were amen but we think about the great superpowers like hitler like japan people who were absolutely gonna fight to the last child i mean they were having their little girls training them in the fight if we come all the way to their homeland they're gonna fight to the bitter end that's the kind of enemy we had that's where heroes were made people did heroic things when i think about the independence brother brad i think about every horror every horror of bloodshed of people getting literally their heads blowed off arms blown off legs blown off folks i would never want to have to see it would you but you think about the worst horror movie you ever watched if you ever watched one open not but the worst horror movie that's multiplied multi multiple times that is what we did and what people did what men did and how they died for our freedom folk i'm here to tell you our generation does not appreciate the blood and the guts that were spilled for our freedom so that we could be free because there was people that hitler didn't want he to come over here quicker than anything after england huh japan wanted to take us into into captivity or whatever think about it you know and we have to fight for our freedom but i think about it i think about the independence and how they sign we are not dependent upon them anymore what it costs then you think about albary hello and the cost that christ paid for you and i so that he could also declare our liberties it ought to be a little noisier in here think about it that he could declare you are no more slaves amen when he hung on the cross there he said it is done it is finished you are free how many please we're free free from sin free from the bondage of condemnation in our heart that's what we're free from amen that brings you joy brings you peace it brings you love oh my just brings all kinds of good things that's when jesus comes it's a different story amen but had sinned against god and god couldn't bless him and that's what sin does in each individual life amen and the don and his daughter-in-law phoenius's wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard that the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her father-in-law and her husbands were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon her and about the time of her death huh think about it it was still terrible that in his childbirth it killed her she died that the woman by her said under her fear not that has borne his son but she acknowledged not neither did she regard it and she named the child ichabod jacob can you imagine that woman in travail of all the sorrow that it brought for the people to sin against god huh i want you to know it brings sorrow it brings despair to sin against god amen amen if she didn't she didn't even name it just the last perhaps the last word it means i named him ichabod what a horrible name to give a child but he was born in terrible times under terrible conditions isn't that right he had a terrible father amen because they did all kinds of evil with the congregation took the meats and this out of the other and lay with the women of the church and everything else evil in the presence of god amen called the son ichabod amen say the glory of the lord is departed what a terrible thing when the glory of the lord departs folks it's a terrible thing because the ark was taken because her father-in-law and her husband and she said the glory of the glory is departed from israel and the ark of god is taken they had nothing i mean that's what it is when you leave the lord and get away from god you have nothing you ain't got no joy you ain't got no peace you ain't got no nothing anymore just get away from god and i'll tell you what trouble sets in brother brown makes a statement in resurrection he says and notice i want you to get this now jesus went away from the home of lazarus and when he left sorrow came in oh my let me say this to you christians when you leave when you when jesus leaves your house watch out sorrow is on its row [Music] sorrow is on its road he says again when jesus leaves your home watch trouble as sure as he goes away trouble sets in if you drive him away with your sinful living and reckless and careless life sorrow is on its road listen evening night tabernacle don't you get reckless don't you get careless about your life and then if you aren't careful you'll drive him away and sorrow will sit in trouble will set in emptiness will set in future set in between you and your wife and your children and everybody will be all set all upset because there's no blessing outside of christ folks since america found out what it's like to try to fight a vietnam war and all these other wars should never be able to win why because if god ain't there it's ichabod folks i feel bad for those 60s 56 000 the man i believe it was in vietnam that lost their lives just for us to pull out because when you lose a war everybody that died died in vain huh because you fought so hard to win something and you didn't amen oh my trouble sets in evil sets in now jesus had left and when he left trouble came in now when he leaves you or you leave he leaves your home where you dwell at troubles on its road road satan's got an open door when jesus leaves isn't that exactly right well this uh spirit is going out of a man and so forth his house is cleaned and seven more evil spirits come in when christ goes out it leaves an open room for the devil to come in for evil to come in and let me tell you something our patrick hentry our george washington's and all those that were godly they're all gone now what has come in evil has come in even the things that ronald reagan says if it ever goes that way he says you watch it out then it's done and it's going that way huh no hope for this country no hope for this world but i'm glad to be tied to some kingdom that does have some hold aren't you glad praise be to god this morning oh my saul found out what it was like after he disobeyed god he was tormented had to play music just to make him feel better and that didn't work oh can i say something this morning i don't care you get away from the hope because i don't care what you drink i don't care what you smoke it'll never bring you comfort i don't care what you do it'll never bring you comfort saul was miserable after he disobeyed the lord departed from him how many knows he departed he went anointed and he says i give your kingdom to one more better than you are one more worthy and he was miserable all the days of his life and everything he did failed till the philistines if i'm not wrong cut his head off and put it on a stake pretty bad a bad ending wasn't it samson found out what it's like to kill a thousand philosophy to be invincible to heap upon people upon even men get up on the top of them said is there anybody that wants to fight me come on is there anymore you don't want to fight me hollered and screaming you bunch of philistines huh but he found out when he flirted with the world let the cares of life give too much to him lust of the flesh the things you flesh once you let that be predominant over what the spirit needs you'll find out that you're going to be defeated wonder why you don't have no amen or hallelujah or joy in your heart and life amen samson found out the hard way lord help us when he gave away a secret lord says don't you let a razor come through your hair it's only required you can fly you can do all kinds of stuff be all right lie you know how many times he lied to the light up yeah he lied just don't let hair don't don't you cut that hair oh man you know i believe y'all see samson over there but i'm here to tell you something i guarantee we go talk to him by the time they say well now what do you think about that haircut you got what do you think about that heart head sam he said brother i'm here to tell you if i had to do it over again ain't nobody ever would touch my hair i like my hair oh my you couldn't get me i wouldn't do it again for the my the misery and the sour they took a iron and punched my eyes out and put me on the grinding wheel somewhere and i had to go walk around in some garage they would go all day long every day man they mocked me and made fun of me the whole time i was not on top of no keep my heat shouting glory and challenging them some more here i wasn't ever laughing at me huh he had plenty of time to think about when he leaves when he's not there anymore my mama let me tell you something the one thing the prophet of god told us that hell is going to what makes hell hell is the fact there is no god there there is no hope no god he's not there amen lost completely gone that'll haunt you for however long it takes samson had plenty time to think about it didn't he but disobeying the word of god amen samson did saul did even david did amen when he sinned i'll tell you what god left he didn't bless him anymore for a good period of time things went really bad for quite a while how about the brother of god when he was first coming into ministry and he wouldn't go preach because his mother-in-law says don't you take me out amongst that trash that holy roller those crazy fools so to speak is that right that's the trash that's the office i mean he wouldn't go he had plenty time to think about not obeying god and listening to his mother-in-law when his wife was there dying and died and then he went back to sharon rose they said she's in bad rip shape went back to sharon rose and her eye flies were flying around there and eyes were across from all the pain huh her eyes had crossed i caused that daddy i caught that i did this don't punish my baby girl he was not the teacher he taught him good amen he says god just just let my baby live and a black sheep come down in front of him god shut him off this is what it's like without me it's a terrible world i mean it was a terrible world without christ look around you out there it's a terrible world without christ your world will be terribly without christ but your world will be blessed beyond measure when christ is there aren't you glad that he came to your house aren't you glad that he has an abiding place in your house you really don't have a worry in the world because he promised he would never leave yeah he'd never forsake you he never does leave us he never does or shakes us then forsake him it's us that leave him that we don't abide in him so he goes off somewhere until we're willing to take him back make things right god have mercy on people who aren't with the lord the lord is not with them you think about the church world out there god is not in that no he's not there anymore they don't even know and they keep right on going folks i don't care when i go down the wrong road when i believe jesus somewhere i hope he gets my attention if he has to throw me on my back uh if he can put me in the hospital if he's gonna take my life don't let from your lord huh because the worst thing you could ever imagine is to go on thinking you're okay when you're not and to be disappointed in the end folks you want to make sure that you're on god's side and make sure you're resting in the blessings of god because if not man i'm here to tell you things will go bad huh we can hear it amongst us we can say that's right that's right brother i've been there i know what you're talking about but i thank god that in the midst of all of that when you reach down and do like israel and repent god comes back to you and he gets to that peace again after you're done wrong when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus comes all tears are wiped away when jesus comes the dead race to life again when jesus comes to church has a hallelujah and is trying it again but it's got to be christ coming it's not just talking about something but it has to be his presence that comes down amen when jesus comes i like that don't you oh hallelujah i don't want to open door for the own devil to come in i want to keep it closed up i want to keep it sealed so that the devil can't come in praise the lord brother brahm says about the tabernacle branham tabernacle that's a whole lot of what's the matter with the brandon tabernacle because of unbelief because of the cares of the world has bound to people he would say this to his own church pretty strong huh until it cannot produce spiritual i guess that would be one of the most discouraging things to a pastor is to see that these people don't progress people just don't progress a pastor is the most forgiving the most understanding the most merciful person the most long-suffering person probably that you'll ever meet huh long we'll put up with all kinds of garbage he'll pray for you and believe for you anyway and no matter how bad you been he'll forgive you if you're willing to repent and get right and try a little more sure he is boy oh boy and god and and a pastor is thankful when he has a congregation that's a little bit that way back huh it hurts it hurts bad when there's no return of it amen when he has mistakes when he has failures there's just condemnation because folks how many believes there's plenty to go around all of us have mistakes but i learned that it was a year ago or two years ago or three years ago or one month ago i don't know what it was brother i said something about when you get older you think a little bit more about every little thing you don't want to you want to make sure that you don't grieve him away amen watch every little thing you do amen when we're younger we're a lot less careless we just are i don't know why we're a lot less less careless from what we do sometimes but as you get older you realize hey you know even coming out this morning and standing here most of the service just a little bit jittery just a little bit nervous amen i guess because of the responsibility to try to make sure you don't want to come up here and say something that would be wrong amen because you're accountable for it just want to be in tune with god make sure that everything you say and do is pleasing to him amen all right let's go on the cares of the world is bound to people until it cannot produce spiritual growth that's what's the matter with our nation that's the matter with that's what's the matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord is departed as it is written one time in the scripture in the hebrew word means ichabod which means the presence of the lord has departed amen again he says ichabod is rolled over our doors and over our nation a black checkmark has come across it amen but praise be to god let's come back up for the next 10 or so minutes is that all right how many knows that not so many hundred years ago maybe 500 years ago this world was in a bleak dark condition amen it was called the dark ages it was dark folks catholicism almost had their millennium they almost had their millennium reign for almost a thousand years huh because it wasn't but a hundred years after the death of christ if or so remember when constantine joined with the christians and so forth the roma church became the roman catholic church the roman catholic church at one time was the part of a real genuine pentecostal church that came off of pentecost but they left the word they left the word became the roman catholic church for you know and they would join church of state and right there and about a couple hundred years after death of christ hundreds of thousands of so-called christians would be killed if they didn't bow to the will of the antichrist the roman church catholic church they ruled all the way up the columba and then we had a luther and it was very dark they didn't want you to even think for yourself it was so dark but then jesus came and he got into somebody how do we know he got into luther he got into luther and he began to protest the catholic church and pinned those thesis on the door and says no we don't have to pay for this we don't have to pay for that we ain't got to worry about to pay for all these that just shall live by faith he didn't have a whole lot but he had enough to spark a whole uh reformation thousands upon thousands of people and they tried to even kill him but they had kings in different countries where they would protect him and guard him and not let him get a hold of him a lot of them before him tried it and they got killed huh they got killed for it but martin luther escaped it was the right time jesus was coming and he was coming back amen but after luther it was wesley that right wesley he began to say no it's not just justification but now it's sanctification quick smoking them soaks and drinking them beers and so forth it's time for sanctification you got it in a deeper walk they had a great time it was a revival all over the world like you ain't never seen tracks and everything going on in the world and the gospel being spread over in england is that right first germany then then the third one was landed in california huh now he knows that wherever people reject christ it gets dirty and filthy and terrible just like england they are filthy dirty and everything else it was it's just real bad long before america was because they rejected john wesley they rejected the gospel and then he landed where on azusa street we had a pentecost right we had not just sanctification now we had you know speaking in tongues and and interpretation of tongues and my just the outpouring of the holy ghost speaking in tongues and then it started a revival that went world over [Music] amen but where did they put christ out unless you believe that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the holy ghost and you ain't got it they were wrong it was wrong because from pentecost we went up another step we went into the prophetic age we went into the eagle age hello amen and this was not just somebody so to speak i don't want to call it rattling but to most people it would sound like rattling on in some language and then somebody interpreted and you might say well maybe that's right and maybe it's not huh maybe it's right maybe it's not and if it was prophecy saying somebody's gonna have this is gonna happen it happened yeah yeah but if you're just quoting scripture but we got something more christ became more evident more real and jesus came down in malachi 4 isn't that right he had such grace and such mercy for this world this layout is here age how many was he had mercy for germany he had mercy for england he had mercy for japan he had mercy for the buddhists muhammad's jeans all of them people over there the ishmaelites and all of those everybody he got the same sign of wonder to him is that right it was no more maybe it's right but while he was here i challenged any man anywhere to come and prove that that discernment was wrong one time not even once he could tell you what your name was who you was if he prayed for you declared you healed you'd be evil huh he it was so much of christ of brother i'm called the fullness of christ we had the fullness of christ again in this age amen to bring us to a full stature of christ the fullness of christ was nowhere not walking the shores of galilee but now the fullness of christ is in the church proving himself alive again just like he did how many times brother bam said now jesus he was then i'm here to tell you he's here now and he will do the same thing if he does the same thing god is identified by his characteristics he said 1965 another by his character but what he does is how you identify who christ is hallelujah aren't you glad when there was 900 different ways how in the world are you ever going to figure out which one's right 900 just about the time you figured out hey this one is right another one has a little of truth hey but that's right over there and you don't believe that so what am i going to do now if i go there then they believe it yeah but they don't believe some of the stuff that's true that they are and on and on and on and on that's where we were what are we going to do but he came and made a path didn't he he came and he says now if i haven't told you the truth god don't come vindicated you don't have to believe it first of all he says if i say something contrary to this here then i'm a liar i'm not false we went right back to what paul taught that's what the prophet took us back to exactly back to the original the original seed is what we have i mean believes that it produces an original church original baptism another an original new birth praise be to god amen praise be to god and what did it do when jesus came there i was minecraft sarasota confused what's what's right didn't he want to go to church it's funny though you know what's funny somebody that won't go to church they're still going to go to church what do you mean brother it's going to be their own church yeah a one-man denomination it's like they are they want to believe it the way they want to believe it you're a denomination already because it's not about going to church but there is a true church how many believe that there's a true church god is not in this or we are not in this world without there being a true church amen i wouldn't be standing here brother perish if i didn't think i was in it i believe i'm in the true church of god following the true word of god and not just the way i want to believe it amen i found out quick that hey even if you don't want to go to church you i'm gonna believe this i'ma believe that well god sent a prophet are you gonna believe that i don't think so well then you can do what you want but god did huh that's the truth you come god's way or you don't come that's one thing for sure if anybody's gonna get to heaven you're gonna have to go by jesus christ no man comes to the father but by me no man comes into heaven but by jesus christ hey man i got a few more minutes is that all right hey amen i shouldn't i guess i shouldn't be in a hurry but brother tommy i was raised in that generation that hurry up hurry right brother urban hurry let's slay this side come on hurry hurry hurry fast hurt pass brother behind that's one thing i can do now even on the roads ah that's all right i'll just follow this flow person i just follow i won't worry about breaking my neck around the curve trying to get around that guy i i don't have to be anywhere real fast you know and i i even get to laugh a little bit but i go to wrestle and we're almost at the red light over there and somebody's crazy they're just in the crazy hurry they go flying by me there's a whole lot of traffic ahead of me they're only going to get past me why didn't they waste all that gas you know i i laugh people it's just oh i'm like boy he's rush isn't he well you know he's really disturbed you know because me before i do that i realize hey if i get you get past this car it ain't gonna do me no good there's too many up ahead am i right have y'all ever seen somebody do that have you ever done that [Laughter] hopefully you don't have to anymore slow down just now i'm like we want to take communion right and it's quarter after that's time to close that's when i usually shut down but it kind of go a little longer it's very hot outside anyway and it's nice and cool in here folks man i got a shower and i they thought god thank you for a shower and i looked at the wash and drawer in front of me i said thank you god for washing dry we used to have to go down they used to have to go down uh you know back in on independence they probably going to do it on the scrub board they they couldn't go inside their shower just turn that knob on although they couldn't go over to a commode and just flush pray speech to god then go to the kitchen and have a kitchen sink with water oh praise the lord don't have to have an ice box or wonder how you're going to keep things you got to pray thank you jesus i'm thankful for all that god has given us we have god it's so nice and then you know even the dishwashers and everything and then we're still yeah come on forks you know what it is the problem is it is a lack of correct raising people don't teach their kids to be conservative and not waste and take good care of what they have amen how many know how many has learned a lot of us has learned that brother irvin is sometimes better to fix something than just to buy something new people can't fix one little bitty thing and have to spend 1500 for something new well i believe it's the same with our generation of people who don't appreciate the price that we paid for our freedom the price that was paid for our freedom and they are squandering it and wasting it i mean it's like a person being rich and having a child that is not worthy of that it's just such wasteful spender and you can't hardly you can't hardly give that person everything you have ever worked for because you know they're just gonna waste it just squander it that's what our generation is doing we pay dearly with our blood for our freedoms and they're just squandering it being waste they're not worthy of it amen and in any way i thank god for the benefits of what christ died for me for i don't want to squander that amen i don't know if i read this or not in matthew i believe it was and i'll just read the scripture and say a few words did i be okay and then we'll get into communion amen yeah i believe it's found in let me see where i've got this wrote down matthew 9 matthew 9 and verse 18 and when he spake thee things unto them behold there came a certain ruler in worship saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay the hand upon her and she shall live can somebody say this man had faith he believed i don't know if you heard about lazarus at this time yet or not perhaps you hadn't learned about him raising laughter he said my daughter's dead but i know that if you lay your hands on her she'll raise and jesus arose verse 19 and followed him and said and so did his disciples and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment and she said within herself if i make but touch the hem of his garment i shall be made whole and jesus turned about and so when he saw her said daughter be of good courage comfort thy faith has said may be whole and the woman was made whole from that hour another place another scripture says he had virtue to go from amen and when jesus came amen when jesus comes into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels of the and the people making a noise he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn when i read that i just try to imagine the sound of it because you know laughing's one one thing but to scorn it sounds like it's just a little on the heavy side just really laughing how much different their faith was than the dad the dad said if you come and touch it she'll be made he says she's just sleeping they should all said oh okay okay yes we believe she says sleeping we believe with you that she's just sleeping go wake her up we want to see her raise up but to laugh him to scorn with doubt and he put the people forth amen how many know sometimes you just got to get away from unbelief and he went in and he took her by the hand and the maid rose and the fame thereof here of went abroad in all of the land see folks when jesus comes death can't even hold people i'm here to tell you this morning when jesus comes sin can't hold you anymore it changes your whole life how many knows when jesus comes every young person every young person raised in the message you may know it by knowledge but know this that you need jesus to come by you need that holy spirit to come by and it has to become a personal experience because just your parents experience will never hold you in the hour which you live in you have to say god i have it in my heart i want you to come by here that's why i love that so come by here lord come by here come by here lord come by here i hope everybody this morning has the same way lord come by here come down my aisle yeah i know you're up here but come down my aisle come by here lord i need a little guts i'll tell you now if you need healing whatever you need people on calvary and if you can just call on him and say here i am lord come come stop by here because when he comes demons have to flee when he comes lives are changed when he came for me folks i've never been the same i think about the past the past the god of the past of my past when he came to me some 30 years ago changed my whole life he touched me and i've never been the same praise the lord about mary and martha he had left but he came back when he came back lazarus was four days dead and he seemed a little late can i say something usually when jesus comes it's a little late brother bam said he called the darkest hour then jesus comes he lets it get real dark i want that to soak in so i'm being quiet the darkest hour most of the time then jesus comes jesus never showed up for the three hebrew children until they begin to come into the atmosphere of the heat and just as they came into the atmosphere that he there he was right on time they didn't get their hair since first now he protected them all the way that right but they tried him and tested him all the way to the heat just the looks of the fire and the threat of their life and the feeling of being extinguished and killed and so forth you know they had to get past all of that go all the way to the heat i'll take you all the way to the heat to see what you'll do and see if you'll keep on believing the same way with daniel didn't stop at the wall no he went in gotta let you go in your trial amen some of us brother brad better joe different ones of us we think about how that god has given us a second chance we know what that dark hour is we know what it was like to be at the bottom of the bottom and it can't get any worse or it doesn't seem like it can but guess what if you're a child of god and you put your trust in him look out because here jesus comes let me tell you something a lot of y'all were sitting in your pews because jesus came you're sitting in those pews because jesus came he came to you and he touched he changed you coming in here are in that place god i've been touched by the master that's why i'm here jesus came my way and it made all the difference i pray in the name of jesus christ that our children every one of our children that he'll go by them that he'll touch them that he'll fill them with the holy ghost that he'll give them a desire to read the bible a desire to love the lord to go to church to be a christian our money is with us our younger generation our children that are coming up they need the protection of the holy spirit they need jesus to come in their lives and make a difference that'll be a difference for a lifetime and then a present god can i talk about a present god because that's what we need we need a god here now not just in the future but we need him here now oh i love don't you just love his guiding hand on your life daily don't you love the fellowship that you have with christ daily oh my i would shoot myself if i wouldn't have jesus well that's kind of strong words but maybe feel like it why because it just life wouldn't be worth living no wonder they do it it's a miserable life without god it is a miserable life without god total dissatisfaction amen never have any satisfaction never content how many knows that whenever israel would complain and murmur he would leave bring punishment upon them well i did always mumble god doesn't want that you don't have to when you're walking in the lord we're so blessed you're so blessed people all those people that don't have christ they're on their own they'll have somebody to go to and get help but in closing the one great privilege sister becky one great privilege sister joyce that we have is that we can ask a present thought that when you need something he said just ask i'm here now glory i'm here now sure i was with brother bottom and discerning thoughts and intent of the heart sure i was but i am with you this morning i am with you in your trouble just like i was with peter when they were about to sink in they said to me they said cares though not that we perish christ jesus cares whether or not you die he cares for your life he cares whether you live or die he cares whether you have food to eat he cares whether you have raiment he cares whether you have a nice house to live in how many knows he cares how many could say this morning i need to care more for him lord jesus help me to have a complete surrendered life to you my hands my heart my mind my soul my strength is yours lord use me use me lord god bless you let's stand this morning let's just bow our heads and have a word of prayer lord jesus with our heads bowed to you father we want to thank you lord jesus that you said that you would be a very present help in time of trouble and lord jesus this world is in a whole world of trouble but you said you would be present with us lord you'd be present with you your people and don't call upon you father that we would ask anything in your name you do it lord jesus and as we bow our heads lord i ask the congregation what is it that they desire what is it that they need raise your hand say god this is what i need lord i'm asking for a closer walk with you i'm asking for healing i'm asking for my children i'm asking for whatever ask what you wish and it shall be done lord jesus you see the hands that are up and what's down beneath those hearts there's you're still a desire thoughts and intensity you know exactly what we're desiring lord and we ask god that jesus give us the faith that this man had for his daughter we know that if you'll touch the situation if you'll come by lord when you come lord we know it'll change everything lord we ask this morning in the name of jesus christ that you meet every need represented underneath that hand and help us all father to be closer to you to be better christians after this morning service than what we were when we came in lord jesus help us to be careful in everything we do never lord to grieve you away from our hearts lord jesus we want we don't ever want you to go away from our own from our house from our body from our tabernacle that is yours we ask god not as we change the order to service and we do the greatest thing that we could ever do and that's commemorate celebrate what you did for us on calvary lord to remember what you did father in the past that has caused us to be able to be where we are today in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord turn your bibles if you will too
