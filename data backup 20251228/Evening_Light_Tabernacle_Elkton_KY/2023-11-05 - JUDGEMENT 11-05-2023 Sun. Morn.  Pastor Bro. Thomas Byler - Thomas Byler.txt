========================================

that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom the day of judgment than for thee may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen amen I want to review just a little bit if I could would that be all right recap amen for the believer amen we know that uh we've been teaching what the believer is and and the rock that he has and and no matter what Trials Come tribulation come distress yes amen and there was something else maybe even a little bit more than I thought about that I wanted to bring and that was amen but but over in uh Romans 8 I believe it was he says shall tribulation shall persecution a Believer has such a grip amen amen that he's unmovable amen amen that's a real believer and how many knows that uh according to the Bible it's talks about straight is the gate and narrow is the way amen uh but in few there would be that would find it and he said broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be that go in there at so what we want to talk about basically this morning with the help of the Lord is the many the many amen I wanted to pull that up but brother Brandon one place he said he said you know uh when it comes to the make believer he says that there will be millions and billions of mimics of Christianity amen millions and billions of so-called Christians that say they're Believers they're actually make Believers amen how many know outside of a real genuine Born Again experience of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen you're just a mimic amen I remember I was listening to brother brah he said the other day he says you know if God hasn't come and change your nature and your desires from amen for sinful nature he says your deceived amen because a lot of people can get it on the on the spirit they can get it on the flesh amen and it's a very deceptive time is't that right because the devil is not amen even one place I believe brother Braham said that even Cain was a Believer the devil's a Believer the Bible says the devil believes and he trembles amen he perhaps the Devil Himself believes more than what a lot of Christians do is that right amen because if you know a lot of times when Jesus would come he says have you have you come to torment us and so forth you know but the scribes the Pharisees they were so blind amen that they uh amen they claimed to be Believers but they weren't really Believers amen the same way with Cain he wasn't really a Believer even though we would class him a Believer he was a churchgoer he was a relig very religious unbeliever amen remember the uh the man that said to brother bam he says you know uh you know I don't care if you if if I seen a miracle you know what this out I still wouldn't believe it he says of course not you're an unbeliever but yet he was a preacher amen and the whole world is full of them and Paul talked about how that a mean and we want to go there perhaps yet with in 1 Corinthians 10 where he talked about Israel and how that they were amen uh under the cloud and all these other things and they were examples amen for us they have been given they were our example the example of the believer let me just say this while it's into my mind amen a make believer amen he'll say well I'm as good as anybody in that church or I'm as good as that guy in the church maybe that person that he's talking about is a hypocrite amen and so he's not really saying anything amen but a make believer will be happy with where he's at a real believer will take heed amen if you think you stand Paul said take heat least you fall a real believer wants to make sure that he's sure and we're living an hour folks where they're at the Judgment it's not going to be the unbeliever The Sinner the Harlot The Prostitute that's going to be disappointed they expect their sentence but said but it's going to be the make believer in that right they're the ones that going to be disappointed at the Judgment amen how many know that we need to examine ourselves according to Paul amen examine yourself see whether you're in the faith or not how many beli amen seek out your own salvation the Bible say with fear and trembling in other words make sure that you're sure how sure should we make a mean how should we be should we try to be because we're living in that final watch my friend you got to be sure that you're sure and that takes examination amen how many believer even this morning he says you know let a man examine himself and so let him take of that bread and drink of that wine when we have that moment of silence and so forth you examine yourself see if you're worthy or if you need to repent of things before you take it amen because you've got to find you got to examine yourself Paul said don't you know yourself how that Christ is in you unless you're a reprobate everybody knows if you're that's the problem with people is they don't examine themselves how many believe that a Christian has to have a self-examination you know exactly how you've lived you know exactly how you are you know how you think and what you've done amen so we have to examine ourselves amen I believe it's the hour of examination brother bam said we need to not just check up every month or every week every hour of every minute of every day every day you want to check up because you're living in the hour let me tell you how many believe we're living in that hour and in that watch where Jesus said you know if the thief would have known and what watched out you know not the thief if the owner of the house would have want known in which watch in what watch the thief would have come he would have watched and then been prepared and you and I living in that watch how many believes we're living in this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled and what we see in Israel just at any time God could be done with this let me tell you something there's time people are backsliding people getting cold on God you need to look at yourself and see where you're at amen because there's no hour from backsliding no hour from getting away from God because that's what the make believer does make believer he don't much care amen he doesn't believe like he should amen you know it's quite something and I thought about this and talking about just a little bit of review talking about how thankful that you and I can can be to know what really is the truth remember Wednesday we talked about brother bam was talking about he says you know why do people drink why do people commit adultery why do people do this and all of these other things is because they haven't drank of the water that truly satisfies how many knows the whole world our our our college system our government system everything is because they have rejected the way of life they have rejected the truth and that's why and I'm so aren't you glad you can understand exactly why they're in the condition that they're in oh Hallelujah aren't you glad that you don't have to be in that condition this morning you don't have to have another tattoo you ain't got to have no nose ring Hallelujah you don't have to get through to go through the pain of painting yourself up you're perfectly content with how you are why because you are a Believer and you have so churched your soul amen and you've been filled with that Fountain of Life amen there's a River of Life in The Believer amen and they're so empty and going out into darkness because they have refused the way how many know God has all of Humanity on a one this is what we know to be the truth that God has put each and everyone every person is responsible for their actions and for whether they believe or whether they don't and God comes and he does such great things as he did in our generation I mean as he came and he made himself so obvious and he was put it you know that that just that scripture is enough to either save you or condemn you but then brother baham says you know just the word of God should be enough but then he sends gifts he sends prophets he does all kinds of Miracles to try to persuade people to come amen oh my and when you reject all of that and disbelief you deserve hell and God will judge you you will be judged and guess what that's why we call it judgment this morning because when you turn down that kind of grace and mercy that God shows a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein and sinners plunge beneath that flood lose all their gain guilty stain a chance to have all of your sins gone and not have to have to give account for all of it amen why because you've come to the house of judgment and your sins I read I was reading where better says preachers will am me have people come to the Altar and and judge yourselves amen and your sins go up beforeand amen they get taken care of you ain't got to worry about this amen the Judgment but if you don't get them taken care of they will have to be dealt with people don't mind the cons people are so all prising so to speak amen and so blind the devil so blinds people but listen to what he says here he begin to upgrade the cities I think that's sometimes what the Holy Ghost will do Amen in the prophet even in his message you remember when he was preaching the choosing of a bride when he was in California he says oh don't what a solemn warning we don't know what time we don't know what time but this city one day is going to be laying here at the bottom of this ocean amen amen remember Jesus said oh capernium which are exalted into heaven shall be brought down to Hell if the mighty Works had been done in you that were done in the amen that were done in Sodom it would have remained until this day then brother bam says oh capernium said Jesus D exalted in heaven will be brought and if the mighty Works had been done in Sodom and gor oh my it' been standing till this day oh doesn't it want to just make you scream look at what God has done in our generation oh my my my my if he could say that about Sodom and Gora huh a bunch of homosexuals so filled with homosexuality until they were trying to come into the break down Lots door and everything else and Bible says they would repented if the signs were done there's a price how many know I wish this whole world could just hear this this morning and it's always easy to believe a Jesus that died on Calvary it's always be easy to believe a god of the past but if you don't recognize the god of now you're lost amen because oh it's so easy cuz it's back there you know but now when he comes and he talks to you and he proves it to you what will you do with this Jesus that's called the Christ what are you going to do with the resurrected Christ not the dead Christ but the resurrected Christ that's here and living among us come and showing signs and wonders like never before around the world for 30 some odd years doing signs and wonders that he did I heard brother bam said man he was praying and doing a discernment he say if that sign would have been done in Africa there's been thousands upon thousands receive the Lord Jesus Christ and people people oh I guess that's all right folks how many knows that signs and those wonders and that discernment that was a precious thing that would God give us in this hour amen don't take it for granted don't ever let it become lukewarm to you amen notice now that's right and solom and Gomorrah lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea comper in the bottom of the sea thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty things and fashion and things and even the foreign country come here to pick up the filth to send it back and you f churches and your Steeples and so forth the way that you do remember one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea you're under your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God Is buing Right benath you how much longer he'll hold this Sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out y under a mile deep will slide in there Plumb back to the Sal and SE it'll be worse than the last day of pompe repent Los Angeles repent the rest of of you and turn to God the hour of his WRA is upon the Earth flee while there is time to flee and come into Christ and that what he said they would have repented how many knows when the gospel go forth It's about repenting getting right with God repenting but they would not repent amen how many knows Cain was a religious person very religious person he had church he brought it offering he made sacrifice and everything else but when he was presented with the word of the hour he would not repent how many knows that in our generation the church world the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian the Pentecostals especially would not repent amen what do you think is left for them nothing but judgment nothing but the wrath of God to be poured out upon them cuz when God does something let me tell you something people will be condemned simply because they don't believe that's amen when you don't believe God you will go to hell you will be punished you will have to pay for every one of your sins because he has made a way he has given you everything that you could ever dream of ever needing a satisfaction in your soul a washing of your sins a filling of the Holy Ghost amen Oh My My My when we think about the gift that God has sent us amen amen think about it what what even the prophet of God said look at what happened in the days of Solomon when the people accepted God's gift cuz how many know solom had in him he had that spirit of discernment he had that spirit of discernment amen let me go on to the next scripture in uh St Matthew 12 and uh verse let's go with 41 the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation amen oh my can't we say that same thing about this generation men of Nineveh they're going to rise in this in judgment didn't the bible say that the Saints shall judge the world those folks that were saved in the days of in the Nineveh they said you know all we had was a Prophet come out and speak the word I don't know that he did all that many signs other than being spit out by a by a big old fish their fish gots bit him out and said y'all better repent what did they do right from the King all the way to the they took put it on their their animals and everything else dressed everything in ashes and prayed to God God forgive us amen my repent it but God could do all these signs and wonders in this generation and people don't repent you rise in judgment with this generation shall condemn it because they repented not at the preaching of Jonas amen no they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here amen the queen of the South shall rise uh up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solom Solomon and greater than Solomon is here brother brother preached a message called a greater than Solomon is here a greater than all this here and still wouldn't repent buch of make Believers don't call yourself a Believer when you won't believe the Bible when you won't believe the manifestation of something that's right there in front of you listen kids don't never take for granted I even talk my granddaughter we was talking a little bit about that says don't never underestimate don't take it for granted what God did through that prophet in discernment amen God come and he proved himself brother Ben couldn't do nothing he was a seventh great education he had no it was Christ doing it through him he was so close to God God used his lip every time he begin to turn brother said then he said he uses my lips to speak he says it it's never wrong it was always right God used him as his mouthpiece Amen to show was the resurrected Jesus Christ amen and everything he said adds up to the word of God Amen praise the Lord that's what he preached with the unadulterated word of God to bring us back amen the queen of the South shall rise in judgment because why she went all the way come all the way from the south months and months through as we know amen uh uh a territory of Thieves and so forth with a lot of gold and can you imagine if the word would have got out there's a lady coming up there with a few little little uh you know guards and so forth we can easily take him but God watched out for her didn't she absolutely but she came all the way two months travel just to hear the wisdom of Solomon but says people won't cross the street they won't drive to the surfice in a Cadillac and come and see the greater things just like that again my what is God going to do with this generation no wonder we're in the condition that we are in amen my Christ has come and what he has done for us Amen in this generation let's go on now notice Queen of the South she came from the uttermost parts of the here the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here amen a greater than Solomon is here let's look at a couple more things shall we let's go to uh uh Luke 14 Luke 14 there's all kinds of different categories of where the Bible talks about people who make excuses people who uh uh you know even even talking about the foolish virtues we'll read here in a little bit now notice let's start with verse um 15 chapter 14 14:1 15 of St Luke and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then said he unto them a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servants at supper time to say unto them that were bidden come for all things are ready now amen and they all with one consent began to make excuse some many knows that that's what a make believer do a believer he hungers and thirsts after right he get there it don't matter through snow amen two months travel it don't matter but this guy these people they just make excuses don't oh my I've heard it said somewhere I says you know in heaven there's just not going to be any excuses hello no the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and must needs go and see it I pray you have me excuse another said I have bought five yolk of oxin and I go to prove them I pray that you have me excuse how mean know the unbeliever or make believer always find an excuse to do what he wants to do oh let me just go on same as Caine how many know amen Kan he had his own excuse in the wanted to do it his way A make believer want to do it his way no another said I've bought five Yol of oxen okay another said I have married a wife I therefore cannot come so that servant came and showed the Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to the servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring hither the poor and the m and the Halt and the blind amen and the Lord and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room amen how many believe there's still room for somebody else to go to heaven there'll be plenty of room for more in heaven God says there's more room keep coming keep coming he stretches out and the people even this morning the Holy Spirit maybe there's people in the church here am me the Holy Spirit keep calling out keep calling out this is you he's talking to you can't be wishy-washy amen listen a make believer is wishy-washy he's a jellyfish he's tossed about with every wind like Israel was ain't that right that's what a make believer is no backbone to him right but still claims Christianity that's right under the name of Christianity that's right my Jude describes them is that right waves of the sea so to speak foaming out their own shame backsliders turn from God deceivers and being deceived deceiving their s how many know as a Christian that's what we always examine ourselves God am I deceiving myself am I fooling myself God I don't want to fool myself let me examine myself I want to make sure that I'm in faith I want to make sure that I'm ready to go and when you look at this in your life you look at that in your life and you say God this has got to go that has got to go not oh well I'm fine huh people think oh I'm fine if you think that well you must have reached it you must be in perfect walk with God and never fail and on fire for God witnessing to your neighbors to your milk man and just all of those things like you're supposed to be doing amen but I'm here to tell you I heard even even brother brandom I was reading the other day and he was talking about himself and how that he hasn't went and that as much as he should and says I'm like a I feel like a jellyfish jellyfish he called himself it because I haven't done I haven't witnessed I haven't just went out there like I should I've always waited on things I said Lord if he could feel himself to be a jellyfish cuz he ain't doing enough for God what should we do not doing enough for God that's right you don't have much time to do much more for God it's about closing time people it's about going up time straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it it's going to be few people it's going to be few real genuine Believers and I'll tell you right now the way of the hypocrisy the way of make Believers is many oh my my my let's not be there how many know say Lord examine me let's check ourselves out make sure we're not in that category of people amen now on down listen there's still room Hedges oh my and then yet there's room and the Lord said unto the servant go into the highways and the edges and compel them to come in oh I believe that's what the Holy Ghost is doing man if you're not what you ought to be come God is compelling come on in come on in come into Christ get into Christ flee from this wrath that is fixing to happen here amen but God beg God persuades so to speak compels people to come in only the True Believers really do huh make believer I heard that before aren't you glad you've got something down in there something down in there makes you want to go further makes you want to go deeper makes you want to walk straighter makes you want to love more makes you want to drink more makes you want to feed more what makes you want to be like Christ more because if you're predestinated according to Romans 8 he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son and I believe that word comes out in your heart to God that's what I want I want to be conformed to the image of his son but says tell you what now all of your good deeds all of this out of the other people doing helping a widow woman helping this one and helping your neighbor all of that don't count one thing there's only one thing that's going to be accepted and that is if the literal life of Jesus Christ is in you you're not going in rupture unless Christ's life is living out through you that's the only thing that'll satisfy the wrath of almighty God that's the only thing that'll have you ready for a Rapture is when you're not doing it your way remember when Jesus talked about the man that came in there with the robe to the wedding is that right he says man how did you get in here and the man was speechless I'll tell you how he got in there in John 101 it says you know the Sea comes not but he comes up some other way to kill and steal and destroy if you don't come by the way of the door come up some other way you're thief and a robber and mean that's the way Cain thought he could do I can do it my way people want to have a Christian walk like they want their way if you want it your way you remember you're descending the Kain a Believer wants God's way and I'm here to tell you Millions will come on that day and be disappointed disa appointed complete disappointment for the unbeliever and the makeb believer especially the make believer amen because they thought they were right to say this the Baptist is going to be disappointed the Methodist is going to be disappointed Pentecostals are going to be disappointed a lot of message people's going to be disappointed hello that's right they're going on to church this morning but you know what I after they rejected Christ how many knows they rejected Christ Pentecostals the latest of them said if you go down to that church and them meetings will excommunicate you you go to listen to the prophet of God and you see that discernment and Jesus coming Discerning because he did it all the way don't you just love it the Pentecostal say well brother Brandon got off on the end but yet every right up to the last service Jesus always come and Vindicated it don't lie to me you can lie to yourself but you ain't gonna lie to me God was with him all the way he didn't start a work can you imagine God taking him through the Hindu the Buddha challenging them all and and so forth Victorious over all his life and then at the end God drops him boy I want to call him something that I shouldn't fools huh that's right how foolish right how can you think such your brain isn't working right no wonder they go on oh they go have church how many they have church they have speaking in tongue still and all of that brother brah turns around says you have crucified Jesus Christ the fresh and put him to an open shame amen you have crucified him you've put him out even the Bible says I standed it all the L out the age the Pentecostal age had put him outside they rejected him there's nothing left but judgment that's why there's Pentecostal women preachers huh that's right all kinds of stuff like that going on because they've rejected Christ and when they rejected Christ and thought that they what they're going to be in for disappointment then he says Prophet God he was absolutely right you can't expect God to kept you after you reject him no he said what did he what did he say all the church world is doing they're worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God the way that they did it was they took their own understanding they leaned to their own understanding and thinking of things and their ways above the Vindicated proven word word of God this old Amish boy right here I am glad that God came and let us know what the real truth is and then he opened these old scaly eyes right here to be able to see it and by God's grace brother I'm telling you Sean if he has opened our eyes he not opened your eyes and put eyes have on your eyes amen but he's going to see to it that you are not deceived cuz all the world wanders after the Beast here oh ho world is deceived by the devil all their churchgoing their religion is all who have thought it a't that right but that don't make them Christian uhuh when it comes right down to him then reject Jesus Christ it's the same thing is say well the days of Miracles is passed that's not what the Bible says that's what the devil says no such a thing as the Holy Ghost amen my brother Brandon really got him there was a person to come up here says we just speak where the Bible speak and say where the Bible says you know but was only the Holy Ghost was only for the apostles and so forth oh so you speak where the Bible speak let's go to uh Acts 19 let's go to acts the 11th chapter the house of Cornelius he got saved amen Acts 19 got saved it wasn't just for the 12 now believe it come on but no on my church don't teach it that way go ahead and reject them if you don't believe amen you'll be damned amen be damned have to go to the judgment I just brother Joe I just can't imagine how somber how sad how how what it's going to be like at the Judgment what's the Judgment G to be like I don't know about you but when you go into a courthouse and you stand in front of a judge you're not wo hallelujah praise the Lord it is a sober thing somebody's fixing a good to death penalty somebody's going to die somebody going to jail somebody going to get fin somebody going hello it's a sober time amen I can't wait to see Biden there I can't see wait to see Nancy Pelosi there and all of Them Crooked polic I can't see that I can't wait to see y'all there cuz you're gonna be there all of y'all all of y'all gonna be there sure as I'm standing here if you don't think so just give it a little time I know you don't believe it maybe you might want to not believe it you might not even believe it but you're going to be there whether you believe it or not God will raise yourself up he'll bring you B of the Dust of the Earth and he will judge you for having been presented with the truth and rejecting it and going to church being the Catholic our president is huh have some resemblance of Christianity claim Jesus is the savior huh Jesus is the savior but kiss the toe off images of Mary and Peter and Paul and worship and fall down and B to him but of idolatry brother bam says the biggest a form of idolatry there is is Catholicism you know what the other neither be ye idolators over there in uh 1 Corinthians the 10th chapter as some of them were amen some of them worship their Church Pentecostal St their Idol was their church Baptist their Idol was their Church their position they idolized it they put it above God oh brother Brandon we know that it's the truth but I preached that they'll put me out well my gracious where do you want to be put out of here or over there you got to get put out somewhere aren't you glad to be a believer I don't care what it cost me I don't care if it cost me my job my home my church whatever it is I'm willing to pay the price because right after these things let me see if I have it here yeah right after he said that going to highways and the hedges and so forth If any man come after me and hating not his father mother wife brothers and sisters yeah in his own life I like that even your own life also he cannot be my disciple begin to begin to put some real restrictions after he said that some real restrictions if if you're going to follow me you're going to have to forsake all but people not willing to forsake all well I got my life I'll do it my way I don't care what the preacher says you may not say it but you do it life speaks louder than your words isn't that right it's a sad hour for the whole world had rejected something they should have put in the White House remember solom had a gift and they made him King is that right they made him King and what was it that I'm not sure if it was Elijah or one of them you know the I believe it was the Philistines were saying how do do we have a do we have a spy amongst us Prophet said and somebody says he they says no it is that prophet he tells he knows what goes on in your bed Chambers he knows what kind of pajamas you put on he knows he you know oh my brother I got to think about this last night man we should have made brother Brandon president he should have been president we had all nations and I oh my what would have been done didn't even brother B say why didn't this generation if we accept God's Gift the way to they did we'd had another days of Solomon again all the nations would have feared us we wouldn't have needed all we wouldn't have needed a spy plane with all the technology and go down there and look where they're b a little BM no we would have need all that cuz of God would have showed him right there hey y'all get out of that little mountain back there and quit making some nukes we know what you're doing okay as a matter of fact you have about 24 hours to evacu will blow that place up huh that's kind of that's kind of world we what kind of world would we have live lived in if all the churches would have accepted Jesus Christ in this hour I'll tell you what kind of a world we'd have lived in brother BR there wouldn't have been any Baptists and Methodist and Presbyterian and old Lutheran we'd all been message Believers we believe God send us a message we are believers of God's message that he has sent my we've all been unified there'd be no divisions the churches wouldn't have went off and divided themselves anymore because he's coming on a white horse or on a cloud they doctrinal difference they laid all of those things aside and not been such children anymore huh but they couldn't even do that they couldn't even believe and recognize what Jesus that Jesus was what was he was doing and mean didn't the Pharisees didn't those make Believers don't make Believers said you know that you have a devil you're Bey but you cast out Devils by the devil Jesus but B come along he says you know what do they call this mental telepathy mind reading that's what the church World tried to call this and he says that's calling it a devil which for which according to the scripture and the prophet of God he says when the Holy Spirit is coming you seek one word against it it won't be forgiven you in this world or in the world to come to call it but they did didn't they we find such a parallel today don't we of make Believers The Same Spirit that was in the Pharisees is in the churches today it can be done right in front of them right right out in the open right there it is and they reject it that's right when the hot flames of hell is burning their tongues and burning their bodies and they're in complete torment they'll think about that they'll think about the fact that hey they actually just turned their eye I didn't want to do it I want it my way am me like Kane he wanted his way way of worship God doesn't accept your way of worship no you come his way or you don't come amen that's the world that we're living in folks that's why the world is in the condition that it's in is that boy if you could just have that in every media outlet that there is out there the reason the world is in the condition is is because they rejected the remedy for it not to be that way that's why the young people that's why our colleges that's why our presidents that's why it's all going Amen to hell so to speak in a hand basket ain't that right because they rejected Jesus Christ just as an individual how many knows you as an individual you get away from God and you

how many knows it's man's it's man's ways it's kind of built in US Amen to get away from God the cycle of death and Revival always repeated itself always go oh my but aren't you glad that there was a word spoken in this message that said that's not going to happen in this last one there's going to be a bride that is not going to backslide a bride that's not going to get away from God she's GNA get not hot not colder but she's going to get hotter and she's going to be ready for the coming of the [Applause] Lord and I'm a part of it are you a part of it I'm a part of that that word is down in here and that we're not rejecting Christ we listen to him and it's still Small Voice every day are you listening to a still Small Voice every day cuz that's where the rubber meets the road and you listening to the Holy Spirit or not just the other day the holy spirit says do this do this do this do this I didn't really want to but I did Brother Brad because I knew to listen to that voice I have my had my butt beat way too many times when I didn't listen to it it's a terrible thing when you don't listen to it boys you're going to get it amen it ain't going to be pleasant oh my so when you hear that voice when that voice tells you to do something do it I don't care how much it rubs against you you know what do it amen follow that holy spirit amen and it's the same unction that's cried out to the people cried out to the prophet of God repent B repent Methodist repent Pentecost repent every one of you he said because kabad is rode over the doors amen the wrath of God is belting right beneath you how much longer he'll hold that sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out y a mile deep will slide in there Plum back to the saltan SE it'll be the last day of Pompei worse than the last day of Pompei repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God all right I read that one let me go down to this last one so I pray Lord in jesus' name let the people shake themselves tonight and to flee from the Wrath that is to come OT is roll over the doors and over the nation a black check mark has come across this spirit of God is grieved away from it and they're weighed into balance and found waning the Feast of King Nebuchadnezzar has repeated again with drunken parties and half-dressed women calling themselves Christians amen remember when brother B went into the hotel room and all of this and so forth and then they were stripped down drunk and everything else church people huh that's where Christianity had gotten to all in the name of Christianity a bunch of adulterous amen amen if you won't come pure before God God ain't that right you want to commit spiritual fornications against God you'll commit for fornications naturally hello there's no no saying no talking of how slow a person will stoop when they get away from the God oh my amen you love him this morning we do not want to fall in that category isn't that right no we don't want to fall in the category of a make believer but we do have to be careful even Paul warned us Amen in chapter 10 and we'll go a few more minutes that all right chapter 10 of Corinthians he says more moreover Breen I would have not have you ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and they all eat the same spiritual meat and they all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual Rock they followed them then that rock was Christ how many believe that's what we preached on Wednesday amen that that spring that flows up that rock that we can drink out of just speak to the Rock anything you need but there's a lot of people that eat and drink come to church amen I'm telling you telling you of people that have backlit and gotten away from God and you thought they never would it's almost scary ain't it like what in the world it makes you say God yeah God help me that right Lord you know let me take the warning that Paul said let him that thinketh he standeth take heed least he fall amen stay humble before Mighty God Amen they were all under the cloud they all were baptized unto Moses amen let me say a lot of them were baptized those Pentecostals were baptized any merss in the name of Jesus Christ that's why many of them spoke in tongues and all these other things but where are they today amen they all drank the same spiritual meat and so forth but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness oh my let's not be overthrown now these things were our example to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted but does the Bible say every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own rust and it TI and when you go that way it ends up in sin and sin brings you into death that's what happened to Israel they were overthrown talking about scary people uh you know to think that two people out of two million Joshua and Caleb out of the original Bunch after they came out of Egypt they had children a't that right they had children and so forth but after kades Bia when they would not believe the spies and so forth when they came back went back it was a judgment brother said called a judgment they went back into the Wilderness none of one of them Jesus said every one of them died in the wilderness and then Joshua and Caleb took their children in sure their children went in but those million those two million didn't why because they were overthrown they were make Believers like I said a make believer is tossed first trial that comes along they seen all the signs they seen all the Wonders oh I don't know about you but I'm not just seen signs and wonders through the prophets and message I believe that but when you see God working in your own life and then something else comes up and you murmur and complain about it huh don't let that unbelief what did Paul say you know be be careful at least there be among you one that is with an evil heart of unbelief amen be careful make sure now these things are example amen neither be idolators or some of them were now can I just read put my own scripture in here a little bit they put something else before God anything you put before God is an idol that's right God ain't first in your life how many believes that's why you got to be careful that every day every day keep God first every day examine if God is first or if whatever else you're doing is the firsted don't be an idolater verse 8 let us not commit fornication some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for an samples and they were written for our admission upon whom the ends of the Earth or the world are come Lord help me don't let me be an idolator don't let me be a Fric these are example don't let be a bur be a murmur don't let me complain don't let me disbelieve you Lord let me be anchored in Christ knowing that whatever problem comes up next if God took care of your last problem if he delivered you from your last trial he'll deliver you from the next trial he'll deliver you from the next trial is't that wonderful aren't you glad to serve a God like that that no matter what comes along next he's got you he's got you taken care of you're not a make believer I'm a Believer not a doubter I'm a Believer not a doubter amen and

really are happy you love him this morning don't be a make believer you be a real genuine Holy Ghost filled believer that examines his life daily to whether you're in the faith or not because you can't take a chance I am never I do not want to hear those words amen that he said when they came to me many will come to me in that day and say haven't we prophesied haven't we cast out devils in your name haven't we done all these many mighty works can you imagine what kind of a day that's going to be now how many believes this Jesus said that's what they're going to say that's what they G to
