========================================

Verse 15 says, "See then that we walk circumstantially not as fools but as wise." Verse uh 16, "Redeeming the time because the days are evil." And I just want to speak a few minutes on this on this thought, redeeming the time. I believe we live in a time that time is going so fast you can't keep up. I believe we're living in such a busyness of life. The devil keeps us busy, young people. He keeps you busy with social media. He keeps you busy with social your phone. He keeps you busy. I tell you, I was at a store the other day, Brother Ber, and this young kid was doing this and literally hit the wall. Hid the wall. He didn't even look up. He just hid the wall. And I said, "That's the time we live in." That go that the devil wants to keep you so busy, young people, that you don't have no time for God. And God is still waiting for you to come back to your first love. &gt;&gt; He We're in a time that everything's running fast. We're We're in a time that it's busy. And I said, "You know what stands for? Being under Satan's yoke. &gt;&gt; Being under Satan's yoke. God, the devil wants to keep you so yolked up in even your job or whatever you're doing that you'll even miss Wednesday nights. Oh, it's okay to miss a little Wednesday night here and there. It's okay to not maybe miss a Sunday, but no. Have you ever missed a gas station when you went by when it was almost on E? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I have. I'm gonna be honest, &gt;&gt; my car didn't run that good, brother Ber. I I kind of started putting, but maybe some of you felt like I barely got here today, but you're here. And maybe you didn't feel like getting out of the bed today. And maybe you feel like you just put a bomb in life. But I'm here to tell you, let God come on and change that attitude. Let God fill you up. Maybe you say, "Brother Cris, my joy is empty." Well, guess what? He'll give you some more joy today. Whatever you need today. Well, I tell you, aren't you thankful that we got a little gauge? And sometimes, I mean, there's not every day that I feel like waking up. And there's been days I'm like, "Oh gosh, I got to preach today. Oh my, I barely can feel my body. I'm not feeling good." But I'm here to tell you, it's not about your feelings today. &gt;&gt; It's not about how we feel. It's it's about we just come here and say, "God, you have control. You have control of my life." But are we living in a time that we need to redeem our time back? The devil's trying to steal your family's time, your devotion time, your prayer time, your everything in your life. The devil wants to take up in your family's life, fill it with games, and hey, they're all good in their place. In volleyball, I saw all that's good in his time. But God wants to fill the young people, he wants to feed you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you a life that's worth living. Maybe you're maybe you say, "Well, my family don't do this. My dad don't pray. My mama don't read the Bible." Well, guess what? You ripped the Bible.
