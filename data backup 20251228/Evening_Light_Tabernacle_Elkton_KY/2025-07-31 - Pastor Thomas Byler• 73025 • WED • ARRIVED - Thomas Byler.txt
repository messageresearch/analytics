Her color is good and and she just said that she would wish we'd pray that she'd get her feeling and her hands and her her feet were not swollen like they had been.

Trust everybody's having a good week so far. Amen. We are certainly looking around the corner. Amen. For some of that good 80s weather. Amen. So, praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen. Good to see everybody out. Thank you, musicians. Amen. That'll be all. Amen. We're going to announce this coming Sunday will be our carry in Sunday. Brother Joe Adams will be with us Sunday and also next Wednesday evening. Amen. So, he's going to preach three services. So, we're looking forward to that. Amen. Y'all better ready be ready for your scream and shout. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God is good, isn't he? Amen. So, I just have a little thought tonight with the help of the Lord. Oh, and brother Brad will be ministering the following Sunday after that. Amen. So, amen. Already going into August. I was looking at the calendar about four and a half weeks before September. That's unbelievable, isn't it? Amen. Things are fixed to turn around the other way. We're going to lose a lot of daylight. Amen. And so forth. But Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Quite the times that we're living in, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we come before you, Father, tonight once again desiring, Lord Jesus, that Father, you'll have your complete way, Father, in the service, Lord. We welcome you in a special way, Lord. And we have been taught by your prophet that wherever you are invited, you always come, Lord Jesus. And so, Father, tonight we ask that you would look at every heart. Father, you know what's beneath every heart and the need of every heart and you know how to speak to every heart, Father. And we would ask, God, that you would minister to every need, Lord, this evening. Bless those that are streaming, Father. We do thank you, Lord, for the a good report, Father, on Sister Parish, Lord. And we just ask God that you'd just be with that and do that with each and everyone, Lord, has that same need, Father. And bless the reading of the word, the meditation of our heart. Now, we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Turn your Bibles if you will. We'll just get right into the word. Amen. I told my wife, I said, "We'll just make it short tonight." Amen. So, she didn't say, "Don't make promises you can't keep." But Amen. Philippians, if you will, Philippians, and this is kind of a new message for me, actually. This is, you know, and so we'll just see what the Lord will have. Amen. And I just like the Amen. If the Lord lays something on our hearts, just kind of let him if he puts it there, he knows what to do with it, right? &gt;&gt; He knows what to do with it. But this is a scripture that come to my mind. Philippians 3 verse 7. But what things were gained to me I counted loss for Christ. Yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found of him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but with that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. Amen. And if by any means I might untain unto the resurrection of the dead. I want you to kind of pick up that word, stick it in your mind every time that Paul mentions it because I will give you my title off of this word here in a minute. And that's that word in verse 11. If by any means I might attain. Attain. All right. Unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained. Either were already perfect, but I follow after. If that I may apprehend, there's another good word that'll go with it. That apprehend that for which I am apprehended in Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended. But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto things which are before, for I pressed towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded. And if there be anything that ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, and notice this, whereto, we have already attained. Amen. Whereto, we have already attained. In other words, the things that you have already attained to. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe there's things that we have attained and there's those things that we're trying to attain. &gt;&gt; There's things that we're trying to apprehend and there's many things that we have already apprehended. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So it says there where we have already attained let us walk by the same rule. Let us mind the same thing. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated tonight. Amen. So do you have that title? Very different title. Very different. Called arrived arrived. Amen. Amen. That's the word that come to my mind. Amen. And then I begin to work off of that. Amen. And begin to think, you know, and just let the Holy Spirit uh, you know, quicken some things. Amen. And it was amazing where it went. Amen. Uh, so Paul's saying here that I don't claim that I've gotten there, right? There's some things that we have attained to. There's some things that we have we've possessed that we get. Now, notice the word possession. Amen. when uh uh when when you arrive someplace, you've gotten to the place that you were trying to get to. Amen. You're in possession of something now. Maybe you had a goal, right? And you work hard towards that goal and you finally get to that goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get there, there's great joy because you have arrived. &gt;&gt; You've gotten what you were trying to attain. You've gotten there. Amen. I thought before I come out here, I thought that brother Brandham had said something about that in his vision of where he went beyond the curtain of time and he seen all the people there, right? And he described what it was like and it was so beautiful. It was so perfect. And he makes a statement. Oh, when I thought to come back, it made me sad. Will I have to go back again? Why? Because he had gotten there. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go back. How many believes we're looking to go to that place? &gt;&gt; Man, that's what we're striving for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Paul said it in the resurrection that I by any means I might I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Amen. Will I have to go back to what I was afraid of being? See, then when we come to the resurrected body, then we will eat and drink. They didn't eat or drink. They had no need of eating or drinking. They uh they wasn't going nowhere. And they wasn't tired. It was just there's no word that I could use. It was perfect that would make it. It's beyond what you call perfect. They had just arrived. &gt;&gt; They had gotten there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What a place. Isn't that nice? What a place to be is to get where you're trying to go. &gt;&gt; You know, they said, I guess, brother Glenn and Sherry, they went on a road trip, right? Alaska. They're enjoying the last y'all made it back. Good to see you back. Glad you had a hope you had a good trip. But there and I was sitting back there. It's kind of like them, you know, because I think it was brother Glenn says that Sherry has a bucket list, you know, and she wants to go places and see places and stuff, you know, and they've kind of got a goal. I know I have a vision of we're going to go to we want to see Alaska, you know, and I can just kind of imagine. I don't know about them. Ain't no telling. I don't know if it's a fancy restaurant with big lobsters is the imagination of their desire or what they're really looking for, you know? But for me, I'd like to find one of the highest peaks. Wouldn't you get way up there somewhere and to be able to just see the vast beautiful land and man having to travel? I don't know if they flew. I guess hopefully they flew. Surely they didn't drive all that way. Glenn would tell us that you know what he says about she's going to kill me. But anyway, they flew up there and so they go to the vast parts. Amen. And they they they go to the airport, they go to Nashville, they go to they fly and they come and they do all of that and all of the work that goes into trying to get there and finally be there and I can just kind of imagine perhaps you're there and you know you put out a little man I'm finally am I glad we finally got here. &gt;&gt; You know, isn't this awesome? This is really nice, you know, and hopefully is as good as what they dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's kind of what we want to speak on that place of arrival. Amen. There's quite a it's it's it's it's quite something. It's like Amen. It's kind of like the trips that we used to take to Florida. Many we don't take near as many anymore. Amen. But we used to go and you know there'd be these mile markers, right? These mile posts, what we call mile posts as you're traveling. Let me go back a little bit. First of all, how many's ever really been on expectation of going somewhere so much so that that night before leaving you couldn't hardly sleep. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's so much expectation that man I can't go man you I'm looking forward to the time I can't wait till morning I can't wait till we go and you know that's the way it is in the Bible there's uh when the fullness of time comes you know it was time for the kingdom of god to be preached there's a time for everything &gt;&gt; and we anticipate even the moment of that time and you're finally he says oh man the The time has finally come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so just before you can even go, the time has come. And I believe we're living in that hour, don't you? &gt;&gt; That the time has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it's about time to leave this place. &gt;&gt; So next morning you get up. I don't know what it might be. Might be me and Joe going to Texas on a hunt. Man, I can't hardly sleep. I can't wait. Hey, we're going to Wyoming on a bird. I don't know. You know, uh, you know, used to be exciting and doing different things and but you head to Florida maybe and and as you start out, of course, your first line uh mile marker is going to be what? Nashville. Oh, man. You know, it's an hour to Nashville. All right, we step number one. Next one's Chattanooga, right? All right. Three hours. Oh, three hours to Chattanooga, you know, and next one after that finally. Oh, we got that. But boy, oh boy. Oh, boy. It's kind of a drag. We still got a long way to go, right, Brother Troy? Atlanta. All right, we Atlanta's the next one. Oh, finally we get down there. It's about I don't know 80 miles between is Chattanooga 80 something or is it maybe a little more than that? But anyway, you get to Atlanta. The next one's what? M waiting for that 475 bypass. And once you get on the other side of that 475 bypass, just where you come around that curve over there, that's always to me been the halfway mark. I don't think it's quite halfway, but it's pretty close. You come around there and say, "All right, we meet back up with 75. Next one, Valdasta, Florida." All right, that's the next one is after making Valdusta. You know, you go to through Tiffan and all these other little towns and but you're looking for Valdasta cuz it's down there. And finally you get to Valdusta. And then you go past the Valdusta just a little bit just looking for that Florida. Welcome to Florida sign. I finally get to the Florida Florida sign. Oh, we're the we're at the landmark here now. We're in Florida. Amen. We ain't got to worry about them Georgia troopers anymore. They're everywhere. All right. Come to Florida next one. Next thing you see is a big old sign says 203 miles to Tampa. Oh, 200, man. Honey, can you drive for a little while? Right about that time. See if you can drive. Get a little siesta and wake up about where just 20 mile. Wake up about 20 miles from Oh, yeah. That's all right. We got it made now. Ain't that right? And so after of course you get to Tampa it's just about an hour maybe or so back to you're going to go. Amen. And when you get that you get out of the truck and man I am glad we have finally arrived. Amen. You kids know how it is. Are we there yet? Are we there yet? No, we're not there yet. Amen. That's what Paul was saying. We haven't gotten there. But guess what? We ain't looking back. Amen. We're pressing for the mark of the prize of the high calling. Amen. We've had gl we've had our marks of Paul and Arinius and Martin and Pentecost. We've had the m marker of Malachi 4. But Bam said, you know, you know, a couple years ago Malachi 4 wasn't fulfilled, but he said now it's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; I mean, know he said that. That's right. Malachi being fulfilled. Amen. He the word is restored. Give us some mile markers telling us where we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. A little bit closer and we will look for 50 years for that woman in purple. Hello. Amen. We waited for 50 60 years. I don't know just how long it's been. Amen. For that man to come out of Rome. And we know he said one he said once that woman comes in there and does what she does. He said the next thing he saw was the world America burned up. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? nothing but volcanic or or ashes everywhere. And here we are giving I mean giving Putin an ultimatum of about five days and he said, "Hey, you're going to cause World War II." Talking like that. &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows we are going to have to tick him off pretty good cuz for him to push the button, he's going to have to not like us well at all. &gt;&gt; So, as long as Trump and Putin are on the phone being buddies, maybe nothing will happen. But if they're mad at each other and they don't like each other, we don't never know. Ain't that right? How many believes that we could go at any time? &gt;&gt; The rapture could happen at any time. We are passing these landmarks. We're almost home, people. It's time to get excited. We're coming down the home stretch. It ain't going to be very long anymore. And there's going to be a body change. And I'm not just worried about the world blowing up. There's a bride. There's a church. There's a people in this church right here. Amen. That is manifesting. Amen. That they're getting ready. A bride is getting ready to leave. We're coming into his image. Amen. We've got the dynamics of the power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And not just the mechanics. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A church that's getting ready. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And we're looking forward to it. And I like it. I like that song. I don't know if Brother David can maybe sing that, but I'm here to tell you, Amen. When we get over yonder, this is what Brother Bam says about it. When they finally get there, he says, "No, listen friends. I think I'm in my right mind. I know it sounds strange, but if I've ever been able and never tried to explain to the people of things, he says it's beyond explaining. He says, you'd only confuse the people's mind if you would try to. It's a lot. It would be alarming. But notice this. I say this, don't be afraid. That is just a scarecrow trying to keep you away from something. My, it's so glorious. It's beyond anything that you could think of. No wonder the Bible says, "Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man." Amen. The things that God has prepared for them that love him. Oh, just to look past the curtain of time. Amen. Another place he says, "Whatever you do, friends, don't miss it. You can't afford to miss it." How many knows when we get over I like that song. When I get over there, when I finally get to that place, when I finally arrive, I'm going to let the glory roll. When the roll is called in glory, I'm going to have the time of my life. When the time of my life is over, I'm going to get carried away when I get carried away. [Applause] Woo! How many believe that's what we are? Amen. We're under expectation. We're looking forward to it. And when we get over there, get out of my way. I'm going to run and scream and shout and praise God. I'm going to get carried away. &gt;&gt; But we got to get carried away a little bit. &gt;&gt; Cuz how many believes we have already, praise the Lord, come and we already have in our possession. &gt;&gt; We have come to the place that we possess the down payment of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many remembers what brother Bam said about earnest money? Amen. How many believes we've got the earnest? I'm going to jump around here a little bit, but I might as well go here while I'm at it because I want to take you through a little little cycle. Let me just do that. Paul said that we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why does he get hope for it? In other words, once you possess something, once you arrive, once you have something, you ain't got to hope for it anymore. &gt;&gt; There's people perhaps, "Oh, I'd like to get saved. I'm trying to get saved. I'm trying to get more. I want to be born again." Amen. And they're fighting and they're struggling and everything else. That's not any fun. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I just don't know if I'm worthy. I just don't know this, that, or the other. Amen. And I had to ask myself the question here. I don't know if anybody anybody but wants to have joy. &gt;&gt; How many wants to have joyable? &gt;&gt; How many believe we can have joy unspeakable? And I like the second half as I wrote it down. It's not just joy unspeakable, but it's full of glory. [Applause] It's full of glory &gt;&gt; when you think about it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because if you've got God, man, you've got all of God on the inside. You got glory, the glory that created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; But it might be a struggle. It might be a journey of of uh justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. That's right. You might want uh no doubt, but people want peace. Peace that passes understanding. The very peace of God. But there's a way to get that. There's a way to come to the place where you can say, "I have arrived. I have got it." &gt;&gt; Amen. This is little little of the series like Benjamin Franklin said, "I got it. I got it." Well, what do you got? Tonight, we want to look at what we got. &gt;&gt; Amen. What you possess, not what you want. We're going to talk about wishbone and backbone. Not the stuff that you wish you had. &gt;&gt; There's a whole If you don't have something, all you can do is wish for it. &gt;&gt; You still got to have wishbone, but you got to have faith to get that and get rid of the wishbone and be claim it, &gt;&gt; to accept it, to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You still got to hope for things that you don't have. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So, a little walk there stages we come through. Amen. I think as brother Bram said that Job when he uh when he finally got the revelation and God revealed himself to him, he said, "I know. I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; He may have had questions before. He may have had confusion before. But when he got the revelation, I know my redeemer liveth. That's why brother Abraham says it's time people know that they're saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might struggle. You might s. But you've got to do one thing. One thing you got to do. Amen. Is to repent of your sins. &gt;&gt; Repent and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Ask him to forgive you of your sins. If you want to be forgiven, if you don't want to have condemnation in your heart, if you want to be free, you got to come the right way. And God has a way. You got to come that way. You got to go through that death of yourself, &gt;&gt; man. And when you finally do, this just comes fresh. I believe Brother Brandham said, you know, uh, Abraham after he had the the battle, Amen, with the enemy and brought his brother back after he had gotten your after you got yourself whipped. &gt;&gt; Hello. After you whipped yourself, after you had that battle with yourself, Amen. You've overcome that battle. Amen. Then you're ready for fellowship with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; You got to have that battle. &gt;&gt; When you finally come to the end of that battle. Amen. Then what does God do? God gives you something. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that something? It's that something that God told Joshua. Remember he says, "Now get up and go in and possess the land." &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's time to arrive? &gt;&gt; It's time to possess. &gt;&gt; It's time to have it. &gt;&gt; Not wish you had it or try to have it. &gt;&gt; You got to go through those stages, but it's time to possess it. Amen. I thought of that scripture where Jesus said, "Be ready." How many believe it's time to be ready? In other words, you have come to the place. You have arrived at the place to where you truly believe if Jesus comes before morning, you're ready. &gt;&gt; You have arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a process sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, brother Bam says when he was preaching about the message of the hour at invisible union, I believe it was. He says we don't just come together to talk about the message. We are to come together to get in the message. And we can say not just get in the message, but we got to get the message in us. &gt;&gt; He says it's not time to just sympathize and say, "Yeah, I believe it right. Yeah, I believe it right." It's got to be more than that. You've got to possess it. You got to get to the plate first. It's in me. I am the message. &gt;&gt; The message is in me. Perfect faith is in me. Perfect love is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that. He said it's like another place he explained it. He says the message, you know, it's like a young man seeing a young girl. She may be beautiful as ever. She maybe be Christian, you know, but guess what? If he don't say, "Hey, will you be mine?" She ain't never going to do him any good. &gt;&gt; Never know him commitment. Hello. But you got to you got to say, "Hey, will you marry me?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Commit yourself. Become part of it. That's the way it is. This is it's beautiful. Let's make it part of us. Say, "It's mine. We are one. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. How many knows that prophecy is something that's foretelling the future? Prophecy foretells the future. And we've already covered a lot of that. How that you know it tells the future, but there comes a time when that prophecy is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then it's not prophecy anymore. And we always wait for thousands of years just as a prophecy of there'll be a day that'll be neither dark nor light, but it'll be a dismal day. Little confusing when you got 1900 different churches, thousands of different faiths, bunch of different churches from the same Bible. &gt;&gt; Hello. like a bunch of different message churches out of the message. &gt;&gt; Aren't we all supposed to be message believers? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "In every revival, there's twins." &gt;&gt; There's the carnal believer that persecutes the the real Christian believer, always against him. There's always twins in every revival. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. But there's a truth somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be. I want to be in the right path. Amen. Okay. Praise the Lord. So there you are. God, forgive me. Lord, forgive me. Fill me. I want to possess the land. I don't want to just look across Jordan. How many knows? It was a journey for Israel. Two weeks journey took him 40 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. Took him 40 years to go about two weeks journey. Some folks struggle half their lifetime trying to surrender themselves and get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Don't knock Israel so much. How long have you been struggling along going around mountains? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Time to surrender to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Time to be surrendered to God. Time to be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead to that promised land. I want that promise. It's mine. Go in and possess it. What is the promise? The promise is to you, to your children, to them that are far off, that if you'll repent, Amen, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cuz it's the promise. It is our promised land to you, to your children, to them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. I remember I remember struggling. I remember looking for what's truth. I remember desiring the Holy Ghost. I remember thirsting after God. I remember wanting to be knowing that I'm forgiven of my sins. &gt;&gt; Hello. But I'm here to tell you, Amen. When John, my goodness, Stephen, can't even remember my father's name, so to speak. John Stemon. Amen. When we got baptized into that Philipp when I come up out of there, hello. I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. It was a load lifted. I thought I might just float on away. I know the feeling. And it ain't just a feeling, but I'm here to tell you when all the load of your sins and the burdens of your sins are gone, you're going to know it. A baby can't be born and not know it. And I'm here to tell you, you begin to woo. Yeah, I have arrived. I don't want it anymore. I've got it, Daddy. I've got it. Why? When you get to the place that you want to go, you have to wish for it. Amen. I got it. I still got it. I still got it. 40 years later. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come to that place, Brother Brad. That's good. &gt;&gt; I have arrived &gt;&gt; to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I got something to be excited about. &gt;&gt; Man, I miss my fan. Got to have my fan. It's under the house where me and Caleb was crawling like rats. Amen. Got it. Praise be to God. How many knows what all comes with that? Let me explain what comes with that. Brother Brandon preached that the Holy Ghost is a token. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is where the Holy Spirit took me. That it's a token. And when you get the Holy Ghost, that is a sign that the price has been t paid. &gt;&gt; Token is a prize. A sign that the price has been paid. He says a railroad company, a bus company, a lot of times they don't take money. You come on there and say, "Here's a $100. Let me on." Nope. Give me the ticket. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Got to have a ticket. They'll shut that door on you. You got to have a ticket. How many believes if we're going to escape Putin's nuke, you better have a ticket. &gt;&gt; You better have the ticket in your hand. You better have the token in your hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, many things he said and I'll just go over it quick out of memory. Brother Benham says that if he gives you the Holy Ghost, that means that God has accepted your faith. He has accepted your sacrifice. In other words, you have died the way you're supposed to die to yourself. And you have believed the way that you are supposed to believe because we're not to be supposed to have to carry and wait anymore. The second that you believe, the second that you really accept it, God is obligated to you. Boy, if somebody ain't got the Holy Ghost where you ought to have, you ought to write that down on your little tablet. God actually accepts your faith. Amen. He will give it to you right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are in possession. You have arrived at the place. You are there now. And it means the price has been paid. He has accepted your money. He has accepted the offering that you have given and that is faith in the in the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Bam goes to talking about it used to be that they had to have the blood that token in the Old Testament. They had to put the blood of a lamb on the post of the door of the house. So everybody can see it. It's got to be on the post and on the lantern. So every onlooker can tell that you have been you are under the toe. And how many believes your workers, your boss, the people around you ought to be able to tell that's a Christian. &gt;&gt; He's got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be a witness. We'll get into that in a minute. Amen. Joe was telling me of how he witnessing to folks and telling them, "Hey, are you ready if the Lord comes, you know, are you ready at 2:30 or what? Are you ready for the Lord coming this week? We've had a sheetrock finisher finish your our sheetrock Caleb sheetrock." And I was impressed upon him, felt felt my heart to go tell him, talk to him and invite him to come to church. And uh Juan's his name. I like the guy. He's just you know some people just lively and you know just something about him and he was just about to be done today and I went over there and I says, "Hey, you go to church?" He said, "No, we we used to. Me and my wife used to." I says, "Well, you ought to because we're at the end of the world." you ought to cuz we're at the end of the world. That's what I told him. He says, "Yes, yes, yes. If we see," and he's at the New York, the massacre, he knows. He said, "Here's why." He knows. Ain't that right? So, I gave him the church address. We may see him. He said he might just come by. Amen. We got to be bold. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. In witnessing, I need to be more bolder than I am. Amen. Praise the Lord. So let's look at this token. And they had to put it on the house. It was his requirement. He says, "And that was their protection against death." Ain't that right? Amen. And as we see the great end times of the earth, warning us the time is at hand. How many believes the time is at hand? &gt;&gt; We're here. We have arrived at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says we should love one another more than we ever did in our lives. We should love and have such a hunger to go to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wrote in here and I hope it don't full hurt nobody because I tell you what, our elderly and different people that are adolescent that can't come to church, it's all fine to stream. But people that just stream, well, I don't go to church. I I stream. &gt;&gt; Be careful. I felt to say that you don't stream yourself into hell. &gt;&gt; Hello. Maybe you need a little more than just streaming. &gt;&gt; If you can, you need to be in the house of God. You need to have so much of the love of God. &gt;&gt; That you're not just comfortable drinking your tea in your rocking chair. &gt;&gt; Hello. Or your soda or whatever it is when you could be up and about. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're sick or can you can't do it, I'm glad for all our streamers. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother Mo, I don't know if he's listening, but he had told me the other day he streams the service here. He really enjoys it. So, if he's listening, appreciate him listening. Amen. Led him to the Lord way many years ago. Here we go. That's right. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get with one another. How many believe we ought to love one another? We ought to be for one another because I made it to tell you just before I come out. I said, "Lord Jesus, get on my knees. Lord, I'm going to stand before your purchased of your blood. Keep me from saying anything I shouldn't say. And Lord, help me to feed your sheep." Amen. We got to have a respect and a love one for another. And that's what he's saying in the times and so forth that we're the age that we're living in. Amen. Praise the Lord. We see the end times. Brother Bam talks about he can't hardly wait to go see his wife. She got healed. Amen. That's the way the church ought to be. Just seeing the power of God, what it's done for us. We should be counting the moments getting together in love that we can that we can fly away someday to meet Jesus. &gt;&gt; How many's looking for that? That's right. One of days we're going to fly away. Amen. And meet Jesus. Praise the Lord. Because that's what we're looking to do. Amen. You know, Israel on their journey, they had a lot of scary times. Ain't that right? Scary times. For example, when they were down at the Red Sea trapped and the enemy was coming, they could hear him coming, see the dust, I guess, and they begin to complain and murmur. But what did God do? He opened up the Red Sea &gt;&gt; and he began to walk across. Amen. And while they were walking across, there was probably a lot of spooky thoughts, a lot of fear, perhaps. Amen. I thought that's like kind of like maybe uh like what what a person may be with my wife or whoever. Perhaps you're sick. Perhaps there's cancer and while you're waiting on the Lord to come heal you, you believe you're healed. Hello. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, when you get to that other side, Amen. and the enemy gets washed away. I'm here to tell you when you get results back and they tell you it's not on the limp notes anymore. It's not on the lengthen. We said we have arrived. God has done something for us. We are here. We're seeing the power of God. We're seeing him move to the place you can rejoice on the other bank. Woo! You can be happy. Oh, there's so many different illustrations. It's like a football team. It's like a basketball team that's struggling sweat. And I'll be honest with you, I've never liked basketball a whole lot. Never been much of a basketball man. Cuz for the most part, they're even teams and they play all the way to the end. They're always pretty much close tied. &gt;&gt; At least the ones I've watched watched years ago. I guess they got what? Three quarters, four quarters. Well, the just throw the first three away. Don't mean nothing. Same way with football. Whenever they're just one touchdown away, it don't matter if they're in overtime or how long they've been playing and there's just two minutes and they're on the 30 yard or 40 yardd line. Hello. And they've got two minutes or comes down to 30 seconds. Those 30 seconds are more important to you than everything else. And that's the way it is with you and I. We've had all the church agents. We've had all of that. But this is the important time. This is time to be ready. This is where it matters the most. This is crunch time. This is where people are at the edge of their seat. Hello. Counting down. Maybe it's down to the last play. They're at 10 yard line. It's fourth down or even probably fourth. Why? Because they didn't make it on the three downs. So, they're going to try it with the fourth, &gt;&gt; whether it's a field goal, most likely it'll be a field goal. But if they don't and they go back, everybody's watching. And when that quarterback throws that ball, when that wide receiver, when he tips it, hello, he he tips it and he still just jumps over and catches it and knows it. Can you imagine the crowd? They ripped their shirt, go crazy. Why? Cuz they had beaten. They've come to the place of victory. And that's where you and I ought to be tonight. Amen. Don't talk to me about victory. I know what victory is. I am victorious. You are victorious. We enjoy the thrill of victory. That's where you and I ought to be. victorious cuz he's coming for not defeated people. He's coming for people have overcome. To him that overcometh, &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me in my throne? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes we you need to possess that? What did Paul say? Amen. Oh death, where is your sting? Oh grave, where is your victory? But I thank my Lord Jesus Christ who has given me. &gt;&gt; I now possess the victory over death. I don't fear death. Oh chopping block, let me stick my head in there cuz you have no victory over me. &gt;&gt; That's where you and I ought to live. Sin, you have no victory over me. Temptation, you ain't got no victory over me. &gt;&gt; I think Jesus has given me the victory &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. How many believe you ought to be the happiest people? &gt;&gt; We should be the happiest people on the face of the earth cuz you possess the token. You got the ticket. The train is coming around. It's in the block and we're fixing to get on it. And you ain't got to worry. You ain't got to fret. You ain't got to worry about the future of this world because you've got the ticket in your hand. Why? Because you love the Lord God with all of your heart. You love him on a Monday. You love him on a Tuesday. You love him on a Wednesday. You love him on a Thursday. You love him on a Friday. And you love him on a Saturday. You love him 24/7. And you give him your all and say, "God, help me. Let me be like Paul. I have suffered the loss of everything that I might win Christ." Let me tell you something. You put everything else as loss so that you can serve Christ. that I may know him in the power of his resurrection. Amen. Couple more things on the token. I love this token. &gt;&gt; It means you've been accepted. Praise the Lord. A lot of people might not like you. They might not accept you in their circles. The bank might not accept your application for a loan for the house that you wanted. We never know. This may not be the job you don't get that you wanted, but I'm here to tell you that if you want eternal life and you come the way that you're supposed to come, when God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he forgives you of your sins. That means you have been accepted in the beloved. You have been accepted by Almighty God. You have not been rejected. Not only that, but God has sealed you. That means he has put you in the car. Amen. And he has closed the door. And Amen. You are going to make it to your eternal destination. You're protected. You're sealed. Amen. If you have arrived, then you are sealed. You are sealed in. In whom also after ye have believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his glory. Remember, you've got the earnest. Brother Bam says that's like the down payment. &gt;&gt; You got the down payment on it. Amen. Until the redemption of the purchased possession. In other words, when God says, "Now I'm coming to redeem what I bought." How many believe God's going to do that? All the saints and the graves, Ivan, all those that are filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. All of our loved ones that have been filled with the Holy Ghost, God will come and he'll say, "There's my possession. I have bought them on Calvary all the way from Abel all the way through all of them. He's going to come and redeem us at that time." What a time that's going to be. How many believe? Oh, I'm going to have the time of my life. I'm having the time of my life now. I can't imagine what I'll do when I got my new body. &gt;&gt; I'm going to jump from here all the way up there to the balcony, folks. We're going to leap over wall. We're going to leap and jump. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Man, if you can have joy shouting like that here, what's it going to be like over there?" What do you think it's going to be like if this is just a down payment and we can enjoy the down payment this much? Hallelujah. What is that earnest? Or it's like a quarter. Amen. If you're starving to death, somebody gives you a quarter and you know that's the purchasing power. All I can tell you is give me another one cuz I want to buy that good baloney to put on the bread. &gt;&gt; How many likes a good baloney sandwich? &gt;&gt; One don't. You didn't have too much of it, did you? Said now you don't like it anymore. I am weak, but thou art strong. Cuz I just got to cook me a hot dog once in a while, folks. And put it on there and put some ketchup, mustard. I'm an American, folks, and I like my hot dogs. And my bologoney. I do don't do bologoney much, but I do something. Amen. Amen. I'm going to rejoice about something else. I told you a few weeks ago about these pains in my gut. Had me very concerned. Very concerned. What in the world? You're not supposed to have that. Won't go away. But here now, since I've told you, I've had a few spells here and there, but I'm here to tell you. Amen. When you're when you're going through that, it isn't just all the joys you have in faith. God, I believe you're my healer. But when it ain't there anymore and you're feeling good, you rejoice. Say, "Hallelujah. I'm thankful to feel good. Woo! I've arrived. It is not there anymore. It's not bothering me anymore." That's reason to rejoice. &gt;&gt; When you get in possession of it, when you arrive at the place that you're looking for. Amen. Sometimes the journey's a little rough, but when you get there, you can have a good time. Amen. People will go try to go to that perfect place, that perfect vacation spot. We're finally on the beach. I'm finally on this rest. I'm finally doing Oh, I'm finally got that place. You ought to be happy then, &gt;&gt; cuz that's what we're going to do when we get over there. All this rustle and pussle and all this here that we have to do with hand in hand, church, we're all going to go hand in hand. Evening light tabernacle. Paul will come up with his people every all those who come up. I wonder if our pastor won't come up with his group and we'll go in together. How's that sound? &gt;&gt; Hand in hand. Enjoy. &gt;&gt; The splendor of youth, &gt;&gt; heaven. And we're going to have a good time. Amen. I'm about to hurt myself. My lower back. I'm still mortal. I can't wait to be immortal. Well, I can wait. But people are always saying, "Man, I can't wait to get to heaven when they get a little sickness." Oh, man. I got to go to the doctor. I got to go take you scared to death. Well, I thought you was wanting to go to heaven. I'm sorry, but right now to go there, unless the rapture, you know where you which way you got to go. So, be careful. Amen. I want to go but at the appointed time. &gt;&gt; How does that sound? &gt;&gt; Isn't that truth though? &gt;&gt; We do that. People do it. I I know we all tend to do that. Oh, I just wish I could go home. I can't wait to go. Be careful what you say with your mouth. &gt;&gt; You say, "Sure, we want to go home." when the Lord gets ready. Okay, where we at? Praise the Lord. So, you can be just as happy with the quarter as you could with the loaf of bread. Just as happy. And how many believes that he said if you another type now last type and we'll let you go. Last types said if you went out in the ocean and you got a spoonful of water, put it in your mouth and swallowed it and it's just a little spoonful. Ain't that right? Every chemical of that ocean is in that spoonful. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many believe that when you get the Holy Ghost, when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, every chemical of heaven is in you. That's why we're gathered together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We've already been raptured up. We have the peace of God. We've got the joy of God. We've got joy unspeakable. We've got it now. Not have to wait till then. We can possess heaven now. &gt;&gt; We have arrived in possessing a portion of heaven. Now, we have not arrived in heaven yet. Amen. There's folks that thought, well, you went to Jeffersonville. They heard the millennium was there under a bridge somewhere. How confusing. Excuse me. Ain't that right? The millennium under a bridge. We're all looking for the millennium, but not under a bridge somewhere. How many believes we have to wait for those things that are not fulfilled yet, we got to wait for them. But for those things that we have attained to. How many's glad for the things that we have attained to? &gt;&gt; That joy that we have, that peace that we have, that forgiveness that we have. God help Evening Night Tabernacle. God help each and every one of you to walk with God the way that Enoch walked. &gt;&gt; Don't be children anymore. Don't be babies anymore. Walk with God daily. Fellowship with him all the time. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Having done all the sin, stand therefore, having your loyance ski about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Just that little word arrived. I thought arrived. Amen. How many believe we're in the promised land of the Holy Ghost? We have that portion of God on the inside. You already know that what it's going to feel like in heaven. Hello.
