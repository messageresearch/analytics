sister Louisa Hava is here tonight sister Louisa stand up so everybody knows who you are that's sister Louisa there God bless you uh she was our first tour guide in in Europe when we were there we went to her family's uh little island of tking Take a Little Ferry and go off the coast of Holland and had a little Lighthouse there and and she took us around and showed us the the city and uh you

each and everyone come up here brother Dennis God bless you to see you too just God bless you this evening it's always a joy to be in Fellowship around the good things of the Lord and just reading in my Bible um this evening as we were sitting there and David said has the Lord forgotten to be gracious and he said no never and uh I believe that that that he knows uh how to be gracious and it's a wonderful thing to know that he's a loving father and and our life is in His Hands So Good Times bad times it's nice to know that our father he's he he sees every detail of our life and so when those people came I'm sorry to maybe take an extra minute but you know when those people came in the prayer line the Lord knew every detail of their life and sometimes we just can't imagine how great God is but he is concerned and David one time thought that he wasn't interested in the details and it caused the Nathan the prophet said the sword's never going to leave your house you thought you could sweep something under the rug but you know the Lord cared and uh so it's just uh wonderful to be with you we had a couple our age in in our house last night and the sister said well we're getting old and we're getting um we're losing our credibility and and I said what what are you saying she said well well that you know they're going to everybody's going to start to think that we're old people and uh I don't feel that way I believe as long as I got breath you know there ain't no Rock going to take my place amen and I'm going to tell the younger ones uh you know what we've learned and it and this gospel is not changing so uh it's good to be in fellowship and uh I covet your prayers we're leaving Saturday for Bulgaria I'll probably be there Lord willing maybe a month and a half we just don't exactly know but we have some uh we did three messages Christmas three of brother bram's Christmas messages and we put them in a little Christmas box like little packet and uh the Nikolai did a beautiful job just kind of gave it a special uh Christmas paper and you know it's like it has a greeting on it in Bulgarian and and the Bulgarian word is Christmas is always white and it's so nice to go to these other churches you know there's not a established message church that that I'm aware of if I learn Bulgarian I might know a little bit more what's going on but we we're going to try to go and visit some uh just nominal churches and gypsy churches and bring those Christmas books so if you'd keep us in your prayers we're encouraging Lord we have a young man from um uh Jeffersonville Noah stutsman going with us and I I just felt like uh wasn't it Jonathan that said his to his armor Bearer he said let's go up and see what the Lord will do because you know it doesn't matter to the Lord if it's many or few and uh I appreciate this young man saying yeah let's let's go up let's go out there and see what God will do so God bless you brother Ron it's nice to be welcome here appreciate your friendship for all these years and uh God be with you all and Merry Christmas yeah well it is true we all are getting older uh and uh credibility I hope we're not losing that I know we're losing uh senility and other things sometimes uh your memory goes and different things but that's part of getting older and uh I'm glad I got a wife that reminds me whenever I forget things and and uh but I've noticed lately that she's getting a little forgetful too so two halves make one so God knows just exactly what he's doing amen let's all stand together brother Warren arizola's come just back from a few places here we've asked him to minister to us tonight he's got a few testimonies he wants to share with you let's sing that song only believe I always love that song it means so much because you remember the time when you first heard what did it do to your heart and little would I know that it would be lifechanging life altering changing the course of my life and here all these years later I still believe because I heard the voice of one that was sent this day to turn our hearts back oh be yes only be all things are possible only [Music] believe only be all things are possible now let's there's brother Warren come up here my brother God bless [Music] you Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I [Music] believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things [Music] are how many believe that he's here tonight Jesus is [Music] here Jesus is here all are [Music] possible [Music] Jesus Jesus is here he knows where you at right now all all things are possible Jesus is here amen God bless you all you may be seated I just got back yesterday on this morning my plight was delayed in h Dallas so I got back at 12 midnight and I will share a testimony before I preach remember brother W prayed for me here last uh two weeks ago or 3 weeks ago he said I pray that he comes back with with great report great um and and uh wi Souls amen and so I will share the testimony amen amen I wrote it in the paper so that my English will be good to tell amen amen I preach to the Church of brother Stan price in uh p Cola Florida and then I visited the church in Georgia and then I got uh there in Matamoros Mexico um about uh December 1st so I was preaching on December 7th and after I preached there was three people accepted the Lord but it was very cold in Mexico that they hold on the baptism so uh I will read my testimony this is for the glory of God it just happened that I was there amen they said Brother Juan greetings to you uh brother all the Believers Pastor BTO from Matamoros Mexico brother Stan and brother Dale um later the uh this one is the uh the assistant pastor uh this was uh Sunday morning December 8th the assistant pastor asked me while I was inside the church to get outside because the sister needs help she explained that the doctor recommended abort aborting her baby due to S uh severe bleeding that had started the day before she didn't want uh to go through with it and ask for prayer before heing to the emergency room believe God could h i I asked her if you believe God I think it's it seems like it's better to tell okay I asked her if you believe God and she said yes so I said I will pray for you and I prayed and I asked her after I prayed do you still believe God and she said yes she went to the emergency room and the doctor told her that her baby is okay amen not only that she came back to the church she was so excited and she was in the kitchen in helping the sisters to cook food to the Believers amen it's about a lot a lot of Believers you know the the so many uh things to to do to help and she was there helping the sisters now um the second one uh this one was last uh last year I was there that evening that dinner uh Fellowship I was speaking to the Believers then the family approached me with an interpreter they wanted to share what had happened after last year meeting when I preached about the sword of the Lord in the hands of the Believers during that sermon I came down from the pulpit and though I could REM remember his face I handed the sword to a young man according to his grandmother from that moment he be became a different person his parents were an addicts who had been in trouble with drug dealers their home was filled with conflict but that young man persistently urging them to stop fighting and turn to God his parents were backsliders but he didn't give up he keep encouraging them to return the Lord eventually thee uh the pressure lead them back to the fellowship one day while traveling to Mexico this young man traveled to Mexico because the parents wants to move somewhere because they were in trouble with the drug dealers so his parents uh his dad and his brother were traveling to Monteray and there was a car accident and this young man died on that car accident so when he died I told the family I prayed for them I said someone must to die he gave his life and his family with returned to church and now Faithfully serves the Lord and after praying together I went to another fellowship because it's so many people so I went to another another fellowship another groups of Believers and they were you know I was sharing the testimony that is Christianity is not about quoting the Bible Christianity is not only reciting the message the message must live in Us in you and then I was uh I I told them that you need to know the author of The Bible without that experience we're M merely parting the message we need to know who we are or there will be no power in us I shared the story about brother Brenham going to an auction with a Rancher friend there was a Skinny Cow that sold for 11,000 while a big healthy looking good cow sold for $300 C curiously brother brandham asked with the Skinny Cow uh sold for much more his friend explained that in the cattle business external appearances don't up always determine the value it's about the C house breeding and lineage the lesson was that as Christians if we lack of a genuine experience with God trials will reveal our lack of uh the trials will reveal and our lack of foundation and we may fall away that's why you see many Christians falling away because of lack of experience while I was sharing there was a commotion and people started screaming called brother Warren I went to a family holding a baby the baby was pale white and the parents explained that the baby had fallen earlier but seems spine and that time however when they put the baby to sleep the child child had a scissure seizure and his uh the eyes was turning big according to the parents the parents handed the baby to me when I touched the baby's head I feel that it seems like a crack in the skull and I told to the father that the baby has had the damage skull the baby was one years old he's uh uh Oney old so I assume with a CPR on first aid because I am certified CPR uh I I renew my CPR on first aid every two years so because of my training I was ready to resuscitate the baby but God is more powerful amen I feel that the power of God take over instead of relying on my training I started praying and holding the baby tightly the baby felt unusually heavy like a dead weight if you hold a dead people before that's why you carry a dead person you carry uh the nurses can can can uh knows that dead weight so I was holding the baby a one-year-old baby on my hip because of of the Dead weight the baby wasn't breathing and uh so I prayed and I cried out to the Lord I screamed like Lord we are in a state of emergency right now and then and that I thank him for his sacrifice on the cross the pastor brother bito Garcia was with me and then the the the brothers the ministers uh they uh placed her their hands on the head of the baby while other ministers including brother Bena one of the assistant Minister was holding the feet and the the other minister brother um elaser was behind me about the brother said it's about five minutes that the baby wasn't breathing and to me I I think it's longer than that because I prayed we prayed and then we stopped and then I started praying again then I felt the jerk of the baby so I lift the baby up on my chest the baby is not heavy anymore and all of the sudden he breathed and cried out with a loud voice and she and the baby opened his eyes I've been to many experience I shared you one time about the demon possessed I shared one time about the women that I overdosed her I so many testimonies but this is the first time that the dead baby rose from the dead tell me about Christ the message of the hour is alive because it's Jesus Christ amen the brother said they're watching uh right now in our services in our uh service to the Believers that watch out that's the baby after 20 minutes the baby he was normal he was playing that's the parents of the baby I had a video but because of the time I will uh just show the two uh pictures I will start preaching now brother Dennis thank you I will include you in my prayers amen let's open our Bible let's stand up Esther chapter 4 verse 4 oh the verse 13 I think up [Music] to 16 Esther chapter 4 14-6 then morai commanded to and uh to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace of this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews Lo from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who know it whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then Esther B them return Mori the uh this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in suan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will first likewise and so will go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish God bless you let's bow our heads father before I come here brother steepen step prayed already that he said Lord we are not preaching to a closed book we're preaching to this open book and you're the only one Lord that give this Revelation to us anoint my lips this voice Lord God must be clear to the people Lord give me a give me strength Lord God to share your word that this is the message in the last days that if I perish I perish Lord Jesus bless your people tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated you know we're talking about the third pool and you can quote the cat you can express about the third pool but if you don't experience this there will be no power the third pole is a powerful message the prophet said this third pool cannot be imitated no one can mimic this third pool you know brother brandham was uh uh telling the congregation how he loves his wife he said he said I really love her that I really want her to come inside of me that is the third pull that God wants us to be with him Amen to be inside of him remember about the house that he's explaining to us he said he can invite the V the visitors to his living room to the kitchen but only the husband and wife can go inside the bedroom and only the husband and wife can talk about their relationship how can express their love to each other brothers and sisters I may not tell you what's happening inside that living room or or in the bedroom because it's personal amen that is the third third pool means it's between you and God and if God will use these lips Brothers no one can separate me the dead will rise the sickness I don't care what kind of sickness we have or your experience or what kind of trouble you have because we have the greater God we have the big God and that's why I'm so thankful that the the church send me wherever I go I always tell to the people that you send me but without the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters we're just parting the message remember G Galatians chapter 2:20 look about yourself maybe if I go wake up in the morning and I will go to the to the bathroom and look at my face on the mirror maybe I see not a goodlook man maybe I will wish that I will have a hair one day but remember this brothers and sisters this face this hands and this body is God's Property amen your face your flesh is God property galatian 2:20 uh do you have a brother galatian 2:20 meditate that word that scripture I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not who who takes care of this body now what is this body now it's Jesus Christ live it in me don't be ashamed when God created you God created you fearfully and wonderfully made you are the image of God you are the Believers that Adam longing for that wants to go back but he did not get back but right now to us brothers and sisters we are right now in the Garden of Eden we are right now Eternal in him if God is in you brother I don't have a beginning we don't have a beginning if God is in US think about that scripture and the life which I now live in flesh I live by the faith the faith according to the prophet the kingdom of God is in you the Holy Ghost the faith of the Son of God that loved me and gave himself for me that's how we live amen that's why there's no death to you brothers and sisters there's no death to the Christians you know I was I didn't tell you this I come always sit over there showing my face all the time smiley brother Warren but you never know brothers and sisters my trials I have a big burden in my heart and I question my Ministry maybe maybe I will stop but you know why my my myself I'm I'm fighting of myself how about if I tell this to the brothers oh now I'm a ashamed of myself no way but in my heart I have a big burden I'm suffering we're just like us the difference is the ministry we have troubles and testings I have trials with my kids I want my kids to I always tell to my kids how about if I will not I will not go to chur Church how about your mom and dad will stop going to church are you going except the Holy Ghost will come to you amen and this is the Fulfillment of the ministry there's no death in Christ amen amen in the third pool how many the the the scripture said in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 5-7 500 people saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ but how many went to the upper room brother Dennis 500 people saw the the resurrection of Jesus Christ if I saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ I will go wherever you wants me to go brother but why it's only 120 in the upper room why there's only 120 had the pillar lick of lick of fires in their in them that's a big question you know why not too many people will see this third pool but you always pray Lord I will be the part of this body I want to be that third pool that brother Warren is teaching that brother Ron always say am this church Brothers I've been to so many churches I can say this church has more Revelation than any others I can say this church is like the efficient Church of this age you know why because I can talk to the people I can discern the spirit but don't I always say this wherever I go do not know like the prophet said you you you've been to the church so many years and the church become common to you I pray that this church is not common to us amen I will start preaching now you know Esther I titled the message if I die I die the context is desperation I preached this on December 7th over there in Matamoros and I saw the power of God desperation said the the feeling that you have when you're in such in a bad situation that you are willing to take the risk in order to ch change it you are willing to take the RIS in order to change the situation and then here was Esther Esther and morai when he heard in Esther chapter 3:13 the Bible said and the letters were sent by the post into all the kings and provinces through neon he hat hated the the the the Jews he hated uh morai so he sent he gave money to the king and the King gave him the ring and he ordered that on March uh 13 all the Jews will be exterminated so here it said of uh the to cause to destroy all all the Jews and to uh kill them to cause them to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women and in that uh in one day even upon the 13th day of the 12 month which is the month Adar and to take the spoil of them to pray and here was morai when he heard the news do you think about this the Second World War this one was different this one will the the king ordered men and women to be destroyed in one day but here was Esther morai was was was uh uh CH how did he uh what did he do he was crying in the midst of the the uh the city and the new went to Esther and and the news said uh Mori your cousin he was crying asking to there was there are here's the help uh forgive me if I jump sometimes but here was morai according to the scholars This Book of Esther is not supposed to be in the Bible you know why because there's no God mention about this this story of of Esther but how can you how can you um fast if there's no prayer right so you read between the line because this message is for the bride and the bridegroom the story of the bride and the the bridegroom when the Malachi chapter 4 came God the the prophet took this this message and and give an an Enlightenment to the bride that this was like talking to my bridegroom and here was you know why what happened why there was a a bad bad blood with nonon and morai can you remember about the story of Samuel and Saul saved the agagite the king the agagite remember that story and then Samuel said uh uh uh the the I think um there was a um obedience is better than sacrifice so now here was Samuel because he saved the King the agagite and and Saul was a benjamite and here Saul or Samuel pulled his sword and hacked the agagite king in pieces and I think this agagite neon remember that story how he had a h an anger to this man morai but but my focus is not morai and Damon my focus tonight is Esther how she pray how she how she went to the to the king and how she fast but then when she was fasting after the fasting it takes an action and here was the action of of of of eser according to the law you cannot enter to the Chamber of the king without the the the the the how do you call it the the request of the king but here was Esther you know why she said for 30 days the king never called me to to come to his chamber well maybe the king have 500 wives and it's not her turn but she said if I die I die I'm thinking about my people this is for my people and according to the scripture she put her royal robe and what is the Royal robe we put on the word of God Amen and when the king saw that she was so beautiful and the King if he will lift up his sep she will come but if the king will not lift up the scepter she will die right there but because of the beauty of Esther she won the heart of the king and the King said you are so beautiful Esther what is your request and even the H of my kingdom is yours and she came and explained about the invitation of Ammon and the king for a dinner and to make the story short because I will jump you know what happened hmon was hang and the Jews were saved and all the people that supposed to kill the Jews morai killed them all 7,500 Jews or or or uh the the people of was killed that time and then children of neon were hanged because of the perseverance because of the desperation of Esther that she said if I die I die at least I made I I I made my way amen how about I I I took some characters here in the Bible the prophet said here we have played long enough can you can you say yes we played long enough you know we went to church long enough how many years you've been hearing this message we went to a church long enough but he said we got to do something this is not the time of playing church anymore brothers and sisters the prophet said until you get to that place until the whole church get to that place that it's between death or life or and life you got to have it now or perish then God will move on the sin it takes a desperation to bring God on the sin we played long enough my friends it takes a state of emergency if someone needs help you raise your hand brother I will pray for you sister Maggie had a testimony one time about the the situation it's between life or death between life and death situation but she have a husband that has powerful faith that was the big mistakes of Satan that day when Maggie went to the hospital and the doctor said your cancer is so fast the cancer is eating you you need to go to the operating room but her husband said I'm not welcoming that cancer in my house right now don't mention that name name that name is not welcome in this house go to the closet my closet my love and while the sister Maggie was praying giving heart her her heart to the Lord and all all of the sudden sister Maggie you were in desperation that time that day why you change your prayers why it change to a different person instead of you're praying to yourself you know why because that's the body supposed to be we don't pray to ourselves instead she was praying to Sister Rebecca and it fulfilled her prayers because not only sister Rebecca came back to church but she was healed by God the Bible said I will teach you how to pray he said our father why he said our you're supposed to I'll teach you just my father but why God choose our father give us why us this day Our Daily Bread why it's plural because God wants you to pray to each one of us God was that's living for others you want Power live for others it takes a desperation I was remember this this woman that that carrying a baby she was in the Mexico meeting and this baby was so desperate because her baby died at around 7:00 in the morning and it was a night meeting and the the the the deacons was P pulling pulling her brother holding her don't go it's it's the the the prophet is preaching she doesn't care brother she wants an answer right now for my baby well it's not uh in order but that's her brother her heart her love you know the the prophet said how can you desperate to a person if you don't love her it takes love to desperate am but but she doesn't care she pushed the Deacon she pushed the Asher and she went straight to the pulpit because of her prayers God showed the vision to the prophet that the baby was smiling on her chest and the prophet said bring that baby here God answered the prayers of that desperate woman there was a woman one day the prophet said forgive me but this is the prophet said she was an illiterate colored woman maybe she doesn't know about science but she believe that the shunamite woman needs Elijah and she was praying that night brother she was praying that night that Elijah will come because she said I gave God gave this boy to me but the boy went to a wrong crowd and the boy had a women's disease but brother this woman she said over in my dead body Satan you cannot take this baby this is my baby this this brother Paul this baby is a 300b man but she said this is my baby and she prayed and she prayed and she prayed because of the desperation the 737 stop brothers and sisters do you want to stop the storm do you want to stop the airplane be desperate God wants us to be desperate well brother Warren that's like that's that's like a Pentecostal message no brothers and sisters after the prophet preached the token he preached this desperate desperation because he said the church need to be desperate amen you want to go to the Rapture be desperate something wrongs with the airplane the airplane went went back to Memphis and you know what happened to to the prophet he went to the store and looking for a a goodies for the kids but there was a voice go walk go walk lead by the spirit brother go walk where do you want me to go Lord where do you want me to go just go walk be lead by the spirit spirit and then while he was walking in front of her brother in front of him there was a colored woman said good morning Parson my accent is different but good morning person said why how do you know me I'm a person because I I prayed for you last night see that Fai why she knows that brother is a pastor because of her prayer because of my prayer once you prayed you expect don't doubt your prayers sometimes the doubt are the best enemy that can destroy our faith and then when the prophet said he said um I've been to a King's house I've been to a noble people but this small house one kitchen and one bedroom and one living room or one bedroom and the according to the prophet the boy was groaning according to the mother he's like in the midst of the ocean and he said always and he always say oh it's dark in here mama it's dark in here mama and the prophet said this house is the house of a woman that knows how to pray so she he he asked the woman uh uh uh the woman asked brother Brenham to pray but brother Brenham said you pray and brother according to the prophet that woman can pray that woman can pray it's I it's better she pray really good because it's between life and death situation but like Esther if I die I die I don't care anymore I'm I'm I'm I I I'm saving my whole family I'm saving my whole all the Jews how about shamgar you know what happened I I will continue this when the prophet prayed he said there's a light in here coming mama there's a light in here coming mama you know why because of the atmosphere of that woman and not only God healed that woman that man but after three months brother Brenham saw that boy not only healed but saved that's the faith of Abraham I don't care about this flesh I care about my soul but the soul will manifest outside because that's our it's our children the prophet said that's children's bread healing is God's children's bread now here is is the shamgar shamgar was always you you know that sometimes brother brother Bryant you know we we we talk about last time about the situation but s Satan that's what he wants us to do he wants us to to to be weak and to question about our healing to question about God if he's real or not but brother our faith is unmovable you can destroy this body brother Neil I will question I will question you when you were in the hospital is it job 13 was real to you destroy this body and in my flesh I will see God it must be the scripture we be real to us because it life and death situation brother Neil but if you if I die I die at least I fight the battle shamgar was always every every year the enemy comes to him and while he was he was uh ready to to to uh Harvest his grapes the enem is already coming and until he saw his family weak and skinny but it takes the desperation one year he recognized his position as the Son of God as the son of Abraham and then he started get angry he started get angry and he took the stick because he's so angry to the 300 demons Brothers he destroyed all the 300 demons because of the faith he recognized his position as the son of Abraham we need to recognize our position as a son and daughters of Abraham here was Peter Peter one day he said let me walk Lord let me walk and Jesus said walk his faith was so strong that he really wants to walk but here was Peter when he was walking he saw troubles coming and he sunk what did Peter say ah well my faith is too weak I will let this body drowned in the sea no brother you fight he said look Lord help me he cried cried with a loud voice Lord help me and God is always on time he took his he he reached out with his hand Brothers don't always think that God is late he knows the situation think about sadrach mishak and Abednego do you think God was late that day when they said put me in the oven God will save us how about was God was like I'll take a nap like right now maybe later I will wake up I'll I'll watch the situation brother the three Hebrew CH children when they went inside God is already there he's not too long late for your question for your for the answer he always come on time in time of Deeds call me in the days of your trouble and I will answer Thee I am the untime god The Great I Am God that present tense help in time of trouble amen how about Daniel how about Daniel maybe he was when when when the the enemy of Daniel put him inside the Cave the hole the hungry lion was waiting but when he was he went there God was already there he wasn't late brother to your question he wasn't late for your troubles but we need to be desperate and the lion was laying already instead of roaring like the lion sound you know why because the pillar of fire was in the midst of that cave and Daniel what he did he enjoyed the promise of God thank you Lord and he used the belly of the lion better than my pillow brother Dennis better than my pillow because God is always on time in his promise how about here's God Jesus Christ in Luke Chapter 189 uh 9 or 1 up to 9 he gave a comparison he said there was a city there was in a city a judge which fearth not God neither regarded man this God is an unbeliever worse than unbeliever and there was a widow in the city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and there was a uh and and and he would not for a while but afterward he said with in himself though I fear not God nor regarded man yet because of this Widow trouble at me I will re avenge her L by her continually coming she wey me put that unbelieving judge to a person think about yourself as a widow this this woman you know if sometimes if we ask for prayers and if it's not answered we stop I pray that this Widow the story of the Widow will be us that even the judge close his door but the Widow did not stop she always come to the front door and always knock avenge me for my adversary every day every night avenge me for my adversary and this man that has his heart is like a Heart of Stone change the atmosphere and help the woman because it wearth him how much more our heavenly father here's the heavenly father Matthew 7:7 it said here the bad JS and the good God ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall opened unto you for everyone that ask it receive it and he that seeketh find it and to him that knock it it shall be opened this Widow was K knocking day and night but this one knock and I will open or what man is there of you whom is this is his son ask bread well he gave him a stone or if he asked fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children this is the challenge how much more shall Our Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him the bad judge was opening his door because he cannot stop it's annoying to his ear but the good father before you knock he opened the door not only that he opened his arms come my child what do you need I will give it to you are you desperate enough the prophet said here remember desperation see what desperation will do desperation will drive you across the sea why you're going to the Gypsy brother Dennis because desperation brings you across the sea to see one Soul save this message to see a soul that worth 10,000 worlds you know what happened one time there was a man in New York he didn't know the value of his jar he he he he cleaned his room and he put it outside as a gar in the garage sale this man saw the jar and he bought it for $2 that jar was the oldest jar of the emperor of China the man sold it for two plus million dollar in the auction because he did not the owner did not know the value of the jar but the person knows the value of the money that's why you're going over there that's why we're winning why we're going somewhere to win souls because we see the value of the souls so here he said desperation will drive you across the sea desperation will drive you from another state desperation will drive you anywhere there was a story of this woman of this girl and Gypsy Smith and when when they went back in the back of the building to go out that night there was a poor little ragged girl standing there she was all her clothes was all tore off of her and she had something she said she wanted to see Mr Smith so Gypsy Smith said what do you want darling said Mr Smith I didn't have any money to give you but said about a month ago it was at Christmas and somebody gave me a lollipop I love you uh so much Mr Smith said my daddy got saved he's not drunk card anymore said I thought I bring this I bring you this lowly pop Mr Smith took it in his hand tears rolling down his cheeks patted her on her hand and said honey in my offering to tonight lays as much as thousands of dollars in checks but this is the greatest gift that I got of all of it what's in your hand right now that hand can touch God if God can use the stick to kill 300 Philistines what is your what's in your hand Gypsy smth has thousands of dollars in his bank but he wasn't happy he was a powerful preacher troubled the world but he cried out because God used that girl to touch his heart because of that lollipop amen there was a woman one day this woman was suffering for 12 years of blood issue the prophet said she went to many doctors to find the best Specialist of that cancer that woman woman because of 12 Years of coming back and forth to the doctor she lost all of her wealth and moved to the banks of the river she doesn't have any more strength one month of blood lost in your in your body you will be weak how much more for 12 years think about the story not only that my brothers and sisters she doesn't have money anymore she is empty that's the time God will call you that's the time God will say now you're empty who will you call now and that's the start when she heard there's so many voices that that day oh Jesus the deceiver Jesus the Healer but because of Faith she choose Jesus the Healer 12 years my brothers and sisters how can you press to the crowd for 12 years of loose of of blood but she doesn't care about the the pushing and push the people for maybe thousands and 5 thousands of people were there but she she press she press because of her faith that if I touch the Hy of His Garment I will be healed she was so desperate that day she pressed maybe she was crawling maybe she did everything that she got this is the last maybe of my life if I die I die today at at least I did my best to touch the hym of the Garment of the Lord but when she was maybe close enough close enough brother brother uh Briant she maybe stretch a little bit her hand and then the power of that garment touched the master and the master said who touched me and Peter rebuked the Lord so many people keep touching you and now you but virtue came out of me do you want to touch God do you want the virtue to come out of God touch him with desperation if I die Lord today I will die at least I give my best not only that can you please brother Leviticus uh chapter Leviticus chapter 15 it's 9:00 I will close with this uh service uh with this uh scripture Leviticus 15:19 and if a woman have an issue and her issue in her flesh Be Blood 15 19 up to 20 uh 30 but I will skip some uh verses she put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until even so if the woman has period and she will sit to this to this chair and you will sit to that chair you will be unclean and you need to wash yourself and you will be clean until even now and everything that she lay layth upon in her separation shall be unclean everything also that she Seth upon shall be unclean and if a woman uh 25 and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation or if it turned beyond the time or her separation all the days of her issue of her uncleanliness or uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation shall be unclean 29 and on that Eighth Day shall take unto her two turtle dobs or two young pigeons and bring them into the priest to the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall offer that one of uh one offer the one to offer for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and the priest shall take an atonement for her before the Lord of that issue of her uncleanliness not only she was suffering for 12 years but she was separated to the people this woman was a Christian this woman believed the five books of Moses but she cannot go to church for 12 years because she is unclean now that's why she end up on the banks of the river by herself maybe she has children maybe she has husband but maybe the husband and the children left her because of her situation that's why she was desperate that's why she was ready to press the battle f 5, thousands of people she pressed in to touch God and not only he touched she touched God but she saw the offering she saw the the the the atonement of sacrifice Jesus Christ thy faith made you whole whole because of our perseverance because of her desperate uh Faith this is closing do you want salvation
