Brother Neil, it's okay to read your testimony this morning. [music] Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. Brother Neil left a a note on the update on the desk this morning. Brother Neil says, "Test results update. I'd like to give praise, honor, and glory to our Lord Jesus. He never ceases to show his mighty hand through these tr troublesome trials and times that we've had in our lives. Every time I go to the doctor, whether it's for a followup or a test, his miracles shine so bright that the doctors have to say, "This man is a miracle." And we believe that this morning. [snorts] Amen. &gt;&gt; The update on his aorta image review. After the vascular doctor read his results, showed the images of the aorta, he asked brother Neil, "When did you have another aortic dissection?" Much to sister Karen and my surprise, we looked at the doctor and said, "What other dissection?" He should proceeded to show us a picture another dissection in the lower region of the aorta. This second dissection will be closely reviewed also and updates are forthcoming. The vascular doctor's attention is on the type A dert section uh at hand showing currently showing a 5.2 2 cm in dilation and I have two options of [snorts] surgery. Uh two options for surgery were post proposed. Uh option one open heart open chest repair the valves uh open the chest repair the valves to direct flow back to the true luminum correct path for the aorta. Option B would be will consist of three surgeries but can leave him paralyzed or with other serious outcomes. After discussing this [music] with sister Karen, they have chosen option A. [snorts] The test results will now have to be handed over to a team of cardia cardio surgeons to determine the complexity and how to perform the needed repairs. Waiting for the completion of the review. Two procedures that need my immediate attention. Carterid artery ultrasound to help find out why his right arm is going completely numb. This will happen on December the 5th. Second procedure is an angiogram to repair blood flow to the one kidney that is only half working and that'll be a week later on December the 12th. I want to thank you, brother Ron, all the brothers and sisters in Christ, all your prayers, your support through this. The Lord will always be in control and I rest in that with all of my heart and my aort. So we thank the Lord for having his hand upon you, brother Neil. He still moves &gt;&gt; in the hearts of his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our other needs today. [music] Sister Melody Weeden says, "I want to thank the Lord for uh finding my my brother's long lost baby uh he picked up for adoption uh in the 70s and I've been praying o over the [crying] years for her to be reunited with the family and through DNA test that she was she was found to be tied to her dad." [crying] So, we thank the Lord for answering this long prayer that Sister Melody has had. Sister Hannah Yarro says, "I'm requesting prayer for my grandmother Navaro." Grandmother Navaro has a dental procedure last week. She had one and she's experiencing quite a bit of anxiety and the slow healing process and she's asking prayer for everything to be healed. So, let's remember Hannah's grandmother today. Brother Rod Brander says, "Please remember a friend of mine. His name is Larry Overby. Larry [music] has a special unspoken need in his life. So let's remember this need for Larry overly. Sister Ramona Aldco says, "Please pray for my daughter Vanessa." Vanessa goes Monday for a biopsy on her right breast and her left lymph nodes under her arm. Then Wednesday and MRI on her chest.

Thank you Jesus for this day of [singing] victory. Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. I wanted to do a a little testimony before I sing. Sometimes as we walk through this life being a Christian, we think we're doing pretty good. you know, we're we're praying, we're reading, we're listening to the message, &gt;&gt; and you know, we think our lives are pretty well set in the Lord, and we're walking the best we can. That's what I was doing. [snorts] And one day I God showed me some He showed me something in my life that I didn't see. And I truly did not see it. It embarrassed me. It shocked me. It made me ashamed. I don't know if anybody's gone through that. But it's not a it's a hard thing. It's hard thing to but it's a it's a merciful thing too that God would show you &gt;&gt; and and that's the way I take it. It was a mercy that God would even show me that in this life &gt;&gt; because when you think you're doing so good &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden you see something &gt;&gt; it's not good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And through this, you know, the person that it was hurting, I had to repent to them first before I could repent to God. &gt;&gt; And you know, this this has been happening for a long time. And you know, and this past week, things have been happening. And I got to a point where I felt like I was being crushed. And then I felt like the crushing became grinding. And that's the song I'm going to sing. See, when God unfolds the rosie, I know I just sung this one a few weeks back, &gt;&gt; but every time God when God was showing me this, that song keep coming. And the words in this song became so real &gt;&gt; because that's what I felt &gt;&gt; everything. &gt;&gt; And before all this happened, I read an article. This pastor had asked this old farmer to pray over the food. And this farmer starts out. He says, "Lord, I really hate buttermilk." You know, and he pauses a bit. He goes on said, "Lord, and I sure don't like lard, you know, and he pauses and the pastor kind of, you know, Opus and I starts looking up and kind of where this is going to head." And then he goes on and says, [music] "And Lord, I don't much care for raw flour either. and he pauses and all a sudden he says, "But Lord, when you mix all those ingredients together, it sure makes a good biscuit." &gt;&gt; You know, and sometimes we go through these trials in life &gt;&gt; and we get tunnel vision. &gt;&gt; We look at this one certain trial and we hate it. We don't know why we're going through it. &gt;&gt; And we go through another trial. We don't know what we're doing. How are we going to go through it? &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden &gt;&gt; if we just hold on and wait, God mixes those ingredients together. He sends us through the oven &gt;&gt; and look what he makes. &gt;&gt; He makes the child of God. He makes the son of God. He makes the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what we are. &gt;&gt; So just wait. Wait and see what he makes. [singing] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; There have been trials. There have been times when I thought my prayers didn't even reach the ceiling of the room. where I now to pray. And a voice inside [music] kept asking me, "Did you think God was really listening to anything that I had to say? I kept on [singing] praying, holding on my faith, knowing God, he's always in control. And I waited like a rose. But in the garden, for only [singing] God can unfold the rose. When God unfolds the rose, [singing] he always gets it right. When the pedals are in place, oh, it's such a beautiful [singing] sight. God knows when to hold on [singing] and the perfect time to let go. So let him have his way and watch God unfold the rose. There are trials and tribulations we must all go through. When it comes to heartaches, we've all had our share. When times are the hardest, we need to hold on to the promise. He said he'd never give us more than we [singing] could bear. So I'll keep on to praying, holding on by faith, knowing God is working all things for my good. And I'll wait just like a rose bud in the garden. Only God can unfold the rose. When God unfolds the rose, [singing] he always gets it right. When the petals are in place. Oh, it's such a beautiful sight. He know [music and singing] Hold on. And the perfect time to let go. So let him have his way [singing] and watch God unfold the ro. God knows when to hold on [singing] and the perfect time to let go. So let him have his [singing] way. and watch God unfold the role. [applause and music] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. Can you say amen? Amen. Let's stand this morning as we change the order of the service. Brother Mario comes and ministers today. Sure appreciate brother Mario and his gift in his life and being sensitive to the Holy Spirit. May the Lord just visit each and every one of us today in a supernatural way. Be unto your name. Be unto your name. Be unto the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of our praise, &gt;&gt; worthy of our adoration. All glory and honor be unto him this morning. Amen. And let's sing this this morning as we get ready to change the order of the service. Amen. Amen. Let's sing it sing it to him this morning. And we are a woman and you [music] are [singing] forever. Born of the angels, God [music] before time, are [singing] a maker. [music] And you are eternal everlasting and [music] reigning on high. [singing] Holy, holy, [music] [singing] Lord God Almighty, worthy is the [music and singing] lamb who was slain. I [music] praise and glory [music] to your name. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; of your name. Second verse says, "And we are [music] the broken and you are the giver. Jesus redeemer, you are my [music and singing] king to sing. You are the love song we'll sing [music] forever. bow me before you and blessed is your name [music] everyone. [singing] [music] I bless you this morning. He is [singing] the [music] lamb who was slain. the highest [singing] praise and honor and glory to your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless everyone. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like what uh King David said, they were so glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We had so many things to thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only we receive his messenger in these last days, &gt;&gt; but we heard his voice in these last days. &gt;&gt; Because in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, we will begin to sound the mystery of God revealed. So it was not the voice of the prophet but it was the voice of God speaking to each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; So we need to to rejoice &gt;&gt; because in this age alone God came down and revealed himself to each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; So it is an individual revelation of himself to each and every one of us. It's not by group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the scripture said when the son of man came shall he find faith. Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't come to find a church member. &gt;&gt; He didn't find to come a good work &gt;&gt; or good affiliations or whatever status in your you're in life. &gt;&gt; But when the son come shall he find faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we need revelations above things because revelations alone can distinguish us from the right and wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are walking in a thin line but it takes the revelations of God because upon this rock he will build my church upon the revelation of his. So thank you musician. Thank you for our song special. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we are now uh in the presence of the Lord and &gt;&gt; we have only one desire this morning &gt;&gt; and that is to worship God in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the most privileged people in these last days. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because not many people can receive what you receive. &gt;&gt; It's only by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, praise God, to be a Christian is not our desire, but it was God's desire for us to be a Christian &gt;&gt; because he said no one can come to him except the father draw him near. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we don't come here by our own desire, but it was God's desire for for us to be here. Amen. He wants to speak to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to speak to him also. Amen. This morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the purpose of why we are here. Praise God. That is to worship him in spirit and in truth. So, we need to be excited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're excited, I will be excited. &gt;&gt; So, I need your help. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this is a two-way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are not here just to listen to a preacher, but we are here to encourage the preacher. &gt;&gt; Because I cannot preach without your encouragement. &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't look at me as if you you have a blank in your mind. Look at me and say go brother. &gt;&gt; We need you brother. &gt;&gt; We need you. So we need to encourage one another. As always says a preacher is just like a waiter. &gt;&gt; That I cannot serve unless you order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God is here, we need to order. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God knows every needs. Amen. What was in your mind, what is in our heart, God knows our needs. So we need to pull. Amen. &gt;&gt; Upon the presence of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said that he if you need anything, you need to ask. &gt;&gt; So why don't you ask because you don't believe. &gt;&gt; So if you believe that he is here, whatever things you ask, he will he will you will receive it. Then we will come into his &gt;&gt; in his presence this morning. Let us bow our head. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful, Lord, this morning for your presence. We just feel your presence this morning Lord and we are we just humble ourselves Lord that by your grace hallelujah we stand before you this morning Lord God with one purpose and that is to glorify your name Lord we just want to thank you for the revelations that you given us Lord Amen we don't come here to be saved Lord because as the messages of Leah hour said Lord we were saved even before the foundation of the word but we thank you for the revelation that you put in our heart that we realize realize that we are already part of you even before the foundation of the word Lord. &gt;&gt; So uh help us Lord to to walk according Hallelujah to the revelation that you've given us Lord. Hallelujah. So this morning we humble ourselves Lord and commit our our life to you. May you just bless and sanctify each and every one of us Lord that your name once again be glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. Hallelujah. So let's uh turn our Bible to the book of Isaiah chapter 54 &gt;&gt; verse 7-10. So we'll just also remember our pastor brother Ron brother Neil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that God is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you just need to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 54:7. So Isaiah is the mouthpiece of God. Emmanuel always believe that uh the prophet always represent God to the people. So he said that for a small moment I have forsaken thee but with great mercy I will gather thee. So God say he forsook his people for a moment &gt;&gt; but he will now gather them back with great compassion. &gt;&gt; So we'll notice the nature of God in the contrast of small in judgment but great in mercies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So in a little wrap I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee said the Lord. thy redeemer. &gt;&gt; For this is as the waters of Noah unto me. For as I have sworn that the water of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I would not be wrought with thee, nor rebuke thee. So, so Isaiah is mentioning about Noah. Amen. He will no longer judge the people by the flood. So that covenant that God made with Noah is an everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the mountain shall depart and the hills be removed. So this is showing a word of torm and cataclysmic judgment. Noah's word came to cataclysmic judgment and this word is also heading towards another Catholic judgment. And we are convinced about that. Amen. So there must be a people on earth now that God has established a covenant with as he had done with Noah and his group. For the mountain shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee. Neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, said the Lord that hath mercy on thee. &gt;&gt; And may the Lord add a blessing upon the reading of his word. You may now be seated. So I will take this title from this verse. But my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, said the Lord that have mercy on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is showing us by the scripture that as a believer of his word that he has sent in this hour by messenger that he has placed upon our lives a covenant of peace as he did with Noah and the people of his group that were under his message. The covenant of peace and this covenant of peace an everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. So people try to draw peace from different places. They're trying to find peace. Sometimes they they try to run away from the city life, go to the mountain to have peace or sometimes in medications or sometimes in in music. They want to find peace. Maybe some uh some retreat or somewhere an I an island or maybe somewhere they trying to find peace and some try to find through drugs and through some entertainment through groups but you cannot find peace. &gt;&gt; We can only find peace through the promises of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing this word cannot give us peace &gt;&gt; except the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So as sons and daughters of God, we have all had our rebukes and chastisements in life. &gt;&gt; When we are being born again, we are already sons and daughters of God. So we struggle in this life. We have true ups and downs and sometimes we have chastisement and sometimes we have rebukes &gt;&gt; and all of that. All of us can experience that because as uh Hebrew 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth he chastenth and scourge every son whom he received. &gt;&gt; So if you are sons and daughters of God praise expect chastisement expect some rebuke. Amen. Because it is the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not to put us down but is to rebuke us to correct us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Under tutorship. So as believer of his word, this hour that has come to us through the message, we are supernaturally under the power of the covenant of peace in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. We may not know it, but we are under the supernatural covenant of peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that is the promise of God. So the promise is not if you do good, you have a peace. If you don't do good, no peace. But if there's a certain rebuke, but a mercy is so vast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his mercy never fails because this covenant of peace, he establish it as an everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; So because the word revealed for this day directly connect us to the sacrifice of the blood that was shed at Calvary. &gt;&gt; This message is the voice of that blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; That has spoken in these days. And when you take the truth of this hour into your heart by faith, then that is the same spirit that was released by the blood of Christ that is now coming back upon you in this day by the spirit of the word in the message the token which he preached in 1963. said. Now we also find in Hebrew the 12th chapter 24 verse that the New Testament the blood speaks better things. &gt;&gt; The blood is speaking. Do you believe it? The blood is speaking. &gt;&gt; And the blood's got a voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the voice of the blood is the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong that the word is identified by the voice of the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost that brings life. &gt;&gt; It is life and it brings life to the word and quicken it. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the blood still speak &gt;&gt; and the blood has a voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So token paragraph 168 sure the blood speak. It speaks about a thing. The old testament the blood spoke of guilt. In the new testament it speaks of redemption. In the Old Testament, it spoke of death and sorrow. In the New Testament, it speaks of resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; It speaks heaven. &gt;&gt; And the same blood that was shed upon the ground and called out after his brother death. Oh, I I I I skipped one of program. He said in the Old Testament, it spoke of death and sorrow. In the New Testament, it speaks of resurrection and life. It speaks of healing. The blood of this voice and it speaks healing. &gt;&gt; So if you are sick this morning, hallelujah. The blood is still in effect. &gt;&gt; The blood is still the voice and the blood speak healing. &gt;&gt; Not only healing in the physical because when we heal in the physical, we can get sick. &gt;&gt; That's only the first pool and the second pool. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the third pull, hallelujah, is emphasize on the soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need healing of our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speak healing. It speaks of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speaks of power. It speaks of life. It speaks heaven. And the same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother called out after his brother that was killed. The blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood is cover all our sin. past sin, present sins, and future sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And speak peace and resurrection &gt;&gt; and power and life and healing. All the redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for, it speaks for us. Certainly, the blood speaks. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the blood is still in effect? Hallelujah. He shed it in Calvary almost 2,000 years ago. But that blood is still in effect because that blood is a voice. &gt;&gt; And if you believe it, hallelujah, God will set you free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because when you know the truth, hallelujah, there is freedom in truth. &gt;&gt; He will set you free. &gt;&gt; But Satan don't like you to think about that. &gt;&gt; That's right. In your mind, the devil will tell you he has power over you. &gt;&gt; In your mind, the devil will battle you. But the devil doesn't change God's mind. Remember that. &gt;&gt; He will bombard you of all negativity, but he cannot change God's mind about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot dictate what was in God's mind about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The devil doesn't influence God's thinking. Remember that. &gt;&gt; He may accuse you of something of do this and do that. &gt;&gt; But thank God that the prophet said, "As long as we are in the flesh, we have sticky nature." &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet for letting us know about that. &gt;&gt; We can struggle in this life. We have disappointment. We have discouragement. But it cannot take away you being sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because you are predestinated even before the foundation of the word and not hallelujah and Satan cannot do anything about that &gt;&gt; he will can discourage you he will bombard you all negativity but it cannot influence God's mind &gt;&gt; because in God's mind you are already justified &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; you are justified in the first place &gt;&gt; and what is the first place in the mind of God before the foundation word before he created the word, the stars, the moon, the molecule, you are already in his mind. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize your day, no amount of negativity will discourage you. &gt;&gt; You need to stand strong. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't make God see you different. But if you get under the influence of the devil, your mind, you will think that God is seeing you the way the devil is showing you your condition. &gt;&gt; Remember that is just battle in your mind. &gt;&gt; That is only in your mind. &gt;&gt; But your heart is already anchored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the word of God. &gt;&gt; The battle is always in the mind &gt;&gt; but your heart is already anchored. &gt;&gt; You receive the covenant of peace. Whatever battle you are in, you are still under the covenant of peace. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural covenant. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is not what God see as you. This is the thin line between defeat and victory. Glory. We want to cross that line over into victory this morning. &gt;&gt; We want to come through the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the blood is still in effect. There is power in the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is redemption in the blood. &gt;&gt; There is joy in the blood. There is healing in the blood. Hallelujah. There is reconciliations in the blood. &gt;&gt; And the blood is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in Psalms 103, he said, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me." Bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefit. &gt;&gt; It is done. It is finished on Calvary. Whatever you've been through this morning, it is done. It is finished. And don't forget the benefit while he died for you, my brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Whatever things you are doing, if you be sickness, family affair, whatever it is, it is done. It is finished. You just believe the word &gt;&gt; because he said it is done. It is finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to believe &gt;&gt; because he has already declared himself, it is done. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why don't forget all his benefit. Who forgive all thine iniquities. &gt;&gt; Forgiveth all thy iniquity. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are completely forgiven. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as though you had never seen it in the first place. &gt;&gt; In Romans 8:12, there is therefore now &gt;&gt; no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; No more condemnation. &gt;&gt; So if Satan is trying to bombard you of all negativity things, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; tell him I am already, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; praise God, washed by the blood of Jesus Christ. And that blood is still in effect in these days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, no more condemnations. Don't let Satan condemn you of all negativity. But praise God, if you're walking in the spirit, there is no more condemnation now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Preach. &gt;&gt; Don't be bullied by Satan. &gt;&gt; Because if you know who you are, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is powerless. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There is no more condemnations to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you in Christ Jesus this morning? &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit? &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; We are already free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Why keep entertaining Satan when you are already free? &gt;&gt; When you are free, you are free indeed. &gt;&gt; Of course, we can commit still mistake. We we can be disappointed sometimes. But if we are walking in the spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is just a bluff. &gt;&gt; Don't entertain him. &gt;&gt; Or you can entertain him. It's up to you. Okay, Satan, what you're saying is true. Just like what brother Brham &gt;&gt; when his daughter died and his &gt;&gt; wife died and Satan come to him. Oh, look at your you you you are praying for for sick. You're praying you have divine healing but your daughter you cannot even save. &gt;&gt; You are preaching salvation and your father is not even saved. &gt;&gt; Do you still want to? And he said, "Okay, what you're saying is right. &gt;&gt; Everything is right. &gt;&gt; But when he tell the prophet, do you want to still serve him?" &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." He can do whatever he want. We can agree with what he's saying about us. But nevertheless, the scripture say, "You are predestinated." Praise God. Whose report do you believe? If your life changed, is that your you you you are not the one who changed your life. It was the grace of God that changed your life. &gt;&gt; And the evidence is you are serving God. So whatever he tried to put in your mind, I here I am. &gt;&gt; I am the testimony of the grace of God in my life. &gt;&gt; Of course, I have born sin. Come to the word speaking life. I cannot do anything about that because I was born. There is a love. There is a love. There is a nature in my life and I cannot help it. &gt;&gt; Even though I don't like to to sometimes tell a lie but it automatic you tell a lie. &gt;&gt; I cannot we cannot help it. &gt;&gt; Because we are born in sin by one man &gt;&gt; disobedience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sin cometh to the word but by one man obedience to the word we are set free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are being set free. We are an advocate. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we cannot even say praise the Lord without his grace in our heart. &gt;&gt; We cannot say hallelujah without this grace of God. We cannot say amen without the grace of God because we are born in sin. We were alienated from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By why why we are here this morning. &gt;&gt; You are the testimony &gt;&gt; of Christ. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You may not stand here and testify of what God has done in your life but by sitting alone. Hallelujah. That is the testimony that God is working in your life. &gt;&gt; Because you have no capacity to come and worship God without his grace in your life. &gt;&gt; Remember God don't look at church member. Right? &gt;&gt; When he come, when the son of man come, shall he find faith? &gt;&gt; He need faith. He need revelation. &gt;&gt; So if there's anything that we want to come to church, we need revelations, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want revelation of grace. &gt;&gt; We don't want to become church member only. &gt;&gt; There is now therefore no condemnation. Now, &gt;&gt; not in the future. Now, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. You need testify. No more condemnation now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't struggle and don't struggle to always pity party. But if you are in Christ, there's no more condemnation. &gt;&gt; Let him condemn what he wants, but let us stand by God's grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; But it was by God's grace that I am what I am now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the grace of God. So there is a Hebrew word shalom which is used extendedly throughout the Old Testament and it means to be a covenant of peace &gt;&gt; with someone of whom you had fallen out with over something. Example, maybe they had stolen one of your cows or cars or something and it's caused a situations where peace had left your relationship with this person. Maybe he borrowed you some money and he he promised you to pay a month later but 10 years after he doesn't pay again. So it will mark your relationship. So to be able to enter into a covenant of peace it would be required to make a whole or good to restore and to make compensation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So need to to compate you need to try to return your relationship. &gt;&gt; So this is what the work that Christ did on the cross for the human race in order to make whole what was forfeited by the first Adam. Christ paid the full price to make good the error and the penalty of sin that had come in between God. So God became man that he might become the very righteousness of God. God was in Christ reconciling himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For he had made him to be sin for us who knew no that we might become made in the right of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21. So he bridged the gap, re peace between men and God again. And this covenant of peace that God has reestablished is not a temporal covenant but an everlasting covenant that is established for eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the working of the Holy Spirit when he preached in 1956 he said and he write the commun in the old testament back in the holy of holies the commandment was wrote on the table of stone but he said after these days that I will pour out my spirit and I'll write my covenant upon the table of their hearts &gt;&gt; and in their mind. Amen. Then God by the Holy Spirit confess faith in Christ bring the Holy Spirit that writes the covenant of peace across your heart. Then the spirit that was in Christ dwells in you and it makes you act &gt;&gt; the Christlike life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in there God has placed in this group of people which is called his body. Apostle, prophet, teachers, evangelist, pastors. Hallelujah. And Paul said it's for the purpose of defying the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And some don't believe that there is a fivefold ministry. Praise God. But they are pastoring a church. How come they don't believe the five-fold ministry and they pastor a church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you are showing a different picture. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said hallelujah. God has placed in the group of people which is called his body. Apostle, prophets, preachers, evangelists and pastors. &gt;&gt; That is for the purpose to edify the body until we come into the unity of faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. And then uh working of the Holy Spirit paragraph 56 uh 37. And then you think that after 2,000 years has passed by, the Lord Jesus is just as much alive tonight as he was back there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Still with the church. So he preaches in 1956. He's still calling the church church. But after the opening of the seven seas in 1963, he no longer called you a church, but he called you a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because at the opening of the seventh seal, he gather his subject unto himself and that is the bride of Jesus Christ. In 1956, he called it still he is still in the church. But now, hallelujah. After the opening of the seventh seal, he is no longer calling you a church. You are calling you his bride. &gt;&gt; There is a relationship change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The second place of the covenant is here with us, the Holy Ghost, writing out and doing the very same thing that he did when he was here on earth. And he said, "A little while and the world will see me no more." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After his crucifixions, the world will see me no more. &gt;&gt; They will not understand about his move, about his works in the church. They will not understand him. That's why all the have no life. &gt;&gt; They have just sensations, emotions. They do that and they do this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They always believe in a historical God. &gt;&gt; But now Christmas is coming. People are preparing historical God. They know he was born in a manger &gt;&gt; and visited by three kings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then on the Easter they will reenact the crucifixion again. &gt;&gt; They are believing in historical God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to believe in historical God will not give you life. &gt;&gt; But to know him in the power of resurrection will give you life. Because my spirit by word there are spirit and their life. &gt;&gt; We need to know him &gt;&gt; in the present tense and he reveal himself by the revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To know his story. God has no effect. &gt;&gt; But we need to know him in the power of resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is still with us. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And a little while and the world will see me no more. Yet ye shall see me. &gt;&gt; You understand? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How I work in the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; I work from Paul up to this day. &gt;&gt; So that's why we understand the moving of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; For I will be with you to the end of the word. &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous? Hallelujah. I will be with you. &gt;&gt; He is with us this morning. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know that God has been reenacting out his great plan of redemption &gt;&gt; since the fall in the Garden of Eden. And he could have told us everything about it in the first few chapter of the Bible. But he speak it out and spread it out and scared it little by little throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. In other words, he sealed the picture of it in a different portion of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because creation or redemption is greater than creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He laid it out from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; It is not just like a a story book &gt;&gt; that you you wrote the ending. You have the climax and you have the ending and you know everything. &gt;&gt; But here you cannot know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is scattered all throughout. Even in the book of preview, Paul carth and he is written about himself in the volumes of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Little by little, portion by portion. Here a little, here a little, there. So, it's just a mystery. It's a seal book and no one can understand it. Even we without the grace of God in our life, we cannot even understand it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We read the we read the Bible according to the denominational understanding of the book. So, that's why we cannot understand it. Yes. &gt;&gt; How many times we read about Sarah, Abraham, Easter, Rahab, yeah, Elers. We read all about that history without any any meaning about it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's just a story in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About Samson, about Delilah. Just a story in the Bible. There was no life in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But by God's grace, &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the revelation of who we are. &gt;&gt; The mystery of our life was hidden in the book. &gt;&gt; So he tell us first in Genesis 3:15 to look out for his coming redeemer that will bruise the head of the serpent. &gt;&gt; And then in Isaiah he tell us that he's coming through the mankind through a virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Then he tell us about out of all the nation this redeemer is going to come through Israel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he tell us somewhere else that it will be out of one of the 12 tribes and that is going to be through the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; And then out of the city in Judah, it is going to be out of Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And out of all the families in Bethlehem is going to be through the family of Jesse of which he will be the son of David. And so he scattered all this information in a small parts of prophecy all over the Old Testament in a way that is very hard to put it all together clearly to form a clear picture especi especially if we don't know what the picture is. So God could have written it all together in a narrative type way and made it clear in just a few chapter but he spread his mystery plan of redemption all throughout the Bible in a way that not even the devil with all his mark can put it together understand it correctly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was hidden mystery &gt;&gt; and God does this in order to hide his plan from the devil so that his plan won't be thwarted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God knows about it. He He is the only one who know what he's doing. &gt;&gt; That's why he can say my thoughts are above your thoughts and my ways are higher than your ways. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We just need to come before him by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when you look at the revel book of revelation, it is written in the same way. It can be very confusing. &gt;&gt; So that's why every denomination is allergy. Don't touch about the book of revelation because it is very confusing. Hallelujah. And so God has written the Bible like this to throw a lot of people off the real truth of them seeing him of what his real character really is. &gt;&gt; Yes. So that's why there must be a special class of people &gt;&gt; that what that will understand &gt;&gt; his character &gt;&gt; that was being revealed in the book &gt;&gt; so many will stumble many will question but for the bride of Jesus Christ we just believe it &gt;&gt; and some sometimes we cannot understand it we got confused but we still believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we cannot help ourselves to believe because we are ordained to believe in these last days. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; this is the most deceiving age in all the ages. &gt;&gt; But for the bride, it is impossible to be deceived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why in Matthew chapter 13, he said, why? And the disciple came and said unto him, why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, because it is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom, &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. So there is a special class of people to them and to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why when you receive the message of the hour, what a blessed people you are. &gt;&gt; You may have trials, you have my troubles, but just continue on because you cannot help it to believe the presence of the hour. When I first came to the message of the hour, I so rejoice because I I believe God sent a prophet in this last days. I read about the serpent seed and I believe it without any question. &gt;&gt; And when I share it to somebody else, there's a lot of question about it. &gt;&gt; Can you find it in the Bible? Can you find this? Why this Eve have a children do this? So many question. &gt;&gt; But for me, when I receive it, that's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to explain, but I believe that it's true. Yes, &gt;&gt; it was not an apple, but there's something more than an apple &gt;&gt; and I believe it with all my heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as time goes on, there's a lot of confusion. The likes of Proctrin coming in may perushia, two soul, three soul, whatever doctrine. And I began to confuse about myself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I convinced myself I believe there's a property in the land. &gt;&gt; I may not understand it. There is a double statement. I may not understand. But I believe Lord, you send a prophet in these last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if I cannot understand right now, I still hold on to it and I believe that you will reveal it as I continue to serve you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you cannot understand, don't try yourself to understand it. &gt;&gt; Just humble yourself. Believe that God will reveal something to you &gt;&gt; in his time, in his season. &gt;&gt; Because if you are sons and daughters, he is obligated to reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; Don't struggle. Hallelujah. Don't struggle to know more about him because but the more you struggle to know him, the more you go farther away from God. &gt;&gt; Just need to humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that you sent the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe you gave your life for me. &gt;&gt; Whatever things I cannot understand, Lord, I humbled myself. Lord, I'm willing to learn your ways, &gt;&gt; not my ways. That's why the song I did it all my way. &gt;&gt; I think it's Frank Sinatra or something. And maybe they have a lot of voices, &gt;&gt; beautiful voices when they sing I did it all my way. But it turned out they all of them mostly all of them that sing sang I did it all my way and in tragedy &gt;&gt; because you cannot walk your own way &gt;&gt; because there is only one way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ said I am the way &gt;&gt; and I am the only way &gt;&gt; and I am the only truth. God will lead you into all truth and the truth will set you free. And when you are free, then life manifestation. I am the way, the truth, hallelujah, will give you freedom. &gt;&gt; Then we'll manifest life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise be to God. So let us continue on to serve the Lord &gt;&gt; with humbleness knowing if we are sons of who we have so many trouble. That's it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But thank God the prophet said that as long as you are in the flesh, you will have a sticky nature bothering you. &gt;&gt; You will be bothered by that sticky nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which you are born in sin come to the world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; But if you are sons and daughters of God, you have a peace covenant with you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I may have battles but I am son of God. &gt;&gt; He may accuse me of something but I still stand as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because I cannot believe this message unless God ordained me to believe it. &gt;&gt; Not everybody can believe what you believe. &gt;&gt; So you need to rejoice. Don't focus yourself on this temporary thing. Focus yourself on what the word says about you. &gt;&gt; Because if you believe &gt;&gt; that you are sons and daughters of God, God is obligated &gt;&gt; because he said, "I will be with you." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Not only with you but in you &gt;&gt; to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; We need to always put that in our mind. &gt;&gt; He is with us. &gt;&gt; If we have trouble that is okay. We are undergoing our testings and trial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize who you are, then let your test become your testimony. &gt;&gt; Your me becomes your message &gt;&gt; and your discipline. Make it an appointment with God to humble yourself. &gt;&gt; Lord, reveal yourself unto me, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Psalms 25:12, he said, "What man is he that fearth the Lord? &gt;&gt; Him shall he teach in a way that he shall choose." God has ordained chosen pathway for each one of us &gt;&gt; to walk in this life. And he has ordained to teach you by the lessons and trials that he has placed for you along the pathway that he will lead you in. For the footstep of the righteous are ordered, arrange of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nothing comes our way by chance. &gt;&gt; Everything is ordered and arranged by God. &gt;&gt; So that his name will be glorified. &gt;&gt; His soul shall dwell at east and his seed shall inherit the earth. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him. &gt;&gt; So the mystery of God revealed to the individual is what brings you into respect towards God. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant. &gt;&gt; So if you have respect, hallelujah, God will show you or reveal himself unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the prophet said if you cannot respect the person that is standing respect the opus &gt;&gt; of the one that is preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you look at the flesh the flesh has so many flaw &gt;&gt; that you can pinpoint anything in the flesh. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said if you cannot respect the person respect the office of the person because the office is not the person it was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he has said that, he said, "Give unto men." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave the fivefold ministry in order for us to come into the unity of faith. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so if you have respect for God and for his word for this hour, then God will lead you in a pathway that he has chosen for you, hallelujah, for your life to bring you into a place where he can fully reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; That's the secret. Respect. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't say anything. As the prophet said, if you cannot say good things about somebody, &gt;&gt; don't say nothing. We can see that in almost every good writer of novel first begin their story with setting out character of the story at the beginning and then they develop that character and narrative and as the story goes along they can make you love or hate the character simply by describing and developing the personality of the character in the words and actions of the car so that you become emotionally entangled with a character. That's how noble was. &gt;&gt; The more you read, you are into the climax into the ending and you don't realize at the ending if it is a tearjerker you are already crying. That is also how God is able to bring you into a relationship with himself over time by revealing to you little by little his true nature and character throughout your life. Slowly letting out more and more of his great purpose and plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; We just need to wait &gt;&gt; for his God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are we are in God's hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever we've been through, just hold on. In Jeremiah 29 verse 10 to 1 and was also God that after 70 years be accomplished on Babylon, I will visit you. After 70 years, the testing of captivity, after 70 years be accomplished, I will visit you and perform my good words towards you in causing you to return to this place. We are in the hands of you an expected end &gt;&gt; of peace and not of evil &gt;&gt; to give you. &gt;&gt; So he is the one to give you. &gt;&gt; The word expected end means the things that you hope for. the outcome of what you have desired all along in your life's journey. It is God that has put that expected end in you from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Unexpected end what the things that you hope for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And some of us are hoping for something that expected end. We may have some troubles along the way. But we are praying and expected then that God our family will really reconcile whatever this is happening in your life during end because God put it and expectant put a desire in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't just long for wealth or career or whatsoever. Long for your expectant your family. Even had he right when he said that is the truth brother Brennham nothing but the truth &gt;&gt; and the spirit was pleased that he told brother Bham tells you there what she wants &gt;&gt; as their rights just don't even know what to ask &gt;&gt; and brother Bernham is the one who encourage her you have so poor so if you just ask money God will instantly give you money &gt;&gt; you have a sisters that is not is so sick Why don't you ask prayer that he will be she will be healed? So brother Bernham is encouraging her but her unexpected and is for the salvation of her children &gt;&gt; and when he spoke it God hallelujah ordained it &gt;&gt; and his sons come. Amen. So God put a desire in our heart. Our hope hallelujah our hope our family will get in touch or the family or children whatsoever or loved ones. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's true. &gt;&gt; Things that you hope for, the outcome of what you have desired all away in your life. &gt;&gt; It is God that has put that expected end in you from the beginning. Joseph was brought through all of his trials to unexpected end. Ruth was brought through all the trials to unexpected end. And so will you and I also come through all our trials &gt;&gt; to unexpected end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ruth was brought through all of her trials to an expected end. &gt;&gt; And so will you and I also come true. You and I is no exception. &gt;&gt; We will come through our expected end. God has placed a desire deep within the heart of man for peace and joy and fulfillment and fellowship. Man was not designed to end. Man wasn't designed for his end to be that of suffering and hardship. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; That is only necessary for a short season of your life in order for you to be able to appreciate the contrast of eternal blessings that has in store for those that love him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Trials cannot compare to the blessings that is being in stored about us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All those trials, even Job, no one can compare the trial of Job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But at the end of the day, &gt;&gt; his expected end, his wealth, his children were returned to him double in double. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I believe each and every one of us will experience the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this in this world that we are now living, Satan is trying to create his Eden &gt;&gt; through scientific knowledge and everything that he wants to bombard. Praise God the people so that their mind can turn away from the presence of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, the broken sister and the prophet said they say today by joining these things and by making this word council of churches that they're going to make a better place to live in. We can see all around even the in in pinnish area there's a lot of buildings apartment everything complexes not only here maybe all over the world they seems to forget that the Lord is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not concerned about the coming of the Lord. They're concerned about the prosperity and all the business and all to become big to have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're going to make a better place to live. To my honest opinion, they're going to make a better place to sin in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's just the whole thing is sin anyhow. Not to live in, but to die in. make its place to sin instead of live in. Any other thing outside of Jesus Christ and his word of life is a broken system. &gt;&gt; Anything that tries to substitute it, anything that you try to do to bring you peace, anything that you try to do bring you comfort, any kind of joy that you receive from anything else as you to this is a broken system full of filth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he gives perfect satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Only God can give us perfect satis. We may not own a lot of money. We may not own a big houses. We may not have a good cars, beautiful cars. But if we have him, we have everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message God of this evil age. Now let's watch it manifested. He say he is making a better world for them to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God but by his coming together in denominations and creeds intellectual scientific and so forth. He is making a better world for a man to live in and ignoring the promise of God that the only time the world will be fit to live in is in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's only in the millennium. &gt;&gt; You know my opinion. He made a better word to sin instead to live in. &gt;&gt; Notice did he do it? He legalized sin. He legalized whiskey drinking, cigarette smoking and in the churches legalized that woman could be member of the church. Even they allow woman to preach. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; With short hair. Now may you stop just a minute? Yeah, &gt;&gt; she can wear short, wear paint and still belong to his religious group which is absolutely contrary to the word of God. &gt;&gt; He say it's all right. See his knowledge. What that got to do with a woman just the same as taking the forbidden fruit or the forbidden fruit. That's what it is. God said not to do it, but he does it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she believes him and she loves him for it. She hates God. Her own action proves she does. &gt;&gt; She says she believe God but their actions &gt;&gt; tell the different &gt;&gt; she say she love him but she love Satan. &gt;&gt; She love him but actions love Satan because in this word the Satan is the god of this evil age. &gt;&gt; She worshiped the god of passion, the god of the word, the god of hollywood goddesses. She loves him, but she hates the true word of God, &gt;&gt; which is the only true God there is. Did you catch it? The true word of God is the only true God there is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you as an individual receive the true word of God for this day, then that is a very unique thing in the eye of God that puts you in the specific group of believers and nothing else should matter to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this relationship that you have with God in the light of the truth of this hour is what establish this covenant of peace between you and God. It is the message of God that will establish you between God and you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so God's covenant of peace concern you in this hour is his assurance to you that he will fulfill the promise of his word and take you out above judgment of what is coming upon his word just the same as it was in Noah's day because he promised it that he will never again judge the earth &gt;&gt; but his mercy is renewed every morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. his mercy, hallelujah, renewed every morning. This is the covenant of peace that he had given us in this day. Just as root entered into rest upon Boa's word that was rebuilt at the midnight hour. This is the same promise that we have received in this hour. &gt;&gt; We are now entering the midnight hour. Hallelujah. And we have the promises of God in these last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So his covenant of peace is his word promised to you by the message that has sent to you for this hour. We are to hold fast to that word of truth of what God has called you to stand for in this last days. We need to hold fast the word that was being revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you don't come by accident. It is God's ordained that is trying to reveal his covenant of peace with you. We may have troubles in life. We may have chastisement. We may have rebuke. But his grace is more. Hallelujah. as he shows in his character, his grace is more everlasting and neverlasting. &gt;&gt; So he was not speaking to Allah's people. He's speaking directly to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Israel, his wife, his widow wife. He is speaking personally to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this message is speaking personally to each one of us as a member of this as a member of a body of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Revelations 225 26. But that which you have already, hold fast till I come. What you have already is the revelation of who himself, of who he is in your life. So hold fast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan bully you, intimidate you. Just hold fast. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what you are holding now is an eternal life. &gt;&gt; The life of Jesus Christ in you. And he promised he will be with you even in you until the end of the world. Whatever you've been through, there's always a peace covenant with the people of God. An everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even if you commit mistakes, hallelujah. God bypass it. Lord, &gt;&gt; because he knows that we sons and we don't decide to commit sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every time we commit sin, there is a there is an inside teacher that will tell us, "Oh, that's wrong." &gt;&gt; And we automatically ask forgiveness for our sin. And he is faithful to forgive our sin. If we confess our sin is able and hallelujah, God is so good. &gt;&gt; But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. And he that overcomemeth and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nation. How? As the prophet said, how did I get my power? I didn't get power when I stand there and preach and divine healing. No, I get my power &gt;&gt; in my closet. That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, spiritual prayer &gt;&gt; through prayer. &gt;&gt; Not because you're studying a many group of people this divine. Even the brother even brother Brandon said the healing is not mine &gt;&gt; and I draw don't draw people to follow me &gt;&gt; but I draw people to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because he is faithful to his calling. When I meet the pillar [clears throat] of fire in Ohio, he heard a voice as John the Baptist forun the first coming of Christ. Your message will forrun the second coming of Christ. And he was faithful to that calling. So I didn't draw all the people to come, but I introducing to you Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of man. Thessalonian 5:21, prove all things, hold fast that which is good, abstain from all appearance of evil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because faithful is he that calleth you who also will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So meaning of hold fast in Greek word means to embrace tightly. Hold on to something tightly to prevent it from being taken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then Lord, Satan bully you. You need to hold fast tightly. I am a son of God. You need to you need to to speak it. I am the son of God. I am the son of God. I am the son of God. Because that is the real message of the hour to let you know who you are. And when you know who you are, Satan cannot stand against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; We have our identity being restored in these last days &gt;&gt; from all those previous years we have this amnesia. We don't know who we are. &gt;&gt; But every time we go scroll the scripture we know something is something is bubbling something we cannot understand it. I know I remember something. I know I remember something. As the brother said when you are in amnesia there is no doctor can help you recover. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you just need maybe some a close friend of yours and bring you to a place where you will recognize it. &gt;&gt; Maybe to a park and then you will look at it and try to remember. &gt;&gt; I've been through this. I just can't remember where. But I know I'm familiar with this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come to a place. Oh, I know this brother, he called my name, but I can't remember. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like the eagle story, brother Bernham. Hallelujah. The eagle is just been in the chicken yard and he don't know what he's he looks familiar with the other chicken. &gt;&gt; And he thought like a chicken. He act like a chicken. He ate like a chicken. &gt;&gt; But deep down in her heart, there was something different. &gt;&gt; Something I cannot explain. Something I cannot &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is. But one day there is an eagle scream. Hallelujah. And he recognize he resonate to the word to the voice that he heard. Hallelujah. I am that voice. &gt;&gt; I am that mystery. And we recognize now. So you need somebody to bring you to a place that you are familiar with. And we need a prophet in this last day that bring us out to the vir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He showed me that I have been in Ruth. He showed me that I have been in Easter. He show me I have been in Rahab. He show me I have been I &gt;&gt; He will walk me all the way from Genesis to Revelation. He show me I am in Noah. He show me I am in the Bible. He show me I am in Gideon. He show me I am all the way through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I realized hallelujah I am the book. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he open the book he called my name. &gt;&gt; How do you call your name? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; By revelation of by revealing the mystery of who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; I now I saw my name. That is why. Hallelujah. I recognize sister. I recognize all these testament character because they speak volume about me. &gt;&gt; It become alive. &gt;&gt; And this book become a new book. &gt;&gt; This open book is a title deed over redemption. &gt;&gt; It's time to go home. My brother and sister. It is now time praise God to pity party. It's time to encourage yourself. It's time to look up &gt;&gt; for a redemption is draw at night. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can see all around us. Volcano. Hallelu. Exploding eruption. Earthquake here, earthquake there. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't you read what Paul said? The earth is in birth pain, &gt;&gt; waiting and groaning for the manifestations of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are hallelujah. groaning &gt;&gt; for the millennium. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the earth cannot hold. &gt;&gt; There's always a flash flood because there is an illegal lugging, illegal mining, all that. They &gt;&gt; they corrupted the earth. &gt;&gt; So that's why the earth is now growing. &gt;&gt; They say they have a climate change, but that hallelujah is groaning, &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestation of sons and daughters of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; So we need to look up. &gt;&gt; We need to stand as son as daughters of God. Don't be afraid of the intimidation of Satan because we God over his covenant of peace. An everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; Galatian 5:1 Standfast therefore in the liberty where Christ hath made us. &gt;&gt; Stand fast therefore in the liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message of the hour set us free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if Satan dictate you, just agree with him. &gt;&gt; But don't give in with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, okay, I can still commit lie. I can still have disappoint. That's right. That's right. That's right. But as the prophet said, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand fast therefore in the liberty where Christ hath made us free. &gt;&gt; And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Be not entangled. Don't struggle and struggle and struggle. The more you struggle, you become entangled and you don't know what will happen. &gt;&gt; Just claim your God-given rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like in Joshua said, he said that in Joshua chapter 1 verse 7, only thou be strong and be courageous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us be strong &gt;&gt; and be courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to the law which Moses my servant commanded. Be strong in the revelations of what the prophet had been sent in these last days. &gt;&gt; Turn not from it or write. Don't add to it or take away from it. Don't make your own interpretations. Praise God. According to the message of the hour &gt;&gt; from to the right and to left, but thou mayest prosper in whatsoever goeth thou goest. You will prosper in revelation if you stay in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Stay in the message of the hour. Don't entertain any doctrines or praise God. Any other doctrine or any other interpretation, stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word and you'll prosper. &gt;&gt; Your revelations will prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth. &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation 8, John was commanded, "Take the book and eat it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou must prophesy, don't take it away from your mouth. &gt;&gt; Take the book. &gt;&gt; The book of the law shall not depart out thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night. thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. &gt;&gt; Don't find anything or any that can tingle your ears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of revelation, &gt;&gt; just stay simple. Stay simple and humble &gt;&gt; because when God reveals something, it's always in simplicity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That even the common people understood it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He don't use word flowery word that we cannot understand that we will miss just single iota of his word. &gt;&gt; Because he said that every kama, every line, every if you cannot find Christ in your Bible, read it again because Christ is in every verse and every line, every kama, every everything it was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us go back to the word and become simple. Then we God will prosper us. &gt;&gt; Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is worthy whatsoever thou goest. That's always says when the seventh seal was open. When the mighty angel coming down with an open book, he set his right hand the right feet upon the land and upon the sea and it say the time is no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never go back. He is still with us here. &gt;&gt; And he keep unfolding himself to us. Unfolding his word little by little. &gt;&gt; Little by little. Little little by little. You don't need flowery words. Hallelujah. To to embrace him. Just little by little. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid neither thou be dismay. And dismay is to overwhelmed by fear, discouragement, distress, open to the point of being shattered or broken in spirit. It implies a loss of courage and resolution. So if you are looking in some channel of YouTube, just make sure you follow just one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Although we have pastors, we have associate ministers, sometimes we looking for a supplement. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Just like we are eating regular meal, but we need supplement. Vitamin D, vitamin D3, vitamin D1, vitamin B12. We need supplement. But make sure the supplement that you're looking can help you &gt;&gt; not to confuse you &gt;&gt; because there's a lot in the YouTube channel that will confuse you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if you find something hallelujah that will that you feel that you can grow in that supplement, &gt;&gt; stay with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have your regular meal. We have pastor here. We have associate that can feed you but we need supplement too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible ministry is to edify the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So last quote trying to do God a service without it being God's will. He mentions when no one is group. So there is always a group of people. As the prophet said, brother Bernham will represent us. So if you're looking for eight messenger or somebody, no one will represent you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because only the seventh messenger in this last day which was vindicated by God, that is the only voice in this last day &gt;&gt; because God sent Elijah to you &gt;&gt; to turn your heart back to the father and he will be the one to represent us to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why we are called the group group of believers &gt;&gt; just like when Noah and his group. So God brea is so specific because only Noah and his group &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; miss the judgment. &gt;&gt; When they saw the message nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When they saw praise God the message of the hour nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of accusation. There's a lot of accusation. There's a lot of backbiting among but then when he saw praise God the message of the art nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It comes to my mind about Abraham as I while while I was you know when when God appeared to Abraham he was already 75 years old. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God knows that he cannot already produce because he was old. Yeah, &gt;&gt; God knows everything about us. &gt;&gt; He know that he cannot produce a child because he was already old, 75 years old and also Sarah. But when God told Abraham, you become a father of many nation, Abraham didn't figure it out. How can I be? How can I be a father of many nation? He didn't struggle upon that word. He didn't have an anxiety. I cannot sleep and try to figure out what what was that. He tried to figure out. But what he did, he just believed it and that's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't have any problem about sleeping or anxiety or nervousness because of thinking of so much of what it's that that I hear. &gt;&gt; He just believe it and that's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was imputed unto him for righteousness. He didn't struggle. He didn't figure it out. He just believe the word. &gt;&gt; Just like us, we just need to believe the word. &gt;&gt; When we see the word in these days, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Moses saw group, nothing else matter. When John saw John's group saw it, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; When Jesus group saw it, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; When the apostles saw it, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing else matter. When Luther's group saw it, &gt;&gt; then just live by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing else matter. Although he was smoking, &gt;&gt; he is believing in a trinity doctrine. But he saw his message and nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; God will vindicate the me the message of the hour. When Jen or Luther saw it when Wesley saw it, Pentecostal saw it, nothing else matter. And may I add, when the bride saw her position, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because when you know who you are, then the rapture will go. Nothing else matter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our career, our everything that we own or only nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; We cannot bring anything that we achieve here. Nothing else matter. When we saw the message of that the most important thing &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Pentecost saw it nothing else matter. And may when the bride saw it, nothing else matter. They pull away from everything. Why? &gt;&gt; By his forn knowledge. He predestinated the things to happen. So he chose his own person by his fornowledge. Nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; When the bride saw her position, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; All the upset in the message, nothing else matter. &gt;&gt; All the disappointment don't matter.
