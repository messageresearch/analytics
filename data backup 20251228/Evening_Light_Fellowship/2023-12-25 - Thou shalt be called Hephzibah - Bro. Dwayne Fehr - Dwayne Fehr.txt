you take your seats for a moment I was uh uh brother Ron was I I'm just I was happy as you were to see brother Ron this morning you know we got we got the message about what kind of shape he was in and and so we just you know the the request was please no phone calls no text messages no emails no contact no visit so man when you love somebody that's hard to do yeah but we do have a way praise God prayer changes things I honestly didn't think I respected that request uh when you're real sick that becomes a reality you just don't as much as everybody wants to love on you you don't want everybody's loving anymore you just you just need your space and I've been there too so I understand and uh but I really didn't think I would get the opportunity to see him while we were here under those conditions and uh I was real pleased when I saw him walk in this morning what a lion heart you know just here I am as long as I got breath in my body I'm going to stand here and Proclaim this glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ brother Zig another lion heart God bless you good oh oh you guys are all up for a wedding aren't you man I pity you I know what it's like to lose one I mean to gain a son-in-law he just stays a long ways away I am thankful for my son-in-law and I actually I was telling brother Robert where my wife brother Ron asked if we would sing this morning and otherwise I wasn't just going to go right into the word so I'm going to ask if she'd come but um you know God does know all things he he does know all things and I was telling brother Robert I don't know why but I know father knows and you know if you're a Son of God then you just understand that sons of God are led by the spirit of God and they don't ask people for you know their directions they just wait for the father to give his orders and I had preached this little message at home and of course I don't you know I'm here on vacation not vacation I'm on vacation it's true I got my whole family amen literally every one of them all the grandkids everybody which if you would know my family you know I got children that aren't serving the lord and and they don't you know they're uh how do I say it the right way I love them with all my heart but there's a there's a affiliation that the blood of Jesus Christ has that even your own Blood Ties don't have yes right and I uh you know I had been at home and I preached this message at home and I was driving home and here's my a I'll Stand before the Lord someday and give this testimony uh I was driving home and the Holy Spirit said when you get to Phoenix you preach that message I had no intentions of ministering I'm I'm just here with my family my one time that my whole family is together literally I'm just here with them just to enjoy them and you know maybe love on them a little bit and the Holy Spirit said when you get to Phoenix preach that message I never I'll tell you what I dismissed it shame on me I hope you Minister Brothers understand and don't hold that against me but I just dismissed it like well that was just [Music] me until brother Robert [Music] called then I said father I'm sorry I just didn't give it the Credence that I should have and so you pray for me this morning I know you know everybody's in the Christmas mode you're trying to get everything together get your family surrounded but but one more time you know one more let's give them the morning let's give them the morning before we take care of all the rest he's worthy of it all amen turn it on thank you [Music] sir all around there's signs appearing coming up our Lord is nearing he sent his word before the judgement [Music] Day the prophet brought brought a perfect message W to us if we should miss it and be here to see God's Wrath come [Music]

this morning now you do me a favor you go to pulling on the word and I know that God will answer just while you're turning to First Kings chapter 17 this morning just want to bring you greetings from home brother meno and the Saints there he's uh taking the service for me there he said make sure and greet the Saints here uh I suspect it won't be long and you'll see him here winter has come and uh he feels the call so but that's I'm happy for him that he still can I really am 80 81 years old and uh another lion's heart still going so we're thank we're thankful for these men of God that have uh I'll say this like brother Timothy said on Wednesday night you know they've they basically hewed down the trees and they've plowed up all the dirt and they've you know they've even paved the roads and us the young men are just running on it and so if we're going to run though Brothers there's a there's a line right down the middle let's just stay in the middle of it and just stay in the middle of it so if you got your Bibles with you this morning and you would turn over to First Kings chapter uh 18 and I want to start reading at verse 17 and it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that you have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and Hast followed after balum now therefore send and gather me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table and so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together un Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and the people answer him not a word let's bow our heads forward of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we come this morning Lord and you know how much in need I am this morning Father Lord we're here for one purpose father that is first of all Lord we want to show the enemy whose side we're on this morning we're not here to bow down to some little uh uh manger scenery we're not here bowing ourselves to some red man in a suit but father God we've come this morning to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of glory Lord we've come to take our to take our stand at our post of Duty this morning Lord to show the world what side that we're on Father we believe that we're a called out people that we've been elected Lord into a higher calling that Lord we come from a different Kingdom Lord a kingdom of righteousness a kingdom of Holiness father we're here in great need this morning Lord we realize the hour is late the need is great father we ask that you would feed your people Lord you would come in the only in in a way that only you can Lord you know where they're at Lord you know where they're at in their Journeys this morning and I pray father that Lord that you would go to their seats father you would strengthen me Lord for this little por of time that you would go to their seats meet them Father where they're at forgive us of our sins our iniquities Lord forgive us Lord of our slothfulness Lord and uh Lord our lack of diligence Lord all these things father that Lord that I I'd say like Paul said when I would do good Evil's present Lord but we're here this morning calling on the name the mighty name of Jehovah meet your people where they're at this morning Father we thank you Lord for brother Ron touching his body bringing him in Lord thank you for the saints that have come in this morning morning Lord the visitors we ask you'd meet each one that's in our divine presence this morning in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning praise the Lord I uh I think what a you know you know I look at this little thought and maybe you think brother Dwayne what kind of scripture is that to read at a uh you know Christmas time and uh but but if you'll just bear with me for a little while maybe maybe you'll you'll see the direction I'm going and I you know I got to ministering to the Saints at home and you know we get uh it get sometimes in our in our walk with the Lord you know we're sitting here as uh I love to call it the elect lady and and each one of us has you know you wouldn't be sitting here if you weren't walking in the light this evening or this morning you wouldn't be sitting here if the light hadn't Shone on your path and and if you've just come in for the first time I pray to God that the light would shine on your path not not the Su light but the but the s o n light you know when the there's something about the light of the word when it when it when it catches you if you're if you're a genuine seed of God something within you it just Rises up and it you might not even understand the hunger you might not understand The Thirst you you know this world hey we were all in the world at one point you know let's just be honest our first nature we didn't we didn't come with any good thing in our lives we we our whole desire under our first nature was what we we were thirsting for the things of the world every attraction was an attraction to us and everything that Satan can throw at you we desired and oh my we we just wanted to be pardon we wanted to be experienced but one day praise God one day Hallelujah the word Shone on our lives and in that one moment in that one moment something in your life quickened and it it came alive and and pretty soon the things that you once loved you don't love no more and the things that that you maybe thought were heresy and were were people were insane and they were C crazy pretty soon you saw you you started seeing things that you've never you you look Beyond a veil that you had never seen before as you came alive I thank God this morning that that he quickened my life I thank God this morning that he made a difference he's he has made the difference listen church if it could be that much so in this Natural sinb Born body if your nature could be changed that much in this world what's it going to be like when the Veil is rent between mortality and immortality and not and you look like brother Ron was saying you know I know if I'm crossing over I I'll recognize those faces one day that's going to be reality one day that you're going to see as you you're going to be known as you are known and you're going to see as you as you should see listen church we are literally going to see them that have gone on before amen and

already under our feet it won't exist over there you'll never listen you won't never fight cancer you will never fight tuberculos where's sis where's she at this morning there she is sis we prayed for you earnestly God's A Healer amen the same God Amen the same God that healed her is the same God that can heal the Saints at home amen listen we're we're we're we're dealing with a defeated enemy this morning you know it's a shame that the children of Israel would have got in a position that that God would have to call a showdown he'd have to call a showdown listen they were they were the called out they were the elect of that age and somehow they' got in this position that that they really they they they somehow had forgotten the the reality of what God had called them to am of their position in the word of of who they actually were that that Jehovah God would stand and fight their battles that that Jehovah God could be called on the scene to to heal their sick and to and to heal their Afflicted and somehow in me in in mingling with the world of their day the world had started to rub off and the thinking of the world has started to rub off and and things that were once black is as as black and white is white pretty soon they got you know where it wasn't so bad and and it's not such a big deal and you know it really doesn't matter and and and it's and I guess it's okay and who who what's going on yeah what's going on subtly they're beginning to lose their identity the very the very reality that God had called them to be sons of God that God had called them to be the daughters of God and in their mixing and the rubbing of the world somehow they got into a position where they had lost their real identity and so God would send a prophet back into their midst Hallelujah listen send a prophet back into their midst and he'd call them to a showdown he'd call them to a showdown you know people don't like this kind of preaching anymore they they they they want a god they want a God that that that will be whatever they'll leted him to be sure I worship God sure we bow our heads and pray sure we we know there's a Jehovah up there somewhere I know he cares but he but he doesn't really care about us no he cares about you he cares about what you thought this morning he cares about how how you felt this morning he cared about what went on last last week he cares about the struggle in your homes he cares about the job he cares about every part of your life amen he cares do you he cares Hallelujah listen Church we're not we're not here to go through a ritualistic you know H uh uh Sunday morning uh Christmas message we're here to we're here to it's a showdown every day is a showdown and here God sends a you know God sends his prophet Elijah up I I want us to recognize something God sent a man up who knew his position that's right God sent a man into their midst who knew his position he knew that he was sent there Lord I do all these things cuz you told me to amen standing there in the presence of what was it 400 800 850 so-called prophets preachers of the day great men men men with great organizations men with great Revelations here comes a mighty prophet of of God and how did how did God's children get in this condition how did God's children get in this condition that's right God's Prophet comes right into their midst and he says choose you choose you this day who you're going to serve make up your mind who you going to serve are you going to serve Jehovah are you going to serve baale just make up your mind look at the picture they had so lost their identity the people didn't even know how to answer my children of God you know a prophet of God would call it Amnesia right he'd call it Amnesia they got caught between the opinion right not the opinion the unadulterated word of God right the unadulterated word of God they got caught between the unadulterated word of God the word's opinion and the world's opinion you know there's only one letter difference between those two words strange isn't it just one letter difference wasn't it just one word difference that caused Eve to get in her condition brother Brown would say this another thing that caused that it caused among the people is getting between two opinions that'll cause Amnesia yes it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't you you you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you you can walk around and eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself oh my yeah isn't that isn't this isn't this the crisis of the world right now it's I I I don't know about you but I don't belong amen I don't belong I walk yeah I come from small I was going to say small town man that's bad 200,000 people sounds like small town by the you know the course of six million but you know I come from this we come from this little Outback place in the middle of nowhere man I've seen things change you know first it's the pink hair and the green hair and and now everybody's sporting rainbows and I walk into your Walmart to pick up some things for the kids not not just food and stuff like that and and just wandering down and here's these little dolls that girls love to play with them listen dolls that girls would love to play with with pink hair Rainbow clothes it's Satan's subtle way listen church if God would T 50 more years the very your grandchildren my grandchildren would think this is totally normal we could be what we want to be you see how subtle the enemy is little toys for kids that that we would deem oh it's not such a big it's a big deal it's a you better have discernment what you're letting in your home those are devils that are trying to invade your home and spoil your children and we don't think twice about it we they well that's just what it is oh no it might be what it is here but I'm not of this world I got a choice I don't have to be partakers of this I can make a stand I looked at it and something I just my my spiritual indigestion it gave me spiritual indigestion I walked away and I thought oh God this world is so ripe amen it's so ripe to be destroyed but listen church as ripe as it is to be destroyed there's a people who are beginning to understand who they really are this morning there's a group of people that have that have heard the voice of the message and they've heard their beloved say I am my beloved and and he is mine and His Banner Over Me Is Love hallelujah amen you can't identify yourself you walk around and eat and everything but you you still can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education yeah you could same education you had but you don't know where it come from you don't know who you are where you belong that's Amnesia yeah you don't know who you are or where you belong that's Amnesia hallelujah amen oh we might you know we sometimes we I guess this is all right brother Ron's in the back and he's got a big stick he brought back from vatu I said you just keep that back there listen it's not just the people of this world that can get spiritual amnesia or this scripture would never have been written these were God's children that God spiritual Amnesia and God had to bring them back to a showdown he had he had to call them he had somehow had to catch their attention again to get them to recognize so he would do what send a prophet what's he done in our day church right what's the reason that the book was open in our day so that you could come back to the understanding of who you are where you come from and where you're going listen we're here we we're sons of Kings let's act like kings let's act like the the son of a king listen it does we're not just we're not just people walking through the Earth We're Not Just Another Number of 8 billion people I'm I you know what I I'm 7.13 billion that's my number Oh no I got a name written down and it was written down in glory I'm not just a barcode in your you know in this world I've got a name that's been written down it's record Ed I come from God I go back to God absolutely but listen anybody can get you know anybody can get amnesia BR Brown tells a story tells a story about a little soldier boy that had been out in the battle he'd been fighting a battle to to save his people and I tell you if there's ever people that have been in a battle it's you and I this morning the greatest battle that's ever been fought but the shock that this young man had received in the battle he said as he they they had they had built a place for these these men that were coming home that that didn't know who they were anymore or where they come from they they didn't understand who their family was or or what they were doing on Earth and they they had them all loaded in the train and they were heading home and and the and brother R would tell the story that they stopped to to to get water and to take on fuel and and when they did they let the soldiers out and one young man he just you know he started walking and just looking around and and one of the guards watching him begin to he began to watch that young man yeah MH he thought I'll just follow him a little ways he said pretty soon the young man went he he went down the street a little ways and and as he kept walking he kept looking around and the guard just kept his distance just walking come to a corner and he made a right and the guard followed him and made a left said pretty soon he come up over a hill come down the hill and in the corner there was a there was a little yard little old house yeah with a gate in the front yeah the young boy stopped and begin to look and an old man Hallelujah an old man one that came from eternity he walked out tears running down his face he said my son I knew you would come home I knew you would come home and the moment he heard the words my son he came to himself he came to himself listen he might have been a soldier boy are fighting for a country but you're soldiers of the Cross not fighting for this country we're fighting for a kingdom that is to come listen Church we're fighting for family we're fighting for friends we're fighting for loved ones but we are fighting for a cause Hallelujah he might have been nothing in this world you might never know his name I might never know his name but we can go back and look at some of the great man of scriptures let's go back and look at Nebuchadnezzar for a moment here's Nebuchadnezzar the greatest King on Earth the greatest King on Earth had accomplished great things Hallelujah on had accomplished great things and the more he accomplished somehow the prouder he got come on sounds pretty human to me doesn't it the more he accomplished the bigger his ego became the more he thought of himself as something oh look at my degree look what I've done look what I've accomplished look at you know all about you yeah one day he stepped out so full of self come on listen church God knows how to get your attention God knows how to get your attention so full of self such an ego look what I've done greater than God I must be God of this world look what I've accomplished and in that moment in that moment listen I don't care how great you think you are this morning I don't care how you don't think the world could go on without you in one moment you brothers that were in vanatu know I'm telling you the truth in one moment listen he didn't the king didn't get sick in one moment the Bible said God gave him the heart of a beast all of a sudden he's chewing grass hair starts to grow out on walks around like an animal doesn't know who he is anymore I'm talking about am this morning church I'm talking about Amnesia doesn't know who he is doesn't recognize where he's from in one moment God knows how to bring you to your senses listen never was God's desire to leave them there only to show him who's God only to show him where life comes from only to show him who will sustain him only to show him who's given him his blessings in his life who's taken care of him who's who supported him his whole life he was only trying to get a hold of him to show him those things amen hallelujah Amnesia I don't care how much God blesses your business while you're here I don't care how great you become in this world you have got one purpose on Earth and it is not to supply your own needs it is to serve the King of Kings the Lord Of Glory I don't care if you live in a a little two room Shack I don't care if you live in a tent on

your life thank God for this moment in my life then shall she say I will go and return to my first husband for it was then was it better for me than now she did not know that I gave her her corn and her w Wine and Her oil multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for BA therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof and my w my wine in the season thereof I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness now I will discover her Less in the sight of her lovers and none shall deliver her out of my hand I will also cause her mirth or her joy to cease now listen read these verses Church he's not talking about just make Believers or unbelievers listen here's the feast days I will also cause her joy to cease her feast days her new moons her sabbaths all

them I will visit upon her the days of balum wherein she burned incense to them and she decked ourselves with earrings and jewels and she went after her lovers and forgot me sayith the Lord verse 14 therefore behold I will Allure her the tender hand of Jehovah the tender behold I will Allure her what is I will entice her I will bring her back bring her into the what kind of condition is she in

valley of aor for a Door of Hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her Youth and in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be at that day sayith the Lord that thou shalt call me isi and I don't know if you know what this word means thank you isi means in that day you shall call me husband and shall no more call me Bali which means lordship Lord or Master now there's a huge difference between a wife and a slave that's right a wife and a servant a wife and a hireling there's a huge difference in that day she shall call me husband she what what day is she talking about church right I'll tell you what brother Brown said in the lady of c and age was the marriage age in the marriage age in that day she shall call me husband and not just Lord is in in master there's a different relationship between just a woman and a man and a wife and a husband hallelujah oh God help me this morning between a wife and a husband amen but this wife had somehow lost her identification she had lost her identity of who she actually was supposed to be married to hallelujah amen yet God wasn't going to leave her like that oh I will restore say the Lord amen I will restore sayith the Lord God's not going to leave her like that he wants to bring her back into a position where she can recog where he can pour out his blessings upon her where he can show her his love and where he can where he can I I tell you oo and a and you know how many's ever not how many we all see this but don't you just love it when you see young people when they fall in love I mean when they're actually in love man they can't help but look you watch them and they're looking at each other and they're watching to see what the other person's doing and man they can't wait for the phone to ring and their phones get hot and go dead before you know we got to get a phone cord and plug it in again and there just everything is about the other person the other person the other person and then what happens we get married yeah come on church we get married and when it still should be about the other person pretty soon it's like oh poor me poor me and look at me and and oh I don't become we all we become self-centered and it becomes about us and we lose the reality of relationship and what a husband ought to be for a wife and a wife ought to be for a husband and oh God and listen this is not something what we experience in our natural flesh is no different than what Israel experienced in her relationship with the Lord amen how many times can I just say it this morning how many times you as a wife of Christ how many times we get down there and oh poor me and oh if I just this and Lord my life is so hard and oh I'm going through such hard what are you complaining about what are you complaining about you got a God that loves you you got a God that cares about your every part of your being there's not one thing that he won't supply for you there's not one listen if he knows you have need of it he's happy to do it am listen Ephesians 5 what does Ephesians 5 say husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it amen but so many times we want to be served listen we are the bride we are the bride of Christ to serve him listen he's not here to serve us he willingly serves us but we are the bride of Christ to serve him amen hallelujah and if you should just be wondering who him is I want you to look at somebody who's not well no look at the person beside you they're part of your family if that's a Son of God that's part of him serve that person and if you can't see there then look across the congregation and serve that person to be servants amen of the most high didn't wasn't it yeah you know wasn't it the disciples when they sat around there oh my I'm I'm way off my notes this morning disciples when they stood around there and you know James and John had got you know they they got their mother beside them and they they they kind of started getting this little uh you know who's going to be the greatest amongst us you you know we better we we better get our positions we better secure our positions and so Mama goes and hey hey Lord when you come into your kingdom can my sons can one sit in your right hand one sit in your left those are good things that's a that's a real request that's a mother's heart but when Jesus perceived what all the commotion was about he looked at them and said listen listen in this Kingdom in the Gentile world one wants to exercise above another and one wants to lift himself up but in my kingdom in My Kingdom if you want to be great in My Kingdom then you become the servant of the servant of Brothers how many ministers we got in this church right now don't be ashamed this morning listen we're Servants of the Lord come on put your hands up I know you're afraid because you know what listen the Bible says servant of all you know what that means to me brother Robert that means that I got to be the servant of this young man right here if he has any what's your what's your name Buddy Miles miles how old are you seven seven years old if miles at s years old has a need I've got to be the servant of that need that's right amen right servant of all most time we just brush it off just kids no children of God children of God I am so far off my notes Lord let me let me get back would let me get back listen God sent Elijah to a people yes sent Elijah to a people who had lost their identity God has sent Elijah back to a people again who had lost their identity but he he knew where he stood Elijah was confident in his calling he knew where he stood yes amen there was no identity crisis in him he understand his position in the word that's where he could stand there and tell them Hey listen rebuild the altar let's take the stones let's rebuild it all and say okay now if if your God is going to answer then let them answer by fire that's right and there they go to cutting themselves and trying to get an answer from God and if that's not like us a lot of times oh we'll do whatever we can whenever you know we seen so much Hollywood we'll put on whatever Antics we can to get God's attention listen all you got to do is get humble and call on his name you'll get his attention you're already his son you're already his son Elijah just stood there and while they were trying to call fire out of Heaven he begin to mock him and say listen you know maybe he's sleeping listen my God don't rest I don't know about your God but when you're tired he's not when you're wore out he's not when you're exhausted he's still available when you don't think nobody's listening he is hallelujah hallelujah Elijah stood there and mocked him and finally said okay enough is enough right he didn't answer it's my turn now if Jehovah is God yes listen God is not doing what God has done for us is not just a show for the world church amen it's not a show for the world no it's to catch the attention of the elect lady so that she'll come into a revelation of what she is amen amen the god that answers by fire Holy Ghost not a Creed not a Dogma not just a Doctrine a life that literally comes into you and begins to minister out the very same things that he ministered out Elijah would say now God if you're if you're Jehovah God and what I've done I've done at your word then answer right God we still serve a God that answers we don't have to go and make a show of it we don't we don't have to go into the parking lot and call in all the other churches and say hey we're right God will do that amen you know when Jesus stood at lazarus's tomb that day he wasn't a bit shaken right he wasn't a bit shaken that there was a dead man laying there it didn't bother him a bit that that man had already started to decompose and already stank it never it never shook him not one little bit everybody else was boohoo and oh poor you know poor us we've lost our didn't Jesus say didn't he look right at Mary and say listen didn't I tell you if you would believe yeah I don't know what your need is this morning but he's saying the same thing to you if you'll believe God answers if you believe God answers amen Lazarus sure come forth yes amen the problem is that you don't want to roll away the stone that's keeping him remember there's a stone in front of it what did Jesus advise them to do first roll away the stone first amen listen Jesus could have called Lazarus through the stone right he could have the problem is we got a lot of stones in our life and God wants all of you he doesn't he didn't just bring Lazarus out from the waist up right he didn't just bring him out half a body he brought him out as a whole man healthy strong amen God wants all of you he doesn't just want part of you he doesn't want a Sunday morning you or a Wednesday night you he wants you from Sunday morning to Sunday morning he wants all of you he wants you when things are going wrong he wants you when things are going right he wants you when you're happy he wants you when you're sad he wants you on the mountain top he wants you in the valley he wants all of you he wants your voice he want wants your tongue he wants your feet he wants your hands he wants your testimony buddy I was sitting behind you the other night and you were boohoo and about your situation and I thought God help that man cuz you are a man that looks at a promise not a man that looks at a situation you are birthed by the spirit of God who looks at the word of God and you might have got down far enough but you moveed that stone out of your way you can look right at the promise again hallelujah hallelujah praise God brother Brown would say this speaking of Jesus he said he relied in knowing that he was the word I want you to read this this morning and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him and that oh pardon me and that Faith where we at he was God the word and they was they was in him and and that give him Faith because he understood his position that give him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scriptures had said that he was this right Hallelujah because the scriptures had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew who he was yes amen is there more to that quote brother here we go therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what God has made us as Believers what a challenge what a challenge can't we rely on listen I talking about Amnesia this morning can't if he could rely on what God made him can't you rely on what God made you this morning amen can't we rely on what God these signs shall follow them that he had faith in what he was and if you're a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a Believer amen hallelujah can we say it this morning together I am a believer then have faith in what you are this morning Hallelujah let me back up here and find my notes all right brother Brown would also say he says Jesus had perfect Faith he had it it' come because he was the word that's right and you become the word as you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me my words in you which this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you have said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for and you shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with amen watch now he said to us if you abide in me yes in Christ all right spirit filled if you abide in me my words abide in you you can ask what it will it'll be done yeah then recognize your position as a Believer you've got to recognize your position he recognized his amen what's the word coming back to do to bring us back what's the opening of The Seals All About to bring us back to recognize where we're from listen Jesus could say I come from God I go to God you have got to be able to say the the same thing tomorrow this morning not by a head knowledge by a revelation I come from God I am going back to God hallelujah Absolut I believe God has that God's desire for us uh is is so much greater than what we comprehend because we're living we're living under so much pressure and so much there there's so much struggle and turmoil you know all hell has been loosed against us and and and so we're fighting this greatest battle ever fought and I'm here to encourage you this morning what God's desire really is for your life this morning you talk about a Christmas gift it'll be a revelation of what God's desire really is hallelujah you'll find it in Isaiah chapter 62 says this for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth as brightness and if there's ever a bright light that's been in this world you are that light and the Salvation thereof as a burn as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness all the kings th th glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name and thou shalt be a Crown of Glory now he's about to tell you about yourself so listen close Thou shalt also be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God and thou shalt no more be termed forsaken thank you Lord thank you Lord yeah I agree with that thank you Lord amen neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but thou shal be called hepah yes thank you father and thy land buah Hallelujah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married God I don't know about you but it does something inside of me to think that he loves me he loves me he loves me more than I love my own wife he loves me yes he was willing to give it all up for me yes hallelujah thank you so much so that the scripture would read behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God that we should be called the sons of God hallelujah if I could I want to just jump over to the Book of Esther for a moment because remember Esther I'll say this eser is one of those women in the scriptures that you and I can relate to this book was I don't I don't believe this book was just this this story was just told so God could put an extra book in the Bible it's kind of like the story of Ruth I don't believe it was just you know it was just told or God wrote it just so he could put the The Book of Ruth in the scriptures but I believe that this is the hour where this book comes to reality in this little bride's life cuz she was a little girl remember she was a little girl that was you know she was for La she' lost her mom she'd lost her dad and there she was being raised up you know by her by her uncle I believe it was or her cousin or something like that and remember that she was just a she was just a common ordinary girl just just like we're common Ordinary People here she had no idea what God had in store for her life like you had no idea what God had in store for your life she had no idea that all of her struggles and all of the trials and all the testings that she was going through as a young woman was actually molding her and shaping her character because God knew that at one point she was going to sit on the throne beside the king hallelujah amen you got no idea what tomorrow holds and you got a lot of questions about the past and you got a lot of wonderings and and why did this have to be this way and why did I have to go through this Lord why did these things take place in my life why did these things almost crush me but let me tell you something you're here this morning you're here this morning you're not gone listen God didn't just throw you to the to the wind and and just make you ashes out on you know out on the earth somewhere you're here living breathing still with a whole bunch of questions you don't know but God knows amen he knows why you're here he knows why I'm here this morning he knew I would be here this morning listen church he knew I would be here this morning he did something that was Supernatural to get me here How Could my whole family which no possible way if you knew the situation no way and they all say yes we're coming hallelujah hallelujah I know I was supposed to be here this morning why would the Holy Spirit tell me when you get there you preach this I had no idea that I was getting a phone call I had no idea what the situation was Hallelujah God knew you would be sitting here listening to it this morning too I don't know if he had to bring me from 2,000 miles away for somebody sitting here or somebody online but I know I'm here for purpose Hallelujah listen Esther had no idea am didn't have no idea what her struggles were about this young girl with all this wi and my parents what what what happened to my parents and where they at and and just foror and all the things going on in her poor little mind and then one day there's a decree that gets put out every young virgin yeah yeah the king is desirous for you listen I'll tell you one thing my king is desirous of a virgin bride too not one messed up with man's Creeds and ideas and doctrines and all sorts of nonsense he wants a virgin bride whose heart he can take a hold of Hallelujah can I jump quickly through the Book of Esther for you let's put let's put her where she let's put her where she's supposed to be remember you are no longer forsaken your land is no longer desolate Hallelujah here's Queen Esther uh chapter 2 starting at verse 15 now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what Hagi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther I want you to how many Esters we got here this morning oh that's a poor representation how many Esters we got here this morning I tell you what brother BR says you better put your name in the book you better find it somewhere you might say brother Robert I you don't look like an Esther no but my heart beats like one I'll tell you what my heart beats like an Esther he says The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther was taken unto the king of hazus into his Royal House in the huh the 10th month yeah and in the seventh year of his Reign she was taken into the King's house in the 10th month and the seventh year of his Reign I don't know what which what you're thinking about this morning but what happened to Revelations 10:7 Hallelujah so much more than what we realized this morning church there's a greater Revelation than what we listen God has found us he's found us list we're the apple of his eye this morning you are the one that his heart beats for this morning listen And The King The King loved Esther I don't care about all the other men she didn't care about she didn't care about hay the Chamberlain she didn't care about what Mori and they were all people that were part of her life but she had one thing listen there was one thing that was more important than anything that's right if the king finds favor in you amen yeah if the king finds favor in you that's what's important this morning has the king found favor Hallelujah and the King loved Esther above all the women she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashy and we don't need to go into that this morning but I want you to recognize her position is your position her position is your position this morning the King has set the Royal crown on her head come on Hallelujah let's jump to chapter 5 quickly cuz we understand what's what's going on that that there Comes A Time you know even though listen even though Esther is Queen already even though she has found favor in the in the of the king and he's already pronounced her as as his Queen she is not without her struggles she is not listen she's going to come into the greatest battle of her life between life and death she is called listen although she's Queen God has still called her to do what serve her people and her purpose that's it God has called you and I to do the same this morning that's right amen hallelujah came to pass on the third day chapter 5 thank you came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her remember remember what the story is here's the people that God's going to you know that you know name's got he's he's ready to uh uh you know exterminate all these people and and Esther's found out about it and she's asked the Church of God she said listen I know but I haven't been called I haven't been called to come before the king and it's a death sentence to walk into his presence or though being called yeah right unless unless he should take the scepter the golden scepter and hand it out right watch her only request you pray come on Church come on Church you pray may I say this this morning I don't know why this struck me there's a reason your pastor was laying down and out there's a reason he came home so sick God didn't just listen he's a lion's heart he's been there many times there's a reason that he got put in that position and it wasn't just about him come on maybe God needed to get your attention take something you love and call you to a place where you would intercede where you would get down on your knees where you would go to the throne of God where you would be the Esther hallelujah praise God God allows those things to happen in our lives God allows those things to happen to grab your attention somebody that listen he might be one here that you all love on the other side of the world maybe his name's not mentioned but God wanted mentioned here so we would start to pray and pray and that's all es Esther said listen just pray for three days and then I'll go into the presence of the king in other words make a way for me make a open up a channel open up a channel so the king can give me the blessing that we're looking for that's our problem this morning church many of us don't stay before God we get into situations and we won't stay there and pray through we can't pray 10 minutes we can't pray 50 oh my what kind of what kind of Christmas message is this we can't pray 15 minutes we can't pray half an hour God wants you to stay and pray through like like Jesus was there on the mount that day and there he was you know he began to pray disciples would you just pray with me Brothers pray with me Brothers I got this burden on my heart and the Bible says and they fell asleep and they fell asleep and they fell asleep like you and I many times fall asleep on her knees come on God's wanting somebody somebody to break through somebody get the blessing bring it back here comes Esther said against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen oh my yeah come on Hallelujah when the king saw Esther the queen that he said I don't got time for you right now oh for crying out loud what does she want now oh good grief woman what's wrong with you don't you know I'm busy no siroo I mean that's bit sometimes the attitude of us husbands yeah help us Lord here's the King when he sees his beloved under the pressures of the world all the decisions that have to be made everything that's going on in all of his kingdoms you think he wasn't a busy man you think you're a busy man he was a busy man you think you got pressure he had a lot of pressure come on but the moment that his wife walked through the door with the king's clothes that he clothed her with wonderful what did he do brother R just like that why you don't got to find favor in the eyes of the King again you don't got to find favor in the eyes of the King again you have already found favor in the of the king you already are you're already a blessed people he just wants you to come does the Bible say Come All You that labor in our heavy laden bring your bring your needs I'll carry them for you this the Bible says and she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out the golden scepter so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter and then the king said unto her what's your need this morning yeah what's your cry what's your Mountain much too high what's your need watch what he says and I'll give it to you up to half my kingdom y listen Brothers half the kingdom doesn't mean she's getting 50% of your wealth no 50% of all you've accomplished she can be half of what I am no everything that was his was hers that's it everything that was his was hers she was his wife amen all all the father everything this word has all of it is yours listen if you're married to him you're not entitled to listen brother Robert's wife is not just entitled to half of brother Robert she is entitled to all of brother Robert am my wife is not just entitled to half of me she's entitled to all of me she is a reflection of what I am that's Hallelujah what's thy request up to half the kingdom I'll tell you this king of hazus or whatever his name was you know he was not an insecure man no oh she's going to take me for everything oh what she what she going to do now buddy if he had a gold card he just placed it in her hand and said honey whatever you want he had so much confidence in her she he knew she would treat him right that's right yeah confidence that's on a different page Esther chapter 7 Esther chapter 7 and I'm hustling along you go go back and read the story when you get home but we we know the story when hmon came in you know the banquet was set and Esther had one request to the king Hey listen if you love me come to my banquet I'm going to make for you come to to Esther's Feast oh my I'm happy to be part of that this morning Esther's got a feast made this morning thank you so the king and hon came to the banquet with Esther the queen and the King said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition oh my I hope you're catching it this morning yeah God wants to know what you want he wants to know what you need he said just speak to me just speak to me and the King said unto eser on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition Queen Esther it shall be granted thee and what is thy request can I say this this morning there was a time that Esther was just a forlorn little girl but today she sits as the Queen of Heaven amen I'm not talking about the Catholic Church who likes to take that title as Queen of Heaven I'm talking about an elect lady who is the Queen of Heaven Hallelujah that's right we're not dealing with a a and hazus which is a you know a king of a of a great part of the world we have got the King of Kings we're wearing the UN unmerited wedding B the the wedding band of unmerited Grace amen his wedding band amen yes amen what's thy petition Queen Esther and it shall be granted thee what is thy request and it shall be performed listen his attitude towards her had not changed that's right her attit his attitude towards her had not changed and she come to one realization I'm the queen amen I'm the queen that's it there's 10,000 other virgins out there but I am the queen this is my man man she could walk with her head up high she was proud to be Queen Esther there was only one Queen and she was the queen that's right listen Church there's not going to be multiple Queens when we get to heaven we are the queen Hallelujah and then Queen Esther answered and said if I found favor in thy sight oh King and if it pleases the king let my life be given at my petition for my people and my people at my request for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain to perish and if we have been sold for bonds men or Bond women I would have held my tongue although the enemy could not have counter vailed the king's damage verse 7 chapter 8 and the king of hazus said unto Esther the queen and to Mori I'm just jumping through this you guys go home and read this book at home King of hazus and said unto Esther the queen and to Mori the Jew behold I have given Esther I want you to notice something Church listen Esther was not she so recognized her position can I say this in Christ she literally invited the enemy that wanted to destroy her into her own home literally served him with Grace and dignity just right alongside her husband she wasn't one bit afraid she'd already had the king's favor listen I don't know what the enemy has come to do in your life but you don't need to be afraid remember who's standing at your side he's promised I'll be with you always even in you I don't care what kind of thoughts that Satan is putting in your mind how he might be telling you your life is worthless how he might be telling you that that that that you're that you have no you have no purpose on this Earth you've rued your life it's all gone no no no listen we serve a God our God has come to restore us back into a position of authority of power of relationship with him alone amen hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah I want you to notice something here verse eight now let me back up behold I've given Esther the house of hmon and him they have hanged on The Gallows because he's laid up his his hands upon the Jews write you also for the Jews as it liketh you in the king's name how do we come what whose name are we hearing this morning in the Name of the King Jesus name who do we lay our hands on and pray for people's name what what name do we use Jesus Jesus what do we bless our food with Jesus name Hallelujah seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's Ring May no man reverse amen amen God had placed her in a position of full Authority full Authority put his word in her hands put his word in her hands said Esther I trust you you're going to do it right I trust you you're going to do it right didn't brother randam tell us he said when we get to the end there there will be a people who either they'll either have thus sayith the Lord or they'll keep silent God will back up what they say hallelujah she recognized her position I think that's what we need to do this morning church we need to recognize where we're at in the economy of God her words were as good as the king's words amen man that should have brought us right out of our chairs this morning Amen to think your word that's been the unction of the spirit of God in you when you speak it's as good as his words Hallelujah listen Thou shalt be called hepah the Lord delighteth in you amen the Lord Delight in you listen listen have have we not come to be reunited with the word is that not why this message has come to reunite us with what Christ the word the anointed word of the age is there not going to be a bride in this hour who's going to be flesh of his flesh she's going to be bone of his bone she's going to be word of his word Spirit of his Spirit no wonder he can have complete confidence in her he she he knows she's not going to use this power just just randomly just to prove to you know prove something to somebody she gets the unction of the spirit or she just shuts up listen there's times I I say this there's times in prayer where where you might be burdened you know you might have this H this natural burden to pray for somebody and you'll you'll be you know praying away and you you'll want to bless them you'll want to you know you want to send healing their way and something shuts you up you can't do it all you can say is Father thy will be done I don't know if you've ever experienced that but I've experienced those things and you wonder Lord why I don't know but God will show it she has thus say of the Lord or she shuts up you know what our problem is this morning church we're scared we're scared to take God at his word right we're happy to see a prophet do it we we you know we turn on the the tape and and we get to the end and the prayer lines and the discernment and we Rejoice you know we we think oh my the move of God but the same God that was in the prophet is the same God that's in you he's the same God that's in your pastor he's the same God that's in your deacons he's the same God in your wife or your husband what are we afraid of brother brand would say this he says now he says we become Anointed with the same Spirit anointed Messiahs Messiahs what is that Redeemer savior of the last day to shine forth now not like we are Jesus he he already paid the price but God uses man to redeem man yes listen there's a reason the gospel is being preached he's using man to redeem man I heard your pastor saying in the office he said here's all these you know these native people and here they're sitting there and he says they start catching Revelation you just see their faces light up why it's word cell coming to word cell word cell coming to word cell listen they're not it's not something that they you can just make up when you're when you catch it you come alive Hallelujah now we become Anointed with the same Spirit anointed Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people hallelujah he's in his people listen he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestations there's nothing left for us to do but believe it amen believe what believe what he said about you yes listen we're not we're not living in the first and the second pole we're living under the third pole the opening of the word and the opening of the word has been telling you who you really are that's right he's been he's been calling your name and and you've heard it and you've been responding to the word and by hearing and receiving the word you are becoming the word Hallelujah they're becoming one for the wedding supper pardon me there's nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect Faith what's a perfect Faith a perfect Faith calls those things that are not as though they are that's right so when you look in the mirror and see what you're not call it as though it is amen when you look at the word of God and you see I don't measure up call yourself according to the word walk in the vision of the word let the word become let become the word amen don't look at it and see all the times we failed and all the yeah we do that all but that's what the blood is for let the blood be the blood don't make it of none effect in your life let the blood be the blood and then take the Living Word of God eat the book and become the word hallelujah yes brother R was saying the pergan church age he said he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips right brother Ron's lips brother zig's lips on brother James's lips no Your Lips Your Lips My Lips amen when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as who is deity what is deity it's God that is the same as God speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man remember the quote and I don't think I sent it to to to the brothers in the back but remember the quote of the church age book brother Brown would say this he cannot he's you know how Satan will fight a True Believer every every step of the way you're going to battle every step of the way you're going to battle brother BR say this he that the the reason you're battling is for Revelation Church amen don't forget this the battle is for Revelation because Revelation is unshakable as long as you've only got the word in your mind you can be shaken but once it drops down and becomes anchored you can't be shaken no more amen amen speaking of Satan he says he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for she can do the Greater Works for she will be an invincible Army amen if they get a true revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the Christian Church By God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit that's the one that tells you that you're not that you're not good enough that you don't understand enough that you don't got enough you just you're not going to make it you just you've got too much that's the Antichrist spirit anything that takes you off of the word of God the promise he has for your life that's Antichrist the word Christ means anointed by the way all right he will be as definitely thwarted as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it we love it praise the Lord with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them yes well brother Dwayne it's different today is it why is it different well brother Dwayne and Israel had the pillar of fire they followed it and we know back when the prophet was here you know the pillar of fire all we got is a picture today really is that all the revelation we got a picture I know your pastor teaches different than this so I'm okay is that all we got a picture on our wall that we can point to somebody and say well back 70 years ago let me tell you the story it's good I'm not I'm not belittling it I'm thankful for the picture but if all we've got is yesterday's news where's the god of today listen we're thankful for the messenger we're thankful for the message but it didn't come just to give us head knowledge and and and a and a history lesson it was proving that God was God then and the same word is here today to prove that God is God today Hallelujah you want to know where the pillar of fire is today well brother Dwayne we don't really see the pillar of fire anymore we just we just got the picture of it I'll tell you what God open her eyes god listen if brother Dwayne could tell you where it is but you might not believe him but if I give you thus say the Lord then you had better believe what he says Paradox 1964 says the pillar of fire is identified scientific scientifically and by the reaction by its character and everything else just the same as it was when it was dwelling in the body of God's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted Sons for this last day Hallelujah listen I don't know how much Amnesia you got but I pray to God that somewhere that the spirit of God begins to break it off your you know your heart so does it dwell in the body of his adopted Sons the same Pillar of Fire that you got hanging on your wall the same one that we give we recognize what God had done in that day is the same one not just not just in your pastor's life in your life in my church it's time that we realize this it's not about the pastor or the deacons or visiting Ministries it is about your life sis the same God dealing in your life brother it's the same God that's dealing in your life sis it's the same God that dealing in your life will just give it will give way to him he wants to take it all hea I Delight in you my whole desire is for you my whole kingdom is for you all my being is for you I've done all this for you amen hallelujah I'll tell you what there's so many times that we just look and we we we we we take the history lessons I love I love this book amen I love this book it's truth I love every single message from 1947 right on Plum up to 1965 I love every part of it it feeds my soul I might be crazy to my children but I'll tell you one thing I love whom I love I know who my soul loves Hallelujah I don't care in the way they call heresy that's the way I worship my God hallelujah tell you what when people get to recognizing that he's in our midst when we get to recognizing he's here in our midst we come under a different expectation we come with a different hunger we come with a different thirst that little woman that had the blood issue she had tried absolutely every single thing she could try brother he had she had spent every single dime she had spent she had spent years and years and years never coming into a meeting like this never being able to walk in amongst the amongst the children of God never being able to hear the word of God being preached why because she was unclean she was unclean she had spent everything and she didn't know what else to do and then one day she heard about somebody that could change her life forever am one day she heard about somebody who could change your life forever listen Brothers she understood the scriptures she understood the scriptures if she was to walk up if she would have been to walk up to Jesus and do this she would have made him unclean not he wouldn't have been but by the law she he would have been unclean cuz she would have touched him she said if I could just Touch the Hem if I could just Touch the Hem the little pieces that hang down on the bottom if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I know I'll be made clean she was willing to do whatever listen I'll tell you what she had a better identif she understood her position better than many of us do she knew that if she could just touch him that's right she was a Jew she was God's Own Child she was part of the lineage if I could just touch him so many times we just let him walk right by it's just another church service oh it's just Wednesday evening I'm tired I'll tell you what brother Robert if we can just we could just touch if we could just Touch the Hem amen amen your problem will be gone if you just Touch the Hem your problem will be gone if you're just willing to break through if you're just if you're willing to do what nobody else is willing to do just to touch his him your issue is going to be over remember her issue was a blood issue it was a life issue that's the same problem you and I have this morning our issues are between Mortal life and Immortal Life a life issue Hallelujah praise the Lord if the musicians would come brother Ram would say this Say by faith in his word we he conquers we can conquer anything both death hell and the grave yes we know that God is God that perfect faith in God's perfect word he conquered everything that he came in contact with death could not even stand in his presence sickness I hope you're listening this morning you said you believe he's here and he is amen sickness could not stand in his presence there was virtue flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going from His Garment these people laying in his Shadows he said put their fingers on His Garment and was healed when that woman done that everybody wanted to touch His Garment cuz see they they seen that virtue was going from him constantly flowed like Rivers there he was walking in a world with perfect Faith because he was the word what kind of world are you walking in this morning what kind of world are you walking in this morning recognize that you are the word amen you are the word amen and now if you abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my words abide in you then walk in the same kind of a way virtues flowing from you virtues flowing from you praise the Lord so that when your pastor's sick that you can be the one that intercedes so when your brother gets down it's got a little boy a little grandson that's been afflicted by the enemy let the virtue of God listen we're always waiting for somebody to come by and pray the prayer of faith but what about you Mama yeah what about you Grandma thank you Lord what about you ain't nobody can intercede on that little boy's behalf more than you can because you've birthed them you've held them close you know you understand their every little cry you know you understand their every whimper you understand what it takes to nurture them how much more are you and you say well no not me brother Dwayne I just come to church and and I just no no no what if God wants to use you what if he wants to use you you're not just a mother sitting here not just a young mother not just an old mother not just a grandmother sitting here this morning that's right you're a woman that's brought life into this Earth amen come on and understands from a position that a man could never he could never intercede in that way on oh bless God you know we're the men here women have nothing doing not in God's kingdom brother that's right listen they have good she has just as much right to go and put her hands on somebody and pray for them as you've got mama you got just as much of an OP Grandma you I I had a little Grandma tell me this one time end of a service she came up to me and she said brother Dwayne she said she said I just want to share something with you she said do you realize she said my generation she said we are the generation with the most time God has a lot of us the most experience in life he's allotted us the most hardships the most trials the most victories and we now have the most time so therefore he says I feel like we should spend the most time interceding for those that are coming up I said God bless you Grandma if we have grandmas like that and grandpas like that the rest of the generations would look different come on but instead we got YouTube and we got Facebook and we got television and we got shopping malls and we've got sports games and we got everything to entertain us and Jesus is the one that wants to take you and make you the Waters of living life so a virtue can flow from your life he wants to take me and make me what I'll tell you what you want to be a Christmas you talk about a Christmas story this morning you want we want to send your family the greatest Christmas book gift ever you get yourself so filled with the spirit of God that the love of God will go to them in their condition yes listen I'm not here to criticize I'm not here to criticize my children because they're not saved I'm not here to condemn them because they're not saved I want the love of God to flow through me so they'll recognize what I got is greater than everything the enemy has shown in front of them Hallelujah the love of God packaged up in a vessel that's just their dad or just their mom or just their grandpa but no you can be that one vessel that virtue can flow from that virtue can redeem that virtue can heal that virtue can set free you can be that one little option that your children or your grandchildren or your neighbor or whoever could know that you're a man of God you're a woman of God and that when you speak to father he's going to answer your prayer they can come to your door they can say listen brother listen friend I got to tell you something I'm going through this hardship I know you're a man of God I know you're a Believer I don't know who that is but would you pray for me and you can go to prayer and you can be there to intercede for listen we're talking about a god a body word something that walks something something that talks something that has breath I'm not talking about a church that just sits and listens and takes in a Sunday morning service or a Sunday evening service or a Wednesday night service I'm not talking about a church who can say I know God sent a prophet I am talking about a body that literally breathes the Breath of Life someone who actually their whole being pulsates with the spirit of the Living God hallelujah listen what we need is lifegiver lifegiver we've been so prone to to take life we've so we so got in a place where we're so critical and we're so we're so self-righteous and we're so we got it so right and everybody else is so wrong but what do they see in you they see a snide little sneer and oh I'll tell you what God forgive me God forgive me because when I see that something inside of me turns me upside down and I got to keep my own thoughts straight God you died for them like you died for me I'm just so thankful to be part of the election this morning listen God called you heah heah I Delight in you amen I Delight in you maybe you've never heard it before maybe you've got to the place where you've turned down the voice that tried to tell you how much you love that he loves you because of your feeling of being condemned listen God comes to convict not to condemn you got a problem in your life he's not there to beat it out of your life he'll change your circumstances to make you 100% willing to give your life if there's anything I despise is to see a relationship where a wife has been so beat down by her husband that she just becomes this nervous little something a shame on those kind of men that's right that is not what God called us to God called us to serve God called us to live to lead but servant leadership he's called us to love and to show the way and to lead the way Daddy it's your duty this morning to lead the way to Christ it's your duty to show to take your life as a living example I tell you what we got too many parents that that they're happy to say oh God forgive me cuz I was one of them they're happy to say this is what the word says and you better do it but your God don't act like that and neither does mine he presents the word to you and he says now it's your choice you just go ahead and live the way you're going to live but somewhere along the line I'm going to change every part of your circumstance until you're willing to come back to me and call me your husband again Hallelujah epah I Delight in you I Delight in you I care about every part of you I am the
