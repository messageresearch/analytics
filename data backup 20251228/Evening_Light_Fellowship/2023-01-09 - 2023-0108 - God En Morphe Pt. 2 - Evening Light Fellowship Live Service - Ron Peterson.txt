your path and that Prophet began to preach and talked about predestinated elect seed you said that's me mama you identified yourself in the scripture in fact that's what Jesus did he took the scroll of Isaiah and he found where it was written of him amen and I found one day when it said behold I send unto you Elijah and I found where it was written of me I will send unto yous somebody say that's me he sent unto you Elijah how many of you believe that amen let's stand together let's sing this song [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a part of his word [Music] next time we sing that we'll go it's a revelation it's free destination we'll sing that a time or two let's go on to the next verse [Music] [Music] among Express [Music] who I am [Music] a part of my savior the heart of his word [Music] um amen thank you musicians let's just remain standing go directly to the word uh we're continuing on with a thought about God in Martha now that's what this message has come to make you to be aware of that you're a part of God you always were a part of God he said every elect seed has been and will always be a part of God that makes you eternal though you came down here took on a flesh body you bypass your theophany but God did all of that for a purpose amen but what he's doing is he's taking you back we're going back to what we were no deposit no return but if you came from God you're going back to God because you know what you're a part of him amen praise the Lord all right I'd like you to turn with me to Psalms 82 and verse 1. then we'll go to Deuteronomy 10. and then we'll go to Psalms 138 and then to First Corinthians 8. and then to Philippians 2. amen yeah we're going to read a little bit this morning Psalms 82 and verse 1. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods that's why he's here and his judgment is righteous he stands here among us today in the form of the revealed word what is he doing he's judging among the gods Deuteronomy 10 verse 17. for the Lord your God is the god of Gods and the Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward amen aren't you glad you know that God he is the God of all gods Psalms 138 verse 1. I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I sing praise unto thee before the Gods I will sing praise unto thee turn with me now to First Corinthians chapter 8. verses 5 through 6. for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in Earth as there be God's many and Lord's many but to us there is but one God the father of whom are all things and we are in him and our Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him notice there are many that are called gods whether in heaven or in Earth but for us there is only but one true and living God Philippians 2 verses 5 through 8. let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made of himself no reputation that took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in his presence I'd like to title my sermon this is part two and I'd like to take a subject this morning of let this mind be in you now I talk excuse me I told some of you to do homework to look up God in Martha and then we were had the breakfast I said that Sunday morning and Monday morning Scott Schofield sitting next to me said how do you spell in Martha I spelled it he said how come I can't find it did he say it he knew he said it because I said he said it but it was n e n and then Martha so I corrected it this morning God en whatever hyphen morpha and so I trust all of you that did your homework and how can I see the hands of those who do their homework extracurricular yeah we got yeah good give them a star give him a dinner pass and yeah yeah I should do that just passing in because uh that's what happens when you do uh that in whether you're in high school or in college you know a lot of times you'll be given extracurricular activities so that you might study to know a little bit more of what you're looking into amen now we're continuing on uh this morning let's go directly to a quote here in 64 where brother Brandon preaches in the sermon the unveiling of God he said God changed himself changes his form if you notice here in Philippians he said not thinking it robbery but took the form of a man now the Greek word here for that form I'm looking at it all day yesterday trying to think out what it was I find come with this word of inmorpha it's spelled en and he spells it looking in the Greek I find out what amorpha was I may pronounce it wrong but the reason I spell it when a tape is released the people Scholars will know what I meant by it when he when the inmorpha that means he changed himself he he come down now the Greek word there means that something that could not be seen it's there and then it's changed so the eye can catch it in other words the Invisibles becoming visible the Supernatural is making itself known so God is changing his mask I want you to understand that brother Brenham talks about how the Bible is actually a a book of a great drama started in heaven was cast down to earth and he says and everybody whether sinner or Saint whether seed or non-seed is talked about in this drama and God is the author and he has predestinated some unto election and he is predestinated some unto hell I'm sorry but there because he is the author and he can make a vessel of Honor or a vessel Of Dishonor so the clay can never tell the Potter why is Thou made me thus for hath not the Potter power over the clay so we understand that there are some that will never come to the enlightenment never know God because they are carnally minded and it's enmity with God but God changing his mask all down through time now watch this so that you understand a little bit of the thought that I'm thinking about that brother Brenham says now watch God who is the God above us Jehovah God who is the spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth but a God who is invisible who is hard to understand has got to make himself known in a way that we as human beings could have a mental capacity to understand a little bit about God so it was God above us and brother Brown said there he was great Jehovah God a God who spanned all eternity all uh eons and eons of time and he being great Jehovah God could not make himself known as great Jehovah God he's too great your little Minds could not conceive it your hard drive would lock up you would have to have an update you'd have to have something that God could allow you to catch that that's why let this mind that was in Christ be in you also it is a battle of the Mind the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind so God is changing his mask all down through time in the Book of Genesis we find out that God is acting out a part of his Plan of Redemption in Adam and Eve in Abel and in Seth what is it God changing his mask and each one of them have got to play their part that was written of them in that age in that time now the phrase the word of the Lord is used 257 times in your Bible I looked it up in Hebrew it says Jehovah it means the spokesman of Jehovah and brother Branham said that the voice of God spoke through the prophets because prophets were known to be the mouthpiece of God and he said when they came under that anointing and they spoke it was not the prophet speaking although it was his voice that they could say thus saith the Lord because they were speaking under the anointing they were speaking under divine inspiration therefore they could say thus saith the Lord and they always spoke in first person singular no wonder when God speaks a prophecy he speaks always in first person singular hear ye my people for I the Lord I Will Bless Thee I will do this I will do that we understand then that even we must when we have Prophecies of the end time of what God will do in this end time to fulfill his word a lot of times people say well this one's got to fulfill that this one's got to fulfill that and understand that God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass God is his own interpreter many times people will say well it's got to be brother Branham to do this I will ride this Trail one more time well he actually says it's three ways I ask you which way is correct he says I will ride this Trail one more she will ride or we will ride which way is it listen when he's speaking on under inspiration remember it's a promise and so therefore if it's a prophetic word what you have to do is let God fulfill it himself if you're not careful what happens is you you make God have to do things the way to your understanding and God never has been Limited to fulfilling his word according to our understanding because many times he can say something and they don't catch it destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up they thought it meant a physical Temple but after his resurrection they caught the understanding oh he meant the Temple of his body brother Brown said when divine inspiration comes upon mortal lips and is spoken it becomes as omnipotent speaking he said it's the same as God speaking that's an amazing thing when you think about that now brother Branham in the sermon the Mighty God unveiled before us 1964. um he says in Joel 2 28 he promised in these last days there would be a latter rain poured out upon the people in the last days I think the Greek word there is kinos which means he emptied his self out not in the way he would say like something was inside of somebody that he emptied out but he poured himself out he changed he is in Martha he changed from what he was to what he is he never changes his nature but on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the son of God he came not with the people he came in the people see the same God carry on his ministry on through in this great age what was God doing on a day of Pentecost he went from one to a many member same works that I do shall you do also yes even Greater Works shall you do than I have done amen God changing in Martha now in Hebrew It also says as I said 237 times in the word of the Lord came when I looked it up and you see all of those examples you actually will take that Hebrew form and you'll see that it says and the word became the word of the Lord became Jeremiah in other words the flesh took on a supernatural quality Now understand that God came down he was the logos of God he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us now we bypassed all that didn't we we came down here without our theophany we didn't have all of our understanding as he did and he says but you having an elect seed inside of you he said there will come a time when you will hear the word and when the word is heard by the hearing of the ear it will Quicken it will germanize that elect seed inside of you and it takes life Hallelujah because Jesus said my words are Spirit and they are life so the word of the Lord became in Jeremiah and the word of the Lord became Abraham the word of the Lord became David and each one had a portion they had only a small portion of a great drama I want all of you to know that you play a part in this end time of laudia SIA and God wants you to play your part and play it well because we have a part to play every one of you and may I say this that everyone on terra firma everyone here on Earth has a part to play and the reason that they out there are playing their part very well is because they're coming under the inspiration of the mark of the beast and the image that is being made in this end time and why they can all talk in one Unison is because the God of this world is blinding their minds and he is inspiring them through the media through all of the television through all of the songs and everything he is bombarding their mind of letting them know that he is their father and his Works they we'll do that's why the people are going crazy that's why the killings the murders the rape and all of this let me tell you this is Satan's eaten but right in the midst of Satan's Eden God has prepared a people hallelujah that is going to receive a word and God is going to end Marfa himself in them and he identified Christ of all ages brother Branham said remember God changes his form in Martha the Greek word means to put on a different mask he talks about Shakespeare's play he's like an actor he changes his form all what those prophets were that was God in those Prophets Jesus said so you call them gods who the word of God came to and here I am the Son of God how do you condemn me same thing as today it's God manifested in flesh the message of the hour the light of the day he can't have them other messages back there they have done lived up we live in the glare of a light now he says don't live in the glare of another age he said they played their part they lived their part what about you and I in this end time we have a part to play that's why God sent a messenger he is to let you know you have a part to play and it's not you playing the part it is God in you it is God performing his word it is God living out a life of righteousness it's not your works it's your faith being made manifest and the faith you have is not your own it is a gift of God it's not you any longer that's living why you've been crucified it's the anointing of Christ that's living in you acting out your part and Lydia Sia Galatians 2 verses 16 through 21 knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore Christ and minister of sin God forbid but if I build again the things I which I destroyed and make myself a just a transgressor for through the law I'm dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I wait a second you're dead yet you're alive nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ the anointed word hallelujah the revealed word the third pull liveth in me in the life I now live in the flesh I'd live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me somebody say Amen I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness came by the law then Christ is dead in vain it is a gift of God faith is a gift that God gives you every man is given a Measure of Faith it is that faith in God that justifies you in the sight of God it is not your works it is not how good you can live this message because no matter how much you try to say I can live it living according to the law and the letter of the law every one of you shall be found guilty because if you have transgressed the least you have transgressed all therefore our righteousness becomes as filthy rags therefore we must not have our righteousness we must have the righteousness what is given to us by faith which is a revelation and the Revelation you didn't get it to you by some preacher you didn't get it from the prophet you didn't get it from somebody in the church you didn't get it from one another you got it from God himself Upon This Rock I will build my church revelation is faith and faith is a gift you who he hath predestinated to receive this grace before the foundation of the world the prophet said he put a ring upon your finger of unmerited favor that means you were engaged before you knew it he had already placed Grace upon you before the foundation of the world and he knew you would come down here in this age and he knew your nature he knew everything about you he knew your mom and daddy knew what church you'd go to he knew all the things that you would go through and he predestinated You by grace Measure of Faith is given in every one of you that you might live the life of Christ Living outside of you that's why God gives you a revelation it is not the dress that makes you holy it's the revelation of God's word then when it's revealed to you and then you do it and you manifest God says that's righteousness do you understand that it's not long here on the woman that makes her righteous it's the Revelation she should not cut her hair because does not nature itself teach you so once she catches the Revelation and she lives it and applies it God says that's righteousness it is not by your works It Is by your faith be but your faith will have Works expressed because if you say you have faith and I don't see works it doesn't add up you say you believe the word of God and I don't see the word of God manifesting itself in your life brother Brenham says now I don't care how much you speak in tongues dance in the spirit have the gifts of the Spirit activate the spirit all of that he says until I see the life he says can you imagine you telling me you got the Holy Ghost and you still cut your hair you wearing moral clothes he said let me tell you the Holy Ghost has got to say Amen to every word and if your life is not saying or manifesting and amen on every bit of God's word it's not the Holy Ghost can't be he said because it will always say amen and manifest the word you can keep the law and you can keep from breaking ordinances and Commandments you can go to church and you can worship God but without Revelation it's vain worship when we look at Saul the Pharisee on his road to Damascus it's exactly what he was he was a religious zealot for God Philippians 3 verses 3 through 9 it says for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoicing Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath wherefore that he might Trust In the Flesh I more watch him brag here for a moment circumcised The Eighth Day of the stalk of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin he's taken its genealogy he's going back I was circumcised according to the law I was of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of Hebrews is touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching righteousness which is in the law that's listen I don't see many people could ever boast that kind of boast but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea Dallas I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but dung that I might win Christ Hallelujah and be found in him having not my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith for the Justified believers shall live by faith what is Faith revelation we walk by faith and not by sight if we're not careful we teach the message and people conform to its teaching and our children sometimes are victims of this you expect them to have the same Revelation you have Mom and Dad because quote they were raised in a mess each home many young people today within the message feel that they are victims that they have had no choice in the matter and in one way that is true because the parents are the god to the children until the children get old enough that they can go and do their own thing but while you're in my house Joshua said for me and my house we'll serve the Lord now they're your offspring and there'll come a time when they may spring off and they think they're big and they want to do their own thing and yeah I don't want to go to church I don't want to do this and I have tried to conform to it and then like the prodigal brother random said there are many elect seed to go through a hard time and identity crisis who am I man what is this message all about all of these rules regulations and do's and don'ts and and and it wasn't my decision so God says fine go ahead eat with the pigs get out there and you act like one of them get to getting around and doing what they do and you realize oh my I don't belong here and the Bible says and he came to himself I want to ask you what came to me see he had an epiphany he was hearing from his theophany you don't belong here huh yeah well and the Bible says and while he was yet afar off in his father's side and he began to rejoice and he said kill a fatted calf get the ring get the Rope let me tell you the moment Hallelujah that he neglect seed come to themselves God in heaven is already rejoicing why you're on your way oh yeah you might be a far off and I'll tell you what if you backslid and you went out of the world you'll have a hard time it'd be a hard time crawling out of that hole because sin has a way of holding you longer than you want to be held yet God makes a way you and I should have more interest in the things that we do not see than the things that we see we should be like Abraham who sought for a city whose Builder and maker is God now Jesus came in three offices son of man Son of God Son of David in the sermon unveiling of God follow along he came first as a prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man because Jesus kept asking who do they say that I the son of man am many of them said well Thou Art Jeremiah or one of the prophets raised up see return Ministry is not something new it was back then oh well it must be a return of a Ministry of a prophet to come back but then he said but who do you you see my brother my sister it must be a revelation to you about this message you're not going to get it because you were raised around it you're not going to get it because you went to a message Church and you sat there and you heard the word but it had no effect upon you now I look at Jacob as an elect seed who is in an identity crisis he couldn't have been born in a more Godly family why Abraham his grandfather and Isaac his father no doubt he sat in home meetings all the time and they explained all of the things why Abraham's talked about so many things of him having met Melchizedek and on and on and the great times that God spoke to him and Isaac said yes even as my father persevered and after 25 years and his body as good as dead and then here I come and all of the things and Jacob's still ah who am I but Jacob see House of God experiences never change him remember that one time he had a vision of sawing Angels ascending and descending didn't change his life visions and Supernatural things may anoint you and he says why God is in this place and I didn't know it and he named the place Bethel House of God many people have House of God experiences they feel anointings and are never changed but Jacob came to a place called pineal where I met God face to face let me say this to everyone here and I trust that each one of you have had your penial experience where you wrestle with God you want a blessing you ain't get it because Mom and Dad got it you ain't getting it because the pastor got it you ain't getting it because the prophet got it you're getting it when you wrestle and let me tell you if you want to be blessed you're going to have to wrestle with it you're gonna have to wrestle with the angel of Malachi 4 Revelations 10 and say bless me you got to hang on and you got to fight for life because you're fighting for your identity your name is Jacob he said because you have done this today I'm going to change your name it's no longer Jacob it's Israel because thou art a prince with God and the evidence of him having wrestle with the angel his walk reflected do you understand let me see your walk change after you have wrestled with God after you have come to the altar after you have come to that altar in your heart and you said oh God I need you to reveal yourself to me it's not what Mom and Dad believe it's not what the pastor or the prophet or anyone else I need to know for myself and when you get under that kind of an unani and you ask God God will show you until then he don't play for nobody sit there with bad attitudes well I'll tell you what I watch young people and I see it I see young people that struggle and I say you know what God help them that they come to that place where they wrestle with God until then they got a drug problem they're drug to church they're drug to meetings okay they don't want to be there so I'll come a time you're old enough you don't want to be there you won't you want to go out be your own man your own woman nobody tell me yeah okay my own daughter told me one time this is personal it's a window into my heart my own daughter said Daddy don't you ever tell me what to do the rest of my life I said look me in the eye I said sis from now on I'll never tell you what you need to do the rest of your life I said you got to find it out yourself and boy it's tough for a daddy to do that because you know what you want to correct the problem I remember even we had a family reunion and she came and her hair was jet black I looked at her and I a little bit embarrassed I said I waited until grandkids everybody else got in the house we're out on the front porch and I said do you mind if I tell you something she said no Daddy go ahead I said you look cheap I said you look Gothic black and I said that's it that's all I had to say well it's my Nat I said ain't your natural hair color I'm your daddy I know what natural hair color so now I I said dad but I said it by permission guess what next time I saw her hair wasn't jet black and I thought uh-huh you see you can bring a horse to water but you can't make them drink but when they get thirsty they'll drink I don't know if any of you have ever rode a horse that's thirsty and you bring them over to the Corral and to The Watering Place over there and they stick their muzzle down into that and they start sucking up water but if they ain't thirsty you can press that you can Splash their face you can put it right there on their lips and they won't drink but when they're thirsty so it is with people they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled now the unveiling of God I read the first part we're going to paragraph 69. then after the Holy Spirit came then he was the son of God God is the spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived through the church ages as Son of God now in the Millennium he'll be the son of David sitting on the throne of his father David he is the son of David now now remember between the Son of God in the laodicean church age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again as the son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures type perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form and Marfa he just changed it it's a great drama to him he is acting it out let me take that a little further he is acting out the drama in laudiusia in your life it's not you that's doing it he's doing it now let me just say when you take a overview of the Bible there is a central theme in that Bible and the whole theme is redemption and restoration he shows the fall in Genesis he shows the drama from genus all the way to revelation shows the tree of life is guarded they are taken in everything that Adam lost the second Adam returns back redeem means to purchase back to pay the price of redemption restores to bring back to its original creation so in order for you and I to understand what were we like in our origin as Adam was so then we go back to Adam before the fall Adam was a God in the garden said great Jehovah God was the god of the universe but he says Adam was placed as a God over the garden he could speak he'd create he was a god he was not now listen to me he was not the ruler of the whole Earth he was the god of the garden because the Earth had already Satan had already been cast down and he was the prince in power he was the ruler he was the God of this world because the battle started in heaven it was cast down to earth and he said what was an Angelic bottle has been cast down to this Dimension and now it becomes a battle among Mortals now since the fall in the garden his elect seed lost their god-like status is that true they lost their position and place in the garden they were cast out of Eden they'd lost their inheritance they lost the right to eat in the tree of life and cherubim's now guarded lest they each of the tree of life now and live forever in a unclean condition they lost eternal life it came mortal beings because the because God had told Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof is the day you die and God is Not a threatening repeating parent he says at one time that's it you see we're if we're not careful what we do your children train you instead of you training up the child don't get out of bed that's it you go in and go to bed don't you dare get out of bed if you do you're going to get a weapon five minutes later jump out of bed come in here Mommy Mommy I need a glass of water I told you to stay back okay go get your water will you get out of bed again I'll tell you what now you're gonna get it you're gonna get a whipping and how many times do they transgress so what you just said and you make yourself a liar and they got you figured out they ain't never getting a whipping that God ain't that way he said the day you eat thereof the day you die you got it don't you dare eat of the tree of knowledge because the day that you eat thereof is the day you die got that for stay stew comprendi yeah yeah I got it he's not like you and I God is a man who keeps his word now brother Ram says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed notice making it known my there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice a tree of Christ's body in the garden making his mystery known to his bride to this Bright Tree watch redeem by Christ the second Adam you believe he was going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeemed back home again that's Christ and the church today look at that Christ in the church today what's he doing taking a redeemed woman justify taking her back but back where Eden taking his wife back see the threefold mystery God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church all together bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood Same Spirit and everything else next quote paragraph 442 making his mystery known to his Bright Tree Redeemed by Christ the second m going back home to the restored back to the original Eden free from Death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life there is something mysterious that is happening to the bride of Christ right now universally around the world you can see this by looking at a cross-section of what is being ministered by the ministry throughout the world the orchestration is not a person we have no headquarters listen my brother my sister Jeffersonville is not my Mecca I don't look for them for inspiration I Look to God for inspiration now I know there are some that say Hey you know you got to press play and Obey and all that kind of stuff well I believe in listening to tapes so tapes don't replace going to church now you guys know I'm a fanatic for telling you you listen those tapes at home so that when I preach here in the pulpit ah you would have the discernment where did he say that tell me all right is this some kind of thing you just drummed up in your mind huh I wish more congregations would have the boldness to ask the ministry where'd you get that excuse me are you adding two or taken away from well here's my opinion listen when it's my opinion I'll tell you my opinion the Apostle Paul said it this is not I excuse me this is not the Lord this is I brother random gave us his opinion on several things right somebody asked him about woman's pajamas you know with the feet in them and the pants and that sort of thing uh is it okay for a woman to wear pajamas he said am I reading that right my goodness well here's my opinion he says I think you look better in a night kill I'll take his opinion okay now if you want to wear your pajamas go ahead you understand it's a it was his opinion now the message is taking on right now a different Outlook than it's ever took on before he says now why wouldn't they understand these things why wouldn't they catch these things huh he said God would not permit it to be done now but one day after I'm gone you begin to catch those things and see those things is that right he said you young men you'll begin to catch these things brother manno years ago I was one of the young men now you're an older man than me and you you're you're Ancient of Days I remember you using a quote like that while you young men will begin to catch that and you said brother Ron that's me well now you're not the young man anymore and then I took my turn and said that's me now there's other ones coming up behind me and saying no that's me because they're beginning to catch the revelation of what God is doing in this hour begin to catch a reflection of who they are you can see it among the ministry around the world it is not the orchestration of a man it is the orchestration of God because by one spirit we're baptized into one body right and this elect seed is beginning to understand the end time seed sign because the message was sent from God now it used to be that years ago and some of you Old-Timers you'll know this years ago you got everybody to Rejoice all you had to do was mention Revelation 10 7 Hallelujah my praise God Revelations 10 7 Malachi 4 God sent a prophet Hallelujah well then we went beyond just looking at the sign because the sign is Good Wonderful Phoenix 20 miles but when you have a sign and you read Phoenix 20 miles you don't stop and say oh great sign thank you what a great oh you're a love beautiful sign but the sign tells you keep going do you understand that keep going when you saw the sign and end time seed sign he said it's not me you don't look at the sign follow the voice that's behind the sign I got nothing to do with this against my own better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper went from the prophet to the prophecy do you understand that we're not looking at the prophet himself anymore but at his message then as you understand that message you become the message in other words the message now takes on another form what what is it God in morpha the now the message is no longer on tapes it's in a body Hallelujah it's transferring itself God in Martha how dare we leave the message on a cassette brother Ram said mechanical devices are not ordained to preach this gospel God never used mechanical devices somebody says you need to put the prophet back in the pulpit he never left why because God in Martha otherwise what happens God left when the prophet left and to those that feel the prophet left okay without fulfilling his ministry they say well he's got to come back well that's logical okay that's that's just logical but see God doesn't go according to your logic he goes by Revelation he's revealing to you amen that the ministry never stopped what God did is he transferred himself into another body God in Martha all right let me show you something in the scripture what God is doing now by the new birth and by adoption you've got to First be born a son and that son's got to come to adoption brother Ram said to your new birth is not your adoption it's not the Seal of God read it and hear his adoption series and you will find out he said one is a birth the other is an adoption it's a placing you can't be placed as a son until you've been under tutors and governors and you've been shown faithful and your obedient son and then God says hear ye my son and who I'm well pleased okay now Colossians 2 verses 8 through 15 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him let me tell you none of you have been shortchanged on what you need to get to the resurrection you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power in whom you also are crucified with the circumcision I excuse me in whom you're also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands what is that Holy Spirit and putting off the body of the sins of Flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism we're in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him heaven of course having forgiven you all your trespasses having what forgiven you all your trespasses blotting out that you know what they when they have a like in our government when they have a report and then they have a redacted report which means a lot of it is blacked out well our redacted version of our life has been blotted out bloody now the handwriting of ordinances that was against us he did this he did this he did this no redactive version said he staggered not which was contrary to us and took it out of the way kneeling it to the Cross having spoiled principalities and powers and he made a show of them openly triumphing over them and it God changing his mask he is a God he was made to be a god this is in the sermon the Messiah I want to show you this because I'm going to take a detour here now for just a moment before we bring this to a close now brother Brown says in the sermon the Messiah there's something about a man he is a God he was made to be a god his purpose here on Earth was to be a god to have dominion over everything in the earth oh my don't let that stagger you because I got more scriptures wrote down here man was made to be a god now how do you know what is your purpose how do you know your place in the body of Christ questions answers 1961. how does anyone know their rightful position in the body of Christ Ah that's a good one very good that'd be the kind of question amongst many of us here tonight how do you rightfully know now I'm presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play now friend said I'd like to say to this brother to give you the best answer I know your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit all right not your pastor not the preacher not the teacher it's revealed to you by the Holy Ghost everyone has to have a place and a position in the body of Christ you know the body of Christ made up of many members right just like your body is made up of many members can a hand say under the foot I have no need of Thee there are parts of your body that you never see you never hear of in fact you don't know anything about it whether it's your pancreas or some little part inside of you and you never see it unless it's got a problem and then they might cut you open and you might see that that little body part has a problem now there are times and one day I'm going to preach on this there are times when there's parts of the body that need to be cut off amputated Jesus said if you're I offend you pluck it out if your hand offends you better to enter the Kingdom of Heaven maimed this Jesus words and sometimes there is need that there is sick members of the body the Bible says after the second and third admonition do what reject don't even bit him God's speed don't sit down and have dinner with them is that right this is the scripture now there is a time when you just say hey I cut it off I'm done you're a sick member and so sometimes there is a time when the shuck is not air with the wheat God's a separator is that right his word is a sharp two-edged sword dividing asunder between Body Spirit huh and your soul amen now watch everyone has a place from now now what Satan wants to do as he fooled Eve he wants her to think she needs more knowledge to be like God fact in Genesis 3 Verses 4 and 5. serpent said to the woman you shall surely not die there was her first lie and he said she re by the reason her reasoning he she stopped to listen do you know the channel that the devil uses on most people today the channel of reasoning and it says then for God know that in the day you eat thereof your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods yeah where did I sign up I want to know good and evil I want you to understand they never knew evil before it was not in their vocabulary they didn't know nakedness they didn't know shame they didn't know Gill they were pure in the eyes of God they only knew good So Adam and Eve were already in a Godlike state but he tried to tell them oh you want to be more like God knowing Good and Evil and so they aided the tree of knowledge through reasoning and guess what it did brought forth sin and sin brought forth death they never knew evil before they didn't know they were naked before they didn't know guilt and shame before they never feared God and ran from the presence of God they had never made a fig Leaf religion to cover their nakedness they didn't need to why they were already Godlike now we know and I read to you here's where I'm going to detour for just a minute and I need all of you to be very much aware and stay with me for a moment the Bible says that your God is the god of Gods is that right he's the Mighty God he's the one in true God and so we would agree we read it in the Old Testament and we saw it in the New Testament for there are many gods and many lords do you agree to that there are many gods what kind of gods are they we're going to look at this for a moment in Exodus 20 verses 20 through 5. excuse me 20 2-5 I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me small G you'll have no other Gods before me Thou shalt make not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on Earth beneath right I don't want no craving image or that's in the water or under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the third and fourth generation of them that hate me the Bible lists worshiping or serving other gods 63 times in your Bible Thou shalt not serve other gods Israel was forbidden to worship or to walk or to serve or to burn incense to other gods I have multitudes of scriptures running to just show you one we're going to go to the First Kings and if you'd like to turn with me because we're going to do some reading First Kings excuse me Second Kings chapter 17 Second Kings chapter 17 verse 26 through 41. wherefore they spake unto the king of Assyria saying the Nations which thou Hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria no not the manner of the god of the land therefore he has sent Lions among them and behold they they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land then the king of Assyria command and said carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from fence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel House of God and taught them how they should fear the lord how be it every nation meet gods of Their Own put them in the houses of the high places with the Samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwell and the men of Babylon Babylon made sukov benoth any of you ever studied sukov Benoit and the men of couth made near gal and the men of hamath made Ashima and if you ever studied that and the ivytes made nibes and tarkad and the seraphites burnt their children in the fire to adrenalic and animelech the gods of seraphim so they feared the Lord and made on themselves the laws and Priests of the high places which sacrifice for them in the houses of high places they feared the Lord and served their own Gods mixing Christianity and idolatry after the manner of Nations whom They carried away from things unto this day they do after the manner former manners they do not fear the lord neither do they neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and the Commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whom he named Israel with whom the Lord made a covenant charge them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice through them but the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and has stretched out arm him shall ye fear in him shall ye worship and to him you shall lose sacrifice verse 37 you should not fear the other gods verse 38 in the Covenant that I made with you you shall not forget neither shall you fear other gods but the Lord your God ye shall fear verse 40. so these nations feared the Lord and served their grave and images both their children and their children's children as their father as did their fathers so do they unto this day now sukhoth Benoit I I'm just going to give you in second Kings 17 verse 30. the men of Babylon made sukov Benoit it literally means the Tabernacles of the daughters or young women who became public prostitutes at the Temple of Venus among the Babylonians their Temple prostitutes spiritual fornication brother Ram said a religious spirit is a fornicating sexual sensual enticing lascivious unclean Jezebel well do I need to keep going and sukov benoth were Temple priestesses who crossed who were prostitute dedicated to the worship of Venus who was called the god of love how about the men of kuth made nirgo is supposed to be the they were serving the the god of the Sun or the God of Light in fact the emblem of that was a rooster now follow this they said because the rooster when the sun comes he always says something at the coming of light so they made him the god of the orb or the god of the son it's a false light and the men of hamath made Ashima it was the god of fire for the atonement to purify the people they worshiped Strange Fire how many of you know that in the Bible says and Men offered unto God's Strange Fire and what did God do he slew years ago when I was in high school there was a I don't even remember the rock and roll group's name but it came out and it got banned by most of the stations and it starts out I am the Lord I am the god of Hellfire and I bring you fire and it goes on and the people wow I didn't even want to play it for you guys but it starts out I am the god of Hellfire and I bring you fire and that's the what the whole song is about fire people are playing today with things that's going to burn them they talk about hell as though it's a game I remember in Germany we had we were having a Bible study with Saints we were there and just down the street was one of those discos back when the discos were really big and the lights and all this and you can hear the Thump Thump Thump and the boom boom like this and we walk outside after the Bible study and there was all the young people they were outside smoke coming out the doors and there was hundreds of kids out there and I can hear today in my mind the song that they were playing and all of them were out there and they were reveling in this Highway to Hell I'm on a Highway to Hell and they're all out here High way to hell hi way to hell under an anointing and I want you to understand God I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to you about other gods and we're going to talk about these other gods and then I'm going to let you go and then I'm gonna try to bring it back around perhaps on the next service now brother Brahm says in the God of this evil age there are two classes of people spoke of in the New Testament children of God Children of the devil did you know that put the scripture down first First John 3 10 Ephesians 2 2. they're called the children of disobedience then how can the Brady Christ associate with the denomination when one is disobedient the other one obedient how can one by be the word and the other one want a perverted word how can a prostitute and a clean woman walk together in an agreement they can't do it they have no fellowship at all come out from amongst them it's of the devil it's the mark of the beast heading right into it now all denominations I don't care who it is God is taking not a denomination of people for his name a denomination won't receive these truths it'll take an individual person that can see God look at his word and believe it belong to no organization but live for God not for his organization the intellectual wisdom some Bishop is something that's taught it that's right both lines two Vines one of God one of the devil children of God children of God of the devil are now being made manifest First John 3 verse 8. now he the kid is meneth sin is of the devil for the devil's sinneth from the beginning for the purpose the Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin why the seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he is one of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil two seeds two kinds of worship both being gods two Vines now the prophet made us aware of certain Gods Among Us other gods did you know that Satan wanted to be worshiped as God he is called the God of this world he is called three times in the New Testament he is the prince of this world Satan desires to be worshiped as God to rise himself above the Throne of God Isaiah 14 verses 12 through 4. how art thou art fallen from heaven or lose first son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations so for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation and the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high that's what's going on right now just as God is cloning himself in elect seed it's him it's Christ in you but Satan is cloning himself in his life is in them because his seed is in them the Bible says in second Corinthians 4 verses three and four but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believed I don't believe it of course you don't you're not seen he said if you're elect seed you hear the word the word you see it you believe it huh Lord tell us what we can do to work the works of God he said only believe that's why he said that's my theme song only believe well tell me what I can do to work the works of God just believe seeds of God that's all God requires of you is to believe he didn't say you have to understand it all just believe it all right now have you noticed how everybody is getting all the same kind of mind that are in the world right now vaccination will prove it because the the unvaccinated we shall keep them from being in a job they shall not buy or sell on a vaccination hey right they believe in my body my choice but if you're unvaccinated you're going all right you do it for the sake of everybody else you're not going to go to the hospital doctor's not going to treat you why you don't go you weren't vaccinated I'll tell you what I wasn't vaccinated I was inoculated yeah all of this kind of so now I'm putting pressure military police firemen people have been on uh you know a job for 30 35 years ready to retire and you ain't vaccinated I'm just showing you what's happening to the minds of the people because they're all getting under one spirit they're coming under the image of the Beast and you won't be able to buy or sell watch the inspiration behind it okay because of the mark of the beast is acting out amongst the people in the world they're acting it out the mind of their father just the same as the Seal of God is acting out in your life in the life of a believer who the God of this world is acting himself out in unregenerated people in non-seed The Works of their father they will do so the Mighty God is acting himself out through you and I okay and it's not you doing it but God is doing it through you God in Martha okay now this is the day of manifested sons brother Brown said you are little Messiahs you're made to be Gods man was born for this purpose that he might be a God so Satan knows that also so he's going to have his gods because he wants to be like God and he wants to have his little gods follow along now now I'm I'm not going to go on some of these say I'm just going to go directly you follow uh with me Brothers on Exodus 34. let's go to the scripture here I've kept you a little bit long this morning but I I want to make some points here before I let you go Exodus 34 verses 14 through 17. Thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord your God for you the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go whoring after their gods and to sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice that thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy Sons go a whoring after their gods notice the word hurry Thou shalt make no Molten thee no molten God Satan is called the prince of this world Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if it were of this world I would send my servants to fight but he said my Cosmos is not of this world now Satan is a squatter he owns or he has a right to this Earth because he was cast down to the Earth is that right but he's a squatter he don't own it he has a he has a right to be here because he was sent here but God is soon and it's going to happen here very soon he's going to take him and he's going to run him off and there's going and he's going to be bound for a thousand years and he's not going to have any effect praise God we're right about there but until then he's going to do all that he can to try to get the inhabitants of the land to go to whoring after other gods now let me make you aware of some of the gods that brother Branham makes us aware of how about the God of music how many of you know that Lucifer and his seed and brother Brown said the serpent seed were the inventors of musical instruments he led Worship in heaven is that right so he knows how to get people anointed under music brother Ram said you want to know if it's a real Revival unplug the organ too much of the time we work it up when we all get together let me get everybody oh hey man come on let's go you're a Son of God yeah and you get them all worked up by the songs brother random didn't do that go listen are you listening to the same tapes I listened to some of the greatest anointings he's not screaming he's not shouting he's not dancing all over the pulpit there's a time for that brother REM said I I there's nothing wrong with shouty he said there's nothing wrong with dancing there's nothing wrong with all those speaking in tongues but I want to know the kind of life you live after you're done all right so how about the God of music Elvis brother REM said became a God to the people they worshiped him they idolized him rock stars today have been given a god-like status I don't care if it's the Beatles Rolling Stones or Madonna any one of them and you know what they are Godlike wow millions and millions of dollars because of the way that they sing their music if you're not careful brother Brown said now you parents be careful what you let your kids put on the wall right some picture of some rock star Satan uses the wrong kind of music to bring the condition of the Mind to where he can brainwash him because the right kind of music brings God's presence and demons flee right kind of music right kind of music David played the right kind of music on the heart guess what demons left Saul wrong kind of music brings demonic influence how about the God of science or the god of Education and did you know that everyone in the world today is forced to megadose and make your children eat at the tree of knowledge Science Education you're not going to let your kids stay home they're going to go to school they're going to have to go to sixth grade eighth grade they're going to go through high school and if they want a good job they got to go to college you want a good high paying job today you're gonna have to go to college that's where world's telling you so if we're not careful we've got all of our professional students are children that go to school and get degree after degree you're forced to eat of the tree of knowledge and I've seen young people that were good kids that go to university and universities are probably the biggest Cesspool of immorality you could get around okay this is my opinion take it or leave it but I've seen good young people go to college and they throw away everything they ever knew within a matter of weeks because they're eating of the tree of noise so they Mega dose on science and education and brother Brenham said watch science has broke into God's Great Laboratory so now DNA and all this stuff and cloning it Science Education how about the God of sports hmm huh yeah I remember and I'm going to tell this here and I've told you guys before I was up there in Canada and I went to the little church there in in Weldon and brother Dave Cook called me up one day he was the Elder of the church and he said brother wrong we got a storm coming a big storm man it's gonna snow you don't know what it does up here in in Canada Saskatchewan it it when it snows it snow so I think he better cancel church tomorrow okay wow okay the Elder of the church tells me so we canceled church so yeah we're just about 12 14 inches of fresh snow and the next morning I got up it's Sunday morning I'm thinking well I'm gonna go visit go say hello to some of the elders I drove over to one driveway you got fresh Fresh Tracks down the road it goes nobody there hey anybody home come to the next house Fresh Tracks anybody home where'd they go they went to watch a hockey game in Saskatoon an hour and a half away I had a great time man I said I can't wait till I get in the Pulpit next Sunday so I said you know what I want to do I says hey you guys you tell me to cancel church but you drive to Saskatoon an hour and a half through a blizzard to watch a hockey puck I said so and he he races and he shoots and he scars come on jump up [Applause] I said why aren't you doing it you did it this past Sunday now God of sports and I like sports there is nothing wrong with a sport except for the fact that if you get your kids and they become too good in it they will be enticed by the god of sports okay and then it's gonna be hard for you to get them out of it because they're good okay the god of sports and look at these guys they make millions of dollars because nothing but net they become god-like status and so their pictures and their names are put on T-shirts and people wear it and they these people become a God to the masses the god of sports nothing wrong with the sport but to make the people to play it a god thou shall have no other and it's so important I can't come to church on Sunday because I got to play my game how about the God of money hmm that you will miss church you will do things for your career because you need money hey everybody needs money that's true I'm not hey but it's the Love of Money and the next thing you know you're enticed obit and well the ox is in the ditch yeah as long as you didn't push him there I see so many of them push it in there the god of money how about the God of fashion musicians come I'm I I'm closing how about the God of fashion do you bow your knee to the god of fashion sisters watch the trends among the women because the Bible says take not your beauty did you know that Satan dwells in Beauty did you know that one of the signs of the end time is the increase of Beauty in women he said but God dwells in character not in Beauty right says said if you're not careful what happened just like it was in in the Anna deluvian destruction when the sons of God saw the daughters of man were fair and they took unto them wives is that right he said watch the increase of the beauty of women so the god of fashion these styles of clothes that come in Well everybody's doing it does that make it right hemlines are getting shorter low necks are coming back in jewelry is ex is accepted all kinds of things that what is it it's the god of fashion and it happened even with brother brenham's family he talked about high-heeled shoes you remember when he got his family together he told Billy get Billy get the girls together I got thus saith the Lord Rebecca Smith said brother Ron when Daddy got our women together and put us in the room and told us I got thus saith the Lord he said how many times have I told you to get rid of those high-heeled shoes and he says and after I tell you you go and you clean out your closet he said just a couple months later you buy them again he said I'm going to tell you for the last time when he said now you wear those high-heeled shoes he said it's going to be upon you not me I've already told you so he has to apply the word to his own family and we as pastors huh we do the same thing how hey would it be wrong for me to tell everybody else that thou shall not be fashionable and immoral clothes and cut your hair and yet my own kids do it you'd say there's something wrong somewhere Brethren I'm going to ask you take a look at your wives your wife I caught that take a look at your wife and see how she's dressed take a look at your your children and why the women because a woman is the type of the church brother Ram said look at the women in the church it'll tell you the condition of the church is that right he said that's why I'm always people think I'm against women he said I'm not he said I'm just against bad ones now how about the God of alcohol and drugs well it'll never happen in our family it never happened among the message believers are you kidding me just drop your guard one time I tell you the drugs that were back in the time when I was a young man are nothing compared because Satan has taken and refined the drugs to where they are so potent huh what man Superman one snort is too many and a thousand is not enough huh yeah which one of your little boys which one of you girls huh little yeah yeah cocaine Fentanyl these drugs that are plaguing America and don't think it can happen to your own family that's why we need to hold the token over our families amen that's all they need huh just one little Puff go ahead try it come on you want to be a man [Music] come on you big how about a little bit alcohol you know the billboard for cigarettes and alcohol you ever go down the street hey you come a long way baby show you some beautiful woman and she's all decked out some Jezebel model of the world looks real pretty you ever looked on the back side of these billboards it's dirty cobwebs filth Satan shows you huh oh hey you wanna hey how about a little bit come on man why be a stick in the mud young people and parents alike I tell you never allow that door to be opened teach your kids pray with them pray with them tell them before they leave huh hey Mommy Daddy's praying for you don't you go somewhere you shouldn't be if you can't go in the name of the Lord don't go hey man how about the God of the internet or the god of the social media God's got a net Satan's got a net do you remember brother Ram said the radio could have been a real blessing and he said but the misuse of it the devil took it right the radio could have been yeah people could hear Brother Branham preach on the radio could have been a great blessing how about the television could have been a great blessing he said to misuse of it how about the telephone he said yeah the telephone could have been a great blessing he said look at what he's done then I take and I see the radio the television and the internet all this stuff is now in one in your cell phone and you give that to your kids it'd be easier for you to give them a loaded gun and tell them go ahead and play with it huh it's the biggest Pacifier that parents give to their children today and it's wrong it makes their minds absolutely enticed by the things of the world God help us you say brother Ron huh and I ain't having anybody jumping up amen glory to God brother on thank you for being a good shepherd and watching over us how about the God of America he said it's a woman have you noticed that in nearly every powerful place of government military right now what is it a woman he said it's a woman's age he said a woman is the god of America and now so you see and what that is now just watch this because there's always a parallel because the Bride is a powerful woman coming into position so what the devil's doing he's having his women Jezebel coming into her position right brother Ram said wow they're just so many things I could say the god of America is a woman how about the God or gods of the ministry brother Brahm said when you make me God you make me Antichrist and yet God was in him because were they not gods whom the word of the Lord come to but he says watch he said it's a fine line he says yes he says how that we worship the God that was in the prophet he said it's not me he said have I been with you so long that you don't realize it's not me that does these things well I'm just near when his Spirit comes down uh he said it's not me that says he Saints it's him brother Branham while he's under the anointing are those things true well I see now and I see a spirit I see you why why yes here it is this is what's troubling you you were a little girl this and this happened and then all of a sudden he shakes his head and she's going yes yes he goes are those things true he said it's gone from me now and if she didn't catch it he said wait just a second he said I'm going deeper into the vision now watch a prophet he goes forward into time or back into time and most of the time when he's in discernment he says why he said do you believe me to be God's servant he says do you believe me to be God's servant or God's prophet he said wait just a moment he said Prophet that means servant he says some people get stumbled by that and he begins to talk he said I want to contact your spirit I'm content I'm doing this for a purpose I'm contacting your spirit he said oh yes I see now what he's doing he's stepping into a vision he's seeing it so perfectly before him he hears the conversation he sees the doctor he hears the diagnosis he hears all of that he knows where they come from and on and on he begins to tell those things and then all of a sudden he shakes his head and he goes are those things true of course it's left me whatever it was whatever he told you you believe now what if we take brother Branham too far and we make brother Brenham God [Music] what did the three Hebrew children refuse to bow to in the day of Daniel they made an image to Daniel the Prophet and they said we shall not bow okay read your Bibles now in closing let me give you just one last quote Revelation chapter 5 in fact brother Branham had a sermon called who is William Branham any of you Old-Timers you know there are many titles that have been changed when Joseph got he went ahead and changed a lot of the title titles great harlot who is William Branham it's Revelations chapter four for those of you that don't know in the revelation of Jesus Christ Theory the original sermon who is William Branham this is Revelation chapter five so follow along with me on this there's at least 15 or 20 people sitting right here it's guilty of thinking I was Jesus Christ wow his congregation was about a half of what we got right here not the whole con about this amount he said I got 15 or 20 people sitting right here right now thank God it's Jesus Christ I think if we were gone to Branham Tabernacle we'd know who those 15 or 20 people were right of course you would because you heard him talk about it all the time well I'll tell you what when brother Rand preached the sermon he's a god-called man don't you get it he's a god called man he's not a god-called man do you see him since it's changed the emphasis brother REM says thinking as Jesus Christ how could they do it I was right onto them until I found out that God told me it was a spirit huh it's a spirit and then men they believed me every word I said how do you believe me then if I tell you then they got to the word they began to see said well sure we didn't believe you or we'd have listened to what you said see but they actually thought they were right sincerely and any one of them Spirits gets on you that's got it you'll absolutely believe it I don't care nobody can tell you any difference no matter how much the word says so well you just don't believe it anyhow just go on if you want to be that way you go ahead I'm having my own way see that shows you're Anointed with the wrong spirit I'm talking about that you were made to be gods but if we're not careful we have other gods that creep in among us because of the land we live in the gods of Music Sports money fashion all of these can become Gods right in amongst our own believers I'm not trying to be some guy that's just always nah [Music] sometimes I wonder brother Brown says I preach against women cutting her hair and he said I come back from being on the field there's more people in my own church that cut their hair well keep me encouraged Lord because sometimes it's not easy being a pastor would you like my position [Music] God help me help me keep the right attitude Lauren I'm not going after people I'm going after spirits spirits that are trying to come in to defile us to defile our families take us down God help us to raise a standard in this last day I appreciate you all coming here this this morning God bless you each and every one and brother Kim Hildebrandt I think somebody said it was it was brother fair that was here it's not brother Ferris you guys ah y'all look alike anyway all you heal the Rants and you freezons and stuff can't tell you apart anyway we love you guys brother minnow thank you for being my friend [Music] when I was in Canada and there for three years and I went through boot camp man yeah so in order for me to come down here into Arizona which it at that time Arizona and it still is a hot spot for return Ministry okay it is well in order for me to come down here and be able to know what is return Ministry where does it come from give me the quotes where is it in the Bible because if you're not careful what happens you just take somebody's word for it instead of reading from the scripture and from your Bible [Music] so I had to go up there and I sat down on [Music] and they had asked me if I would consider being a pastor up there in Canada so I told brother Dave Cook yeah I'll consider it because Dave brother Billy Paul told him he said if I were you I'd get brother Ron as faster and to him that's thus saith the Lord so he ain't gonna let me tell him no so I go up there and listen any of you ever been up there to Weldon canisna some of you you guys ever drive up there yeah huh yeah we were there it was it was December I think it was and it was freezing it was uh like 20 30 below we landed in Saskatoon got out of the airport he's in a van the the windows on the inside of the van are frozen huh you have to go scratching like that to kind of look out and you leave Saskatoon and start heading north there's only one traffic light and it's a blinking yellow [Music] and you turn left and everywhere I'm looking outside there's hey once in a while they're a little farm light way over there maybe a couple little lights I'm going wow where is this place Saskatchewan we as American we don't know you don't even know how to spell it I didn't Saskatoon where is this place so we we drive an hour and a half 45 minutes we get there and sister cook she's hey she can cook she's got a tablespread the whole family all the in-laws and thorsons and and Chris Thorson is sitting next to me he was a former pastor so we sit down and we pray over the food and man I can't wait to eat and brother Thorson interrupts me he said brother Ron I just got three questions for you let's return Ministry third poll and tent Vision what do you believe in mine I said well honestly I said you know I just say what the prophet of God said and I said a few things and he said up Audrey get up right now I will not sit and eat with a man who believes Antichrist Doctrine up out they go I look at my wife I welcome to Saskatchewan sisters are crying what do I do hey I can go through anything for a weekend yeah you can persevere and it wound up that they voted me in his pastor and it's a long story but I tell you God had me to go there to teach me and if you're going to need to let's say fight against the doctrine you need to know the heartbeat of that Doctrine you need to study it hey huh it'd be like if you wanted to know about Perugia well go up there to a perusian church you want to know about seven Thunders go to a seven Thunders Church you want to know about deity go to a deity Church you follow me and so man I went through boot camp but God did a great and wonderful and mighty work while he was up there but then God turned around remember in 1987 God spoke to me he told me to go to Arizona they had to go by way of Samaria but God had a people down here and get and I'm looking at them I am and I am humbled before all of you to say you are some of the finest people that I've met I've ever met in the message and I pop my buttons just to say and call you my friend because you know I Don't Preach to you some kind of milk down hybrid pacifying gospel I preach it to you straight sometimes that's extremely hard but I'm pouring out my heart to you God bless you thank you for coming this morning this turned a little bit of a different direction that's okay that's okay it's still the word huh you gotta chew on it a little bit and go back and listen to the tape again and uh you find out you [Music] those sermons that brother Rand preached sometimes they are Scorchers huh anyway I love you thank you for coming to the house of God brother Amanda would you come up here and would you dismiss in a word of prayer we appreciate you come up here I know you know I'd have you sing but I do that all the time and no I won't I won't ask you to do that but I love you brother Meadow and all the times when I was up there in Canada I call him up about once every month or two hey let's eat let's let's meet and and have some food and then have some fellowship you know what he'd do he'd uh he'd kind of dressed the wounds that I had and said you're okay brother Ron you'll go through it but it's for a purpose brother minnow we love you would you just take a moment greet the people and and then dismiss in a word of prayer that it is it is a great thank you God bless you my words of this message today would be from prophet to prophecy to reality this is reality all the things that you heard him say today or much of it was prophecy even when the prophet left and we thought excuse me I turned 80 this year I never thought I'd see 50 40 30. I heard brother Brown preach the marriage and divorce series when he passed we were ready to go then as a whole generation was prophecy you young men women here today you've heard it exactly the way the prophet said it in love in kindness and respect [Music] to thus saith the Lord the things that we've gone through and go through our only testing grounds proving that there comes a reality to every prophecy for it spoken when it's not yet reality listen to the things he said today about the world it wasn't that way 80 years ago but it's that way now it's not going to be it is that way look at the church world the religious World it wasn't that way 50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years but it is now there wasn't a bride collecting gathered around the world the way they are now around thus saith the Lord they've gone to individuals not what this man says what this man said what I say what brother aunt said it isn't that it wasn't brother Ron it's the message and the prophet knew it when he was here he knew he wouldn't see a lot of things he kept talking about him going he said I might not be here and I brother Ron that's true he said but you young men how I laid a hold of that how are they ahold of that for myself 28 years old but you're going to walk very much alone you're not going to have all the trumpets sounding around you know all the brothers saying oh praise God move on move on you stay with this message he'll stay with you that's what matters I want the presence the grace of God in my life that's all that matters when this race is finished I want my body to turn
