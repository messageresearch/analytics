would you like that to be fulfilled this evening I would God fill my cup amen thou our heart shifts the moment our heavenly father it is a privilege to be here in the house of God of prayer and Pastor Lord we appreciate all of the kindness that you show us in this hour Lord we have to speak we ask that you will open up our hearts make us acceptable to those things that we hear and believe may we leave here Lord warmed by the power and presence of God bless us now and strengthen Us in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen while you're standing if you have your Bibles term with me to Deuteronomy chapter 4. and I would like to start reading it number one one through four if you would now for therefore hearken over his rule unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that she may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto The Words which I pronounce you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you your eyes have seen what the Lord did promise of belchspore for all the men that followed belpora the Lord thy God had destroyed them from among you but ye shall cleave unto the Lord your God and ye awards every one of you this day may God add His blessings to the word you may be seated as we look to the word of God it's an honor to be here honestly to speak the word of God I I mean that sincerely we got a talk on desperation that uh things in our life create desperation you have to have a problem to have it there's certain things that make you rejoice through certain things that make you sad there's certain things that put the word of God out in your life and these are things we want to dress about I attend the service here and fortunate on mainly Sundays to come and get a good opportunity a good look at everybody and how much you love the Lord and I want to see the hearts of those that God does things for your heart it Thrills my heart to see the life go into you and the songs you rejoice over in the gospel you hear and the things you do and that's what I'm talking about and I thought as I listened to some of these we heard a brother preach from war shooting 10 I believe it was West Washington and I thought at the conclusion of his sermon as he was talking I thought about about 400 people were sitting here and I thought dear God they need a touch from you to make them alive to what you're talking about and I I uh I'm not being critical I don't mean to be harsh but I as I sit there I said to myself what could I do to help them what could they do to help me to look better and I began to look at people and I wonder about the manifestation of a living God that lives within all of our presence it ought to cause a stir it ought to caught a mold it really ought to do something different to you amen a lot of times we look for certain things to happen and I thought as the brother made some mention I thought I'd like to see them all saved and on their way to heaven but at the same times you know it's they're got their way of living we do and everybody does and so it just it touched my heart to think because you see there's the gospel that does something to you you can either wash it away or you can cause yourself to have to do something about what you heard it'll make you repent it'll make you shout happy it'll make you know that there's a battle on that you know there's a heaven to gain and a hell to shun and the thing of it is but there's also a spirit that tries to drive you from that presence of God and that's what I I wonder about our minds and about our lives and I'm talking I trust about you and about me I want to be moved by the power and presence of God when people are in the house I want to do whatever I can do I want to come prepared I want to be a believer in God I want to be a believer in the gospel I come here now not only hear the gospel but I come to share the life of the Gospel to you already because you should have came to church already with your light already burning and the past of God that God give us what a difference it ought to make to our life and uh looking at some of them young women it seemed like a lot of them on Sunday morning I think to myself I wonder if the presence of God really gets to them to really cause a change to happen to their life and you write would you like to know how I know a lot of that is because I got the problem what I want I want more of God I want the verse that I have in Christ I want to manifest myself in him can you say Amen and so as we look at the word of God this morning I thought about myself you know many years ago I turned 21 years old and that's about the time of year all the bars are open to you and all you could do and I was going to my dad's church and I thought to myself that night I thought boy want to get through this my birthday's next day I'm going to hit them bars I'm going to hit them Liquors and gonna do that but I looked up and I told him whatever happens to me I want to make Heaven my home father I believe I love him above all my failure come on I believe God Loves Me Above All My failure so I can talk to him whether I'm succeeding or failure and I have to apologize from my wrong and I'm grateful for my right but I believe in him who calls me you know and I I told the Lord and I got getting strict and in my hands started going up and I began to step out in the middle of that congregation and the touch of God I said that uh forget what all I said but as I was in prayer I turned around like this and down the aisle of that church came a pyramid not a pyramid but a whirlwind and I've got to watch in that world win and it had suitcases in it it had straw a lot of stuff in it but all my life I took it at that Whirlwind always swept over me and took the uncleanness from my life and made me different can I hear an amen amen I believe God lives I believe that he fills your heart and life which helps you to live better and more Freer he teaches you to pray and if you don't learn to pray you find out your prayers don't get answered like they should and a lot of things go on that's what we want to talk about tonight but ever since that age when I look back I see that Whirlwind coming by my life working on taking out of my life making me what God would have me to be and I think what a an Outreach that is to my life how many of you believe God loves you do you really believe that he loves you then how can you fail because he does love you we think sometimes because of our failure and because of certain things but that creates it but uh uh the thing that touched my heart was that I believe that we need to take what God has given us he not only give us desperation he gives us your excitements and when you turn these Pages a lot of people I don't know that they like these books anymore but you see it is the mouth of God and if I could say something to you truthfully just being honest and all my life I've read some of the weirdest things I've ever read in my life and never knew them how many of you read one of these and when you come to find out you don't remember any of it nobody well I'll tell you it's a good one you want to read and it's where our life is and I'm saying this to you tonight because I believe it's to my heart and life God gives you things to be thankful for when you don't get those you're not thankful for sometimes you bring your thankful for up he wants to know why but when he brings his thankfuls up and you know the power of God has delivered you has made you different and has made you reach out you know I remember when people were sick you may not pray for me but you'd Pat him you touch him you'd shake their hand and while you did you'd pray for him friends need to be moved today by the power of Satan that the power of God may fill our hearts and Minds that's the dream of my heart and uh as we look at life and look at things this morning what touched my heart was a lot of the things that God has done for us I I I don't know that he pays much attention to what we do to him and I got to invited to preach here uh several weeks ago and every time I'd come to church somebody preached my sermon and I I uh this uh my brother back here the other day running up and down here like this I thought wonder what will happen if I take off running because I used to take off running and then praise the Lord and and friends I'll tell you something honestly I do not believe there's a greater power than the power of Jesus Christ you can go home as dry as you want or you can go home in Victory in your life I believe that with all my heart and you can answer have to answer it why you don't get Victory no more why you don't get to disturb by that how can you listen to me say things and have them not bother you how can he get happy and not me how can he not shout and not saying how can he not do these I say the same maybe to you what's touching their life I want to see Christ in you operating towards your life I know that we've got a children's or sick baby's got problems parents got wives husbands and everything else but I know someone that's greater than all of them amen in his name is the Lord Jesus Christ how many of you know him and the reason we don't know him right because we don't look into him like we really ought to look and that's what I want to talk to you about if I can and my wording and everything is correct that God has done these things for us and you know there's a Rapture at hand is that right amen one of these days it's gonna happen and you're not going to know it or you're going to be gone people talk about dying a Christian Never Dies amen because he has already passed from Death unto life I don't care how many times we have excuses for that it is the truth he died for me he lives for me amen and if anything happens to me I'm on my way to glory amen and when the time comes I'm going to come back we ought to get thrilled about the move of God in our our lives I'm not being critical I'm just looking to people about allow those things in their life and one of the things that touched my heart I guess and you all probably have read many of them or came to him as a squirrel Story by Brother Branham and uh you know a lot of things that when you follow brother bran a lot of things touched his heart but when I I read this he's talking to the Lord in one place he said Lord why don't you send me that uh squirrel and he says God hey my squirrels and he's there talking to God about the squirrels that he got from God but they weren't from God they were because he believed in God and when you believe in things that you get from God they come from God not from you through God to God and as I read this he wants to know how do I get your God down and now he's explaining how it is that it's not really my god when under the anointing of God you ask me to send some doves back or some squirrels back down this is that true and that's the same way when you or I your own voice will cause God to come and do Mighty things among us or you can go home tonight just as bad as you came here or you can go here happy amen it's unto you how many of you have been born again we've been born again and it leaves up to you I'm not going home that way Lord you know who I am you know who I am and he'll change your life so as I looked over Sunday service I thought about or brother and I thought about him asking for these squirrels he said you know he said I rubbed my eyes and I look back I turned to see my head and I thought I don't want to shoot that you know he's there and he's among some trees and brother Brown said every time he walks through those trees he thanks the Lord for him how many of you thank the Lord for the privilege of being in a place that you're hunting or a place that you're doing something from God and you ought to owe him a thank you like today I'm thankful that I'm in the house of God better than I'm in a bar somewhere and if you'll help me Lord I'll heal I'll hear the right words that will bless your mind or my mind and will change my heart oh Lord I I I I'm missing all them squirrels I'm missing them Lord I don't have them you're the one that got the squirrels and so then all of a sudden he begins to say to the squirrels I want you to come down that mountain I want you to come across that I want you to jump up in that tree over there and I want you to wait there till I shoot him and so he's thinking God is not going to hear him but when he looks up you know what he sees he sees the little the the squirrel coming down the mountain he watches him he jumps over there and he put him to jumps in a in a place that had crops that covered it and ordinarily a squirrel would never land in a tree like that but that tree grew up there and he looked at that and he threw that gun he said God I don't want to shoot a vision but he took his gun and shot that thing and down he came and when I got to thinking about that I I got to thinking about our blessings imagine being empowered by God looking on vision and not using any of God's leadership to get you there you know I said when I walked home with a request to meet at this day I thought dear God I am going to find you I'm going to have myself a a wonderful time with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and I want to kneel down and I want to raise my hands I want to tell him that I'm moved upon because that's animal landed that thing in the tree and if he can do that by a prayer that something already happened how many of you got saved how many of your kids got saved how many your husbands got saved how many how many promises do you have and they're all God's promises and it ought to be when you look up you see the squirrel up there and you shoot him you ought to say well you know that's a promise that God paid attention to me a long time ago a long time ago he knew you long time ago he loved you long time ago he liked separate time with you you like to talk it over with you and you run yourself through him you talk to him because without that brothers and sisters he's got no reason to come he's got no reason to be thankful got no reason to be helpful and you say well Michael where do you get those words I get them from this and the thing of it is is as we begin before I move on with this story I wanted to tell you that what he did he just stayed in his position and he didn't ask for the rest of the squirrels and when you talk about the squirrels girl God would ask him but he just could not make up his mind what it is and I'm thinking he's got a power he's got a presence he's got a manifestation he's a prayer he's a singer he's a shouter he's uh and nobody raises her hand and hollers praise the Lord that's good because you see it you see there's something that's stir in somebody you are aware of a presence that's attaching somebody and by the grace of God I'm going to do something with that attachment huh I saw somebody shake his hands or something Sunday and all because he comes here every Sunday anyway and always seems like he's very much alive anybody would want to touch him and if it's God in him and making that man alive you ought to touch him when you look out and you see the women with their hands up like this you ought to say thank you Jesus they're touching God somehow I know what they're doing and I want to do the same thing Lord I want to enter that same presence praying we're not making up a game we're talking reality right here right now you're sitting here either whatever you know and you say well and I don't mean to be harsh but you say well I come in here and I've read two chapters in The Bible well have you ever taken one of these or read a chapter and have the word of God come alive for you God puts it all together for an understanding you know where you came from you know where you're at that's where we're at and I don't mean to be critical but I am trying to discuss these things today that that will touch our heart and life we know he lives people say to me sometimes well you know I'm looking for something to happen friends I am too how many of you were born with an appetite to want to see things maybe you wanted to have a lot of money maybe you wanted to have people like you and you did things all through your early days to grow up to that hour come to church and people know you because you got a good attitude this is the thing that we're talking about in our heart and life is what God has done to us and I believe that's what he's trying to fill our heart I believe there's a rapture but if God does certain things maybe I'm still living maybe God could still use me and then I know who he is and he knows who I am and for me to bow my knee down and raise my hands and say God I need to talk because I want to touch God that will touch my daughters I want to touch God that will touch my business isn't that what you want and well there's something to matter desperation has set in on you well that enemy has caused us to look around and what are we going to do but I heard the preacher say something about how a preacher got touched and God sent squirrels in boy if I could get like that my life would be changed if we could get like that we'd be shouting around here tonight imagine not critical just being honest with you so as we look at the word of God and I got some things I'd like to if I could read I believe that God planted us I believe God has delivered us and I believe that that see I believe people in young and old want to get deeper in God friends you want to know him you say he's a savior that he is he saved you before the foundation of the world he brought you forth under the power of God friends you need to get a little more picked on this thing you get a little more extraordinary how did he die how did he live how did all these things come on and I'd like to take and read a couple of these things here if I can to make you aware of this because what I'm really interested in and becoming more aware of actually what's happening even right now that I'm not being stirred I don't have a tear dripping down my cheek because I don't live like maybe I oughta I don't have a shout in my heart which ought to be there because of who I am and I think about people that would love to go into a vision and would see things from God in a vision and have God talk to you and of his own way I think that's exactly what we want to do in our own life I want to see him alive I want to see him moving on people's lives you say well brother Mike that's not but you see I'm going to read this and I'm going to tell you what he saw and I'm going to tell you something if you're not enthused about what you saw he'll never pay no attention to you you got to get excited because there is a real living God that loves you okay you believe that and if anybody's going to brag about it it ought to be me and it's it's uh I don't care it can help what people think and what I do I got issues in my life uh you might say and my wife and husband and everything else is going on what wouldn't I like a a real talk with God I I'd like to see what I could do to maybe bring a health to my family give my kids where they want to serve God give my wife to where she's happy get my husband to wear uh uh and and there's no desire we get to a place that that we just live like that and I believe that there ought to be a shout in this Camp there ought to be people under the anointing of the camp and uh I think that that whenever you get up and walk out of here in the morning I think sometimes in my prop you know it's it's tough to just to walk out of the house of God with the power of God in the house of God I lost into I listened to the singer and I mean he strains to get them songs out huh he may not think if I would know him I'd do my best to sing them along with you that one that you're saying tonight I've lived unto them all my life and easy to sing and easy to put the power to it easy to put the thrill within it that's what we're talking about here and when you get so enthused with God that's the way it is when you get up amen we begin to look for God and begin to see God moving and dealing in our our heart and life and I don't care how old you're getting or how else friends surely you got a deeper call surely there's something inside you that makes you want to be a real partner in the things that God has for us you tell me this church don't need partners you tell me this church don't need helpers you're telling me they don't need God aware it sure does and you say well how are you picking on them I'm just naturally we just learned to live a normal life I want to be on fire and if I'm saying wrong things may God help me to say them and a lot of things to say now remember this is a sermon that's called desperation and brother Brown starts out this he said the same thing as a token now I'm going to talk to you about a token how many of you got the token well that's not all that's not good because you need the token to prove that you have the Holy Ghost you say brother my how could I get that right now I don't know but if you get bothered enough I might want to turn right around sit right down or get down in that chair and raise these hands and tell God God you sent that and it's out here somewhere it ought to be coming to me today a lot of people today and and even in our Christian experience they were going back to some of my study in my reading and it's been many years 50 years of it at least and my brother was the one that first typing all these human brother Roy back East sermons but I want to read this to you here as part of this lutherans allowed it they just say you got the token how you doing you go to church you got the token but you see and we say the same thing until you get a revelation on what the token is it's a lot of things in church when you get a revelation in here with the power God touches your life and something would change you that fast I'll guarantee you God raise the dead change the life and change a lot of things in in people's lives he said accepting the word accepting Christ as a personal savior and you and the Methodist said well when you get happy enough to shout that's it and the Pentecost said speak in tongues I remember a few months ago brother you preached on tongues I believe in speaking in tongues I don't know about interpretation but when God comes by sometimes my heart just melts and I find a language that I can reach God to talk to him but the thing of it is as we read here spoken in tongues so people that speak in tongues or live that way you see that's what comes off of their life and we're talking about this life we're talking about something that God has set up the prophet of God you know and I I marked he's telling something on the church called the Hebrews book the Hebrews book was Paul but Darren brother branham's preaching he would he'd stand up and said and God said that he'd meet you and the thing of it is that all of a sudden people would stand up said how do you know that he won't and brother Brown said that's no one but God here at the age 33 years old and he's the one and he says he stood right there in the presence of that man that made that statement and talked to his Prophet for the hour and set the issue correctly and he said something else about the rock that the brother talked about the fountain in the rock and the man said in this saint Soul he was a churchgoer and all of a sudden that man about 30 years old which was he said no one less than God the voice of brother Branham said you telling me that God will come to uh wouldn't that be nice today have to know that for some reason God wants to hear what's going on here I'll tell you something you can't start living for God and getting up into God you're going to be a lot better than just paying your tithes it's going to be a real walk with God and as that's why I'm I'm reading this is that people claim well I speak in tongues that don't mean you got it and that's of course a lot of things that's being preached to our ears is that things are going on today that that that are not meeting the quota and I'm thinking dear God help us I I I don't know how to tell people all I can do is is tell them let me go on here because I believe anybody that knows brother branuman loves him and knows he was talking to God and talking to God about some squirrels talking to God about those things I believe that and you know what I'd say I say dear God I would sure like to do that now I don't know about squirrels but I would like a visitation girls is that not true wouldn't you like something to get a hold of you so much that you begin to see something that that and and you see here when you when you fall among that you'll see things that are unbelievable for you to see and it's God how many of you can look and see a devil or a naked woman on something nobody well believe it or not you can see them and the thing of it is you can either call it what it is or you can say I enjoy looking but I'm telling you what it's it's wrong and I'm telling you what we're talking about here about the things of God it says and you go to the railway and all of you probably have read this and you say well I want to go somewhere so what you have to do you have to buy a token so what you do is that you walk up and say I want to go to Chicago okay that'd be four hundred dollars okay here's the token so what he does he walks down the street and if somebody said where are you going what are you looking for I'm looking for the train from Chicago how do you know I got the token how you know where you're gonna sit I got the token when a guy goes up there with the 400 they can't take them so we have to so we find out here as we look at this the railway uh has paid and what they say it's all taken care of that's what the the man says I'll take you to Chicago I'll take you anywhere because now I got the token so when you got the token Brethren you got to Victory and if you don't have the token tonight if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the god in our life it's not what it ought to be and if I'm being critical please forgive me because you see in my heart I want to see miracles in God and the thing of it is is I'm telling you what the man you loved is the one that said this Indiana costs talking about that he said now the company puts a token so that see now things you do you go down and somebody purchases the fair going on with that he says give you the token that gives you the right on the rail till uh it's uh donation whatever the train goes it it gives that's what it does because it's got to talk of whatever the tree the train has got it gives to you then it follows here if the spirit of God dwells in you so does the power dwell in you it ought to heal the sick and ought to touch this it ought to touch that is that right if you can look around and see and look around and believe the case of the blood and the token literally how many of you know do you have the blood of Jesus Christ in your life and it has to be applied because it's otherwise it's just a chemistry so if you read it on the fall on the Bible or somewhere you say well that's just a chemistry I want the reality I want to touch you God I want the blood of Christ on me amen I I want what God's got for me and these things that we're being taught is what makes people come up with questions let me go on here and read it and it goes on to say and to make it a perfect one the whole judge in other words the whole judge come up God from Heaven become everything judge jury attorney hey and the words there where it came and it gives unto them eternal life so when you get that you get eternal life how many got eternal life he said now the Greek he said I know I'm talking to Scholars two or three and uh the word of God there is Zoe and that's God's own life God's own life and I will give unto him Zoe that's you and I God's own life of course they don't do nothing huh but it does it'll look through the clouds and look everywhere desperation sets in and you'll never touch it till you get desperate it says and in the life that was in Christ is the Holy Ghost uh not the third person it's the same person it's the same form over the holy ghost coming upon you as a token coming upon you as a token let me just stop that just a moment but what happens is is that people comes down here and they talk about I got tongues well he said you buy a pair of shoes and how many of you got a set of tongues in the right and left foot huh and so he's talking about after you're getting a foot that way and that's not the way God intended the foot to happen to you is it for you to put on a pair of shoes with a foot in it and the thing of it is is because he wants your life changed and made over like his and so as you begin to read this we begin to see that that God desired you and I to have in our life the things that God would have and I think to myself then Lord no more tongues for me no more that I'm not worried about shoe lasses anymore I'm not worried about this anymore whatever you type it about I want the Life of Christ I want a death burial Resurrection I want the overcoming conversation I want the victory place to me I want to walk with it talk with it Shout with it under the power of almighty God I don't care if you're young I don't care if you're old but that's the promise that way you can say I got the token and that's where God knows and if you look back here a little bit his Boy comes up his boy says Daddy I hear something he said that's why I got the lamb he said I couldn't hardly fight her but I bought the lamb here let me open the door blood all over everything on the door he said that's because he said either get the blood on that or there's going to be trouble and he said well Daddy well how come you're eating all that kind of food he said it's because he told me to eat this kind of food and so this the boy he's standing Daddy what am I going to do he said you're my son and because of my birth and because of what I'm doing and where I'm doing it now makes it all right that you're gonna make it too because it's all taken care of if you don't believe I'll open the door again you can look at the blood and when that death angel passes through that City he's going to see that blood when he Hollies your name he's going to see that chicken or whatever it is you're waving around in your hand there's going to be things going on desperation ought to tell us hey there ain't no chicken hey there ain't nothing happening I'd like to hear a little more amen but I'm being serious with you because I believe it tonight to be the truth and as you you move over into this he begins to prove your love and it's not the answer to everything there's other ones but what makes this this makes me God this gives me eternal life huh this this ought to put a uh unless you're cold or indifferent but if if you get excited it ought to say hey don't get tennis shoes like that with those tongues and those that and and that way get God in there let let God baptize you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the reason that you're baptized I don't know if there's anybody here today that has not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if I was you I'd make a track as close as I could to get that thing done in our life amen I want to make sure it's not father son Holy Ghost I want to make sure it's not something else I want these things done correctly and you say why brother Mike because you see something that's why I'm preaching this I think and I listened to my brother preach Sunday talking about the kingdom and the power and presence of God and how the god deals with people and I I think that's what we're talking about and if anybody wants to be that way I do honestly I do I want to see something different I want to see something here we got 400 people in here bound to have sick people bound to have problems bound to have issues bound to need God bound to need him and then your family and these ladies I'm not talking about them but Sonny there's a lot of women in here and I asked myself God do they are are they aware of what's happening are they aware there's a Resurrection coming as Anything could happen at any time we ought to stay alert amen and the thing of it is is that reading this you go from what he's talking about here and you begin to move on here desperation and then you work on desperation all of a sudden you begin to change and you get that you say well I love them but you can tell people don't love people when you love people God knows you love them when you love God God knows it amen and I think the world whatever it is that we need more of the love of God it's not that we're in love with the neighbor kid or whatever it is we're talking to God Amen when you love him you depart from those other issues you could you can talk honestly it's it's legitimate and brother Branham you know he goes on and he says Lord he said I got a second squirrel and he said he belongs right down there he said I don't have no squirrel he said just say the word and he's saying now here's another thing that I want to jar you with is that he's moved upon this don't have nothing talking to God about squirrel and God says to him he said well you remember when you was hunting and you remember when you said in the name of the Lord let that squirrel come down through there and you did something or whatever it is that you did so don't say about looking at a new one for me he said because it's already there and he looked up there and there come that squirrel down there and he jumped there with uh with uh can't not cancer but uh sometime if you touched it you get a disease on you I can't hear you and the thing of it was he said God a squirrel Will Never Land in that atmosphere because it's it's contaminated with a lot of stuff and down that root Mountain come that squirrel made that turn went over here jumped up in there among all those weeds and all that stuff and he stood there and brother Brown said I can't shoot him he's a virgin and I say boy if I could just get that deep enough my prayer life would come so much real huh and I would say Lord I gotta talk I'm not wearing no more of these tennis shoes I'm changing I'm meaning God and the thing of it is is that we begin and he looks at that and and he thinks to himself so the conversation goes off he takes his rifle and shoots that squirrel he said I looked up and saw his eyes were black he shot him always always in the world in the eye and so he goes on about his business and he's bye bye to God and all of a sudden God speaks up to him he said hey you asked for three and I would ask you hey you that's running home didn't you ask God to talk to you and you might say well brother Mike you know we don't maybe we just need to get out or all I'm telling you is that's what God Said you require three of them and now you're getting in the car with two of them and what's the problem okay so I'm telling you you said you like to get deeper and dips in the power of God now I don't know where that's going to take you but there is a God that can make you ready for the hour I don't know how many of you tonight where the Holy Ghost have got troubles how many of you got maybe one or two not a few troubles attitude sometimes I got problems along some of those lines and I'm looking at that and we're living for God we come and go as we please and all the time would bother me and I wanted to say that if they fill a whole house let us not go home without talking to God about the need in our lives and the requests that we have wouldn't that be wonderful amen I don't care you don't to me it's not money you can get money anywhere but it's him and the young ladies you need to talk to somebody that knows tomorrow talk to him you know there's a man somewhere or a lady I got girls I got four girls and the thing is I say the same thing that that looking for God to be for what God would be and I've been a roofer all my life and uh but my life has been my desire is to know God better than anything else and that's all my reading I've read you need the token you need the token you need the token but it's like this man's boy went home and said hey Daddy you know things have changed so let me move on again he says well who said what are you going to do he said it ain't mine so he goes up there and he gets that third squirrel again and he takes it home with him in a couple days later he's talking about him and and I hope I'm not insulting you but he's talking about these him doing this I asked God about the squirrels well brother burning them you know being who you are sir you should have just Zapped it no no no I had a something on me what turned God to do something about what I was doing or to me I have to answer these questions to myself how many of you talked to God and all of a sudden you have to turn around and start talking to God and he'll tell you that well the reason the problem of it is you're not really interested and if the problem was here's what you do about it and if you ask what you will it will be finished well Lord you say that then why don't you believe what I said I'll tell you why you don't believe what I said and first thing you know we get educated and I'm saying this if this church can realize the request that's on your heart that is yet to be touched and you're when a win is ever going to happen and I'm saying those things for me when are you going to touch my little girl back in back back way back when are you gonna touch this one down here I I don't know Lord but you know I got a right to talk to God like we're talking I don't want to be able to leave the presence of God without me talking to God Amen and I'm not interested in a dollar bill I'm interested in the Revival I'm interested in getting God in my life he saved me I want to be a savior I want to be a Christian I want to be what God would have me to be I want to come into a church with a thousand people on it and shake hands with people and pray for them while I'm shaking and they may not ever know it but by the power of God God will heal them anyway for it so he's thinking about this as we would think why don't God do this why don't God do that why would God say that why would God say that that's why I mentioned to you today about while he's having a business saying a man walks in about 33 years old and says if you were knowing god you'd know who it was and sure enough it was God standing there telling William Branham that it was the truth and uh a lot of those things could go on God could stay with us during the day and never know it if you weren't careful okay so anyway as we begin to read and I looked around and I said God that was you and I said I I thank you for this now I'll go on out and he said well he said don't you doubt what you say you say you get three that's where that they'll be there the next time he said and I thought well if I'm Dreaming I'm going to continue to dream okay so he goes home with his problem so I said today I picked out the old pass over there of the trees and there was a wrapped up in that poison oak and he said you never get a squirrel in poison oak so I said the next one will come right out here Poison Ivy and uh set that young squirrel looking right at me and he said I set my gun down and he said I rubbed my eyes I turned around again I thought there it is he said turn his head sideways and I shot the squirrel and uh the squirrel died but said you said he said you said three and he's going over this let me just skip it but I don't know how long we've been but he's out there with a meeting with some people sister Hattie Wright and the family was the one that made the wine for communion and so he's out for a couple days trying to figure out why in the world these things would happen to him like they did and he walks in there and she's making a cheese a chili cobbler for him and she said I like us rabbit if you could he said I'll get him right now went out and shot the rabbit brought him in sat down to eat and they shot indeedy all of a sudden he stands up you know what I don't understand he said there's your sister over here needs a healing here's this issue over here needs this he said and the thing of it is he said I can't figure out about those three squirrels now everybody sat there because they didn't know what was going on is that right he said sister how do you write whatever you would say he said now you know your daughter needs a healing but he knew her life wasn't going to be long I don't know what all the situation was but all of a sudden he turns up to God and he said what I need sir is my boys need salvation she said well how could he say that is because the leadership of God put the request on him and the thing of it was it it moved Brethren Branham for the for that because those boys immediately and you know if you read this the deal they immediately surrendered their life to Christ and the thing of it was is that he was bothered with the thought and when he brought up the prying or the questioning she gave an answer to what she's bothered by and God answered her father and I think about yourself and mine I think dear God that's what I need I need this man to get a few things straightened out more so than worried about getting everything else straightened out he said well even Abraham brought his boy up to the top of the mountain he said Jehovah Jireh he called him Jehovah Jireh where would you think of that somebody called you Jehovah Jireh I never saw him in my life how would I know who he is so he tells his boy he said that I got off of you as a sacrifice but then all of a sudden the manifestation of the Jehovah displayed itself and they searched over the mountain to find their sheep and couldn't find any and all of a sudden when he looked around for a moment there was that sheep took his boy off the altar brought the Sheep down there did the thing that God I say today if we would touch God and were moved upon by God by the things that's touching Our Lives what a difference it ought to make in our life amen if God hears our requests what a change we begin to make in our life and my time's running out but what you do is is that you live imagine knowing people you're sitting here and you say well I got a problem and you say Lord It's not that it's me or somebody a preacher will stand up here and maybe he'll say something to you and then you'll answer the question well my real problem is not worried about those squirrels I gotta touch God for something else dang friends how many of you really know how sharp he is and how he lived and how he lives today to take care of you or I and to return the pages we can tell you more about the same things that happen and what you're here tonight you hear me telling you about something that you're thinking about you can either regard it or you can pass it away may God help us today to realize one of the first things I think we ought to look at it's time to go home and you better get right it's time to set up if there's issues take them out and you could do here that's page five okay we turn over here to page seven you ought to hear it and then all of a sudden something else happens on page 13. and the thing of it is is because people are unaware of what's going on around about them and all I'm telling you today is is that God wants to do things for us and you say Amen to that I mean how many of you are open to the door that want to hear God tell you something no matter how many people fill the building or how many is not over the building it's between you and him you love him you tell him now you say well if he could hear me friends he hears so you're telling Lord I love you with all my heart sir do you know it and you look at the word of God he tells you will he said you know if you want your wife to love you you tell your wife you love her and then you set out with her sometimes at the table and you start making love to her is she becoming more convinced or not she thou would say man are you in love with me and I know that but he said it I didn't say it that's what a man does a man does and and does that and she sits there until she actually something happened to him well what happened to you well I've heard if I didn't start doing better I may not ever have a wife here and if I didn't start paying attention the way things were going on in my life things may not be just like they ought to be here you know how carnal Mike how cold and different to have something like that I don't care how dead it sounds it feel when somebody comes by and says hey you're looking good just say thank you when they come by with the criticism you say oh I'll try and do different and all through the Bible that and and these books that you begin to read still definition and Elijah were talking about and things that he did and things that he followed God may it be the same when God did certain things I was there huh here we are today and I say in the name of Jesus Christ you know what he did he told Israel he said now when you when uh the king comes over here he's going to take you all home all back to Babylon but he said after you're there for 70 years Elijah or not Elijah but Joshua could be wrong on that he said you tell those people at 70 years old I'm going to turn them loose and they're going to come back and when they come back I'm going to send you after them I mean have you take them back to their land and I said to myself you imagine a man knowing that a Cane's going to take you 70 years there and the promise is given to you in 70 years I'm going to send him back to you and Jeremiah is going to be there to make sure if you go past it I'll find you and I'll send you back but I'm going to guarantee you I'm going to take you back home children now that's a pretty good answer you said well that's 70 years old brother Mike you know it don't make no difference this is home may God help us amen be touched by the feelings that we have in our life amen we look too much to man I think I do and a doctor told me you're going to die I said well I don't mean to be nasty but I serve a living Christ and I know he can pick up an ash and make something out of it he can make my life different as far as I know I've been a year instead of a month alive and said of the things that's going on nothing's going on I can't talk too good that I got a pastor who loves me I got life behind us you know that that help us you know if you listen to brother Ron he'll tell you what he did as a young man because it serves something to his life could I hear you say something that may serve to your life we get together sometimes and don't say nothing like that it's just uh but then I just say you got no problem you got tennis shoes on you got a nice looking pair of shoes and socks and everything else you'd be better off without it so I want to turn the service back to whoever's supposed to get it may God bless you may you look ladies gentlemen whoever you are may you strive at home go in and shut the door whatever God God I wanted to meet you now I'm going to meet you in heaven but is there a chance that I could see you here could you make my wife feel better could she make a little better we got babies out here crying changing friend all you need is one look all's well bang it just takes place may it help you may your life get shook like Hannah's did you mean to tell me I'm released he said yes what would you say and she said I want my boys as far as I know they're still saved God bless you would you stand with me please amen you see when you hear those stories and there's something about it and it stirs your heart how do you write she believed what he was saying she said that's nothing but the truth and that pleased God what about your life what about something that you could say [Music] I know that God is real I know what God has done in this hour I know he said he lied to the prophet I've heard his voice and I know it's nothing but the truth amen and I don't have to try to figure it out I don't have to try to debate it and I don't have to try to defend it God defends his own message amen yes praise the Lord brother Mike one of these days I want him to tell you the testimony of him being there in Los Angeles in the congregation when he preached choosing a bride he was there he saw it [Music] yes brother Branham as he was being led out by Billy Paul and there was people at the altar and all kinds of stuff going on he told Billy he said what did I say and you know if you hear it on tape brother Ram said it was three days later those State boys got and played the tape for him and he said oh my I didn't realize it I would like to see more and more that the men that stand behind this Pulpit have the anointing of God so strong upon him that it's no longer them speaking but it's God speaking through them and we see more of the Supernatural and we see things happening in our lives huh somebody say Amen because that I desire it ever since I heard this message and I was 18. yeah Sandy you know one thing I've looked for rapture it's not this year it'll be next year it's not next year it'll be the next year I've only got one thing in my heart and that is I want to be right I want to be pleasing to God and without faith it's impossible to please you I want to sing that song um pleasing let me be pleasing amen because Saints have gone if the faith of Jesus Christ doesn't move upon us and we don't have the Revelation how can we please him otherwise it becomes rules regulations Creeds dogmas I want to serve a living God one who Thrills me one who reveals himself to me and I get so excited huh that I want to manifest the life of Jesus Christ Amen brother Mark help me with this song here please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

he said you believe God loves you you believe that he called you before the foundation of the world do you believe that there's either neither life nor death nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things that come they can separate you from the love of God then what are you worried about we ought to get happy I was reading today brother Brennan in the sermon God being misunder God be misunderstood and he says get happy he says all of God's children are misunderstood you think everybody's gonna understand you why sometimes I don't understand myself and the thing is God knows he knows who you are where you're at the things you're going through amen uh one more song he wasn't looking at me when he took me in remember that song all right he wasn't looking at me [Music] that was
