there is a channel Amen brother walner talks about the seventh seal and then brother Gregory talks about uh the the new name and being set free and we're alive because he's alive amen I do have a lot on my plate this morning but I have one thing that I'd like to share with you we have had some nominations of deacons and trustees and if those Deacon those new nominees brother Tim Hofer Brothers Zach Lovell is not here but Ethan Strayer as a trustee in Matthew vasaki if you guys will you Brethren will come forward now I'd like to introduce you here to the congregation they will be as nominees in their positive Duty for one year they'll see how it fits for them and we'll see how we fit to them and then a year from now we'll vote them in and ordain them brother Tim Hofer is going to be one of our Deacons and Zach Lovell I think he's over in Scotland right now so he's not here Ethan Strayer one of our trustees and brother Matthew vasaki so we want to welcome them and we want them to serve in the capacity that God has placed them in and all of you welcome them with a great Round of Applause God bless you thank you brother God bless you and I have also um I have asked brother Stephen McNeely to become my associate pastor amen foreign amen amen amen now the reason that I have done this is because as a church body in the event of whether the pastor um you know passes away or re retires or resigns or for whatever purpose all of the above um uh you would never as a church be left without somebody to kind of steer the ship and again at that time that doesn't automatically make him pastor that puts him in a position and I would say probably about a year later they would look and if it fits uh then there would be a voting if it doesn't fit well then uh you as the body will continue on with the deacons and different ones to stay in that position until God raises somebody up within that capacity so brother Stephen God bless you I told him I want him with me in the pre-service back there uh to and but I said it's not necessary for him to sit up here and he can go and sit with his wife now and help take care of the kids so anyway God bless you brother Stephen foreign [Applause] amen please be in prayer for our anniversary meetings brother Andreas ring and will be coming over from Germany to be here with us we've made that announcement and also we have a baptismal directly after service and as even as brother Robert has said if you are in question or if you have never settled that in your mind I want you to know now is the time I believe what God is doing now as he's compelling them to come in amen it's it's something that God is doing amen all right let's all stand together if we could the tomb now is empty the Stone's been rolled away I know we sang that before I just feel to to sing that okay the two now is empty [Music] is alive in my heart [Music] so far or Christ is alive in my heart now it's empty the soul is rolled away I cries into light in my heart [Music] in me in a heart or cry the light in my heart may God bless you all let's just remain standing turn with me into your Bibles please Luke 24 thank you musicians each and every one we appreciate all of the gifts that God has placed within the body amen Luke 24 verses 1 through 12. how can you come on Easter Sunday and not talk about what happened on that first Easter you definitely but I don't want to leave it 2 000 years ago God help us to fast forward to see what God is doing now amen can you just imagine now they had walked with him heard him preach they have been baptized they've been preaching the gospel but their Messiah has been crucified they thought this was him but they watched him die it wasn't rehearsed in their minds that he said destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up they didn't have all of this stuff in their mind all of the events were clouding their mind with unbelief but regardless of the unbelief of the hour God still fulfills his word Luke 24 verses 1 through 12. now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the Sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulcher now stop there for just a moment because there was a guard set over the tomb it was sealed with a Roman seal so events are happening and these guys are coming to the tomb and here my the stones have been rolled away and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed they're about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the Dead he is not here he is risen remember now he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered in the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again now they are reiterating the prophecy that he spoke to them in Galilee trying to jog their memory of what has come to pass and they remembered his words and returned from the Sepulcher until all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest and it was Mary Magdalena and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which stole these things unto the apostles and their words seem to them as Idol Tales yeah yeah and they believed them not then it Rose Peter and I like Peter I'm gonna check it out myself then arose Peter and ran unto the Sepulcher and stooping down and be held the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wandering in himself at that which was come to pass may God add the blessing the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God I would like to turn in to the Book of Mark read another portion of scripture Mark 16 verses 1 through 14. and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalena and Mary the mother of James in Salome and brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him remember it was that because the Sabbath was come they had no time to bury him properly and very early in the morning first day of the week they came under the Sepulcher at the rising of the sun there's two sons Rising and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher and they looked and they saw the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the Sepulcher they saw a young man stand sitting at the right side clothed in long white garment and they were afraided and they saith unto them be not afraid ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell the disciples and Peter that goeth before you into Galilee there ye shall see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the Sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not my what kind of carnal Minds can get so troubled by the situations that we have a tendency not to believe God is fulfilling his word and after he appeared in another form under two of them as they walked and went in the country and they went and told it under the residue neither believed they them afterward he peered unto the eleven as they said at Mead and upbraided them with their unbelieving Hardness of Heart because they believe not them which had seen him after he was risen may God bless this reading of his word this morning I would like to title my sermon this morning his Rising caused another Rising and I'd like to take a subject of the god Gene is the resurrection Factor in every elect seed praise the Lord Saints he is risen and because he lives I live it was 22 years ago today we preached our first online service back in Maryland was the first one and we preached it it was a first service on the internet and I titled it I am the resurrection the subject of knowing him and the power of his resurrection now this month I also want to bring to your attention how many of you know there's a solar eclipse that is taking place here during this time there was a solar eclipse during that first crucifixion and Resurrection there is a solar eclipse now that is taking place again brother Branham said signs in the heavens are declaring what is happening on Earth I will tie that together here in a little bit so we know that gross darkness is covering the Earth and gross Darkness the people the sign is showing you how this gross darkness and who would have ever thought that people within just a few years would not have any kind of a concept intellectual people scientists people with knowledge don't even know what a gender of a woman and a man is gross Darkness the Bible says in all those whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be deceived you're seeing that deception a gross Darkness covering the earth and the minds of the people have gotten so degraded so degenerated until sin and debauchery are all around us but I don't want you to to look on those things and let them trouble you for Jesus said these things must come to pass but look up for your Redemption draws nigh Hallelujah today is Easter Sunday and the world is taking time to acknowledge that there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem many churches and denominations are having plays they have Angels they have the tomb and the disciples and the whole thing and many people are brought the resurrection as an uh entertainment as though it was just an event from over 2 000 years ago but may I say this I don't want to leave him 2 000 years ago because when he rose there's another Rising because when they had Rises the body follows are you with me so it's not that we worship a historical event brother Branham said it was the greatest event in history it was greater than the creation it was greater than the crucifixion he paid the price at Calvary he was a man that was crucified he was a man when they drove the nails into his hand he was a man that cried out Eli Eli Lama Suboxone my God why have you forsaken me he was a man when he said it is finished but on the third day he was more than a man he was God himself I came from God I go back to God amen the resurrection is the single most prominent important event in all of Christianity and it separates our religion from all of the other religions of the world because when he arose on that first morning he proved who he said he was brother Graham said in greatest news flash in history so it was a great time them glorious 40 days how I would have loved to have been there but then thinking again that I'd have had to have been a believer because he did not appear to no one but is elected Church he only appears to believers and as he was then he cannot change today he only appears to his elected Church Believers what makes you different from honey everyone else I believe Believers believe but he had a church that was elected so he has tonight and that's why he left off from the last evening the elected church and then he appeared to his elected church only the rest of them did not recognize him and if he was here today he would just do the same thing that he did then appeared to the elected believer he never appears to the unbeliever I want to say that he changes not and this same God set a pattern years ago and he reveals himself to the elect he said my sheep shall hear my voice and a stranger they shall not follow there is actually no other historical event that is celebrated more than the resurrection 52 times a year we here at evening Light Fellowship do not come here and talk about a historical God but we come here and we celebrate a resurrected Christ and we recognize that he came out of history and he and he brought forth a prophet from Malachi 4. behold I send you Elijah how many of you can say I've seen the Elijah I've heard I know in my heart that God once again fulfilling his word and you what does that make you when God opens your eyes what does that make you when you see what God is doing bringing his prophecy to pass in this hour that makes you part of that elect group Hallelujah not stuffed shirts not somebody that goes to boasting because I tell you when God opens your eyes and Grace shows you these things you say oh God who am I that you would allow my eyes to see what kind of a person am I I'll tell you let me just bring you forward right now you're a God person you're a God seed you're a god-elected God predestinated elect group let me tell you because you got the god seed in you you couldn't miss it possible Muhammad Buddha Hare Krishna great religious leaders of of the world became Godlike because of their teachings they were men that because of some kind of elevated enlighteness or philosophy they became a god-like status but ours was God who became man Hallelujah he was God he came from God and he went back to God those others their bodies are still with us today they're in their tombs not ours amen now we are we know that this time of year now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna elaborate on this because I've done it in years past we know that at this time of year as well as Christmas that the date is has no Biblical reference or significance for us to celebrate what is called Easter in fact Easter the name Easter is not found in the Bible so this holiday or holy day that we celebrate as Easter and as Christmas is actually not found in the Bible and so therefore we realize that the things that the world celebrates today as Easter and they've replaced god with the Easter Bunny with Easter eggs and all of those things I'm not going to go into that because I we are so far beyond that can you say Amen to that okay isn't it ironic that both Christmas and Easter the most prominent um holy days of the Christian church the neither of them are found in the Bible I thank God that we had a prophet that came and he revealed to us the word of the hour bringing the Christ who is historical out of History and told us that he's Hebrews 13 and 8. for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in Revelations 19 verse 10 the Bible says and I fell at his feet to worship him and said unto him see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren to have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now remember that the Bible says that men of old were moved on by the Holy Spirit and as they speak they speak under the utterance of the holy spirit is that correct and scribes wrote that down it became the word of God these men did not understand what they were prophesying they didn't understand the things that they were writing down Behold a virgin shall conceive they had no idea that it never happened before but let me tell you God doesn't ask you to try to understand it he just asked you believe it somebody say I believe yes of course why you're a believer he doesn't reveal himself to unbelievers so that is your testimony having the spirit of Prophecy the spirit will always Quicken the word for its season God and Quicken Noah in his season he quickened Moses with a word in his season God quickened the disciples in their day with it in a season and God has quickened us he has quickened us with a word in its season you see we do not have to make a pilgrimage back to the tomb to believe we don't have to go back to Egypt and look where the Exodus took place and pharaoh and Moses and you know the story We're Not Looking Back to find artificial uh artifacts of events we don't need to go find Noah's Ark to believe there was an art but we're going to go to where the word is being quickened for this hour we're looking to a word-born bride that has come to her position let us go to the place because the prophet of God said there is a god-ordained place of worship that is in Christ let's go to the place where Angels still appear place where angels are declaring prophecy being fulfilled being quickened to somebody and say this day is the scripture being fulfilled that ordained place is called the holy of holies the heart of the Bride of Jesus Christ Where Angels are still declaring he is risen we're not going back to an unsealed tomb where Christ had risen but we're going back to the place where the unsealed Mysteries of the word you talk about a seal broken back then let me just bring you to seal broken again in this day Hallelujah he said this seventh angel he's got no particular mystery he's got no particular thing but he takes what the others probed at all down Through the Ages puts it together this belongs here Luther here Wesley penny cost and there he puts the parts that men Godly men that probe that and there before our wandering eyes the whole picture of the Redemption the whole mystery of God you see Adam when he was first formed and men had been made out of the Dust of the year and he was put to sleep when Eve came she was the mystery of Adam revealed do you understand this bride is the mystery of the second Adam revealed the mystery the seal being torn off they first had a Christ now it's the bride of Christ they had the first coming and now we have a second coming yet it's Christ the resurrection is not just in an event or a special place it's an appearing it's a spiritual awakening to every believer isn't it amazing that we hear in our news today about all of this woke generation and I'll tell you just a few years ago we would have never thought that the people's mind would be so woke that they would be lulled asleep they have no morals they have no concept of what is right is wrong when you catch revelation It's actually an appearing to you I want you to let that sink in when the word of God is quickened to you by the Holy Spirit it brings forth another Rising because as he arose she's Rising why the body must follow the head we can see Christ in the Old Testament prophets we can see Christ down through history Satan is not afraid of a historical Christ you can talk about Jesus of Nazareth you can talk about he was born crucified resurrected as long as you put him in a past tense he doesn't care if you talk about the Pentecost of 1906. he doesn't care if you talk about what an anointing there was in the prophet's Ministry as long as you got looking back in the rear view mirror brother bran said to look in the rear view mirror uh he said you're going to crack up listen We're Not Looking Back we're looking forward there's future events made clear by prophecy The Same Spirit that uttered the prophetic word it's the same Spirit that's got to be on every believer to make you understand this day this scripture is being fulfilled this end time message has jettisoned so far forward from 2 000 years ago to a god of History excuse me to a god of present tense and out of History the bride has been awakened by the seventh Angel's voice just as God did everything in the Book of Genesis and when God began to create the heavens and the Earth and God said let there be light and there was light and God said and it happened and God said why because everything that it was ever created was created by the quickened voice of God there why would it be any different than today for you to be here in this hour to hear a voice and let me tell you let's go beyond the voice of William Branham he said God is using my vocal cords but he said the voice that anointing it's no longer I it's not William Branham that's speaking to you this is almighty God once all man and another saw God and they were both right but I tell you which one are you looking at this morning I say it was God [Music] that's nothing but the truth you start agreeing to that word you start lighting yourself up to it and that third poll the revealing of the word will give to you precious promises it may be something you haven't need in your family and you say that's nothing but the truth I give you your family you might have something that's going wrong in your life I give this to you in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] the seventh seal open unto us a mystery Secret let me declare to you there's all kinds of movies and different things The Da Vinci Code um you know uh the Raiders of the Lost Ark on and so forth all of these that are trying to find some kind of secret passage some kind of special formula to find where the secret passage is into the place that you want to find the greatest treasure the seventh seal unlocks to the bride the entire Bible it is the secret passage listen to God's only provided place of worship now sometime I'd like to come to Shreveport where we just have about two or three weeks just to take 30 minutes a night just on teaching seeing just stay right in the word these Secret passages you catch that I'd like to just stay here and teach on these secret passage all of a sudden you touch this door and see where we could find out just how to get in and you just watch you follow God's direction there's only one key to each door that's right no other key no matter how much it looks like God has no Skeleton Key just got one key and now you've got to have that key or the door won't unlock no matter how sincere you are you just can't unlock that door brother Bradham said what key is it that unlocks the door and that door is Christ he said the only way that you can understand it's not father son Holy Ghost when the key is turned and the door is unlocked and Christ that door you find out it's not father-son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus Christ enter in Matthew Mark Luke John are the four guardians of a secret passage and it takes faith to open that without that listen to me I want to call this key this appearing this quickening this Awakening I want to call it the resurrection Factor it is the element that must be identified in each believer before transformation for Enoch had this within himself before he was translated therefore telling us that we must have the same quickening power you're not getting the quickening power because you were raised in a message family you're not getting it because you're raised in a message Church you're only going to get it when you are birthed by the quickening of the revealed word of the hour Hallelujah that and that alone will transform you not to conform be not conformed I think over the years we have conformed a lot of church members we have conformed people to do this and to wear a dress and keep your hair long don't go to movies we've conformed them that means to mold Under Pressure but be not conform but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind Hallelujah that's what the power of transformation is it's that third pull it's in you it's that secret passage that the world knows nothing about we speak another language that the world cannot understand to them it is tongues but to you it has an interpretation what is it God revealing himself Colossians 1 verse 26 and 29. even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from Generations but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known god listen to whom God would make known no man gave you this Paul says I certify to you Brethren that this which I preach unto you was not given to be my man neither did I learn it by man but it was by the revelation of Jesus Christ to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus wherefore I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily his word is working mightily in me why it's Christ in you the seed Gene do you remember years ago brother Stephen love oh you got me a book called The God Gene remember that you gave it to me they said there is hardwired these are scientists they said there is hardwired into your genetic chromosome that you are hardwired to hear his voice it is called they call it the god Gene the prophet of God years ago said within each elect's seed is a sea Gene of God if you're a part of God you always were a part of God if you came from God you're going back to God I want you to understand that these which are called the elect of God have a supernatural quality it's hardwired you couldn't help it when you heard the voice of Malachi 4. I've heard that voice before yes you did this is not deja vu but I will say to you that if you heard the voice of God in this day you also heard it back in Eternal ages without this Factor you will never be changed in a moment you will never be raptured you will never be caught up together with them in the air but with it you can't miss it you can't I will substantiate that just hang on Romans 8 verses 10 through 11. if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him they raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised a Christ from the dead also shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you if the Same Spirit do you see that a prophet of God said that this promise of God is to the elect for the promise is unto you and to your children and your children's children what promise is that I send unto you the promise of the father I must go away but he said the promise cannot come until I go away and if I go away he the Holy Spirit of promise we'll come back to you what is it it's God evolving himself into another form it is God now in Martha God changing his mask going from a one-member party to a multi-membered body called the mystical body of Jesus Christ Quicken your mortal body all of them that were quickened by his voice were also quickened in the resurrection so the resurrection factor is not just a special event that takes place in history over 2 000 years ago for Christ was already the resurrection before the event took place he was the resurrection just waiting to manifest itself in due seasons Lazarus understand was already a part of the Resurrection by believing The Words of Christ for Christ is a resurrection factor for every believer he that half the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life Jesus said speaking to Mary and Martha we know our brother will rise again Jesus said he's sleepeth he said he shall rise again I know at the time of the resurrection and Jesus said now the some of the most astounding words I am the resurrection you talk about lock up a human hard drive oh I am the resurrection and he that believeth in me shall not die but shall have everlasting life for he cannot die I want you to understand when God hath quickened the elect seed inside of you you have been quick and you cannot die the devil can do all things oh yes you can die in this Mortal body but when it does that seed goes on it lives again it never dies it's Eternal you are as Eternal as God is eternal you can no more die than God could die here's something that's astounding brother Branham said that when Jesus Christ went to Calvary he went as a man the man Christ Jesus and said there in the Garden of Gethsemane he prayed o God let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done and brother Branham now here's a mystery we had never heard this before he said the spirit of God and how left the body of Jesus Christ and there they whipped him up the hill as a man there they crucified a man do you understand he suffered in bled and died as a man why because Adam was a man who transgressed and if because of man transgressed you see the first Adam he transgressed so now God okay has to come himself he's Jehovah Jireh God will provide himself as the sacrifice if I said okay there's a penalty and somebody's going to die and I said well I'm going to send Amos Amos you can die okay be that faithful obedient son would that seem to be fair but how about if God said a man must die it must be a kinsman redeemer he shall be born of my bone and flesh and he took the man Christ Jesus and he crucified him why because it was a man that sinned it had to be a man to be a kinsman redeemer but let's take it farther than just a man because he was the son of man but the body himself they're crucified was the man Christ Jesus even the Centurion wow and he saw him bow his head and died truly this was the son of God the tomb where Jesus was buried was empty that first resurrection morning it was a rising of the Sun the wave Sheaf the head of the body it was the only begotten son of Son of God brother Brown said in him that is in him Jesus Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily do you understand in him he was the seed he was the only begotten son of brother Branham said there at Calvary he said the seal which was Christ was broken and he said inside of his heart where that seed lies he said he emptied out that seed upon the Earth and he says and now okay Satan thought I got him I have crucified he who was the Messiah I have crucified him he's dead and gone but God pulled a trick on him he said except the corn of wheat dies it invites alone if he could have caught that Revelation he would have never let him be crucified but there he Spore he the Bible says and he spilled out his soul unto death and there planted down on this Earth was elect seed and it is to come in the decreed season you didn't come in the time of the first church age that was another season same seed another season but it went down through Ephesus and Smyrna and titira and came down into the most corrupt of all the ages and laudia Sia where man is miserable blind wretched and naked and doesn't know it boy if that doesn't talk about this age that we're in now and inside of the loudiestian church age was poured out seed and then the voice of this seventh angel when he should begin to sound not when he starts his ministry but when he begins to unveil the revealed word the third pull that's what I've got to be reverent to now watch Christ is the mystery of God revealed as the head was taken from the grave so must the body follow him back to Eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with the eternal life and the body must follow that because it is husband and wife again don't fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word because the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one hit you there's one headship that's Christ and the body only recognizes the thing the word the body must follow the head as the wife follows her husband how many believe that in the sermon I know brother Branham picks this up oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm so glad that I'm a part of Easter I'm a part of that Resurrection and we are a part of it this morning because in US dwells that Resurrection Life that as a partaker brought Easter I know my redeemer living you see it's the spirit of God moving in The Believer or it'll never bring forth that see Gene to fruition until it is quickened by the words of life therefore the spirit of God moves upon you it is overshadowing you just as Mary was overshadowed because she said how can these things be how this word I'm supposed to bring forth a Christ child how can it be knowing that I've known no man said in not many days hence the Holy Spirit shall over Shadow you and you shall conceive is that right that conception in Mary was of the Holy Spirit do you understand that the conception inside of you is no different than it was with Mary that conception [Music] is the Holy Spirit overshadowing you conceiving life without sensation it's not some emotion it's not something worked up in fact the only time that a woman knows the seed inside of her because she can be with a man many times receiving seed receiving seed receiving seed but if that seed does not germatized within every 28 to 30 days that seed is cast out of the body are you understanding we're talking about a cycle of a woman but when she is together with a man who has life and he imparts unto her a a germ of life and it takes place inside of her there's a pregnation how does she know she's pregnant there's a body change at the time of the impartation it might have been just like every other time a time of Union but until the faith is conceived to take the seed and to impart to it life but when faith comes to that field you are just a field and any farmer knows you can till the soil you can you can do it you can put fertilizer on it and everything but you must plant seed because every seed will bring forth of its own kind you did not become seed by the rebirth that's a wrong teaching no you were reborn because you were seated he said in non-seat follow this he said in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken what does that make you oh it must be the spirit of God moving on you it's not the wisdom of man it's not with the enticing words of man's Wisdom Apostle Paul said look I'm not going to come to you with enticing words of man's Wisdom but Empower and demonstration knowledge and intellectual teaching only causes a confirmation but the Holy Spirit causes a transformation I want you to understand Lazarus had the resurrection Factor already in him before he died John 6 verses 52 and 54 now the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then said Jesus on them fairly verily Ascend to you except you eat of the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last days you see he is rising causes her to write and I will raise him up I want you to understand this message has caused the rising how many of you can say Amen he caused me to rise up out of old cold carnal denomination out of carnal thinking out of all of that and because the carnal mind is enmity with God and neither can it know the things of God but when you began to catch the revelation of this you know what God was doing come up hither he was actually causing you to rise every Revelation that comes to you causes you to rise closer into the image of the sun Hallelujah do you realize this the sun crosses the sky and everything that is he doing he is ordained to life from that solar energy every plant The Rock feels the warmth of the Sun but it does nothing to the rod but make it warm and fuzzy but when that elects seed catches the solar energy and it comes over if it is either if it is ordained to eternal life it doesn't matter how many of you have been somewhere and they pour all of this concrete and and stuff and then there's just there's just a little line they're just a small little line and up comes the blade of grass how in the world it comes through all that concrete how did it survive how many of you have climbed the great mountains and you've gone up in rocks and Ledges and stone everywhere and all of a sudden there's a plant right on the edge I don't know who planted that how did it get up there there ain't no water they know huh how did it get there let me tell you everything ordained do eternal life when that sun when the son of man are you catching me this is the day of the revealing of the son of man when they came across your path it quickened unto you life and you didn't know it let me share something that came to me this morning in the Book of Revelation There is five takings of the book you like that let me show you Revelations 5 verses 5 through 7. one of the elders saith unto me weep not be Behold The Lion somebody say lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and then be held low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all there and he came and took the book you see that's the first time he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne the first time the book was taken what was it lion remember John in the Book of Revelation do you do you remember the first time it was that when the book of redemption was lost there was no man found worthy on Earth nor in heaven or on Earth no one was worthy to take the book in order to look there on and I John wept seeing no one was worthy but there was a voice behind me weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed then I turned to look at the lion and what did he see a lamb so watch this first one the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne that's the first taking of the book second taking in the book revelation 10. verses 1 and 2. Christ The Mighty Angel watch this now the lamb takes the book the angel which came down from heaven Revelations 10 1-3 and I saw another Mighty angel come down from heaven brother Ram said watch these angels one's a Heavenly Angel the others an Earthly Angel are we together follow along now clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head his face as it were the son his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little book opened and he set his Foot Right Foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice that's when a lion roared and when he cried seven Saunders uttered their voices do you see the mighty Angels coming down that a mighty Angels none other than the lamb who was Worthy took the book the third time Revelations 10 7-8 and the seventh angel takes a little book that had been sealed with the Seven Seals the seventh angel when he begins to sell and he finishes the mystery of God watch this Revelations 10 7-8 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound prophet of God says that word sound means to sell Pizzo the Greek word is to blast forth a trumpet it's a jubilee trumpet it's a trump to signify the Gathering Two Trumpets in The Book of Leviticus two silver trumpets one is for the Gathering the second trumpet is for the moving of the camp and the voice which I heard from Heaven spoken to me again go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea so the Earthly angel takes the book of the Heavenly angel are you following me watch the transferal of the book I love it now the little book is open before it was closed Revelations 5 it's closed Revelations 10 it's open let me say this it was not the propheto that opened the Seven Seals it was Christ because he is those seals because this book is called the Lamb's Book of Life it is the book of Redemption now the fourth time the book is taken Revelations 10 and 9. are we together you fall are you like this Revelations 10 9-11 and I went under the angel and said unto him here's John the elect bright give me the little book wow talk about an entitlement give me the book he didn't sit there and say may I please have the book no it's now he realizes that there's something inside of him said take the book so now he says give me the book he says it with authority why he knows his position every bride member knows their position under the seventh seal it is that secret passage it is a secret passage that opens the door which is Christ I said unto him give me the little bug he said unto me take it and eat it shall make thy belly bitter but Thou shalt be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the look the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up spiritual food in due season now they all must prophesy the ministry continues let me tell you the ministry of Malachi 4 did not stop when he went off the scene for thou must prophesy again before many people's Nations tongues and kings yet there's another taking of the book revelation 22. I didn't have a chance to write this down I it was coming to me so fast I just couldn't take it all so I'm just gonna go read it Revelations 22. are you are you enjoying this all right Revelations 22 verse 7. through 10 behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book follow the book and where it goes and I John saw these things and heard them and when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the the feet of the Angel which showed me these sayings and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God follow the book and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book sirs is this the time seal not it's been sealed up Daniel seal it up Isaiah write it not but now seal not the prophecy of this this book why the book's got to come forth do you understand the book is not a physical book person it's a people seal not the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand so now it's hidden in symbols this is the third pull this is what I've got to be reverent to it's not the first and second poll and the discernments and the sign in the hand and all of the signs and wonders no this is now the revealing of the word he said you can't teach it to him you try to teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things all you do is make carnal impersonation no this is not an impersonation this is the person in the nation are you following it is now the person of Jesus Christ in you the mystery of God the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the seventh seal unlocks the mystery of Christ The Mystery of God Hallelujah you understand it five times the book transfers and it's picked up also in First Corinthians 15 verses 50 through 54. now I say unto you Brethren and Flesh and Blood did not inherit the king that cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit encryption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep and we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall be shall sound in the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and shall be changed the Bible says in the twinkling of an eye scientists have said that's one tenth of a second in a twinkling just a little one-tenth because the Bible says in the Old Testament one tenth is Holy unto the Lord tithing one-tenth we could take you through the scriptures one tenth is Holy unto the Lord and so in a moment one tenth you see this Holiness unto the Lord shall not sleep and we shall be changed for this corrupt Upon Us must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption then this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass us saying that it is written death is swallowed up in Victory when he comes to take the bride off the Earth he's actually taking the book he's Redeeming the names that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life the book of redemption and the rapture he takes the book why because everybody whose names were written predestinated the elect of God that were written on the Lamb's Book of Life he's not leaving one here he's taking the book and when he redeems the book he takes the book what is it it's a bride I'm digging a bride it's mine it's those I have redeemed called The Secret catching away of the Bride questions answers after the brightest Rapture will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost now I see everything will be finished for the Gentile Church when the bride is taken from the Earth when the bride is taken from the Earth Christ leaves the sanctuary's day of mediatorial is over Rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary Goes Forth takes the book of redemption and claims everything he redeemed no more mediatorial work how many understand that I got it in one of the seals yeah the seals and Christ comes forth to claim his mediatorial work watch this the seed is not air with the shut that's why the Rapture the bride the White's virgin the called out the four ordained the elected God knew before the foundation of the world who would be saved and who would not be saved by predestination by foreknowledge he saw every member put every name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the church ever began Jesus come to save and to seek and save that which was on that book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and he redeemed us and all the names that was on that book was redeemed when he redeemed it it is the mystery of Christ in the church the resurrection Factor already inside of every elec seed now watch this Lord show us the father and it suffices up I have you to do with the tree you take the tree you plant it in the ground and then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink has to drink more than its portion and the more it drinks the bigger it swells up just pushes out limbs then it pushes out leaves then it pushes out blossoms then it pushes out apples is that right that's the way a Christian is we are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we are planted in Christ and we just drink drink and push out everything that we have need of for the Earthly Journey he's lying to you don't you believe that he's lying because everything you have need of for your Earthly Journey Divine Healing power of God all these other things in every individual is here that's received the baptismal Holy Ghost for you've planted in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir everything you have need of for this life's journey even the rapture okay is Right In You then I don't know about you but that just blew my little finite mind [Applause] I am the don't resent them follow along don't resend that the Rapture is in US now somebody say now now you ain't waiting for some kind of event way down here no we're waiting for the transpiring of it but it's in me huh it's in me why why because it's Christ in me in me oh I will prove it by the gospel those he called he justified those he justified he hath glorified Hallelujah then in heaven today we're glorified in the presence of right now I'm pushing out to it somebody say I'm pushing out so all I'm doing drink drink come to church drink drink drink all I'm doing pushing out Jesus on the inside push into the outside oh what a change in my life right I don't know about you but I'm enjoying this Christ the ministry of God revealed brother around said as the head was took from the grave so must the Bali follow him the body follow him back to Eden we're the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is re and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife somebody say Amen to that the wisdom men cannot produce this the teaching of the prophet's message cannot produce it you can teach all you want you can show this and that and you can say first pull second pull you can show all this you can put the graphs up here you can have all the timelines chronology and unless the holy spirit makes it real to you you sit there and go but when it's revealed to you I love to see Revelation strike somebody it's like a little kid in school the teacher teaches and no matter how good the teacher is until the student oh oh I mean it's amazing the teacher will say do you all understand that and there'll be just a few yeah yeah I get it is there any of you that don't understand it and you that sat there and didn't catch it are too embarrassed to say would you say that over again I don't get it because everybody else stupid Ronald el stupido no comprende the guy don't get it but you know what's nice is all of those around you that didn't get it when that guy raised his hand would you explain it again they're all going I'm glad he did it I'm glad he took the embarrassment so if you don't get it I'm here to tell you I'll say God go over it one more time God reveal it to me God let your word speak to me again and again and I can't and he will rehearse these things again and again it's a Time release revelation um the resurrection factor is already inside every one of the elect seed the third pull is that quickening power within every elect seed it's the revelation of the word of God made known in its season the unfailing words of Promise how many you remember that I told you that the angel of the Lord and that Pillar of Fire that met me up there and told me if I'd be sincere it would come to pass and I would know the very secret of the heart let me take this a step further if you'll be more sincere you will know the secret of God's heart hmm he revealed the secrets of your heart but the third pool reveals the secrets God speak to me words of wisdom speak unto me in night visions give me things give me Revelation whisper in my ear Hallelujah when you whisper those great secrets you know what's amazing about when you're in an elevator and everybody can be talking and everybody but if you lean over to your friend and say hey everybody shuts up this is that third pole the mystery of God is now being made known to the bride she's catching it why this is our time this is our season I'm not putting it off to another day another hour this is my time amen this is my time I'm not going to let a rock take my place this is my day when my voice Rock shut up it's my time to give God praise it is my time to thank God it is my time [Music] Ephesians 2 verses 4 through 6. but God who is rich in Mercy first grade love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together where in Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together do you see this raising when he raises she Rises he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is a part of the Resurrection as John was called to come up hither all right I'm going to pass a few things here Colossians I want you to turn with me to Colossians 3 verses 1 through 3. brother and I'm passing up Colossians 2. if he then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God said your affections on things above are you listening to me not on the things of this Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God now you see what the resurrection Factor the C Gene this Gene of God is all about his affections and his desires will be turned that elect seed will be turned to his affection and his desire seek first the kingdom of God in his righteousness all these other things will be given to you but it's no longer you doing it but it's Christ in you Galatians 2 verse 20. I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live how can you have a death and a living I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me in closing now musicians if you come Lazarus was a resurrected man when Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus he said Lazarus come forth brother Branham says an astounding statement he said if he had just said come forth all of the Dead had to come up but he identified with his voice Lazarus come here Lazarus engraved clothes imagine him standing there Jesus said I am the resurrection Lazarus had the resurrection in him his nose had caved in his body decayed and began to sting but when God said Lazarus [Music] life Now understand this sometimes resurrected people still sting but yeah they get complexes they're wrapped in grave clothes now the word is not to Lazarus it is to his family Lucille lose him from those grave clothes I want you to understand that dealing with people that have been resurrected in Christ some of them are still there fighting with all kinds of complexes it is our job loose and go what's church is all about sometimes you come to church you're bound with complexes you got some carnal thing that's troubling you you know you're you know in my whatever you're you're wrestling I got crave close somebody resurrected people stink are you willing to get involved with somebody who's got a complex pray with them [Music] come here buddy I'm gonna pray with you I'm going to get involved with you I'm going to lose you many of you have got grave clothes that are still hanging around you and you know what you you think well I just got to this complex and I'll never get rid of it my daddy had it my grandfather had it this that no me tell you you do not need to carry the grave clothes any longer a Deliverance Ministry Christ is the deliverer and he said his word and he healed the people the third poll he sent his word and he healed the people it's not the laying on of hands it's the word it's speaking Lord I am a man of authority and I know if I tell a servant to go he goes if I tell him to come he come I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof and whatsoever you say I believe it'll be done and if you say to my son you don't need to lay hands on him I believe your word Lord he said then go find just as you asked he goes home he asks his servant at what time did my son begin to mend me tell you there are times when you come to church when you're somewhere you're doing something and God is appearing comes in his word is made known to you Plex is lifted and Grave closes unwrapped tombs people [Music] grave clothes are for dead people [Music] it's these After Effects huh and if you still got After Effects even after you've been resurrected I still got some After Effects sometimes they bother me oh Wretched Man that I am when I tried to do good an evil is present with me and that which I don't want to do that I do oh who shall deliver me from this body of death anyone who gets involved with resurrected people are in for some discomfort and some stinking situations like Oliver said to Hardy there's another fine mess you got me into [Music] let me tell you that's what the ministry of Jesus Christ in every one of you is to lose people
