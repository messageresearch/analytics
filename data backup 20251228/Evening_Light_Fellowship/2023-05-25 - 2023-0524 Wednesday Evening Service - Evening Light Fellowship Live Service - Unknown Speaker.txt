you all this evening you may see be seated for just a moment amen I greet you all tonight in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I am glad to be in the house of the Lord I know that wherever God's people's at he is there and when he is there good things happen amen God bless you all and brother Stephen McNeely come on up here I want you to go ahead and greet the church you just come back from from Ireland and he's been with his family there just have him has gone a week but uh seemed like a month and uh anyway brother Stephen we appreciate you and your ministry here you're an integral part of our ministry here go ahead and greet to church here for us God bless you yeah it feels like a month rather than you know six days but uh certainly appreciate your prayers I went to spend a little time with Mom and Dad there and and I ended up spending more time with my dad than I did with my mom um which was really nice because I haven't gotten to spend that much time with my dad in a long time so um mom's doing good she very tired kind of lethargic when I had first got in there and by the time I had left it seemed like she had a lot more color in her face she was staying up a little bit later and stuff so she was definitely encouraged and she's she's very encouraged with the prayers and the love and the support of everybody here and so we certainly thank you for that and um you know we're just we're just walking by faith my mom is is a woman of faith and doctors have you ever heard of socialized medicine huh do you think it's a good thing no it's not uh so Mom and Dad they're still waiting on a a diagnosis of what's going on but good news is this she hasn't gotten any worse for a while and so that's a good thing and so we're just trusting in the Lord for a complete recovery for a total healing and her body and in her mind and that should be a living testimony of Jesus Christ so God bless you and this pulpiture is nice huh it's massive yeah very nice God bless you brother Ron thank you amen yeah praise the Lord also too I wanted to say that Sandy and I went with our daughter Rebecca today to go meet with her surgeon for the surgery coming up on June the 30th and uh uh uh the doctor had looked at all of the testing all of the blood work all of the MRI all of the everything that they look at prior to and everything is going in the right direction and and he said he was very um uh you know under great expectation and said everything is better than what he had expected so hey praise God uh doctor's doctor but God Is A Healer somebody say praise God Amen because you know what listen doctors can do their thing but every doctor knows they're not the Healer the medicines don't heal they heal but God is the Healer so we give God praise for that Ezra come up here brother you've had an issue with your eye there I want you to give a report on how that's gone everything's going in the right direction thank you brother Ron I I'll put my eye up patch the reason I have the patch on is I I lost almost complete vision and I had a retina tear so 30 of my eye kind of dropped down like a curtain or Eclipse so I had to go in for emergency surgery I missed my son's graduation and you know how doctors are I think the guy was German or something I said well can I delay and pray and you know my son's graduating tomorrow he looked at me kind of like brother Ron looks at you if we find a spot young man you will go to surgery okay so we had surgery it went really well he finished up and he said everything went perfectly now I know why I wasn't a doctor that was crazy he was like putting needles in my eye working through lasers and all this thing but they did a miraculous job I spent four days in a prone position which was pretty much like prison brother it was close I just got up to eat and use the restroom and then back in position one little joke here my father brother Mark he'd say Ezra just spent an extra 10 minutes you know it's just it's just time I'm getting back on the floor you know because you want to do the right thing because if it doesn't turn out right then you have to do it again so just praise the Lord I just had my follow-up yesterday with Dr Graf a surgeon out of Mesa and he said everything looks perfect my eye looks completely healed and we're just looking forward to a complete healing so we just give God all the praise amen that's pretty much yes praise the Lord so we thank God for that and we're going to change the order of the service now I'd like you'd all to stand and we have here brother Zachary Wallace and brother Russell and sister Elizabeth I want you guys to know you've done a tremendous job in raising your your children and everything and no matter how you raise them you know it still takes God to move into the hearts of your children to change their heart and for them to have an experience and I want to say uh brother Zachary may the Lord bless your ministry you're a young man coming up and as an older minister in the waning stages of my own Ministry I see others raising up and I'm asking God God raise up these young men give them a burden and a desire huh and that witness of the Holy Spirit to take this word and go Forward Unto the coming of the Lord so we bless his ministry and ask that the Lord take you and use you wherever you go and may you win many souls to Christ is our desire Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Will sing that song and we'll turn it over here to uh brother Zachary now Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart [Music] I wanna see you once again open the oven [Music] Lord I want to see you to see you high and lifted up to see you [Music] As we sing foreign [Music] want to see the Lord but you know it's good to hear when the word is going forth too so we'll get that turned on God bless you Saints tonight it's wonderful to be here really enjoyed the opportunity we've had over the weekend there to be with young people and just really enjoyed the the fellowship and to see the Lord dealing with lives it's a you know it's a dark hour there's many challenges there's many things and you know you find out you're in a battle and you're a battle in a battle for life and death and that's not a dramatization you're literally Fighting For Life physically and spiritually as Satan's coming in and to see that God come in and do things that no man can do there's nothing greater I'd like to see so we're just praying the Lord will continue to to move here among us tonight if you have your Bible we'll open up to Romans the fourth chapter we'll get into the word here Romans chapter 4 appreciate the privilege brother Ron giving me the minister in the Pulpit here it's a nice brand new Pulpit I appreciate that it's nice and wide that other one was a little cramped rather but uh this is downright comfortable so Romans the fourth chapter what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereupto Glory but not before God for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and who sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin and for a little contrast we'll turn to James the second chapter here we just seen Abraham looked at from the Divine element and here James looks at him from the human element James chapter 2 and 14. James 2 and 14. what does it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked in destitute of daily food and one of you say unto him depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble the devil knows the power that's in this message of the hour friends being a believer of the message is good but the devil knows it works too but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seeest thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this word that you have given us Lord we thank you for the promises that are here exceeding great and precious promises where might be maybe partakers of the divine nature Lord so many things here but I pray tonight you would anoint our faith to receive your word in reality I pray that your Holy Spirit would just use these lips this body For Your Glory May the hearts and the ears be open to receive whatever you would have for us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen may be seated the brand made the little statement Noah's Works expressed to man what his faith was in God's promise now God is God doesn't need your works to see your faith but your neighbor does kind of like Martin Luther said uh he says God doesn't need your good works but your neighbor does and when you have faith in God there will be an expression of that Faith there will be a reality of that faith your faith will have an expression and that will be a work at showing your true faith now faith is in case you haven't understood yet we're gonna be talking about faith tonight faith is a substance that means it's real that means that faith is not just something you imagine it's not just something that you know you think about it it's a sense of your body that declares a reality of something it's just as real as as me saying that this is a a piece of paper my eyes tell me this is a piece of paper that's real to me I know it just as real as my eyes telling me that that's a light right there it's just as real as as saying that I can feel this coat right here it's a reality my senses declare something and it's real to me totally real I don't care how much you might try to argue with me that I don't have this coat on I'm just stubborn enough not to believe you because I can feel it it's here my sense declares to me that it's real and in perfect faith brother Graham says see just that real as music playing it's just as real as a taste and anything in my mouth it's that real only you can't show it to somebody else you have it alone it's yours faith is the substance see not just a myth faith is more than just a thought it's more than just a feeling it's more than just a hope so it is a reality is something you actually have a substance you're holding on to and everything could be going contrary everything could be going opposite but you say but no my faith says opposite of that and that is the reality to you works as Faith expressed the prophet said he promised you the same thing that is if you could believe that it would happen if you can't believe it well it just won't happen now remember who's talking here the greatest profit we've seen on this earth now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe God has to give it to you it is a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith your intellectual Faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is down in your heart see your intellectual Faith can't accept it do that and just keeps believing it just keep believing it with all your heart hold on let me let me read that a little bit better see your intellectual faith can accept it do that you believe the word with your mind good that won't produce reality but that's a really good place to start do that and just keep believing it with all your heart until God has revealed it to you just keep believing it until God does reveal it intellectual faith is good but it'll never produce works it will never produce the reality but it's a starting place you read the word you see right here Isaiah 53 he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities by his stripes I am healed the chastisement of my peace of mind was laid upon Him chastisement of your peace these things are in the scripture you can see it you know that that's the word of God and you say that is true now you believe that that's good but you it's not your faith it is the faith of the Son of God Galatians 2 20. the faith of the Son of God when God comes down and he puts something inside you he puts a confidence faith is a confidence faith is a trust faith is an assurance about something you know I have a confidence in my wife I have a trust in her we were just talking about it today you know about how I really am not a jealous person you know and uh my wife was like I don't know if I could do anything that would make him jealous like I just really don't know and uh and she's like you know part of it's just you know my masculine ego but you know I'm just confident that she thinks I'm the best thing that ever came on the face of the Earth and I'm not worried about it you know I know she loves me I know she adores me and and like why would I worry about it like I'm I'm secure I'm safe I'm trusting 100 and her love for me I'm not worried oh you know maybe maybe something's gonna happen maybe something's gonna happen I'm not I have a complete confidence and faith and trust in my wife brother Brown says if you don't have that you should marry her but when God comes down to us he comes and he places his confidence his Assurance his faith in you to believe that what he said will come to pass the purge me in church age this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian victory your faith is awfully limited friends your faith is an awfully limited product but when you get into the faith of the Son of God and that is beginning to operate through you oh something's gonna happen living in Christian victory now faith is a revelation from God faith is a Revelations that's where I want to stay there just a minute it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by a lot of your effort by being just so righteous that God Finally Revealed the word to you and gave you Faith No he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation one place brother Ram says faith is a revelation of the will of God and so we could go into to Hebrews the 11th chapter and we could look at how by faith a revelation of the will of God Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice we can look about how Enoch by a revelation of the will of God by faith he was pleasing before God he walked before God when God begins to reveal it to you you have a confidence you have an assurance when he begins to place that in your heart and everything else can be contrary but that Faith goes beyond the reasoning it goes beyond common sense it goes beyond logic I remember some years ago I had an experience where I was praying for somebody that was just really under a spirit of reasoning and they were just going in their mind and they were just being attacked just constantly and and they were just all tore up and they didn't know whether you know the Bible was true or God was real or or if the message had any validity they just didn't know what to think their mind was just in this turmoil and and I remember I went down to the church and opened it up one night and I was just in prayer praying for that person and and I just felt a real burden of intercession and I highly cautioned you to ever do this but I said God I'm standing between that darkness and my friend and I knew what that meant and for days I just went into a world of darkness and chaos that Darkness just coming against me and and I remember as I was in there I remembered a time when I used to think that you know believing in God is just the simplest thing there is knowing this message is true it's just as simple as one two three it's just so simple you look out here I mean only a fool would say there's no God you look at the universe the creation you know there's a God you look at religions there's nothing that touches Christianity you look at Christianity the message of the hour is the only thing that has the the reality of the word the purity of the word you look at it it's just it's just so simple you can just see there it is but when I went into that Darkness that logical reasoning didn't help me none and as those questions begin to come every which way I could I would try to out argue and I try to out argue it and there would be another answer there'd be another thing coming and you know it really helped that I knew what was happening and knew this wasn't me knew that I was in a battle and all these things began to come and after some few days I remember I was sitting there at work just working and and putting on some electrical connectors and I remember sitting there fighting this darkness and and then all of a sudden because it got to a place friends where I could not tell you with my mind that I knew this message was true I couldn't tell you with my mind that I knew God existed not with my mind I could not tell you with my mind that I knew that I existed you get into this fog of well well maybe I'm just dreaming that I exist maybe I'm just how what do you know is real what is reality there was absolutely nothing that wasn't that was something you could put your foot on and say this is truth this is truth in the mind it wasn't there but I remember as I was working there I just stood up and I said Satan I'll preach this message the rest of my life though I never again understand it in my heart my mind because I know in my soul that this is truth and you know that wasn't reasonable that wasn't logical and there was nothing he had that could come against Faith a revelation of the word of God but it gave me a Grace honestly for those people who have fallen because if that wasn't there I didn't put that there inside of me I didn't reveal this word to me but God revealed it to me and if it wasn't for that I would have had nothing to stand on but Upon This Rock the revelation of who Jesus Christ is upon that rock he will build his church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it a little bit later my friend contacted me and they said you know I was just walking through the house and all of a sudden something inside of me spoke out of me and says I know I know God is real and I know this message is true they said what do you think that was I says that is the seed of God that lies within you that responded and came out through all that darkness and responded with faith in the word of God faith is a substance faith is a reality faith is something that's not logical it's not reasonable when everything else is contrary that faith will stand there and will not be shaken some time ago I I went out for uh went out for a little walk and and uh was up here in Cordis Junction and went out it was kind of a a getting dark a little bit and I went out there and suddenly it got real dark and I was like well I'll just use the moon and then the clouds came up and covered up the moon and so I'm really in the dark and I've got my phone and I pull it out and I've got like four percent left on the battery so that flashlight wasn't gonna work and I'm back there probably a couple miles out in the the rocks and the cactuses everywhere and so you start to learn this you know technique when you're walking in a situation like that so you just you're carefully walking through feeling your way through the dark trying to place your feet and as I was going through there I began to hear this this Creek flowing and I'm like that doesn't make sense like I thought I knew the geography a little bit better you know how's our Creek right here and I got a little bit closer and it was a high power transmission line that was running through there and the energy going through there was just crackling and popping just the the pulsation of energy flowing through there I think they're running close to 300 000 volts being pushed through those high power transmission lines incredible power running through there there was actually just Sparks of little you know energy just bursting off of there you can see the light flashing a little bit I was like man that's a lot of power but my phone's still dead you know here I am under an incredible amount of power is just a few feet away from me and I have a phone that needs a charge so I can turn on a light so I can find my way home and I could have sat there all night wishing for a charge and it wouldn't have happened I could have yelled at that charged my phone charge my phone nothing what happened there is a law to electricity there is a way you have to operate with it the power is there the power was there no questions asked there was enough power there to to light up the whole district for miles around and yet I sat in darkness because I had to go and find the proper channel for that power to flow through and you know I eventually I worked my way over to a little place and I got on a little Trail and and after a long time I finally got back to the house and I plugged a little charger into the wall and that connected to the wires inside the wall which went to the transfer station which went to the the electricity and it channeled it down and I finally got that charge on my phone but I was out of the woods but there is a law to electricity that it operates by I don't care how much you want it to do something if you don't follow the law of electricity it's not going to happen and the exact same thing applies to the power of God there is plenty of power there friends there is plenty of omnipotence that's just waiting to be tapped into it is there but there is a law of faith that it operates under now within you as a believer in God that as a child of God there is enough power in you to speak a world into existence and go live on it incidentally the devil can't create a grain of sand but there's enough power within you to speak a world into existence and go live on it now what keeps that from happening what keeps all the introverts from having their own private World well it's a law of faith that it has to operate through that channel of faith faith in what program says in the Hebrew series he says now the only way that a church can be built the only way that a man can have faith is not by his denomination not by his affiliation but his faith rests not upon the Theology of some man's ideas because it's more or less altogether man but the only way faith can find its solemn resting place is upon the immovable and unchangeable word of God faith cometh by hearing hearing the word that's how it takes and and when faith is heard and accepted it's forever settled nothing can no more can ever move it no matter what comes or goes nothing can ever change that Faith think of it you're anchored and you know more change for Time and Eternity you're anchored forever now that's a powerful kind of face right there that's a revelation that will never leave you no matter what comes in your life and if you have not yet received that revelation of who you are in Christ Jesus if he has not revealed to you you are my child you are my bride then I ask you tonight to call upon him Lord reveal who I am reveal who I am because once it's revealed to you I don't care what you go through I don't care how hard it gets I don't care the challenges there will be an anchor there that says but I am a Son of God I am a believer I don't care what these obstacles are I don't care how opposite it might seem to my personal feelings and my experience right now I know by a divine revelation that I am a believer but faith has a law and brother Branham says that faith is just like common hyssop it's just a common weed they applied that token with faith with hyssop it's just common everyday faith it's just the same faith that you use to go out and put the key in your car and start it that's the same faith that brings the realities of God's word into action it's simple common everyday Faith it's not something worked up something some manufactured something it's just a complete confidence well I mean if I turn on the light the light's going to turn on you don't even think about it if God said it then that's what's going to happen like there's not this big long argument about it friends there's not this lengthy discussion did God speak it if that's what he said then that's what's going to be there's not this there's not this questioning this reasoning oh maybe it's not for me maybe it's for somebody else maybe Faith doesn't do that Faith isn't manufactured there's just something subconscious about it down on the inside it just receives it now you think like to take a step takes faith that took faith you might think well that's ridiculous that's crazy like if you want to take a step you just take a step yes but it's faith um I was in a situation one time where I didn't have faith to take a step I literally didn't and I couldn't I could not take that step it happened to be about a 20-foot Cliff going into a nice waterfall and and a big Lagoon there and and all my friends were jumping off the cliffs so of course naturally you have to too you know that's the rules and so so I was standing there and I'm like okay I'm gonna jump I'm gonna jump and I'd go up and and my feet just wouldn't cooperate with my mind was saying I was going to do and they'd stop and I'd jerk back and like no no it's gonna work I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it and I I'd wind up again and I'd come and and I'd stop why couldn't I jump didn't have enough faith to take a step eventually I stood there long enough and finally I did get up enough Faith I'd seen everybody else do it I knew the water was deep enough I've done it in the past I knew I enjoyed doing it but finally I got up enough Faith to take a little six inch step and then I screamed all the way down and had a great time and did it again and again and again but you can't do the simple things of life without faith you don't even realize it's there but if it wasn't there you couldn't get out of this chair and walk out of the building tonight faith is subconscious now faith is just you know flipping that that uh switch when you flip that switch it turns on the power and it's faith that is that key faith that turns that that uh light on now let's see here so we've got these this nice little shop light with a halogen bulb if you're into construction you already know it might not work now we got this here so we got the cord so right now what we're operating under is the laws of electricity how many believe if I get the laws of electricity right this light's going to turn on why you ever seen it happen before you ever you ever operated under the laws of electricity and suddenly electricity failed to work no if you follow the laws of electricity it's going to work now if I sit here and say well here's the promise of God here's the word of God we're going to plug it into the to the source here we plug it in because he praise God you know the church is just really on Fire or the pastor preached a good message all these different things but if we never make this connection what's gonna happen nothing if we go ahead and make this connection all right so we've got a connection there we've got a connection here everything's been done according to the right law everything's been put in place but you got all of that power there's power there pretty sure power's there the chords are good the connections are right but you get down to this last little switch of faith all of that power is waiting for somebody with just enough Faith to watch up and flip the switch and it worked now you might have had a couple of questions about whether it might work or not the first time but what about now any child here can flip that switch and we'll get the exact same results that President would get it's a law power is there faith will release that power into an action every time I push the switch it gives me more assurance it's gonna work it's gonna work it's gonna work it's a law and every time I see that law go into effect I have more confidence that it'll do it next time if I tell somebody go over there flip that switch they say well is it going to work don't worry about it I just tested it yesterday I just tried it out yesterday it turned on the flip switch the power came and we had a connection now there's some very important things that come into making these laws work you know we could take this and we can say well you know I believe we've got everything set up I believe we've got this we've got this Faith but we're going to take this and we're going to plug it into you know to our pastor here and we plug it into the pasture well you know there might be power there but that's not the channel it's supposed to work by we come right here oh there's there's power right here there's power in the speaker I know it's there I can hear it right now you try and plug into this it's not going to work that is not the provided way for the power of God to flow you know when you need something from God you don't approach the pastor as a man you approach him as a channel for God to flow through to you because that man can do nothing for you there is no good thing in any man I can't help you brother wrong can't help you but there is a gift and that gift is to let the man get out of the way and let God come down now if you'll plug this into the right Source if you'll place your faith and your confidence in the word of God in the promise of God every single time it's going to produce the result now as an electrician sometimes I come into a problem and the power is not there the light's not turning on going to a place and the Outlet's not working you know one of the first things I do I walk over to the light switch and I flip the light switch because I want to find out is there power in the room is it there if it's not in there then I go out I go to the main breaker I check to see if the breakers are flipped is there a break in the connection somewhere because I know electricity works I know it will turn on the light if I can get it right and so I go out to the breaker box is there a break in the connection where is this happening I go to the main meter is the power turned off and what's going on I I have to find out is there maybe a power outage just APS you know do they just have a power outage their stations are down like what's going on because I know it will work and I know the word of God the power is there omnipotence is there waiting to be released I know it's there and I know if I can get that connection from all from there right through the promise of God right through the word of God get it to the person and see that Faith connect it will produce it is a law of God oh it's not a maybe so it's a reality and you know right now when this light turns on it gives me confidence the power's here if I needed to put a light over there I could plug it in over there if I needed a light over there I could plug it into there the power is there and it gives you such a confidence that if the light worked for them it'll work for me too if he can turn on the light if my little girl can push the button and turn on the light then if I need the light I'll just flip that switch I'll just push that button of faith in God's word and watch it come into a reality you know back some time ago my wife was bound in depression she was bound in in just a darkness of of Satan and and suicidal thoughts and just torment but one day one of the first things that happened is God spoke into her heart and said you are a believer and God began to lead her out of that Darkness and tonight she sits there free from that oppression of the enemy the god that delivered my wife from depression is the same God that came and delivered sister Tracy Lovell who was bound by depression Bound by all of this Darkness he came down and he delivered her and she just shared her testimony a couple weeks ago well let me ask you if God did it for them what about you back I was just looking at the dates actually and it the testimony of it came three years ago to this day back a few years ago if you have those pictures I was at my home and my little girl she says daddy you've got a thing on your head and I looked at I was like yeah I had this skin growth for about about six months that had been on my head there and it was just kind of ugly and scabby some kind of a growth I didn't really know what it was and she says well you need an appointment well she's like appointment and I was like yes and uh maybe Hit the Lights a little bit you might be able to see it better I know but uh she says you need to get an appointment Daddy and I was like it was Sunday morning I was like well you know I probably should I mean you know skin growths and Cancers and things are probably something you should goof around with I was like maybe I should get something and I wasn't really sure and then God just began to deal with me bring it to me and so I said Lord I'm gonna have an appointment with you this morning at church and so I went to church after service I went up I said brother Ted I want you to anoint me with oil and pray over me that this growth I don't know what growth this is I don't know what kind the lives it is but it's going to be gone he prayed for me and I went home and I told my little girl I says Jesus healed me she said really she said I said yeah and so she said well let me see and she looked at she says but Daddy it's still there I says but the thing that was inside of that is dead and so this was May 17th the next picture is May 18th it looked even worse the next day and then we got May uh 19th I believe next one there 22nd I think is next 23rd or 24th this is the picture from the next Sunday when I went back to church and shared the testimony that God had completely taken that away from me in seven days I watched that thing go from a dead growth to completely dying away and being replaced with brand new skin and I took my Bible and I went back to my little girl and I said you know I had an appointment and I want to read you the bill by his stripes I am healed it was paid in full that was three years ago today that that happened now the god that did that for me what about you the same God that healed brother little Isaiah Clayville who they said had tumors all up and down his spine had all of these these these health issues they came here to church prayed over him and God completely delivered that little boy you know that testimony it was new to me but I was rejoicing in it what did that my God if he did it for Isaiah what about you they were telling me the testimony of brother Neil Mater and how the doctors didn't understand how he could be alive and how he had never really seen a man go through what he did and that he was alive and the doctor told him he says every day that you're alive you're a miracle and his nickname at the hospital was Miracle Man that's what they said about him that was their testimony about what they seen in that man Satan cannot destroy you until God says I'm ready for him to come home little Josiah McGrady the doctors say he won't live he can't live but I seen with my own eyes him here at church on Sunday my God is Unlimited in his power Unlimited in his resource all that you need to do is operate by the law of faith and come over and flip that little switch and watch that law go into action it will produce and if you see it do it for one it tells you the power's there the power that of God that'll heal cancer the power of God that will raise the dead that will heal the blinded eyes that same God is here tonight and if he did it for them he'll do it for you all you got to do let's flip that switch of faith now when you recognize the hand of God moving when you recognize that God is present it raises your faith because you realize this is more than a story this is more than theology this is more than just religion we are serving a living God with living signs living works God has given us a message that we could have a perfect faith if you get the opportunity if you don't get the opportunity make the opportunity to go listen to the sermon perfect faith it is a treasure trove for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and of spirit and of the joints and of the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents in the heart the word made flesh Hallelujah the word operating in human flesh by physical signs by material Signs by scriptural signs perfectly to bring you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture God has given you a message that is a perfect word so that you can have a perfect faith if you didn't have confidence in the word how could you have perfect faith you couldn't do it but when you know that this is a Vindicated word when you know that you can hang your soul upon this message of the hour you can have a perfect faith in a perfect word and take a perfect rapture now if anybody here ever been skydiving one two three a few of you all right all right so you know I haven't been yet but I'd probably go if I got the right opportunity but if I went out to the skydiving facility you know and I I roll up there and they say hey yeah you ready to go here's your here's your parachute guess what I'm not going if the guy pulls out parachutes like okay yeah let me see the instructions so it says to clip okay I'm going to clip this here on you and oh man what was that other part let me see there's no way I'm jumping out of that plane with a parachute that looks like this and an instructor that really doesn't know what he's doing I'm not doing it I'm going to want to know beyond a shadow of a doubt I'm going to want to read the certificate that this parachute is actually one that works I'm going to want to find out that this instructor has done it again and again and again so that I can have confidence in what he's doing there's no way I'm trusting my life to something that hasn't been proven that means Vindicated this parachute right here that he gave me has not been Vindicated to work friends You're Gonna Fall Like a Rock now if you wouldn't jump out of a plane with a parachute that ain't Vindicated do you think God's gonna ask you to hang your soul upon a word that hasn't been Vindicated oh no he has given us a Vindicated message so that we can have an absolute confidence we can rest our soul I don't care how many certificates I might find on the wall of that parachute place I still might have a question but in my soul I have a revelation that has removed every question has removed every doubt I might not be able to explain it but I believe it because it has been proven it has been Vindicated who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word again once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of a sign we have a Vindicated prophet and that is so important because once you realize he is Vindicated you don't have to wonder whether or not what he's saying is inspired you don't have to wonder whether or not what he's saying is right or wrong if it's a Vindicated Prophet you can rest your soul upon the message of the hour because God has already stood behind it so to have perfect faith we need to have a perfect word and we have it friends we have received a message that has been Vindicated to be right by almighty God perfect Faith he says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now rapturing condition bride material you know what that means substance faith now when you get a revelation by faith in your personal identity that these things are speaking about you there we can go through the scriptures for for a lot longer than you all want to stay here showing all the different types all the different shadows showing how there would be a bride showing how there would be a people on this Earth who will manifest the word but you have to come to a place where you identify with it personally now I'm gonna kind of skip through this here a little bit but the RAM says now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are I didn't say I'm the bride he did I didn't say well this is what I'm gonna do I didn't say well there's going to be Miracles following me I didn't say that he did I didn't say that these signs were going to follow me no he said these times will follow a Believer and that's just what I am you must have faith in what the word says you are the ram says the greatest curse oh I can't skip that back to that last quote and Jesus said what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that came down from God out of Heaven amen and I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I in all these things I am that I am and he knew what that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now if in I myself I can do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you oh Hallelujah what are you are you a hope so Christian are you a maybe so Christian or are you a believer what are you what does the word say you are you stand on that I don't care what obstacle might come I don't care what challenge might face you what does the word say you are Prophet said the greatest curse that's on the church today is not knowing what they are again he said if the church only knew its position it will one day friends I believe were in that day it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is you need to have a revelation of Who You Are I can't give it to you brother Ron can't give it to you but my Lord Jesus is the Divine revealer that will come down and will tell you you are my child oh and when that drops in it begins to do a work in your life there begins to become a reality to it you know there was a little Shepherd boy one time and he came up against the Goliath he came up against the Giant and they had questions like who do you think you are what do you think you're doing and and he began to tell them testimonies about how his God was real he said you know one day I was tending my father's sheep and and I could I could base it on something he could base it on something oh brother and the god that saved your soul can't he heal your body it's just the same reveal it to you he's your healer as he was your savior see but it's got to be revealed first that's the difference he David he had something to base his faith on said now this has never happened before but the same God that delivered me from the paws of the lion will deliver me from the uncircumcised Philistine well how do you know David I believe it why it's been revealed to me you know what he asked when he walked up and seen that situation he said who is that uncircumcised philistine what is his identity a man without a promise that cancer does not have a promise but you do who is that uncircumcised Philistine who is that giant that would defy the armies of the Living God David had a confidence he had a faith in his heart that God that delivered him from the paws of the lion and that delivered from the paws of the bear he was going to be the same God that was with him when he went up against that giant because he was under a covenant and that giant had no right he was nothing but a great big ten-foot Bluff he knew who he was he knew his position and he began to speak out a word of Prophecy that says you are coming down and all of this Army is going to be fed to the birds he knew you know what one man has been the presence of God and has seen the reality of God can strengthen an entire church more than 40 revivals to have that good cleansed member with a heart set of fire for God says in the Samaritan Church age you must have confidence in your identity he said in the Samaritan Church age there's who those these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated foreknown of God and were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season you are a manifested attribute a manifested thought of almighty God and you were placed directly here for a direct season for a direct time for this time don't wonder about your your position don't wonder about your identity how could it be me how could it God said I'm going to take that person and I'm going to put them right there and they are going to manifest my nature as each member came forth it had became expressed and it took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it's very apparent that she ought to be called this that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even the Lord Jesus Christ so what are you God manifested in human flesh do you get stumbled by the swaddling close do you get stumbled by the Ridiculousness of being born in a manger over a manure pile somewhere it was still according to prophecy and you have been chosen placed in this hour as a spoken word seed bride to manifest God don't get hung up on the swaddling clothes you see in your own life friends for the random in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says as Peter was walking with Jesus he says even he says Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you he says even Jesus's own Earthly life did not reveal to Peter that he was the son of God he says but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you now don't you ever expect to wake up in the morning look in the mirror and be like yeah now that's a perfect Son of God flesh and blood's not going to reveal that to you friends but when God comes down and he begins to reveal to you when I said there will be a bride without spot and wrinkle I was talking about you when I said that there would be a people on this Earth who would be an invincible Army I was talking about you when God begins to come down and he begins to reveal to you that this is about you personally something's gonna happen to your faith oh Faith begins to go into action it begins to become a reality in your life when you understand that you're not just hoping about something you're actually in your position this is who you are you're not just trying to pretend pretend to be the Supreme Court Judge of the United States of America that's actually who you are you have this position you don't have to oh maybe if they'll let me into the Supreme Court today it's like no you're actually the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court like just relax that's who you are step into your position and make the Judgment call when you recognize your identity your Authority begins to come manifested oh friends we need to have a faith that'll break through that Amnesia and begin to declare to us who we are in Christ Jesus God is not speaking vaguely or generally about you know somewhere sometime there will be a bride no no it's not just a I hope some point there will be people come on the earth that will believe it's not like that friends there is a book with names written down on it there is a Lamb's Book of Life with specific names recorded and they are specifically recorded with specific attributes this is my bride the names of the Bride of Jesus Christ are recorded on that Lamb's Book of Life they are written there it's not a hope so it's not a maybe so it's a fact now when you can just begin to get that Revelation that same Revelation well you'll have a shout and fit like John had one time when he's seen his name written in that last book of life and he began to realize what that meant it meant that he was not going to hell it means that he was going to heaven it meant that if he hadn't eat of anything he had a right as a Son of God he had a right as a possessor of every Divine promise to whatever God said he knew he was redeemed he knew the blood was for him he knew that the blood worked he knew a whole lot when he realized that his name was recorded there and that's what this message of the hour does you get into this word and it'll begin to open up and you'll begin to see yourself identified in that word now notice what works as Faith expressed now notice we find here Isaiah spoken that a Virgin Mary as soon as the the grounds was already broke up she had been a virgin she hadn't run around the grounds had been already prepared or predestinated by foreknowledge of God even said she was a virgin right then God knowed what her name would be for her name was on The Book of Life in heaven God could have said behold a virgin named Mary shall conceive and bring forth a son and his name shall be called God knew exactly who he was talking about when he made that prophecy it wasn't a hoping someday maybe there would be someone come that was good enough no he knew her by name you know there was a time in the scriptures it's First Kings 13 when a prophet came and he cried out a prophecy against these these false priests that were offering incense to a false god and he cried out against it and he says there will be a son born to the House of David Josiah by name and he's going to tear down these altars he's going to desecrate them and do all these things 300 years later there was a child born by the name of Josiah who tore down those altars and desecrated those holy places of the paganism by name God said Josiah is going to come God could have put an appendix on the Book of Revelation that had every one of your names written down friends there is God is not questioning will somebody believe my message is somebody going to Manifest this word he knows he knows exactly who he was talking about when he said that there would be a bride on this Earth he knew exactly who he was talking about when he said there would be Overcomers in this laodicea he knows exactly who's going to do it it's not just a general thing friends it's personal and I can testify that I have found my identity in that word I have found where it was written of me behold I send Zachary Wallace Elijah the prophet that he might be receive this glorious message I have found myself personally identified in these scriptures and when that Faith begins to connect with that Divine promise all things are possible now in the same perfect Faith now when the same God comes to you and is pleased to dwell in you pleased to honor your word what your decision is what was Joshua's decision stand still son and it stood still amen sure what was Moses decision held to Stick Over the River like that and then called for it to open it and it opened and whatever you ask and if you say to this mountain who is that you if you say to this mountain who is that talking about so talking about somebody else in some other day some other age friends you've got to find your identity right here and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt see in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass then you can have what you said that puts you back in the word now that's not skim milk see it puts you back I know it's going to jump right over the top of you maybe see because it can't anchor but real genuine Faith catches that right now I don't know if I quite grasp it entirely but something inside of me there's a faith inside of me that says I believe that to be honest I've seen that I've seen my God back up his word but remember says that Satan tried to tempt Jesus Jesus didn't use his great power to tie up Satan with some Supernatural you know rope no he faced him on the word says he's tried to tempt Jesus from faith in the father's word here's what he did he tried to show him his great big ecclesiastical organizations on the Earth but he couldn't tempt him come over and join me I'll make you a bishop over all them Jesus said it is written yes sir Satan couldn't tempt him no sir he is past that but Jesus was the word his faith in the knowledge of himself that he was the word the faith in the knowledge of himself that he was the word the faith and the knowledge that this bride will not fail oh now I believe that there is a perfect faith that has been given restored back to the church in this hour and I believe that many times we actually operate in that realm of perfect faith for a season you know Peter couldn't walk on the water with intellectual faith that wouldn't have worked Peter couldn't have walked on the water with a hope so or maybe so Peter had genuine perfect faith Peter was doing all right until he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water he was scared first he thought it was a ghost He said Lord if it's you bit me to come to you on the water he said come on now that's just the same as James 5 14 same as Mark 16 the same God said it come on and he started walking he done all right got down out of the ship started walking on there was a storm on the sea you know Great White Cap ways bigger than these Hills drop down a little bit Jesus said come on he stepped down he said it's the Lord I'll just walk it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared what come in his mind first thing well I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he looked at well he looked at his symptoms he looked out here and seen how big them waves was and he got scared and he and when he believed he did down he went see what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed got scared in his belief then his substance left him see he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance the substance would have went right over the top of them white caps and went right on to him see if he has the perfect Faith see but he didn't have it he thought it did he did at first he was willing to venture right out well the why the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen he did it first friends he walked on the water at first he did it he had that faith and then he gets out there in the midst of a miracle and he begins to wonder but this isn't logical this isn't reasonable the doctor said yeah in all my life I've never actually seen this work this is not you know all of my associates nobody's going to believe that this is possible they don't even believe they're not going to believe my testimony you started to look around at symptoms circumstances these other things in the middle of a supernatural event he was already walking on the water France he was doing it he was in the middle of a miracle and then he started wondering what about this what about that you know what happened he went down but remember says now when you get to thinking well now wait and I've been sick so long stop you just might as well get back in the boat see but when you quit thinking about that Abraham considered not his own body now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he didn't think about that he didn't even consider it wasn't even a thought into understanding he didn't even consider at all he just considered what God Said and he went on as long as Peter did that he walked to musicians would come I believe that many times in our lives God comes down he comes down into service he comes down when we're riding in a car somewhere I remember was at a meeting it wasn't a meeting it was just a group of young people in a house and God came down one of the most Supernatural ways I've ever seen had a five-hour prayer service with Miracle after miracle it was awesome amen and I was so busy praying for people that whole night that I never asked for anything myself I was about 19 I think back then and I remember thinking I was driving here by the Carefree Highway driving up Prescott on I-17 there and I was like I never asked for anything like why didn't I because in that atmosphere of perfect Faith you could have had anything you wanted in that atmosphere anything was possible and I was just like oh God I should have asked for something I was like what would I have asked for and I thought well you know I had that snowboarding injury and injured my shoulder real bad and couldn't raise it up very much and I was like I would have asked for my shoulder and I could have been healed like why didn't I driving up the road there the presence of the Lord came into the car he said I [Music] the same group and my faith went into action and I says then I claim my healing in the name of Jesus Christ I didn't notice it the first week I didn't notice it the second week but I kept testifying everywhere I went not because I was trying to have faith I was just so happy to share with everybody what God had did for me at one time I was testifying about it and I realized you know what that shoulder hadn't bothered me in a long time [Music] you know we look back at how God moved here he moved there he can meet you in your car he can meet you on the way to work he can meet you sitting in church tonight and God will come down and you'll begin to minister to you he'll begin to speak to you he'll begin to talk to you about something he'll begin to reveal a faith in your heart you might come up for prayer you might just be somewhere God speak something into your heart and you actually step out of the boat and you say well if that's what the word of God says then I'm going to stand on it and you begin to walk on the water but then the next day goes by or the end of the service and you're out in the parking lot and all of a sudden the questions start coming the storm cart's getting bad you see the waves rolling this way and that and you're starting to wonder well maybe I was just excited maybe I was just you begin to wander and you're already walking on the water friends you're already in the midst of a supernatural event keep your eyes on Christ Jesus when Peter turned his eyes and began looking at the situation he began looking at the circumstances he lost the miracle that was happening right then but if you can keep your eyes on Christ Jesus if he reveals something to your heart don't you hesitate don't you look to the right hand don't you look to the left keep your eyes centered on Christ Jesus and you watch that Miracle continue to manifest into a complete reality stand to our feet tonight [Music] I believe that [Music] God's done many different things in our lives and different times we could look at but then maybe the storm gets a little rough friends maybe we were standing on a promise of God but right now it just doesn't look possible but Christ look on what his word says look on what his promise is not on the situation not on the circumstance you stand and you look on him and you will continue walking in that Supernatural event all the way into the arms of Christ Jesus let's just bow our
