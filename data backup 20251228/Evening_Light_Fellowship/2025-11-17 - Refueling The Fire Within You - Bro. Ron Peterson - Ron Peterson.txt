Give it to the mighty conqueror cuz he's here to fight your battle today. Amen. And we can make [singing and music] more than coner overs [singing] in this life. And we've been made [music and singing] victorious all through the blood of Jesus. Do you believe it? Lift your hand and sing it this morning. that we've been made more than a [music and singing] consequence. [music] [music and singing] [singing] [music] As brother comes this morning, healer of the broken [music] pieces, you touch my heart and make me [singing and music] new. Oh, now my whole life, my surrender, I lay it down before the men. [music and singing] Lord, I give my heart to you. Love that sought [music] me. [singing] Love that s before I knew you and brought me here [singing] to where you are. [music] Oh, [singing] now [music] I live to praise you. Oh me, how great you believe it this morning. Lift your hand [music] and ask the healer to touch your knee today. Healer. Healer of the broken pieces. [music] You touched my heart and made me. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh now [music and singing] my whole life I surrender. I lay down before the vendor. [music] Lord I give my heart to you. [music] Oh, love that song before I knew you had brought me near to where [singing] you are. [music] Now [music] I live to praise you. Every day I praise you, healer of my [singing] heart. [music] Heavenly Father, that's more than a song. &gt;&gt; It is a reality. &gt;&gt; We look back in our lives and we can see how that we were broken. &gt;&gt; We were dysfunctional. &gt;&gt; Without God, without hope. &gt;&gt; But you placed a call upon our lives, Father, before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. that at some time, at some place, at some hour, we would hear thy voice and there would be a deep calling to the deep. And there would be a deep inside of each one that would respond to that calling. Therefore, Father, we are here this morning to re report for duty, to respond to that calling &gt;&gt; and to thank you, Father, for all that you've done, &gt;&gt; for all that you are doing and for all that you will do. &gt;&gt; We praise you and we thank you. Come and anoint the word to our hearts this morning and use your servant to speak to your people. I ask for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless. You can all be seated for just a moment. Just a moment. &gt;&gt; Have a uh something that's on my heart here and uh just wanted to just share some things with you and stuff. And I wanted to make it clear because somebody's been asking me uh brother Martin Malumba, he why has he not been preaching? Well, he asked he's very very busy with his work schedule and said, "Brother Ron, uh, keep me off of the schedule until January 1." So, uh, hang on January 1, uh, after that, he's putting the line up again. And so, that was his request. And, uh, so just be patient with that. And, Brother Mark Stkey's parents, uh, his mother, I should say, and his stepfather are streaming the service this morning. And I thought I'd take a moment and say hello to Evelyn and John Malik. They're up uh in Colona, um British Columbia. And so we greet them in the name of the Lord. I trust that the service will be a great blessing for them. &gt;&gt; Um as you all know that uh I'm going to be having a heart procedure here in the next couple weeks, but there's also one among us who's having an issue also. And I'd like brother Neil M to come up here at this time to kind of tell us uh what he's going through. And then I want all of us to be praying for him. And when I ask the brethren to come forward, I'd like my deacons, associate ministers, uh I'd like all of you to come forward, even brother Paul Love and uh different ones there if they would come uh to pray for our brother Neil. Come on up here, brother Neil. very special friend of ours. We know that God I call him the miracle man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So anyway, he went the other day and went to his doctor and he he got a report. So we want to go ahead and have him to bring it to you. Brother Neil, God bless you, my friend. &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. I do want to thank everybody for your continued praying for me and situation I'm going through. &gt;&gt; Let's get this way. They can hear you a little bit better. &gt;&gt; Test. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange to be on the other end of one of these. &gt;&gt; Um I went to the doctor the other day and they did their annual scan of my heart and and a and a ultrasound and with the contrast and everything. Well, I I have developed what they call a false lumen. And if anybody knows the medical profession, you know what that is. The blood in my artery has channeled and went through it through the area where I had my tear. And so I looked at the complications of it and you know what's the surgery? Well, the surgery is very very complex since I had a type A aortic dissection. And um having said that, I would just like you to keep me in my prayer because it's it's I go in tomorrow and have another test done to see exactly what they're going to do. So I I don't know. But I basically I feel like a walking time bomb. It's just, you know, it's dilated like 5 centimeters right now. So and if you don't know what that is, it's like two inches. So anyway, I thank you very much for your prayers and you continue support for me. So that's uh that's the the latest on that. Brother Ron, if you want so say a few words. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just stay right up here and let me put this back here. Put that in there. You brethren, come on up here behind the the pulpit here with me. And the reason that this is a very very serious situation is because he's already had aortic dissection. You know, it's caused his feet to get amputated, the ends of his fingers, that sort of thing, and and everything. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; the doctors. I remember when this first happened, the aortic dissection and you know the lifeflight and all of the complications. Uh I remember that we going to the hospital talking to his surgeon and u I said well doctor what is the prognosis? What are we going to do? You know uh are you know and he said well we really don't know what to do. We going to let nature take its course because I've never had anyone live beyond a couple two three days with what he had. So he already broke medical science &gt;&gt; and I believe he's going to break it again. [applause] &gt;&gt; I do. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I have that confidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is a mighty God. &gt;&gt; He is. He's a mighty God. And he's of He's a healer of the broken pieces. &gt;&gt; I mean, if he wanted to take you home, he'd already taken you home. &gt;&gt; Why put you all through this? &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, God is God and we worship him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are here, my brother, to lay our hands on you and ask you to have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's gather together. Get in here close. You brother. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, as I lay my hands upon our brother Neil M. Oh God, &gt;&gt; you're a mighty God. &gt;&gt; You're an everpresent help in the time of need. &gt;&gt; And we bring this need before you, oh Father. &gt;&gt; We claim a victory before the battle. &gt;&gt; You're the mighty conqueror. You're the mighty healer. Our breath is in your hands. Oh God, I bring brother Neil before you. And the doctors, they doctor, they do what they do. But you're the mighty healer. You that have kept him in days past are the same God that will keep him in the future. Therefore, Father, we claim a victory and we we lay our hands upon him right now and ask, Father, so let it be written. So let it be done. May he be healed. &gt;&gt; May, father, even perhaps they go and do the test TOMORROW AND SAY, "WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; Something's happened." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You're the great heart surgeon. Father, we commit our brother Neil to you. We claim this victory now as we lay our hands upon him for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ. May this test be turned into a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Thank you, brother. God bless you, Rich. &gt;&gt; Ah, yeah, you guys can. You can pray for me while you're here. Hey, Mike, come on. You guys, uh, Brother Stephen, he's already there. He's already at his seat and everything. Listen, I I realize, you know, look, the doctors are saying calcification of your aortic valve and they need to replace it and everything like that, but listen, I'm not nervous. Concerned? Yes. Nervous? No. Because everything is in his hands. &gt;&gt; So, uh, Amos says, "Well, we're here. Why don't we pray for you?" &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What does hinder? So, would you And Amos, you go ahead if you would. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you said that all things are possible. Father, if we would just believe. &gt;&gt; He does not believe in our own power, our own strength, Father. Lord, &gt;&gt; but Lord, we're believing in your word, Lord. You said that where two or three are gathered in your name, Lord, that there you would be in our midst, Father. &gt;&gt; And then if we would just trust you, Lord. The Bible says we have not because we ask not, and we ask not because we trust not. But Lord, we trust you in all things, Father. given our bodies our healing. These bodies are frail, Lord. They're temporal, Lord. But Lord, you're eternal, Father. And you know that we still have things that we want to achieve for your kingdom here. Lord, &gt;&gt; our pastor, Father, &gt;&gt; give him strength, Father. Give him new heart, Father. &gt;&gt; Not one not made by hands, but Lord, made by you. Father, we love you. We pray that you'd restore him 100%, Father. will be certain. We give you all the glory and &gt;&gt; we love you in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. God bless you richly. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that if these earthly vessels be dissolved, &gt;&gt; we have another one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's face it, the older you get, the more dissolving we have. &gt;&gt; Whether it be your shoulders, your knees, your heart, your eyes, your ears, whatever. I thank God that I have another one waiting for me. Huh? And so, so it's not that we be unclothed. Paul said, "Not that I desire to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon." &gt;&gt; I tell you, we have the greatest victory laying ahead for the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for it off in the future. I say it's happening now. &gt;&gt; This is the day. &gt;&gt; This is the time. &gt;&gt; This is our message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's sing. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Only believe. Yes. Only [singing] believe. only [singing] [music] all things are [singing and music] possible. All we need, [music] oh, [singing] [music] all [singing] for all things are possible. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, that is our lot in life. &gt;&gt; You said if you would just believe. &gt;&gt; You didn't ask us to manufacture anything, to produce anything, &gt;&gt; but to confess in our hearts that we believe. &gt;&gt; And we say like that one in the scripture, Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief. But it is our lot in life, Father, that when we hear your word, we say yay and amen. There's something inside that predestinated elect seed that is called upon God to believe every word. And so therefore, Father, I pray, let us take our position among those that have down through the ages, the countless members of that elect seed that have been called in every age, by every voice, by every prophet, by every one, Lord, that was called by the name of Jehovah Gyra, Elohim. name. You have made yourself known in this hour. &gt;&gt; We are all recipients of a message &gt;&gt; where you answered this loudest and lukewarm age by fire. You speak from a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Your voice &gt;&gt; follows that pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us enter into that anointing, &gt;&gt; that pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; that we be consumed &gt;&gt; by the power of God. I [snorts] ask it now for your glory. Bless each and everyone. The reading of thy word, oh God, I bless it. I bless it, Lord. Now bless it to the hearts of every believer in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's just remain standing. Thank you musicians. Amen. Each and every one the song specials. Hallelujah. We are becoming really a multicultural church. &gt;&gt; My from Spanish French and German and Norwegian and Spanglish and all kinds of languages here. Bundi and uh Kishwahili and so many different ones. &gt;&gt; Some have asked me, brother Ron, what do you think we'll we'll speak in heaven? Well, I don't know, and I really don't care. All I know is that we'll be able to communicate one with another and you won't need a translator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Won't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; You know, years ago, I got to thinking how that language and having to talk is actually a hindrance. It's a hindrance to me. Sometimes I can't say what I'm feeling. &gt;&gt; I feel like my trying to explain it in verbiage. &gt;&gt; I'm hindered. &gt;&gt; And then I got to thinking, well, you know, if we travel like a thought, why can't we discern one another's thought? So we could just sit on a log next to one another, not even move our mouth, and all of a sudden, yeah, brother. Amen. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Communicating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Telepathy. &gt;&gt; May God give us some telepathy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning. In other words, something that is supernatural. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the brethren asked me this morning, they said, "Brother Ron, are you sure you sent all your notes?" Because you only got two pages of notes. Normally, I have five to eight. And then I got to worrying. I thought, man, maybe I didn't got to checking. Yeah, I did. I only sent two pages of notes, but the notes are in here right now. &gt;&gt; Okay. And I have something on my heart and I wish to be able to take my time because this is extremely serious and I wish to project that to you because if it remains just something on my heart and it's not transferred to you, how do you know what we're talking about? The trumpet gives an uncertain sound. So, we want to have a certain sound &gt;&gt; that speaks. May the voice &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; as he's quickening me &gt;&gt; speak to you because &gt;&gt; I believe that this is for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it's for us. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 4 and then Hebrews chapter 12. Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 23- 24. [snorts] Deuteronomy 4:23. Take heed unto yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, [snorts] and make you a graven, and make you a gro graven image, or likeness of anything which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee. For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's jealous of you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Even the Apostle Paul says &gt;&gt; I am concerned about you with a godly jealousy. &gt;&gt; For I fear less by any means &gt;&gt; that serpent which beguiled Eve in the beginning will come and take away from your simplicity which is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the prophet opened the opening of the seven seals, he preached a sermon. God revealed in simplicity. &gt;&gt; It's not complex. &gt;&gt; But he reveals himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12:es 23- 29. [snorts] Hebrews 12 verse 23 [snorts] to the general assembly and church of the firstborn. Notice who he's addressing it to. This is not to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven. &gt;&gt; Where'd you come from? &gt;&gt; Where are you going? &gt;&gt; And to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect. and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not who refused him who spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whose voice then shook the earth? But now he promised, saying, "Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven." Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is getting shook &gt;&gt; from earthly to heavenly. And this word yet once more signifyth the removing of all those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, &gt;&gt; let us have grace, &gt;&gt; whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. &gt;&gt; For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; May God add the blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in his presence. [snorts] Now, I have been meditating for several weeks now, going out into my backyard or into my prayer closet. Sometimes waking up in the middle of night, getting out of my bed, sitting on my chair, and just meditating. and seeking the mind of God. And there's a subject that has come to my attention even while my wife and I were reading in the seven church age book concerning the subject of the cycle of revival and death that brother Brennham said never fails. It happens in every age. So every age has had its movement of God. Every time throughout history of seeing God from Genesis 1 all the way through, we see this revival cycle that's happening. And then something comes in, compromises it, it dies down, and then God comes and brings another one. the cycle of revival and death that he said never ceases, [snorts] what caused it, how can we combat against it? Because certainly, I don't know about you, but I as a minister and as a pastor am seeing it not only globally Now I want to focus not about those out there but I want to talk about us and when I say us I'm all inclusive of message believers who embrace this end time message as their own. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we can see and as brother Brennham tells us that you watch the revival comes there's a messenger God sends to him a message and those that hear it that were quickened during the time of that messenger &gt;&gt; their first generation I didn't come to the message until 1971 six years after the messenger had already gone off the scene and yet it was still so fresh &gt;&gt; and how the message believers around the world. Why I tell you there were people traveling and getting in buses and on cars and they would travel together to go just to hear about what God had done in this hour and many witnesses all over the world were having uh um meetings and they were witnesses. I was a witness of what God has done in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can say as a young brother, I was in awe to meet the ones that were there. What was it like &gt;&gt; when you went to the meetings and you saw the prophet of God and how he spoke and What was the atmosphere? &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE there &gt;&gt; to hear the Elijah? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I never met him though. I've had him come to me in several dreams. [snorts] So, I'm part of second generation. My children are third generation. My grandchildren are fourth. And brother Brennan talks about he said you watch that first generation and then the second and then the third until the fourth generation. He said there's just a small bit of the embers of the original fire left. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to say and declare unto all of you today that I do not want to accept a dying revival. &gt;&gt; I will declare to you that this which is begun in me &gt;&gt; is consuming. &gt;&gt; It's greater now. The revelation to it is greater now to me THAN WHEN I FIRST EMBRACED IT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S UNFOLDING GREATER and greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture along with the message of the hour as revelation and illumination COMES TO MY SOUL. &gt;&gt; IT IS SO GRIPPING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN THIS HOUR. It was not done in a corner &gt;&gt; IN SOME MYSTERIOUS LITTLE SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SENT THIS MESSENGER &gt;&gt; AS A WITNESS &gt;&gt; SEVEN TIMES AROUND THE WORLD. And he said, "As Moses was given two signs, you and your ministry shall be given two signs." But he said, "That only gets the attraction." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the vindication of your ministry. He said, "Yes, God has called me to pray for the sick, but he says, I want you to know." But he says, "That is only the the bait that's on the hook." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "The hook is the word revealed &gt;&gt; in its season. You might have saw or heard about this ministry, this God vindicated ministry and you like a fish to come by and you got a little something and maybe a good fisherman, he he kind of jerks the line and he causes that and the fish, they're attracted by movement and Maybe you just kind of passed by. Maybe it drew your attention. It had an attraction to you and you come by and you just I wonder what's that come by. Oh, God is a healer. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, little nibble, nibble, nibble, and everything. Now, any good fisherman sits there and he says, "Oh, oh, oh, look, look, watch the Now, any good fisherman knows when the first nibble, don't jerk the hook. &gt;&gt; No, let him take it. &gt;&gt; God did not jerk the hook. &gt;&gt; Until you took it. &gt;&gt; Hook, line, and sink. That's right. &gt;&gt; You swallowed it. It wasn't just a lip. It wasn't you swimming by and it got one of your fins, &gt;&gt; but it hooked you. &gt;&gt; Then no matter how much you fought, &gt;&gt; God will not lose one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Now, contrary to [snorts] you thinking that it's going to be something you do to get you there, it's not. &gt;&gt; He made a covenant &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. In fact, HE WROTE YOUR NAMES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the WORLD BEFORE YOU WERE BORN BEFORE THERE WAS STARDUST God has got an elect seed that HE SAID IS PREDESTINATED TO hear &gt;&gt; you say well don't I have a part to play in this yes you do but is God who reveals to you your heart. &gt;&gt; Now out there, let me say this to nonseed to what brother Brennham declares as the seed of the serpent. He said in nonseed there is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; Jesus when he was here he said you are of your father the devil and his works you will do. Amen. &gt;&gt; So understand that there are there is a whole another race of people that are out there that you rub shoulders with every day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whether it's at work, at bank, at school, or wherever. And they do not see what you see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They do not hear what you hear. &gt;&gt; In fact, you're a foreigner. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; You are as alien to their understanding &gt;&gt; as somebody who is from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. &gt;&gt; If it were, I would have fought." &gt;&gt; Sure. I want all of you to understand that this kingdom that we're talking about is not just some far away place. Brother Brennham said that when the rapture takes place, are we going to go past that wide far away Milky Way at light speed? He said, "No." He said, "Actually, you're just only changing dimensions." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, may I take liberty to just expound on that for just a moment? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "Science has proved that there are voices, there are images, there are things that are passing right through this room right now." &gt;&gt; And he said, "You just have to have a crystal or something that's magnetized to catch that image." He said, "That's all television does &gt;&gt; is you have to have a receptor." Huh? &gt;&gt; Or your cell phone has to be under the cloud or in the footprint. YOU GOT TO HAVE FIVE BARS. &gt;&gt; You understand? Can you hear me now? &gt;&gt; But he said, "Now I can prove to you that there's voices passing through here right now." Brother Brennham said if science knew what to look for, &gt;&gt; he said Jesus when he spoke the words, &gt;&gt; he said if they knew what to do, he said just like a uh a pebble dropped into a brook and it sends the rippled waves. And all of you have seen that. He said that they would be able to go out into the waves of eternity &gt;&gt; and they would catch up and know that right here at this place they would hear the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to KNOW THAT THE VOICE OF God is something very supernatural. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. [snorts] Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; So all of you understand that when God gives to you revelation, do you know what he's doing? He's sending you a signal that you have a receptor within you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't deny it. &gt;&gt; Oh, YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT. YOU MIGHT EVEN DISAGREE with it. You, you know, listen, it's not that YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WON'T. WITH THIS LITTLE FINITE MIND, IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO know what's going on in this world, much less what the heavenly kingdom is doing. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HIS WAYS ARE ABOVE MY WAYS. HIS THOUGHTS ARE ABOVE MY THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; SO UNTIL I GET MY UPGRADE, &gt;&gt; at the first resurrection, LISTEN, ALL I'VE got is the earnest. &gt;&gt; I got the down payment, which is the Holy Spirit. BUT ON THAT FIRST RESURRECTION, HALLELUJAH, THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THAT EARNEST WILL BECOME a fullness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until then, we fight. &gt;&gt; We wrestle &gt;&gt; with thoughts &gt;&gt; and carnalities and and education and science AND HOW WILL IT BE. &gt;&gt; GOD don't have to tell you &gt;&gt; how it'll be. It will be. &gt;&gt; That's his business. &gt;&gt; I don't know how we're going TO GET RAPTURED. I DON'T KNOW how how it's going TO HAPPEN. ALL I KNOW IS IT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; I'm being changed. &gt;&gt; How about you? Are you caught up in something? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, this that began to work in you is going to GO UNTIL YOU'RE COMPLETELY CHANGED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. UNTIL YOU BECOME. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, BROTHER RAM SAID, WATCH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID ENOCH WAS NOT BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM AND HE SAID ENOCH STEPPED INTO his revelation &gt;&gt; when you come to church &gt;&gt; and God gives you revelation &gt;&gt; FOR THAT MILLISECOND. HOWEVER, IN A BRIEF MOMENT OF TIME, YOU ARE JETTISONED. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; INTO HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; And it has SUCH A QUICKENING POWER. YOU GO, MY IF I COULD JUST STAY IN THAT PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; One day you will. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. I can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But be patient &gt;&gt; because he will do it. &gt;&gt; He that made the covenant will fulfill it. So you have a receptor inside of you &gt;&gt; that when he sent a voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound &gt;&gt; there was a receptor inside of you that was catching not the voice of William &gt;&gt; Brham. &gt;&gt; Let me declare unto you, you are hearing a voice from THE PILLAR OF FIRE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PILLAR OF FIRE COME DOWN ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE THE GOD THAT ANSWERS BY FIRE, LET HIM BE GOD. &gt;&gt; SO GOD HAD TO SEND DOWN A PILLAR OF FIRE &gt;&gt; TO COMBAT AGAINST the lukewarm DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS, &gt;&gt; religious spirits, Catholic spirits, DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he captivated you. &gt;&gt; You've been caught up. That word caught up in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, harpado means you made an interception. always in a game like football when the opposing team usually the other team it's a let's say a one of those nailbiting games where it's back and forth and you know it's just a good game not a blowout a good game listen we're in a good game right now &gt;&gt; we got two opposing teams &gt;&gt; this goal line we're about ready to cross over &gt;&gt; and our prophet said, "Okay, come here. Huddle around." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to tell you what to do. These are the plays we're going to do. Do your part." &gt;&gt; If you're a housewife, be a good one. &gt;&gt; If you're a husband, be a good one. If you're a worker and all you do is dig ditches, be the best dig ditcher on the team. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not with lip service. FOR WHATSOEVER YOU DO, DO AS UNTO THE LORD. NOT AS UNTO MAN, BUT AS UNTO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's true. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, we can see that Satan does everything that he can to try to dissuade, discourage, and try to tear down that which God is doing. And there is something inside of me that will not give up. &gt;&gt; I'm not a quitter. &gt;&gt; Never have been, never will be. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So these things that I've been seeing happening within the message, we either accept it when we see the lukewarm things of life and this trying to steal your ferveny and your passion for this word. Come on. &gt;&gt; We either say, "Well, that's just the way it is. That's the way it will be. I am going to call those things that are not." &gt;&gt; AS THOUGH THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You will never steal my fire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You will never quench it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me just give you a quote here. Again, I told you I'm going to go slow. The brethren only have two pages of notes. So here in the Ephesian church age, brother Bram said, the fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God, it has cooled off and become a bit formal. That is what's happening back there in the Ephesians. Now stop there for a moment. The Ephesians first church age &gt;&gt; within 50 years false prophets, false teachers, &gt;&gt; false Christs, &gt;&gt; different ones. They Hey, oh, Ephesians, I have someone AGAINST YOU. YOU'VE ALREADY LOST YOUR FIRST LOVE. &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? These are the ones that saw Pentecost. &gt;&gt; These are the ones that saw the disciples, the closest that were there. And within just 50 to 70 years &gt;&gt; already different ones coming up claiming this is gone, this has come to pass. The resurrection's already and everything. And Paul said, I have not ceased to warn you day and night for three years &gt;&gt; that after my departing shall come grievous wolves, &gt;&gt; not sparing the flock. So follow al along now as I I I read this. The abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them. Who cares what the world thinks about you? &gt;&gt; Who cares if they think you sisters look funny? They make fun of you. Who cares? &gt;&gt; Some Jezebel out of Hollywood, some movie star who is just an actor. &gt;&gt; That's all they get. Money to act, play something that they're not even &gt;&gt; they're not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That second generation coming on was just like Israel. They demanded a king to be like other nations. When they did that, they rejected God. But they did it anyway. That is the history of the church. When it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God, it isn't long until you see them doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially. They changed their manner of dress, their attitudes and their behavior. They get laxed. That is what Ephesus means. Relaxed, drifting. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. &gt;&gt; Let's not get laxed on this. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in the midst of the greatest moment in the history of mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said that the rapture, which is the consummation, &gt;&gt; is greater than when he said, "Let there be light." And there was light. It's greater than the acts of creation itself. &gt;&gt; So to you young men, stay focused. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you miss this, you're guaranteed tribulation. That's right. &gt;&gt; To miss this Elijah guarantees you'll see the next one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The prophet could see it in the behavior of the people, their manner of dress and their attitude. I too am concerned. And this is a warning to all message believers, not only to my church, but perhaps those who archive or perhaps those who are streaming this service at this very moment. Take inventory of your lives. &gt;&gt; Evening light fellowship, take inventory. &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR WALK WITH GOD? &gt;&gt; Are you becoming lax? ARE YOU BECOMING comfortable with where you're at and letting down the bars? Are you praying more? Are you reading more? Are you listening more? Are you going to church more? &gt;&gt; Or is it happening the opposite? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; Ask yourself &gt;&gt; because the Bible says, "So man, SO LET A MAN EXAMINE HIMSELF." YEAH. &gt;&gt; NOT A TIME to look, well, I'm better than that guy cuz he only comes once every two months. In fact, I'm very concerned because there are people in this church that we see frequent the house of God less and less. The importance on it becomes less and less. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that concern you? &gt;&gt; Yes. for you to become less concerned. &gt;&gt; The very next thing that you will do, you will have a form of religion &gt;&gt; and your children will notice it. And the first thing you sacrifice are your children. You think they're going to want to serve a God like that? You kidding me? &gt;&gt; You're not even You're not even on fire about it, Dad. &gt;&gt; You're looking for every excuse why not to go to church. &gt;&gt; You stay home when you got a headache. You find every excuse in the world. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I bought a piece of land. &gt;&gt; I bought some cows. I'm getting married. &gt;&gt; Since when did getting married keep you out of the house of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I had some kids. You did. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you mothers. Here's again, this just a pastoral thought. Some of you sisters, once you have your first baby, I never see you in the congregation. Where are they? &gt;&gt; Well, we got to have a room in the back because they got to sit there. And the kids, they don't teach the kids. Shut up. &gt;&gt; Sit down. &gt;&gt; I got to entertain them. So, the moment they peep, guess what? They're training you, Mom. &gt;&gt; Oh, here. &gt;&gt; Here. Here. Take this. Here. Here. Take this here. Do something, man. [screaming] Okay. Pack them up. Go into the back room. And you never hear You've not sat through a full sermon since you had your first baby. &gt;&gt; Man, ain't nobody amening me. &gt;&gt; I want you TO BE A GOOD MOTHER, BUT NOT TOO GOOD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BABY THAT LITTLE BRAT. It used to be you mothers, you taught them kids. &gt;&gt; All they did is give you a look. &gt;&gt; I'll take you out, give you some five-fold ministry, &gt;&gt; huh? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, they learn at home. You start teaching them at home. &gt;&gt; Don't wait until you're at church. I see as a minister things creeping into the church that didn't used to be. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes I want to say that I think if we're not careful, &gt;&gt; we have church ordered oursel right out of a spontaneous move of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; excuse me. I don't want to get out of order. that. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Why don't you just let go and let God? &gt;&gt; Some of you have never broke the sound barrier in this church. &gt;&gt; Like I remind you that the older sister, Brother, Brother, you preach so good today. I almost said amen. Try it some. Try it sometime. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Because what you will do when you break that sound barrier. &gt;&gt; You see, when Chuck Joerger had the right stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and he got into that X-15 or whatever it was and they put him and he got there and he got between Mach 1, Mach 2 or something and all of a sudden &gt;&gt; there was a there was a boom, a sonic boom. &gt;&gt; I guess he's done. He's toast. &gt;&gt; Next thing they HEARD [screaming] &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; YEAH. ONCE THEY BROKE THE BARRIER, &gt;&gt; he said, "BUT RIGHT AT THE BARRIER," HE SAID, "THIS THING BEGAN TO SHAKE, RATTLE, ROLL." IT'S [screaming] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden &gt;&gt; speedometer starts getting way up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That'll happen to you. &gt;&gt; That'll happen to you. YOU WILL YOU WILL SAY IT'S UNLIMITED NOW. I done BROKE THROUGH THE PERIOD. UH MY MY MY VEIL WHICH HAS KEPT ME BACK. THIS THIS HUMAN VEIL WHICH IS TRYING TO HINDER ME. &gt;&gt; I DIED TO SELF. I I HAD DEATH TO SELF AND I SAID AMEN. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doing you good. &gt;&gt; It will make you get so happy your feet will dance. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You get excited. &gt;&gt; This is something to get excited about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a minister, I see signs creeping in. &gt;&gt; I SEE SOME CHURCHES. WATCH. NOW, watch the two extremes. &gt;&gt; The cold formal &gt;&gt; church where they just sit there and brother Ram said, "Watch if the pastor is cold formal and he's a teacher type and they sit there and they just try to absorb it." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Then the other side," he said, "you got that fanatical element." &gt;&gt; He said, "You got emotions and jumping and shouting." HE SAID, "WATCH THE PASTOR. IF HE'S THAT WAY, SO IS the church." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I do not want clones of me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want clones of him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be like me. I don't even like being my like me myself. &gt;&gt; Any of you ever get that way? &gt;&gt; You do something wrong. Have you had any brains? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cold, formal &gt;&gt; or fanatical, emotional? Now, I would rather have a little wildfire than no fire. &gt;&gt; And yet, I don't want our wildfire to turn into strange fire &gt;&gt; to start saying things and doing things that didn't happen in the prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; But there must be a balance. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother said the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; God help us evening life fellowship to have a middle of the road gospel. &gt;&gt; Not too fanatical and not too starchy. &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of the road if God wants to do something here among us. Hallelujah. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I tell you it Wednesday night, &gt;&gt; brother Mario, you were hitting it, buddy. &gt;&gt; You were just hitting. I tell you what. You was hitting it left and right and everything and you said, "Now in closing, you were 15 minutes early." &gt;&gt; Eric said, "You're kidding me. I came here hungry." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want some little appetizer, some little golden nugget from McDonald's. &gt;&gt; I want a T-bone. I know. I want something I can Hey, do you realize how much hassle I had to get to church? &gt;&gt; The wife and the kids and the dog &gt;&gt; and telephone calls and distractions and the car didn't start and I got a notice on my cell phone that I'm overdrawn at the bank. I'M HAVING A HARD DAY. LET HONEY, LET'S GO TO CHURCH. YEAH. WELL, the kids and you getting caught. Sometimes I think we need to reverse it. The wife is there getting all the kids ready and everything like that. Well, let her go sit in the car and you get the kids ready and then she'll sit there and honk. E My wife honked several times at me the other day. [laughter] Give me a break. I'm sorry, honey. every time I honk at you and is I didn't like it. &gt;&gt; I had stuff to do. &gt;&gt; Now, just as a local pastor, &gt;&gt; let's bring it down home. I want to bring it to where you're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as a pastor watches over the local sheep, you husbands watch over your families. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You take inventory. You look, you look at your kids. &gt;&gt; Huh? And then mothers, watch over your children because you're the fifth gospel. You're the backbone of the church. &gt;&gt; Mothers, I want you to mother, but not too good. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Listen, the world does not revolve around your children. It revolves around him. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless the Love All family who all the way from Baghdad &gt;&gt; would get their families, put them in the cars, drive that cut off road. I tell you what, I've been to Baghdad several times and I don't like that cut off road. I get car sick and I'm driving. But they put their kids in there. Brother Mike said, "Brother Ron, most of my kids would eat their supper on their way to church and then they started to go to sleep on their way home. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, without sacrifice, &gt;&gt; there's no blessing." &gt;&gt; They could have had every excuse in the world. an hour, hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes and we got to go to church on Wednesday night. Some of you that have a hard time coming on Wednesday night, you say, "Well, I'm busy join the club." &gt;&gt; Which one of us are not busy? &gt;&gt; Which one of us on Wednesday night especially because you know what? Listen, you have to redeem the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about things that I see that come in here that if we're not careful, they just keep coming and and pretty soon they have more greater precedence than the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The Bible says man examine himself first. So I ask all of us take take a good look at yourself. How are you doing? How is your walk with God? ARE YOU BECOMING MORE on fire or are you quenching the spirit &gt;&gt; or are you GRIEVING THE SPIRIT WHEREBY you are sealed to the day of your redemption? &gt;&gt; So I'm going to be I'm going I say this that if the husband is not in his position &gt;&gt; it makes the whole family dysfunctional. True. &gt;&gt; Now, you brethren, quit trying to get the wife in order when you're not. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Thou shalt not steal." Do you steal? [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I I could really press it down here right now, but I just I wish to show you something that is really not spoken about a whole lot within the message, but I want to share it with you. I want you to turn with me in your Bibles to Galatians chapter 6. Galatians chapter 6 vers 6-10. [snorts] Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. So here you have a teacher and a student. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let him that teacheth. Okay. Who taught the word communi who is being taught the word communicate unto him that teacheth &gt;&gt; in all good things. Be not deceived. &gt;&gt; God is not mocked. So, Brother Mario did a great job on deception at the end time, but this is another great deception here. You deceive yourselves. &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he also reap. For he that sweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, &gt;&gt; but he that sweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. &gt;&gt; So let us not be weary in welloing. For in due season we shall reap if we faint not. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are the household of faith. Amen. Amen. So this scriptural application here is not really talked about within the message but I wish to share this with you today because it says let him communicate that that Greek word in the New Testament communicate coonia which the first Bible study I ever went to in my life when brother Mitch Buckingham asked me to go to his Bible study that he I had with some friends a Presbyterian minister. The name of that was called Coonia. I said, "Coonia, what does coonia mean?" He said, "Fellowship." Wow. Okay. Let him communicate. Coonia, it means to share with others. Communicate. It means to distribute or to be a partaker of. So it's not just sitting there observing, it's becoming a partaker. &gt;&gt; So let's take it a little bit farther. Let's expound on this. It's called reciprocid. Reciprocity. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Say it out loud. &gt;&gt; Reciprocity. In other words, RECIPROCATION. WHAT GOOD IS it for a teacher to teach and you don't reciprocate? You just sit there like a cow looking at a new gate. &gt;&gt; YOU SIT ON THE PEW AND you do not get into it. &gt;&gt; You're just spectating. Oh, looks like he's all excited. He's sweating. Oh, he's getting loud. &gt;&gt; Some of you I can't wait to see God get a hold of you and shake you like a rag doll. &gt;&gt; I've got a dog [snorts] that when she gets a hold of a little squeaker toy, I throw it and she gets it and she grabs a hold of that. Drives my wife nuts and I laugh and she gets a and then I got some little rag toys and I throw it and she grabs a hold of it. She shakes that thing. Her head is a blur. &gt;&gt; I can't wait for God to get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; And you who sit there who don't want to get out of order, who just I'm watching you, brother Ron. Because on the day of Pentecost, you know what they were doing? &gt;&gt; Sitting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were just sitting. And the Bible says, "And there came a sound &gt;&gt; from heaven &gt;&gt; as a rushing mighty &gt;&gt; wind." &gt;&gt; And it began to fill &gt;&gt; this whole room with his presence. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE CAME DOWN AND IT SPLIT UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LITTLE LICKS OF FIRE, TONGUES OF FIRE, SAT UPON EACH ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; And you know what HAPPENED TO THEM? THEY GOT SHOOK. &gt;&gt; MAN, [screaming] &gt;&gt; they that were afraid OF THE JEWS, &gt;&gt; THEY THAT WERE AFRAID OF THE ROMANS, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IF THEY FIND US? THEY'RE GOING TO KILL US. CLOSE THE DOOR. BOLTED. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY KNOW WHO WE ARE. LET ME TELL YOU, when that liquifier came on them, they became so bold, &gt;&gt; they kicked that door open, they walked out. They started claiming the great mighty powerful things of God. You let God come in there and THE HOLY SPIRIT GRAB A HOLD of you. It'll it'll so quicken you. It'll get you beyond, well, I'm just not that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're Oh, you're not. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever touched something and you got shocked? &gt;&gt; You ever plugged something in all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; You said, "Man, &gt;&gt; I remember the Yeah, it got my attention." All right. I had a friend of mine. He said, "You want to be an electrician?" "Yeah." "Yeah." Went out, bought all the tools, got me the nice nippers, the clines. You know, I spent 65 bucks for a nice pair of clines. You cut through big wires and everything like that. He said, "Okay, brother Ron, just start cutting wire." Oh, man. I know how to cut. Yeah. I mean, lights go out, sparks go everywhere. Brand new pair of clients. It ate a hole through They were not cheap either. &gt;&gt; You know what they called me on the job from then on? &gt;&gt; Sparky. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Sparky. Then he told me, he said, "Okay." He said, "Take this outlet that you got some outlets, you know, you got the two outlets. Take it. Take that top screw and bottom screw out and take that off and go ahead and Yeah. He didn't tell me it's still hot. &gt;&gt; Good grief. I take it off and then I grab on both sides. &gt;&gt; The positive and negative met. &gt;&gt; When the negative of YOU &gt;&gt; CATCHES THE POSITIVE OF GOD'S REVELATION, [screaming] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME? PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; He'll make you move. All right. I promise you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as electricity causes you to move. DO YOU KNOW everything around us? &gt;&gt; Everything around us has to do with fire. &gt;&gt; You go outside. &gt;&gt; El Saul in the sky is a fiery ball. &gt;&gt; Without that, you'd be frozen. &gt;&gt; Yep. You might be chosen, but you'd be frozen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything affects you by fire. &gt;&gt; You came here by a car, unless you got a Tesla and then you got you got electrical, but it came here by town. But the rest of you got spontaneous combustion. You got a chamber. You got gas. You put it the gas in the chamber. It ignites. You're pissing. And you came to church, you took a shower, took a bath, you washed your face. Guess what? Hot water. I hate cold water to shower in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were in South Africa over there and had a nice little Airbnb and everything. And we had traveled all day to get there. And man, I'm tired. I'm hot and sweaty, greasy. I want to take a shower. And I go in there and you turn on the knob and you think, well, it's not all the way or which way is hot, cold. A lot of times they don't tell you. Anyway, I sit there, wait for 20 minutes. No. Okay. Turn it the other way. Time. You got to be kidding me. So, I take a cold shower. Don't take me long to shower when it's cold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I get out of there. My goodness, that's cold. I did that for two days because the people who at the reception this was and guess what? Nobody's there on Sunday. So, man, I don't have anybody to tell. So, anyway, finally after two days, I've had it. I want a hot. [snorts] I finally get to the reception. Hey, how much you guys studio whatever number 22? We ain't got no hot water. Well, we'll try to find No, you're not going to try to find Send somebody right now. I want to take a hot shower. I go over there. You know what? They You know what? It was just the breaker. Well, I don't know which breaker it is. I'm not going to go here tripping breakers. [snorts] It has been my lot in life for some reason that when I go to take a shower, something goes wrong. I don't I'm I'm just telling you we stayed at the Frankfurt Sherin. Wow. Five star. This is Brother Floyd Patterson. He got brother Ron. We're staying at the Frankfurt Sherin right there at the airport. Yeah, man. I never I'm using at Holiday Inner, you know. [laughter] So, we I get in there. Oh, man. Yeah. I kind of like this. Oo, nice bed. Go in there, start get in the shower, brother Joel. I get my I had hair then. Get my hair, get it all soaked up and everything like that. They go those squirt bottles on the wall like this. I dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble. Okay, wait a second. Just just wait. I wait 10 15 minutes. Nothing. Okay. What do you do? You got soap all over you. Okay. All right. Well, I go to the tank above the toilet. I take off the lid. I put water. I didn't out of the toilet bowl. Out of the canister ABOVE IT. GUYS, DON'T LAUGH. [screaming] I CAUGHT THAT SON. That guy's pretty stupid, you know. So, I got the tank. I finally Okay. So, I got enough of the soap off me. I called the front desk and I said, "Hey, hey, you guys." They said, "Well, what room are you? I'm in this and this." Said, "Okay, well, you know, look." And I said, "We're leaving a little bit. We We got to go to a meeting, but I'll be back and okay, we'll fix it." Okay, great. Great. Great. No problem. So, I came back later that day and and I called the front desk. Did you guys fix it? Yeah, we sent a technician there and it's no problem and everything. And so the next day I go to take a shower again and I run it and I run the water and everything like that and I I'm 10 minutes in the shower just uh Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Finally lather up, man. Two time two days in a row &gt;&gt; again. They said, "Well, Mr. Peterson, we're going to comp you. We're going to give you free room for those two days." Well, thank you. Thank you. But I would have rather had a hot hot shower. Do you understand? Anyway, I don't know why I told you guys that. It just So, anyway, it happens everywhere I go. Happened just the other day, three, four days ago. I'm at down in Tucson, nice motel, and it doesn't say hot or cold. It doesn't have any indication. So, I think turn it all the way and it's going to get hot. It doesn't. This was opposite. Jonathan, you just had to turn it just a little bit and then go figure, man. That that anyway, I don't know why I'm telling you this. Just there are certain things that frustrate me that's a anyway now reciprocity whatever it is reciprocation let's use that I can say that reciprocation there must be a reciprocation in other words you must communicate back to him that teaches &gt;&gt; do you understand that &gt;&gt; Christ poured out his life and he expects a return on his investment Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD IS AN AWARD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; He gave talents &gt;&gt; to some 10 to another five, a couple two. And when he came back, he expected. What did you bring back? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And the one who said, "Oh, I know he's a he's an aura of God, and he really demands, SO I HID IT, and I didn't lose it. OH, I I CAME BACK AND I still have the one talent you gave me. And just the opposite of what you thought, go, "Oh, good and faithful servant. You're so good. You kept the one talent. You're so good." No, he said, "Take what he's got and give it to the guy that's got 10." &gt;&gt; God expects reciprocation &gt;&gt; from what he has done for you. that you might do something for the church. That you might do SOMETHING FOR HIM. QUIT asking &gt;&gt; like John F. Kennedy. It's not what you ask what your country can do for you. &gt;&gt; Ask what you can do for your country. &gt;&gt; Quit asking what is this church going to do for you. What are you going to do for this church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let there be a reciprocation. &gt;&gt; Let there be you to to coonia. WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH ANOTHER. HOW DARE THAT GOD GIVE EVERYTHING AND then he gets nothing in return. HE GAVE TO HIS UTTERMOST &gt;&gt; PARTY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then WE CAN COME TO CHURCH AND WE DON'T RECIPROCATE. WE SIT THERE AND we don't enter in in worship. Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't know. That troubles me when I see people that don't reciprocate. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "He that is forgiven much, &gt;&gt; I guess that's why I love him the way I do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I love him with a &gt;&gt; with a passion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I gave him my old teddy garment. He gave me a robe of pure white. I'm feasting on heavenly manner. And that's why I'm singing tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You got to communicate back. Isaiah 55:11 SAYS, "SHOW, SO SHALL MY word that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall NOT RETURN UNTO ME VOID, &gt;&gt; BUT IT SHALL ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH I PLEASE, &gt;&gt; and it shall prosper in the thing, whether I sent it, whereto I sent it, &gt;&gt; MY WORD DOES NOT come back empty or worthless." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God expects a return. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD EXPECTS PRAISE ON YOUR LIP. &gt;&gt; GOD EXPECTS YOU TO RECIPROCATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE. &gt;&gt; Thank you for WHAT YOU'VE DONE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR CALVARY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Every one of you. &gt;&gt; Don't let it be that brother Robert has to &gt;&gt; say, "Come on, raise your hand." &gt;&gt; How about you becoming the song leader and brother Robert, let them go sit out there &gt;&gt; or you go sit out there. Do you know how hard you pull &gt;&gt; now? &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I I say this and I love you as my brother. I'm so happy to have you as a song leader and as as one of the &gt;&gt; my lead song leader. You don't have the most beautiful voice. &gt;&gt; And so do I. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; you got the most beautiful spirit. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for talent. I don't care if you can't really carry the tune. &gt;&gt; I love to see brother Robert and you know what he does? He gets into it. And I said, "Brother Robert," I said, "When you get into it," I said, "Don't leave them out there OBSERVING YOU. BRING THEM WITH YOU." &gt;&gt; And so NOW HE GETS OUT HERE. HE GETS BESIDES HERE. I LOVE HIM. DON'T YOU? AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GET IN AND YOU ARE BROUGHT WITH HIM. HOW DARE YOU sit there and not reciprocate? &gt;&gt; Christ poured out his life. &gt;&gt; He expects something in return and multiply. &gt;&gt; Press down. Amen. &gt;&gt; David poured out his life &gt;&gt; and killed one giant. &gt;&gt; He poured out his life before men and they killed many of Goliath's brothers. &gt;&gt; He put an investment. &gt;&gt; They reciprocated. &gt;&gt; The teacher is now being kept by those who were taught. Which one of you plants a garden and don't eat of it? Which one of you has a milk cow and doesn't drink the milk? Which one of you go to work for a nice boss and don't expect a nice paycheck? &gt;&gt; I tell you, you wouldn't be there very long. I don't care how much you like your job. If you didn't get that nice paycheck, &gt;&gt; it is not fair for God to pour all he had &gt;&gt; without expecting something. &gt;&gt; But I'm afraid we have become of welfare mentality. Let me explain that. We have so many free giveaway programs, we become a socialist government, &gt;&gt; Marxist. &gt;&gt; We have kids that play soccer. It doesn't matter if there's a a winning team and a losing team and every But all the teams get trophies now just because you played &gt;&gt; because I don't want to be second. Well, tough. Sorry. Huh? &gt;&gt; Play better. &gt;&gt; Huh? Get into the game. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening right now in America. &gt;&gt; We have so many that want to stay home and work from home. They don't want to go back to work again. &gt;&gt; We have hundreds of thousands of offices that are empty &gt;&gt; because they don't want to go to work. You know what I have to do? &gt;&gt; I have to get dressed. &gt;&gt; I have to comb my hair. I have to get there on time. &gt;&gt; But we're becoming a socialist society. Without sacrifice, there's no blessing. &gt;&gt; People tend to think that the prophet of God never got down or discouraged. He didn't see all this reciprocation to his own ministry. In fact, he finally one day he said, "I've lost the feeling for the people because what good has all this done? All of the labor, all of the ministry, all of the times, all of this of going and traveling and preaching, he didn't see evening life fellowship and end time ministry. He didn't see all kinds of people coming. &gt;&gt; I think I'll just go up into Canada, become a trapper, forget this stuff. It wasn't that he didn't that he quit loving God. He lost the feeling for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there was no reciprocation. You remember the time that brother Brennham he he got to bragging about he could swim? Oh man. Daddy. He told his uncle and his daddy, I'm a swimmer. Oh, you are? Watch this. Look at this quote. Here it is. 12:05. [snorts] redemption in completeness in joy. I used to tell my uncle and my daddy, "Oh, I can Oh, I can see swim in this little pond up here in Utica Pike." One day, daddy went back and sat on a culvert and said, "I want to see you swim." Little pond was about that deep, but I was just standing on a soap box. I stripped off my belongings and got on my uh nose like this and sprang up and splashed down the soap box hit and the mud flew both ways and I began to splash the mud. I said, "HOW AM I DOING, DAD? Get out there swimming, mud crawling all the time." We got a lot of mud crawling church members, too. &gt;&gt; That's right. Mud crawlers. Yes, sir. I call them what do you what do you call what's this when &gt;&gt; dog pal &gt;&gt; dogg pal how many you look at me swim I'm swimming man you ain't swimming you're dog crawling brother Jonathan when you and I were he and I in the boat together I said come on he said I don't really swim well I put on a vest and everything little mask and snorkel come on jump out of the boat he did bless you Brother Jonathan, but it made you nervous, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't a swimmer. &gt;&gt; But I said, it's it's deep. It was only 12 feet, but 12 ft, you ain't 13t tall. Your feet couldn't touch the bottom if you don't know how to swim. So he dogped, but he was sitting there and brother Ram said he called it mud crawling. Look at this. [snorts] We got a lot of mud crawlers out there. Oh my. My my uncle Jesse got a hold of me one day on the boat. We got some guys that they ain't going to baby their boys. Yeah. You tell me you can swim. Watch what one day my uncle got me out on the boat and I was popping off about swimming out there over the Ohio River about 20 foot of water. He just took over the or knocked me off in the water and said, "Now what about it?" Amen. Hallelujah. [laughter] Ah, God give us more uncles and say, "Oh, you want to swim here?" &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is, what good is it for the ministry to give and give and give and not reciprocate? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking just about the men. We're talking about Christ and his church. &gt;&gt; The little Shounomite recognized that Elijah needed a place to rest and relax himself. So she said, "I want to build a little house." Do you know that brother Brandham told brother Charlie Cox and sister Nelly as the Shunomite woman of the Old Testament, you have become a place that I can come rest. Now, I was at Billy or excuse me, at at brother Charlie Cox's house and I was there and he was telling me and I happened to go with brother Floyd Patterson and we were invited back there and we went to all the different places and he I said, "What was it like, brother Charlie?" He said, "Brother Brandon would come here by himself. He'd drive up and he said he'd get out of the car." He said, "Brother Ron, honestly, it looked like he'd been in a fight. He was so worn and so tired. He'd been preaching conventions and he got up there and he said he just looked beaten. He said, we didn't say nothing to him. We just said, "Brother, brother Bill, go on in there. Uh, here's your room. [snorts] Why don't you go in and relax or sit on the front porch on a rocking chair? When Nelly's got dinner ready, we'll we'll call you." And so he did. And he didn't say much when he came to the dinner table. He didn't say much. Wasn't a time for them to have questions and answers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Wasn't a time to just say, "Hey, hey, Brother Bill, I was thinking the other day when I was reading the scripture and I read this over here and everything." No, you know what? They they said, "We just let him rest, relax." And he said after two or three days and in fact he said brother Brennham when I would put the prophet to bed he said I'd go in there and I would tuck him in. He said I'd bring the he get in and he said I bring the covers up and I'd take his arms and cross them over like this or this. And brother said thank you. and he laid there and he was so tired that brother Charlie would open the door to peek in to see how he's doing and brother Brennham hadn't moved all night. He was so tired. Do you know that brother Brennham said that hunting is an excuse for me to get away from the people? &gt;&gt; I got a quote. I'm going to show you that. Charlie Cox would take brother Brennham because brother Brennon one of his favorite things was just to go hunting. So they but after about two or three days, brother Brennham got to talking at the dinner table. He said to Charlie, Charlie, have you found where all the Yeah, brother Brennham, I know. Well, let's go now. Brother Brenham says in this, "As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee." 1960. I want to say to this to the church now, I got to tell you some things that's been going on. A lot of times you think I'm hunting. I'm not hunting. That's an excuse to keep people from following me. I have to go there to be alone with God. I'm not going out hunting, friends. Yes, I'm hunting, but not that kind of hunt. Isn't this amazing? I want to ask you, what was he doing when there was a blast that came to him and seven angels appeared? He was hunting. He was hunting. He was getting a away alone. And brother Roy Borders told me this. Musicians have become I'm going to close. I I I've laid a foundation for something for the next time that I minister. Brother Roy Borders, his manager, who I happen to to take hunting for several days and he had cancer real bad and wasn't feeling good. So I'd put him on a horse and take him to the to the blind where he was he would sit and I'd make sure he had his food and everything and I'd come back and I say check on him during and then come pick him up late in the evening. And one morning he said, "Brother Ron, I I don't feel good. Do you mind if we just stay in the cabin?" I said, "No, if you'll tell me some stories." These men, he said, "You know, Brother Ron," he says, "Uh, I was in charge of getting the men to come and go hunting with Brother Brenamman." And he said, "Brother Brennham, I would run by the names of the brother." Yes, that's fine. That brother. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good. He said, "But Brother Roy, please tell the brethren to not ask me any spiritual questions. I'm out there to rest. So, Brother Roy would tell all the brethren, "Now, Brother Bram's going to be here, and I don't want you to ask him questions." He said, "Now, as it is, every time we go, guess what? God always provides a way." And Brother Brennham drops into a channel at some time, begins to tell the brethren spiritually what's going on. &gt;&gt; But one brother His claim to fame was, he said, "Brother Brandham, do you ever see a vision while you're out here?" This is on tape. He said, "Immediately, I dropped into a vision. I see your mother. Your mother's got appendages between her toes. You got something wrong with your eye." And and anyway, that was his great claim to fame. Here's the rest of the story that the rest of you will never know. He said, "Underst understand that when he broke that cardinal rule, he was never asked to go hunting with brother Brandham again." Because the very thing I said, "Don't don't ask him." Do you see what I'm saying? And yet, there were so many people that wanted to go hunting with brother Brandham, that wanted to be there, but all of them said, or were told, "Please, he's out here to just relax. when he sits around the campfire and he starts sharing the things that's different. But don't go to pulling on his gift. Now, my sermon as I titled it, I don't even know if I told the brothers the title. Refueling the fire within you. Refueling the fire within you. And the subject it's lamp trimming time. &gt;&gt; Now you all that have got an oil lamp and you put the fire and you know if you let that fire burn, burn, burn, eventually the oil goes down. Now brother Brennham said there is one baptism of the Holy Spirit but many refillings. &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to ask you, how's the gauge on your lamp right now? Is it reading full or empty? &gt;&gt; Oh, because we've been burning, burning, burning. You know what some of us need? &gt;&gt; I put myself in there, too. &gt;&gt; We need another refilling. We need a refueling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Did you know that Elijah did not get a double portion until he ministered back to Elijah? How many you know that brother Brennham says and the Bible says Elijah did not get it until he watered or poured water over the hands of Elijah. He reciprocated back. &gt;&gt; You know, one of the ways that we can give a scripture application of giving back to God is your tithing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not your money that God is actually wanting. He He's wanting you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just ask you a question. How about the tithing of your time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I began to figure it out. We got a 24 hours in a day, seven days a week. That's 168 hours. out of 168 hours in the week, you have 50 hours that I'm just roughly 50 hours that you go to work because you drive to work and you got 40 hour work week etc etc and you go to lunch you got a 50 hour work week minus that from 168 gives 118 and most of you sleep eight hours a day and if you don't get your eight hours and you have to catch up on that. And some of you don't need a full 8 hours, but let's just say 8 hours of sleep. Then you got 60. So that leaves 62. Then you got eating, getting dressed, hobbies, going to the gym, your iPad. So now you're down to less than 50 hours of the rest of the week of what you what you do with it. That that's yours. It's personal. But God says, "Would you give me one/10enth of what's onetenth of 50?" Can you give him five hours? &gt;&gt; And when we come to church, it's not just coming. It's not attendance. &gt;&gt; It's getting into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I went to church. That's okay. But did you get into it? &gt;&gt; Last quote here. Christ is revealed the same. Usually a revival lasts about three years, but this has gone on for many years. Now the revival fires are quietening down. Enthusiasm of the people is dying off and you can see it in the old [snorts] temple of Vesta in Rome. When the fires went out, the people went home. But we're trying to rebuild these fires again on every hill that we can. I cannot do it. No minister can. It takes all of us together in prayer and believing and trusting God to see the Holy Spirit continue to bless his people. as we wait on his coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This is a concerted effort. &gt;&gt; It's not just the pastor. &gt;&gt; It's not just the ministry. It's us together. &gt;&gt; You understand this? &gt;&gt; Reciprocate. When we have song service, get into it. What's wrong with it? Clap it. Listen. I used to go to sporting games and you know what? If I ever went to a Dbacks game [music] and there's people around, they're all talking or what I'm watching the game. Sorry. Watching the game. That's why I paid the money. I'm watching the game. Even if I got a hot dog. I'm watching the game. I get into the game when it's it's crazy, brother Robert, when I go to watch these guys play baseball, softball, okay, I root for every one of them. Come on, Austin. Hit that ball. SMACK THAT THING. PLAY BALL, BOYS. Get into the game. &gt;&gt; I do. I Brother Paul and I, we used to sit there and you know what? And it's dangerous to sit in your pole. Yeah. Did you see that? Did you SEE THAT CAT CATCH he made? Yeah, I did. YEAH. YEAH. GOOD. GOOD. THAT'S MY GRANDSON. YEAH. I have been that way my whole life. &gt;&gt; When I go to watch these guys play ball, most of the time I'm watching them play ball. And you know, brother Paul, what what I've said and you know what I I stick up for my team, too. One time there was a guy on first base and he got to yelling at something. There was a play somewhere and and I think a play at Homer and he was yelling that the umpire called him out or something like this and he was yelling at our guys. I jumped up into the fence, HEY YOU FIRST BASEMAN, SHUT YOUR MOUTH. [laughter] All of my team looking over at me. Yeah, you I'm Oh, excuse me, guys. Yeah, sorry. &gt;&gt; You know what I do? I stick up for my team and I stick up for this team. &gt;&gt; We are the 18. &gt;&gt; And when we play, I want you to play with all you got. &gt;&gt; Go hard or go home. &gt;&gt; Go hard or you go home. &gt;&gt; Get into this game. Amen. &gt;&gt; When we come to church, &gt;&gt; I want you to enter in. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to observe. &gt;&gt; I'd like to take all of you young boys, one of these days. I want to do it. Take you guys all to a maybe a Dback's game or something like that. I'm not into all of those sports and you guys know that. But I'd like to take you to the game and I don't want to see how you act when you're there if you sit like you do in church. &gt;&gt; I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the wind up in the pitch. &gt;&gt; YEAH. SMACK THERE. GO AND ALL THE WAY TO THE WALL. YOU CAN TOUCH THEM ALL AND YOU GOT YEAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY TEAM. WELL, how about once in a while? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you get a little beside yourself. No, [snorts] I'm not asking for something that ain't real. Because if you don't mean it, don't do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Genuine. Genuine. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to talk about refueling the fire. I had another nine pages of notes that I thought, you know what, I don't want to go into that because it'll make this service too long. as it is. I only had two pages of quotes to give you guys [music] and normally you got nine or 10, but you know, hey, it it's it's enough because there is something inside of me &gt;&gt; that is telling me I do not accept lukewarmness. I want to I don't want a burnout. &gt;&gt; I want a breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Flame on. &gt;&gt; I want to be so on fire for God. &gt;&gt; The older I get, I don't want to just Well, &gt;&gt; praise God. Huh? &gt;&gt; I'm more on fire for him now than I was when I was 18. &gt;&gt; I have got a greater passion now. &gt;&gt; And yet my body. &gt;&gt; Huh? As much as I want it to jump, I tell it to jump. It don't. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Anyway, I love you guys. All of you. But we can do better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. God is not mocked. You that have been so into the flesh and you wonder why you're not getting into the spirit like you should. Don't mock God. If we took the amount of time of when you log in in your prayer and you log out, the time you read your Bible, log in and log out. The time that you listen to a tape, log in and log out. How much time do you have in 24 hours that you've given to God? Some of you, sorry, you you haven't been showing up for work. You ain't even logged in. I want all of you to take inventory of yourself and say, "I can do better." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, if you're the coach or you're the captain of the team, I'll take correction. &gt;&gt; Will you receive the correction? &gt;&gt; Huh? Amen. &gt;&gt; If you not been doing what you should be doing, will you be honest with yourself &gt;&gt; and say, "I'll try to do better." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I just been caught up and my work and the kids and life in general has just kind of got me bogged down, but I would like to do better. How many would agree with me and say, "I'd like to do better." &gt;&gt; Paul, come up here and stand with me. Steve, come up here and stand with me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I only had three stand up, so I wanted them to come here. You got my back. Get up here, Paul. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, get up your men. Do you guys see him kind of all crippled up? Do you know he's a battle scard veteran? How many years you spent in the hospital? Since Since uh 2005, right up till now. 2005 till now because you got all shot up and wounded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, I see you lay down here. &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to be in battle? &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; Brian, you come on Monday mornings. Sometimes you come a little bit late. That's okay. And I say and you come up. You say, "Brother, brother, I want you to know my wife and I were talking. You I love what you said. Is it many times you say that?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "My wife and I, we was talking about this and this very same thing." &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother Paul. I have noticed that many times I start talking and everything. I say, "I don't even tell anybody." Next thing you know, Yes. with men like this behind me. Just stand right here. Stand. Come. Come right here. Come on. Just stand right behind me. &gt;&gt; I got great men. &gt;&gt; I got great men. I'm not worthy. &gt;&gt; Is it him? It's him in us. &gt;&gt; Why do you get so fanatical, Paul? &gt;&gt; I love him so much. &gt;&gt; You do? &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; Well, so do I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason that I get EMOTIONAL WHEN YOU GET emotional cuz I can't help it. &gt;&gt; I'm an emotional kind of guy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he that's forgiven much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to go into battle? &gt;&gt; Life and death. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've gone into the forest with my rifle in my hand. I ain't never had anybody shooting back at me. I've been hunting deer for help. Do you guys know what he's been through when he comes and he lays here at this altar before service? I don't know if any of you have seen him. He can't get his legs straight, so he lays with his leg out. He tries to get up. When I have men like that that will lay on their face before God, Thank you &gt;&gt; brother. &gt;&gt; Thank you brotherless. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your servitude. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you pressing the battle. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to bring all of you up here. I would and say, "Okay, let's all make a recommitment, but we can't do it." Do you know how proud I am of you? Like you four girls that came up here and sang. And all of you, I watched you as you left. I watched you. I I looked at your skirts. I looked at as you left. I thought God bless him. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I said, "Why?" Look at them. In an age of laa, you have the boldness &gt;&gt; to live for God, to keep your face washed, &gt;&gt; TO NOT DO WHAT THE REST OF THEM DO. FOR easy is it to go the way of the many, &gt;&gt; BUT BROAD IS the great, &gt;&gt; is the gate that leads to destruction, and many go therein. &gt;&gt; Amen. But narrow is the way, &gt;&gt; straight is the gate &gt;&gt; that leads to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all today. [snorts] If I preach the legalism of this message, it just makes you harder. That's all it does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Preach to your kids the law and they'll rebuild. &gt;&gt; Preach to them the love of Jesus Christ and get them to fall in love with him. You don't have to preach the law anymore. You know what &gt;&gt; the love of God compels them? Because Jesus said, "What's the difference between them and you? &gt;&gt; If you love me, &gt;&gt; you keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; That's all. That's what happened to me years ago. 18 year old boy. I fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I was doing. I still don't know what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; All I know I fell in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Apostle Paul with all that he did, the wife and I were reading the other day said, "Five times I've been beaten with 40 stripes, save one." Five times. Three times I've been hit with rods. Three times shipwrecked. in danger of false brethren, in danger of peril. He goes on and on. I thought, you know what? My my wife said, "Ron, what do you think Paul's back looked like? What do you think his back looked like? He bore the scars of what he believed in his body and he loved God with a ferveny. And the more they tried to beat it out of him, the more resolve he had. &gt;&gt; What a man. I can't wait to see Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't wait to see brother Brandham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't wait to see those saints &gt;&gt; to embrace them and say, "What did I do? &gt;&gt; What did I do in this day?" Not much really. Not compared to any of those guys. &gt;&gt; But I do want to be say to be said of me, "Enter in my good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; Enter into the joys of the Lord." &gt;&gt; So whatever I've got to do, let me do it with all I have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not with lip service, &gt;&gt; but with a passion and a fortitude. &gt;&gt; And let me be so on fire with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to be some lukewarm. &gt;&gt; No. Let me fall in love with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, falling in love. stand this morning with Jesus. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Falling in [singing] love with [music] Jesus. &gt;&gt; Falling in [music and singing] love with Jesus was the best thing [singing and music] I've ever done in his arms.
