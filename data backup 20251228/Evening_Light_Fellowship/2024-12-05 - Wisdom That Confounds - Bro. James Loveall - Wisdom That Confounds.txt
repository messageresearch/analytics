you we thank you we'll be sure to give you the praise the honor and the glory in Jesus precious name amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we're going to turn to Proverbs 2 and proverbs 4 thank you musicians it's hard to believe it's the last month of the year how fast time is going seems like this past year there's been a lot of valleys a lot of Trials seems a little bit more than mountain tops but that's okay he said I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and yet you're still here you're still here you're still fighting you're still at your Posta Duty on a Wednesday night Sir so if you look in Proverbs 2 in verse one we're just going to read to verse 11 and I'll emphasize afterward a few of the scriptures but let's just read this passage here my son if thou Wilt receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thy hearing unto wisdom and apply thy heart unto understanding yeah if Thou criest after knowledge and lifteth up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches her as for hid Treasures then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his the Saints then Thou shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment iniquity yay every good path right when wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee let's turn to proverbs 4 and verse 5 few pages over verse 5 reads get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding am you can have your seats this evening so as we read here in Proverbs a few scriptures i' would like to look at here in verse two says in Proverbs 2 it says so that thou incline thine hearing they hear unto wisdom and apply thy heart to understanding y If thy criest after knowledge and lifteth up thy voice for understanding you see sometimes God just doesn't give you everything that you have to know sometimes you're going to have to cry a cry after understanding we live in a society that is if you ask of something you expect it to receive it now but here the scripture is saying incline thine ear sometimes you got to increase your ear unto hearing yeah you have to get into the scriptures you have to listen to the tapes incline thy hearing to get wisdom and you have to apply thine heart to get understanding and if th criest after knowledge sometimes it takes your voice to call unto God to bring him on the scene amen you know many times that we get slack in our ways and we begin to think that you know it's easier to ask our dad for wisdom or ask our p and go to different ones and say what would you do in this situation how should I handle this situation but the Bible's telling us sometimes you got to apply your heart to get understanding you're going to have to apply yourself very good the scripture here that we read for wisdom and understanding is what's going to keep you it's not your pastor's Revelation it's not your parents' Revelation or understanding it's not the knowledge that they have but you are kept by the power of God and as I begin to look at this thought that I was you know just begin to ponder over and I believe as an individual if we can get one thing and that we need more of each one of us can say that we need more wisdom we need more understanding of who God is and the wisdom to apply it to our lives you see not every not everyone will see it the way you do sometimes God shows you things he gives you thoughts and he he begins to reveal himself unto you but yet it's not for everybody else it begins to deal with your heart and I believe that whenever you get wisdom and understanding you begin to grow in Christ you know for us to gain wisdom it just doesn't help us just in our spiritual walk it just doesn't help us in our natural or in our spiritual walk with Christ and being able to understand the scriptures more but wisdom begins to allow you to understand how to be a better father how to be a better son how to be a better friend because how do I handle this certain situation maybe you have an argument with your son and you begin to battle it out and you begin in this big old argument and you don't know how to handle it well you're lacking in wisdom maybe you handled it wrongly maybe you approached it wrong right maybe you have a disagreement in the church and you approach this brother and I'm going to tell him a piece of my mind but yet in wisdom we approach it wrongly that's why I say God give me more wisdom you see wisdom not only will make us a better father or mother brother sister it'll help us in our ministry it'll help us in our posted duties amen right Paul said I didn't come in man's Wisdom but in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost why why did Paul have to go in this that way why did he say I come not of my own wisdom not of my own reasoning why because you become dependent upon your own man's carnal reasoning right I didn't come to to preach a sermon to try to impress you I didn't come to show you how much I know or how much I studied on a certain thought that's not why we're here because if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and the Divine revealer of the word come and reveal it to your heart it does no good yes sir the L kth but it's the spirit that giveth life you see man's Wisdom will never produce anything it takes the wisdom and revelation of God mixed with the word to produce something ever since the very beginning of time Satan couldn't produce wisdom and he can't produce knowledge but what does he do he perverts it we read in our Bible and Jesus used his people in in so many different ways that if we look at it from a hum a human element it doesn't make sense to us he uses Moses to deliver his people from Egypt with a stick explain that one right he told Joshua to go and March around the walls and they'll fall how does that make sense right right he used Jonah in the belly of a well and as science continues to go on they can try to disprove God you can't disprove this word it's our human element of wisdom and our own reasoning is what hinders us in our walk with God so let me ask you what is God asking you to do that you think is too hard and it's too great and I could never do that and I can never be that so this thought that I that came to me was a wisdom that confounds wisdom that confounds you see Jesus spoke in Parables he said eat this flesh eat my flesh drink my blood and the people said what is he a vampire who can believe these things when a blind man came to Jesus he said you know I'm a blind man I've been blind since my birth and and Jesus he spit in the sand and he rubbed dirt on his eyes if he was the son of man why didn't he just heal him why didn't he just speak to the blinded eyes because it wasn't for everybody he did things to confound those he he did it to confound the majority yes sir that's right he hid it from the wise and The Prudent and he revealed it unto those such it would learn it's against human expectation you see wisdom that works in it it works in let's say a mysterious ways it's mysterious to us but not to God right wisdom that confound it confounds the wise it confounds the majority you see they missed Jesus in his day when Jesus came to Earth they missed him why because he didn't come the way they thought he would how can a virgin conceive to the human mind that doesn't make sense but it wasn't supposed to to them when Jesus came they thought he would come in a certain uh class of people he would come to to those of the highs to the Pharisees those of the intellectual but he came as a baby in a manger and the world missed him why because it didn't come according to human wisdom and yet people today are still missing him they're still missing him they're missing him in their churches because they try to put on they have to put on a a program in order to impress the people that it has to happen a certain way and you got to entertain the people and they're still missing Christ for this day because he doesn't come the way they thought he would and I'm going to say tonight I don't want to miss the coming or I don't want to miss what God is doing in this day I don't want to miss what he's doing in this hour to with his bride I don't want to miss it due to my lack of wisdom due to my lack of knowledge because I didn't cry out I didn't seek I didn't ask God it may come in ways that we least expect you see God's ways are above our ways amen sometimes we ask him to God I need you to come closer so he sends him us a trial sometimes we believe that God's A Healer and he sends us a sickness and he says now believe let me see your faith put in action because so many times we want a a move of the Holy Spirit and we want God to to to to boost us and get us jumping and shouting or just encourage us and yet sometimes he comes in just ways that man are hard to understand to our carnal understanding James 1 and2 says my brother en counted all joy when you fall in diverse Temptations how does that make sense to count it all joy when you fall into these Temptations why why because God's working on you he's molding you he's refining that character of you amen because it's the trying of your faith it's the trying of your faith that worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing you see he sends a temptation to perfect you he sends a trial he sends something in our lives I read that to say verse 5 and if any of you lacking wisdom if any of you lacking wisdom you say what am I lacking in how am I lacking in wisdom what is your attitude when Temptations come do you have the joy of your salvation how is your attitude when the trial comes you said many times we get we get hard we ask God when is this trial going to be over when is this sickness going to be when am I going to be healed of this sickness and here he is trying to encourage you incline get wisdom because when you understand the wisdom of it that it's God working his he's trying to mold you and make you in verse six but let him that ask in faith not wavering you see when you ask something of God don't waver in it when you ask in faith believe it and move on because whenever you begin to waver when you begin to second guess and you begin to come forward time and time again have faith and move on believe in God because God God is going to bring that to pass in his time notice the Scripture it says wisdom first then understanding and then Faith to believe it why is wisdom so important as I begin to look at wisdom and you know as an individual and as a young Minister I I I counted a very of great importance because wisdom is one of those things that God uses and he comes and he ministers unto you and it's something that only God can give yes you can get wisdom from you know a a mentor or a pastor or maybe your father or somebody older yet W the wisdom of God is something special it's something that only he can give you know many times we can get complacent within our lives of I've heard that sermon before I've heard that Minister preach before oh it's just James preaching this Wednesday or it's just this brother or I've heard that thought before and we become knt alls within ourselves come on that's good oh I've heard that before I've heard that Minister oh it's just a Wednesday night why is wisdom so important because it was the very first thing that Satan promised Eve that he would hybrid in the garden Satan was so subtle in the garden and as he began to work on Eve he began to talk to her and woo her and he began to tell her things that she' liked to hear and then eventually Eve began to take Satan's wisdom over God's word let's read it in Genesis 3 and it says and the serpent serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God do know in the day they eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil knowing there's the knowledge and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be Des desired to make one wise the NIV version says desirable for gaining wisdom he was promising Eve wisdom he was promising her knowledge he began to pull her away through the subtlety of words and she partake of it and did eat and gave to her husband and they did eat and their eyes were opened and they knew that they were naked so from the very beginning Satan began to promise Eve something you don't think that Adam had wisdom he had the very Mind Of God why was it in the very beginning that Adam would begin to name the animals and God said that's exactly what I would call it that's what I would name it that's what I would do yeah right and he was God was going to express himself to Adam and Eve in such a way he was going to begin to unfold himself in a knowledge and in a wisdom for them to understand greater things but in that time Satan came in God's power to transform he says which it's all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the word wisdom isn't correct wisdom from God Divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom I don't care how much science we have and what more and education it's of the devil he says civilization is of the devil he says all culture in the Earth all powers of Science and everything is of the devil it's his gospel he preached of knowledge in the Garden of Eden and he has took that knowledge and perverted not that perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of God and now he has had 6,000 years to do exactly what God did only in a perverted way yeah and took the same amount of time to bring his own Eden in isn't that something that satans had the same amount of time to do what God has done but only in a perb way and then like I say Satan can't create he has no power to create he can't give you the knowledge he can't give you wisdom but what he does is he takes man's the the Battle Ground of man in the mind and he begins to battle with your thoughts he begins to take that human reasoning that human wisdom and that's what he uses to battle against God's word he uses that to battle against God's wisdom right and now he's got an Eden here on Earth it's filled with wisdom and knowledge it's filled with wisdom and knowledge I'm going to throw this in here what are the first two of the spiritual gifts that God gave to the church wisdom and knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge science wisdom and science never did God ever cater to that I want you to watch a minute he did this because that he was a man of worldly wisdom you see it's not of a Heavenly wisdom it's Earthly it's Central it's devilish you say well Brother Jay How will I know the difference How will I know the difference of of a wisdom from God and man Earthly wisdom James 3 and13 says who is W A wise man endued with knowledge among you let him show out of good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have better envying and strife in your heart Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual and devilish that what were the effects of Satan's wisdom in the garden verse 16 for envying and strife there was confusion you see if a man has wisdom if a man has wisdom and there's confusion and there's Strife if there's things that don't make sense there's things that don't add up if a man ever gets behind the pulpit and he begins to share how can a man show or preach the love of God and not live the love of God on now all right yeah that's how can we as Believers say well I believe in grace and I do this and I believe but yet you don't show Grace you don't have mercy there's strife and envy there's battles between different ones how is that the Christlike character verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is pure it's Peaceable it's gentle it's easy to be entreated full of Mercy good fruit without partiality without hypocrisy that's the wisdom that's from above that's why your your speech should be seasoned with salt when the wisdom that you're portraying maybe it's a situation that you have a conflict between Brothers a conflict between a loved one or a relative a conflict between somebody else in the church a conflict from church to church is our wisdom seasoned with salt is it Peaceable is it Meek is it humble without partiality I think that's a big one that's a hard one we're all humans we are we're all humans partiality is one of those things man it's hard because does not the Bible say if a man came and gave clothing and Rich and he had all these things and you said sit here and somebody of the less fortunate and you kick them to the back but let me ask you what if it's somebody of your own household not being partial to that person that's a tough one let us have wisdom that is from above full of Mercy you see it's easy to treat those with a wisdom and with a love that treat us the same way it's easy to have those ones that we see eye to eye with it's easy to wrap your arm around them it's easy to call them up hey buddy how's it going you want to come over for dinner why don't you call up somebody you disagree with invite them out to lunch we can test what kind of wisdom we have what kind of Christlike character we have listen Saints I believe this is your Bible I believe we got to live the scriptures it's more than just talking about it it's more than just oh I I'm a good Christian and I go on Sundays and Wednesdays and I serve God and I love God but where is The Life of Christ in our lives it's the simple things of a Christian walk sir I want us to be so close to God that the people out there in the world there's something different about the way you talk there's a difference in the way you treat me why is it that you're up against this coworker and you you go up and shake his hand even though you disagree right it's noticeable friends 1 Corinthians 1:1 19 says for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the scribes where is the disputers of this world hath not God CH made the foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleaseth God by the foolishness of preaching to save them yes sir that believe I'm so thankful it's the foolishness the foolishness of preaching why because if you ever if a man ever gets pupped up ever thinks that it's all about him ever think that he did anything let me tell you something we have nothing to do with it it's the foolishness of preaching but yet he still saves lives amen for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for to the Jews required a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews it was a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called how many are called this evening but them which are called the Greeks it says both Jews and Greeks Christ the power the power of God the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than man and the weakness of God is stronger Hallelujah than man it's in our weakness God is made strong you see many times we get in trouble because we get too stronge headed we begin to think we know it all we can do it all we can do God this we can serve him this way we can handle this situation this way but yet we need the wisdom of God to come and discern the situation and to lead us and guide us into all truths amen that the weakness of God is stronger than man because the foolishness but God had chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise yes sir God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things which are Mighty you see he works in what we would consider foolishness what God calls great man calls foolish right you see things we see so foolish and hard to understand yet God in his infant ways is working and we try to outsmart God and think it's our ways or are better than his and we try to outsmart him we tried to use the intellect of understanding we try to use AI to get by we try use Google sometimes we need to KN kneel on our prayer or kneel down on our knees and say a prayer rather than looking some up on the internet rather than asking AI what is this symptom what is that symptom what should I do you should kneel down and pray yes sir in 57 he says why is it so that so many Christians find it hard to live a Christian Life he says now notice if God intended the church to be run upon intellectuals then it doesn't take the Holy Spirit to do anything in that church he says we don't need the Holy Ghost if the church is run upon intellectuals then we find the smartest man we could find to be our pastor and the biggest buildings that we could build and the more members we could get into a church and root out the illiterate and bring in the intellectuals better the church would be if that's the program if that's the program the smarter the preacher the smarter the congregation the more intellectuals they are the better congregation it'll be thans of God that isn't the case if we ever get to the place that we pick the smartest man and we got to rule it and it's got to go this way many times we put our hands in it and we got to think that this isn't going to happen it's got to operate this way it becomes a program let me tell you none of this is rehearsed the music isn't rehearsed the song leading isn't rehearsed the preaching isn't rehearsed because we're dependent upon the leadership of the Holy Spirit and if we ever make it a program where it's got to be run this way and you got to do it this way and this person's got to sing and this person's got to leave and we got to have this person play the piano we're getting out of Step listen mistakes and things are going to happen mics are going to go out people are going to make a mistake and so many times we get caught up I'm guilty of it well the sound's not working and this guy's not working and why isn't the video and this and that you got all these problems what do you think Satan's doing he's working he's working he got you right where he wants you running around the church during service trying to fix it I've been there listen things happen because it's not a production brother brandom says but I can't find one place in all the holy scriptures where God's church is to be run upon the wisdom of man and as long as we try to run it upon intellectual man the intellectual man we are absolutely fighting the air God's church is to be run upon the B by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then if we have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is going to run the church then it doesn't take too much intellect Hallelujah I'm so thankful he's not dependent upon my intellect I'm not I'm so glad he's not thankful or dependent upon how much I know to minister because I wouldn't be up here listen he's dependent upon the holy spirit and that Holy Spirit he says then if we have the baptism of the Holy Spirit what is it the holy spirit in you that's operating each one of you have a job to do because the holy spirit is going to work in different ways listen I think one way Jonathan thinks another we both have the Holy Spirit and sometimes we get into a place maybe you know that's why a church isn't a dictatorship it's not run off of one man that's why he has a board and those boards have that the board the people on the board have a voice right listen it's not dependent upon them but it's the holy spirit in them God uses different backgrounds different ethnicities different raisings yes to bring different viewpoints he does that's why a church he has a board I was even listening the other day and it came up and he was talking about you know brother Brandon was saying you know men on my board I I I want them to say this or I don't want them to just cater to me right because if they cater to me and they want to want to say things that I you know I want them to hear it will do no good if they don't voice an opinion it doesn't do no good but yet it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit listen it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit In You amen that's right it takes away the intellectual it doesn't take education it takes the Holy Spirit that's God's program amen that's God's program you see we got to start trusting in the wisdom of the holy spirit that God placed inside of us and you might be thinking I'm just going to throw the disclaimer out there you might be thinking I'm talking about our board I've never sat in our board meeting I don't know what goes on so if that's for somebody out I don't know what yeah I'm not discrediting anybody I'm not got to throw that out there never sat in the meeting I don't know what goes on but you see we get so worked up in ways we begin to try to figure things out I know people that sat around on on Election night and they begin they would stay up to 2: 4 in the morning they asked me did you stay up no I went to bed listen whoever's going to be president is going to be president listen God has it in his plan it don't matter if I voted didn't vote who voted let let me tell you God is going to have his man in office so why get worked up why get worried about it that's right because Daniel says in uh Daniel 2 he says Daniel answered and said bless blessed be the the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removeth Kings and Seth up Kings he puts presidents in and he takes president's out he puts this person in office and he takes this person out it's all in God's plan yes so there's no need to get worried and worked up over things that you can't control yes sir you know in sports they always tell you do your job don't worry about the other person because if you're worried about the other person to do their job you'll miss your assignment am but if everybody is focused on their walk if everybody's focused on their goal and saying Lord I want to be the best version of myself I want to strive to be the best Christian I want to serve you with a fervency I want to be faithful in church everybody's going to be all right he removeth Kings and puts Kings in he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge unto them that know understanding he revealeth the Deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth in him he says I thank thee and praise thee Oh thy God of my fathers who hath given me wisdom and might and H has made known unto me now has made known unto me now what we desire of thee you see God comes and he makes it known unto you what you should desire of him for thou Hast not now made me known unto us the Kings matter is made known unto us the Kings matter we want to be about our father's business we want to be about the king's matter and there was a story in the Bible where a little Queen came from an AR a far off country and she heard of the wisdom of a man and she came to see who what this was all about she began to have people come to her City and they would say there was a man that discerned this and he he he spoke over me on this and he began to you know heal this or do these these things of God and this Pagan this Pagan Queen be to desire she began to seek after she began to wonder what was this all about out and she heard that this man was given a gift from God and the people made him King and brother brandom says when God sends a gift to the people they better heed to that gift they better take note of that gift you better find out what that gift's all about that's good because there's an important thing that's going to happen and so this this queen desired and wondered about this this man and she began to think within her heart if he can discern the heart of them what could he do for me is his wisdom cracked up to be all that is it true and this woman would travel this queen would travel for three months the Bible says for 90 days on camels she would bring all all that she had and she would come across desert places and brother Brandon would dramatize and he would say they would travel at night because it was so hot across them deserts and they would travel from a far off and they would go long hours on the backs of these camels and he says a shame to America because we can't even she didn't have a an air conditioned Cadillac she didn't have an airplane to travel in she didn't have some comfort but she came because she had such a desire and a fervency to meet this gift to see this man amen and the Bible tells us that in Matthew 12 that the queen of the South shall rise up in the day of judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon Behold a greater than Solomon is here amen yes she came from the uttermost parts he says this queen is going to rise up in the day of judgment why because people failed to cross the street and go and see what it was all about he says shame on us we can't even get the people to come on a Wednesday shame because they won't even cross the street to go see what this message is all about he says she'll rise up in the day of judgment and judge sir every time you I was listening to several of the sermons of greater than Solomon and brother Brandon would always say of the places that he was at he says you know Houston Texas God's going to judge you for it Phoenix Arizona God's going to judge you for it United States he's going to judge she's going to judge you for it because they failed to see what it was all about you see God's given a gift in our day he's given us a message yes sir it's not my message it's his message and when God sends a gift let's take note of what that that gift's all about the gift might be off the scene but let me tell you something the message Never Dies why because it's his word and God is still giving us an opportunity to heed to the wisdom wiom that he gave don't miss those opportunities don't take those opportunities lightly there's a story that comes to my mind of a man he was out in the ocean and he was out there and his boat began to sink his boat began to sink and he began to pray unto God and he said God would you come and save me and a big boat came coming down down the ways and he sat there and he says well if God sent them they'll come right to me the boat went on and then an airplane flew over his head and he didn't flag it down he says well if they seen me they'll send somebody well the weeks went on and he drowned when we got up to heaven he asked God well why didn't you save me I prayed I asked why didn't you come he says I sent you a boat and I sent you an airplane and you just sat there right on God has offered us the wisdom of almighty God he's offered us the blessings of his word help us to reach out and grab those blessings don't let us miss an opportunity let's read the story in 2 chonicles and when the queen of the of Sheba heard the fame of Solomon she came to prove solemn and with hard questions at Jerusalem and with a very great company of camels that bear spices gold in abundance precious stones you see she was bringing her gifts think spiritually here she was bringing her gifts she came to prove to see if this message is all is it all is it all that is it true and when she came to Solomon she Comm commun with him of all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he had told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon then the house that he built now this house that he built it's not his natural house it's the house of God and Solomon this house that he built he had it in order he had it set in order nothing was out of order in verse four and the meat of his table and the setting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers in their per perel and his cup bearers also in their perel and his descent by which he went up into the house of the Lord and there was no more spirit in her now I want you to understand we're going to break this down because it began to come to me that it says the meat of his table you see around the king's table it's not it's not just the sincere milk of the word but meat are those that are of full age those that can handle it it's the meat of his table let me tell you if we're having steak night night at my house and my sons are past you know one of them drinks milk but the other one we still give them meat but let me tell you God's going to feed his children the meat of the word and it's time to grow up it's time to mature let me tell you we're getting close it's time to get into this word it's time to eat the book amen listen we all eat at different Paces I'm a slow eater but let me tell you my bite of steak is a lot different than Nolan's bite of steak and that's what God does spiritually he doesn't come and say all right here son here you you go and here you go and we all get that same bite because some of us would choke over it come on you understanding but what he does he says okay son here he cuts it a little smaller now chew on this chew on this a little bit all right son I know you need a little bit more wisdom listen don't be discouraged if you don't understand it all don't don't get discouraged if you can't put this type and that type right you know what he'll do he just cuts the steak a little smaller chew it a little yeah do a little more oh there's somebody choking in the back that's all right let's cut it up a little smaller just keep chewing Che amen it's the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and there a pair and the cup bears and and the people that he that he says here I noticed that all the positions are positions of servitude if you want to be a part of go the King's house house you're going to have to learn to serve amen you're going to have to learn to serve you say well I'm not a minister that's all right then be a then be a servant if you can't be a servant be a cup Bearer how many brought their cups this evening and say Lift It Up Lord I lift my cup up fill it up and when it begins to overflow the thing with the cup Bearer when that cup begins to overflow you know what they were doing they were serving others yeah amen you know what the the cup bearers were supposed to do make sure that it was the King's Wine to make sure that's what he wanted to serve to make sure it was good enough you know what El it was to make sure it wasn't poisoned yeah good so you know what you need to do when you come to church you bring your cup and you say Lord fill it up let me serve somebody else let me pour if it begins to flow over brother Brian let me pour up into your cup and it flows over over here to brother Theo and it goes on and on why because we're here to serve one another and when somebody begins to get a little dry that may maybe they're a little empty on their cup you need to go over there and refill them give them the wine of the Holy Spirit it'll add a little stimulation to their life it'll add a little quickening power to their life I have to say this because it I see it in my notes because it was something that came up and it was just you know the term the meat of the word it just popped up when I went to copy the scripture into the notes it popped up in like this footnote and it says the term the meat of the word refers to an idea that knowledge and wisdom from the Bible is only useful if it's put into practice you can have the meat of the word but is it put into practice and we see here that the attendance of their Min of the ministers and the cup bearers and their apparel he mentions apparel twice so you're telling me it's important on the way you dress you're telling me there's a there there's a there there's a approach there's a way that we must dress that we must Dawn ourselves with and the ascent by which you went up into the house of the Lord how do you approach Church you're telling me there's a right way to approach church amen does this sound familiar this is Solomon and yet we had a man in our day that came and when he begin to put the church in order I don't want to get ahead of myself but he begin to put the church in order and tell us there's a way to dress there's a way to come to church 30 minutes early soften your heart you see according to man's Wisdom it may seem in insignificant on our Peril you're saying that's a big deal well if the prophet said it if it's in the scripture if it's the the order in which Solomon did it in verse 5 and she said to the king it was a true report which I heard in my own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom how be it I believe not their words until I came and mine eyes had seen you see sometimes you have to come and see for yourself you can see that God did something for your mom God did something for your dad he might have done somebody else he might have healed somebody else but you got to come and see for yourself and behold one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told unto me isn't that something that one half of the wisdom wasn't told that's what happens sometimes we only hear half the story we only hear half the story as the same goes there's always two sides to the story don't always believe what you hear sometimes we begin to believe certain things that are said about this person or said that about that person but we fail to go get the other half of the story you see if somebody wants to lead you off into some kind of Doctrine if they want to take you out into you know tapes only well why aren't they telling you the other half of the story why aren't they reading the rest of the scripture why aren't they reading the rest of the quotes that contradict the way that they believe because when you take the full word of God there's no in between his word is his word right but where we get in trouble and men get in trouble is they begin to take scriptures that they like and don't like and they begin to divide it this way or that way and pull one off but yet you're not taking the other side of the wisdom of almighty God right she had to come and see just like philli told Nathaniel we have found the one that Moses spoke of and he says who is he he's from Nazareth he says nothing could come come out of Nazareth he says come and see listen you don't got to convince everybody right you don't got to tell everybody the whole spill of everything just tell them come and see there's guys that I've been working on for years and I talk to them and I wait and I don't do it every time and I'm not forceful on but I'm just waiting and waiting when they open up an opportunity they say man I'm having a hard time hey I got a solution hey I got something that might encourage you hey show up on a Wednesday night hey come over here listen I don't need to pound him all the time with this is that and this is the prophet you better see it no no no that's not the way that's not an attraction of people that's not how to get them that's not how to witness listen you bring him to church and just say come and see why do you act the way you do come and see why do you dress the way you do come and see because let me tell you you get them to church and they come into a church and they have respect for you and they walk away and they say it wasn't for me that's fine that's good yeah because they'll be judged on what they know right that's what he said they'll be judged by what they know you did your part verse 7 says happy are thy men and happy are thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom happy are they you should be the happiest people of the earth you should be happy in the Lord no matter what the circumstance that you're going through no matter the sickness no matter the trial no matter where you're at financially no matter what the case is you should be the happiest the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth why because they sent greater than Solomon is here amen and we had a man with a gift that came in our day and he would begin to discern the hearts of the people and he would begin to to to to do healings and the discernment of hand or you discernment of hearts and the healing in the hand and people thrived over it they loved him for it the first and second pull it begin to pull people into it and everybody began to come from their denominations they begin to come and see they begin to bring their gifts into the body but yet when the prophet begin to put things in order when he stepped into his ministry when he began to step into that third pole it's not for everybody where did the multitudes go right a man that would travel around the world what does he say seven times over or several times over whatever it was and he would travel the world and and do all these healing campaigns and everybody wanted to him at their conventions and they wanted him to preach it and do healings and all that but whenever he began to set the church in order when he begin to have church order and hey those gifts we got to handle them this way hey I want you your approach to church I need you 30 minutes early I want there's a dress code he begin to preach at the women what happened they wanted the gifts they wanted all those Sensations but they didn't want the real wisdom of almighty God they all brought their gifts from denominations begin to operate they love the healings the signs the Wonders people do in every age but yet there's a separation I said in the beginning what was the two spiritual gifts that Satan used in the beginning what were them man what are the first two can you pull that up if you have it wisdom and knowledge wisdom and knowledge what's the bridge between those two of the remaining six Faith so Satan knew that if he can mess with wisdom and knowledge discredit discredit your faith he would make the church powerless he'd begin to take away the healings and the Miracles the prophecies people love the feeling of the outward gifts people desire the outward Gifts of those that are four through nine because they feel good on our flesh the healings the prophecies the speaking in tongues I can be honest with you and say I've never spoken tongues what I desire absolutely but yet maybe that's not the gift God has for me but yet what Satan tries to do is he tries to come at the first two we're going to read it here the prophet says and he he him he says do you know God never made two men the same there's no two of you in the world or ever has been that's got the th the same thumb print God makes men differently he has diversity of gifts and sends them into the church but we just cramp down on one and there you go and you see you don't get the wisdom of the spirit that's the reason God can't place us into the position where we should be in his body for one is given this sort of gift and the other this sort of gift and the other and the other this sort of gift and so forth but all to the same body but we want to be exactly like the other you can't do that amen you must use the wisdom of the word amen you must use the wisdom of the word like the Queen of Sheba everybody wants to come in and they came they came to see the gift the prophet in action they love the healings and as I said when the prophet began to put it in order they didn't want no part with it he sat down in Tucson without an invitation why because they like the other stuff they like to feel good I say God I want it all listen I'm not discrediting the rest I'm not discrediting the rest listen we need it it needs to operate within the church within the Assembly of God we need all the spiritual gifts yes but yet brother brother bradam says here and I will restore he says now you'll notice the routine of gifts the first is a gift of wisdom he says the gift the first is the gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group he says if we don't got wisdom we don't know how to use knowledge it's the second gift and if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift of interpretation and next to the last speaking in tongues he says our Zeal is eat up our wisdom our Zeal for our denom ations and our enthusiasm has eaten up the wisdom off the vine brotherly love my goodness our Zeal has eat up all our wisdom listen it's good to have Zeal we need ones with Zeal but you got to have wisdom that goes with iten wisdom and knowledge lets us know how to operate the gifts in the order of the gifts and Faith Comes comes in and gives us the the the faith to believe in him Zeal is a powerful thing but it has its place musicians come like I said the Queen of Sheba as we read in the Bible she came searching for a one with a gift and we can say this evening that we have found the one for our day that came with a gift that nobody spake like this no like this man no one had the discernment like this man we have found the message for this day and we know it's not the message of a man but it's the message of almighty God it's the very thoughts of God but yet can I say this that a greater than Solomon is here a greater than William brandham is here we have Jesus Christ himself the resurrected Lord Jesus Is Right amongst us walking Discerning the hearts ministering to lives Healing The Sick doing things that we don't even know what's happening right now but it's in his presence that he comes by and he ministers to lives he touches Hearts you might not not think coming on a Wednesday night you might not think ah it's just a Wednesday but let me tell you it does more than what you think it gives you a little bit of a boost when I look across the congregation you become humbled because you made an effort to come to the house of God and I believe God honors that yes I'm guilty of it maybe sometimes we get a little cold we get a little hard we get a little short we don't handle the situation correctly I say God give us wisdom I need more of wisdom you know I'm the type that you got to figure it all out you got to make it make sense sometimes things happen in certain ways and you're just like and you try to put God in a box you're trying to make it work this way on you know when you handle a situation wrongly it takes a real person to Humble themselves and say I'm sorry brother listen just because we stand behind our the pulpit doesn't mean we're perfect doesn't mean we don't make mistakes I can say each one of us would say Lord help us do better give us more wisdom give us more grace help us understand the certain situations many times we miss the big picture because we're so focused on something totally different but when you take your blinders off and you begin to see and maybe time goes on and the situation resolves itself you're like yes sir I understand and he he him he says what did Jesus represent he says Moses the law Elijah his sternness his Justice what did Jesus represent let me ask you what do you represent it says his love and what and when God being love and even so love the world and when the Divine love is projected it produces its subjects God could do nothing else but send something to take care take the place place of his love so the law couldn't do it his Justice couldn't do it so love took its place love God's love yes sir it'll take the place of speaking in tongues and that's all right it'll take the place of gifts of Wonders and signs and everything else if you haven't got love to accompany that what good does the signs do you God's tried to do it across the nation but it wouldn't work the greatest gift of all the gifts the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom and the second is knowledge if you haven't got knowledge you haven't got wisdom how can you control your knowledge what Good's your knowledge going to do see what I mean seek the first things first he says God keeping his word he says the first gift in the line the gifts is wisdom and the second is knowledge and if you don't have any wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge seek the best things first wisdom if you ain't got wisdom what can you do with knowledge and speaking tongues and those others it takes wisdom it takes God's wisdom you know Saints I I may never speak in tongues I may never do those gifts but I say Lord give me wisdom that if a man in the Bible if King Solomon could pray for the gift of wisdom and God honor that how much more are we obligated to his word that when we begin to cry out we begin to ask we begin to apply our heart and say God give me wisdom give me knowledge let me know your word let me know how to discern let me know how to understand he says that's the most important gift is wisdom Proverbs 4:7 we read it wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding you see God's going to use another elect lady he has an elect lady on this earth that is going through hard times going through trials making mistakes you're going to make mistakes but get back up but he's using this this elect lady who's not perfect but yet one day just as the queen of the South is going to judge those he's going to use an elect lady an elect of God to come and choose and she's going to judge the earth and the wide of his hair is W of wool what is it the wisdom of almighty God he's going to judge the Earth let me ask you what kind of wisdom are you going to judge with you know when we get there and people come before us I've had many of people if go if the prophet could say for a glass of water you can give somebody eternal life maybe I'm the only one and I have people come and they do something nice for me I always tell make a mental note I say to myself Lord let me remember them let me remember them and I believe that at that judgment seat don't get me wrong there's going to be those that didn't live the right life didn't do the right things but I believe that heaven is going to be so big that I'll be able to judge with the wisdom man they may have smoked me once but maybe I reached around and they came and apologized and they did something for me Lord Give Me That kind of wisdom amen not only when I get to that judgment seat but now sometimes we handle situations and we we we blow off the cuff maybe that person had a relative that died maybe they had something that didn't go through maybe they don't have uh money in the bank and they're stressed at all high that's right we don't know the situation of every person I don't know the things you're going through but God does let's stand to our [Music] feet what judgment will you use I know the Judgment I want to use is one of wisdom one of love one of compassion judge with a little more grace when we get over [Music] there when we get over there you will think of things that were so you thought were so big and such big failures and how could he make it how [Music] what Saints I wanted do everything I can to get there I want us to have wisdom and Grace because I believe it's important let's just pray you know we need one another maybe you could reach over and brother to brother sister to sister and you could lay your hands upon them and Lord we need you now Lord is a body of Believers father Lord we don't pray for ourselves but we pray for those that are around us we pray that you would encourage that you would uplift that father with an outpouring of your h Holy Spirit father right now they're they're being cup bearers this evening and they're pouring their their wine over to the next lord they're laying hands on one another knowing father that there's power in prayer that you come on the scenes and Lord I don't got to know what they're going through but
