tonight we're always grateful i'm thankful for you making this effort and i pray that god really bless you tonight tonight is a special night before we have a special speaker tonight i want to read i want to share something with you and then we'll bring on our guest testimony speaker tonight today as i guess most of you might know by now we had 720 new cases of coronavirus and 21 deaths so trinidad is going in the wrong direction really fast and we want to encourage you to take note of these standing protocols that is in place that you don't be slack don't take things for granted actually today the world of the world health organization had an emergency meeting because of a new variant from south africa and that variant uh mutates setting 30 times i believe the delta mutates about three times so this guy this demon whatever it is it it they're not sure that any vaccine right now would be able to deal with this guy so we are dealing we are living in perilous times we are living in dangerous times and i want each one of you to be safe yeah and i believe it was august the 1st i preach a message having therefore boldness to enter into the holy of holies by the blood of jesus something like that and on that message i shared about the leopards i know uh i didn't intellectually just uh study in and get that thought it was given to me to share with you by i call divine inspiration and you know what obama says you can only serve god as you do believe the servants that god send that interprets the word to you by divine inspiration and we got many testimonies both locally and abroad of people who haven't heard that message and heard what was shared uh they were hesitant to take the vaccine and they went and do it afterwards because in that i felt that i was given by the lord to share about these lepers and these lepers if we stay here we will die if we go out we will die and i didn't add this one but i guess as lepers they will die anyhow but they choose to act and in acting everything changed and i believe that the situation around us it's almost and and the prophet called this a dingy fate that these lepers choose to go into the camp the enemies camp and while they were going to watch the camp god caused the enemy to hear noise and they fled and they ran and these guys were able to eat food and come back and let the city know there's food up there and everything else but the storyline or what is the key behind all of that is that in times like this doing nothing is not an option it's not an option you have to take care of you and do what is your best for you as a pastor i don't go to hospitals and go to doctors with people who have issues and challenges you you take up yourself you go and visit the doctor doctor prescribe this prescribe this the person has nothing involved in that you go to your private doctor that is your business that is your fear and you need to set up a prayer request it's a prepared question and so on we're not involved in that so i cannot tell you that don't take the vaccine i cannot tell you that all these health professionals of the devil and vaccine of the devil is as far as they're concerned as foolishness um to travel overseas we have to take yellow fever vaccine we have to take this vaccine that vaccine it's required and all these so-called vaccines i never asked fortunate you know and i would say this way if you take a bottle of ketchup you will see some name there that you can pronounce you don't know what in it if you think what kind of coke any preserved thing you will see stuff there that you can't even explain you don't know what it's about it's there and we are still alive and around so to me in this plague it's a plague it's a pandemic is a plague we have to see ourselves getting more serious with the lord some time ago i preached a message i shared about the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that message i shared how about a man speak about this member this black mamba that wasn't coming to him he was coming to the bridge coming to his brother and even though that snake couldn't affect him he was told to be more sincere and you have been given power to buy any mamba is trusting me he wasn't told if you're being said if you be sincere you will get power he said you have been given power but the emotions here so as we get closer to the top as we get closer to the cap as we get closer to where we belong where we're supposed to be i believe in all my heart that they have to be a genuine heart experience towards god not head we're talking about heart you see it has to be a word from you as it was in your heart what does your heart feel you're here tonight to be edified to be strengthened um we're not here to rebuke you water or to bless you you are we are here that you your lives could be encouraged we live in a stressful time you know when when i was young much younger i i wanted to be a doctor to help humanity i felt that was my calling to help and assist i personally find life is very stressful life is very hard and i don't understand the sense and try to make life harder for others i feel as a christian as a believer as a soul or a fearing stranger in this world i feel that we ought to try to help people and make the lord a little lighter what can i do to make somebody else load lighter what can i do to encourage your feet that's why i don't like to dwell too much on the negatives or we could give warnings but on falseness and and all kind of hypocrisy and whatnot we try to stick with the true dollar the real dollar the original dollar which tried to do that so tonight just before our speaker comes i want to read a scripture for you and this scripture is from sin john chapter 14. i want to read just to find it let's read it it's familiar scriptures but i want to bring something to you tonight before we continue and this scripture is in john 14 15 to 21 this is jesus speaking he said if you love me keep my commandments this is in red and i will pray the father he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and then in verse 17 jesus translates in the comforter even the spirit of truth now not just truth but he identifying not just word but the spirit of truth as a comforter whom the world cannot receive so you if you're in a holy spirit a worthy atmosphere you can't get this this is not for the world even the spirit of truth who can't receive because it sees him not he annoyed him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so god comfort was the pillar of fire above israel when they look up they were comforted to know that god is what was with them the night you saw a pillar of fire in the day you saw a cloud so as you move regardless of the enemies all around you know once that cloud is moving once that fire is moving god is moving with you that was god above us in the father and when the word became flesh in the person of jesus christ that was god with us but god want to come in us so jesus in verse 18 continues i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you you have no pastor there you have no evangelist there you have no prophet or apostle there i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world see at me no more but you see me you see me because i leave chalice also and then he prophesies at that day he shall know that i am in my father ye and me and i in you he that had my commandments and keeped them hated that love at me and he that loved me shall be loved of my father and i will love him i will manifest myself to him so jesus clearly tell them told these disciples okay the comforter is now with you which was the word made flesh jesus standing with them he said but this comforter will come into you and how they're going to be if you love me you keep my commandments and he loveth me shall be loved by my father i will love him and will manifest myself to him there is no evangelist dear there's no pastor prophet teacher there and will manifest myself to him now that is in john chapter 14. now in john 15 one verse there was 26 jesus said and when the comforter is come prophecy whom the father will send unto where whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceeded from the father he shall testify of me so he is saying the spirit will always bear witness of the word the spirit will give witness of jesus christ the word okay we come to the final one i believe in john 16 and this is jesus speaking these things have i spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues ye the time cometh whosoever killed you will think that he did god's service so jesus was prophesying dread times come in and they will actually think by killing you they're doing god's service and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall come you may remember that i told you of them and these things i said unto you i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you so jesus was saying certain things i didn't say at the beginning because i'm here but now i'm going so i have to tell you these things who is five but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asked me whatever is done but because i have said these things unto you saurod filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth is expedient it is necessary it is absolutely compulsory that for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the will of sin and of righteousness and of judgment when he comes he will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin about righteousness and so on i see amplified verse night of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now i'll be it so he's prophesying listen man there's stuff you need to know but you can't get them now but how be it when he a person the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and this is the verse i want to get to he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you you see that little word there those four words he shall glorify me that mean the real holy spirit will glorify jesus christ let me say it again the real holy spirit so in other words glory cannot go to some man some message pope some bishop some pastor and and and so on glory go into some man this is humanity oh and what not that cannot be right this is what jesus identifying you know as the spirit of truth he says he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father had a mind therefore said i he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while you shall see me not see me again a little while you shall see me because i go to my father then said some recitals among themselves what is this that he said unto us a little while shall i see not see me and again a little while he shall see me because i go to the father then said he therefore what is this that he said a little while we cannot tell what he said now jesus knew that they were desires to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of what i said a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me verily i send to you prophecy that he shall reap and lament his prophecy unto them and the world shall rejoice and he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail to sorrow because her hour is come but soon as she's delivered of the child she remember it no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and ye know therefore of sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man take it from you and in that day he's prophesying to them again you shall ask me nothing very like unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto he asks nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have i spoken unto you and proverbs but a time comment when i shall no more speak to you in proverbs i shall assure you plainly of the father that day you shall ask in my name i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father love at you because you have loved me and i believe that i came out from god i comfort from the father and i'm coming to the world again i leave the world to go to the father and then his disciples tell them law those speakers so plainly no speakers don't play me and speakers no proverb no we are sure that don't know use all things and it is not that any man should ask thee by this we believe the dog came as fought from god jesus answered them do you not believe he said behold our comment he is now come that he shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because my father is with me these things i have spoken unto you in me that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation be of good cheer have overcome the world may god add a blessing to read a word isn't that a lovely scripture reading tonight oh my god jesus own words in red and um just two more quotes and we'll close here and be afraid but a brown that is why no man can ever come along and say the holy man is a pope or the holy man is a bishop or priest the holy man is christ the holy spirit in us how dare the hierarchy declare the lady has no word to say each one has something to see each has a work each has a ministry the holy ghost came at pentecost and separated himself on each that it might be fulfilled where if christ said at that day you shall know that i am in my father he and me i am you the great i am the almighty god has come a spirit to fill his true church he has a right here we go he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to let me read that again he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men among us but the whole true congregation of the lord is holy because of the presence of the holy spirit it is he the holy spirit that is holy not the congregation of itself and finally this is a harvest time that previous quote was from revelation of jesus christ but jesus said when he the spirit of truth is come see he will bring these things that i have taught to your memory the word he will also show you things to come there is the real spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word god on earth see he doesn't need any theologian because his word is of no private interpretation he interprets his own word by vindicating it and proving it's the truth oh let's give the lord a hand to pray scriptures for the word from the prophet o blessed be the name of the lord so we are grateful tonight we have among us tonight brother lino tirado i um he translates in spanish as you know he came to trinidad and he was here in a convention and we worked together in argentina in chile a couple other places and i'm grateful to have him here tonight um over the time he has shared so many testimonies with me that i at the time we never had this platform or this opportunity and i always felt that if given the chance he should be able to share you know what's up on his heart and and and that will be able to bless god's people everywhere i believe a testimony is something to give witness of god so far we had about three or so sessions of testimonies and i believe people were edified strengthened and built up with it and i believe it will continue on tonight in a special way i know that lino is a brother who loves the lord and fire for god and has a burden for the spanish side of this message uh spanish language people who they were short on the books short of the translated books in spanish and you know we have to have that burden and just as i read where brother madam says how dear people say that the lady have no see you as an individual have no see each one of them ministry each one have a calling and to me this is what you have to begin to see i may have a calling as a pastor and and shepherd and to preach the word and so on but it's no different calling from you as a believer to believe and to receive and to act upon the word of god this comforter is not for the pastor only this comforter is for the entire body of jesus christ all that was important to god important to christ all of us in christ he poured into the church the church is not pastor teacher prophet evangelist that is a ministry that god will use to get things to his people and is not about glorifying these men or glorifying their ministries but is actually their their dear for your benefit for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the defining of the body so the whole burden of god is to get to his people he sent one man moses and he moses after so much a pressure god put the spirit and other men to share that burden and life itself is a burden and tonight adeline is here to share in this burden of the word and this burden of the lord to share so he could introduce himself and and testify about you know the lord and so on i want to get it over to him because we give the lord some praises oh and bless his name praise be to jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord but as i could okay i'm seeing him now so we tonight we just want to welcome brother lino should we get into unmute amen amen amen god bless you my brother go right ahead praise god amen it's an honor and a privilege to come before you and lift up the name of the lord jesus christ the thing that he has done in my life they are all to glorify him i wish i can take credit but it's all him doing it and i'm so grateful that he has done it in my life and i'm very happy that he has done it in my life i mean um uh usually when no people fill out an application they they usually tell you um where was you born or where do you come from well my spiritual life uh it started in new york city the local christian assembly and uh me and my family my dad we were eight all together and um and it's a testimony in itself the way we got there but i just wanted to move up uh a further to for for the sake of time um me and my friend my dad and my mom we all visited the church and uh um i was going to church because i wanted to obey my dad and uh i i had an understanding that my daddy paid the bills he fed me uh he took care of me and he had a home for me and i said well the best thing i can do is to obey him so when he said let's go to church i go to church sunday and wednesday and when there were special services through the years just obey my dad but i did have something against my daddy uh it was kind of like a hatred because he gave me a spanking when i was a child that he almost killed me and i always carried that in my heart so every time i hear his voice then call the church there was something but i i de-obey and i went so going to church hallelujah the local christian assembly in new york um one day uh got7 preached a message and i didn't understand the message being a young person but i couldn't get away from the title of the message now the title of the message was i give you a new heart and i'll give you a new spirit so i went home as a young person and i began to think on the title and i began to think like nicodemus i said lord how are you going to do that are you going to come from heaven you're going to come down here you're going to bring a knife you're going to cut my heart take this one out i'm putting you in so i i went by myself talking to the lord and i said how are you gonna do that and then they say that they cannot see you how are you going to do that so i waited i waited order suddenly i got up from my chair and i stayed like this and i said okay i wanted it so i looked to my left i looked to my right i said i wanted it i wanted it and i waited and i waited when honestly suddenly a presence came and that present wrapped me up and literally that present took me up to the ceiling in a slow motion and i begin to go up and then come down i said to myself what is happening so and as soon as i touch the floor just like a little button something inside began to turn it was a joy unspeakable and incontrollable i hurt myself and i began to say oh oh oh and i hugged myself i run towards the house and i fell down i rolled over i got up i kept on running i'm hogging myself oh oh finally i went to my room and i nailed down pick and and as soon as i down i raised my head and i said lord what happened here please don't let never let me forget what happened over here and as i'm trying to understand i laid down i began to pray for hours and hours after a while my family began to come into the house and when i heard the voice of my daddy i run to my dad i throw myself on my daddy and i hug him and i said daddy i love you daddy i love you i miss you i love you daddy i love you i love you they my daddy tag me on the sh on the back i said boy what's wrong with you what's wrong with you so when my daddy touched me i looked to heaven and i said you did it i'm telling my daughter that i love him and that was the beginning of my life now i was just finishing high school and in high school i was a good baseball player and i was one of the best we beat all the high school on baseball and the rumor went abroad and even went to the scout of the major league los angeles dodgers and they came to see us play and it was the time when i did the most spectacular play ever and he told my coach i want that boy i want him so my coach called me to the office los angeles they want you about two weeks later they came to my house with a a contract to sign i tell my coach coach i'm sorry i cannot sign i cannot go i said but little wait a minute you can go i i said no i can't go i i cannot sign but what what's wrong with you i said coach baseball is out i don't have the fever no more so the lord gave me a new heart and gave me a new spirit oh and i fell in love with god i developed a habit of praying i read my bible i read all the books that have been published by bro abraham and it was a a love of a falling in love with god uh uh he became a friend to me now with that new uh know me i went to college and in college i was supposed to major in biology but it was a religious college and instead of me choosing classes for the thing i wanted it i choose everything religious and just one subject on biology and in college i fall in love with god i fall in love with the bible i remember one time glory to god i was supposed to study the book of biology but i was studying the bible i was studying the book of joshua and he heard me that i had to leave the bible and take the book of biology lord i hate to leave the bible but you're for 10 minutes father let me grab the book of biology as soon as i took the book of biology the book turned completely red and i saw fire coming from the book and i was able to see hell in the book and in that hell i saw somebody trying to get out of it and when i saw the person i recognized the person it was the president of the college when i saw that i got so scared i threw the books and i ran from the place i run to the cafeteria and when i run to the cafeteria i met my sister and i believe she's here tonight and i i'm telling her what happened i saw the boot turned wrecked and i saw hell and i saw a man trying to get out and i recognized that man uh it was the the president of the college so my sister was telling me lino calm down they're gonna think that you're crazy calm down and then all of a suddenly that man entered through the door i got up from the table at a scream i said sir you are in hell immediately not to the office anyway to make the story short i did not last in the college i left the college so i went back home and i'm in love with god i i'm in love with the bible hallelujah i i began to work with my father and my mother in a company and i remember one day hallelujah at six o'clock in the morning for the first time in my life i heard the voice of god oh it is something when you hear his voice your whole body heals it and there's not one doubt that you know that he spoke because your whole body hears it and it's such a beautiful thing he interrupt my own thinking and you can see that he interrupts you on thinking and he went down and he spoke and he said i am the lord that god that healed all of thy disease since there's no way of doubting that he spoke i scream and help mommy are you sick she said no daddy are you sick he said no i told my the rest of my my brother are you sick nobody was sick mommy called the aunt called the uncle and they said bolino what's wrong mommy god came down in the bathroom and he said i am the lord that god that healed all of thy disease somebody is sick so nobody was sick six in the morning everybody went to work but at 12 o'clock on that day i got sick and i got sick so bad that they had to bring me to the house so when they brought me to the house it was such a pain from top to bottom i couldn't be seen i couldn't beat standing i couldn't be in bed it was a bad pain all over and then my mom's a bully tried to lay down said mommy i can't but i went down to the bed and then i said lord you suffer more than me when they put a crown of thorn in your head as a lord that got to hurt and father when the whip in your back the pieces of meat came out as the lord that must hurt and father when that soldier hears you on the back of the side i said lord that was a hurt i said this pain that i'm going through oh this is nothing lord oh jesus just let me suffer a little bit when all the suddenly the same voice that came in the morning came back again and he said i am the lord the god that healed all of thy disease i'm just in a fraction of seconds i was completely completely healed i lifted my hands i came to the cheek catching i said mommy i am totally fine what happened remember the morning that voice came back again and now i'm totally here oh i fall in love with god oh i began to to to to to read and pray more and began to have god's friend i heard his voice they got about a little month passed by or two months and i'm in the bathroom and uh all the suddenly uh i hear his voice again but this time he said lino get up quickly go to your mama's room because the devil is after her when i heard that i said what with who and as soon as i get up and i went to my mom's room my mom had a stroke her arm was twisted her lip was twisted and she was on the floor and as soon as i came in or remember laying on my shoulder and as a satan you have trespassed this property that have been brought with a prize the blood of jesus christ leave my mother alone in jesus name or the son of the arm just straighten up on her lip straighten up and mama got up lift up her hands and she began to praise god all over the house oh i fallen i fell in love with god even more hallelujah and then a couple of monks passed by and then i'm on my job and because i developed a habit of prayer even on my job on my breakdown i'm in my lunch time i had to hide myself in a second story building and just to pray just to talk with the lord and uh and i remember one time my supervisor he had a a slight heart attack the ambulance came and the ambulance took him and the doctor told him water the next time you will come in you're not gonna make it you have to stop smoking or you're not going to make it the next time so my supervisor brought a jar of candy into the office so every time he feel the pool of smoke he'd take a candy but one time he got rebuked from the office and he forgot about the candy and he was almost two or three packs a day he was just smoking like a chimney one day i i i was eating my lunch and i was eating my lunch uh the spirit of the lord he come back again and he spoke for the third time in my life i heard his voice and i said lino go to walter and tell him that the only way he could to stop smoking is by me and by me alone i say oh lord if you tell my boss about christ he probably fired me i said lord the doctor told him so he's supposed to know he's about to stop smoking because they tried to call him so about two or three minutes passed by the void came back again i said lino tell walter that the only way he's gonna stop smoking is by me and mia look now his supervisor is with him father the doctor told him so a little time passed by the voice came by the third time but this time he scared me he said if you don't go you will give me a count of the judgment day i don't know what happened but i drank my sandwich and i run to water and the anointing drop and i said walter i am here to tell you that the only way you gonna stop smoking is in the name of the lord jesus christ and him alone stop smoking now brother abraham said that is a demon so as soon as those words were spoken he began to scream and go from left to right and he slide down under his desk and i remained there and then five minutes later he took his head out and he screamed hallelujah he never smoked again for the glory of god and for the first time in his life he began to go to a church what that be with him i don't know but he does hallelujah oh and i fall in love with god more and more and more and i begin to study and i begin to to try to understand the message one time i remember i didn't understand the whole thing so i draw myself at pyramid and i put everything in place the sea the messenger the voices and i tried to connect everything and i said lord i don't understand nothing i don't understand it but everything is here and i said you stood there watching that pyramid all of a sudden a supernatural white light came on on my right shoulder and went straight to the pyramid and when he touch it it light it up and then spook something i want to keep that for myself and when he spoke what what what he said i was able to understand oh i was the happiest person alive and i fall in love with god more hallelujah and as time went by glory to god i remember i wrote god's servant at the new york church a letter and i said pastor revelation is good revelation is great but i am missing something hallelujah and i believe is the holy ghost and by the grace of god i believe in 1983 a great move of god came and i remember that they went on the floor i remember both he came around and he laid hands and that was in such a soft thing lay hand and i went and i left i waited today as a lord i'm still waiting and then one day at three o'clock in the morning something wake me up all of a sudden and when i get up on my bed and when i look to the side there was hanging a pillow of fire right there i was knocked down to the floor hallelujah oh and glory never been the same again and i fall in love with god more and team begin to happen hallelujah team began to take place and and supernatural thing as i fall in love with god in my prayer that is one of the most beautiful things that you as a christian can have you prayer when you enter into that room of prayer there's something on the inside that come out and that atmosphere you don't want to leave hallelujah it take away all tiredness or sleepiness it take away everything as soon as you kneel down just something take over i remember one time i was so tired but because i developed the habit of praying i said no no no no oh i'm so taboo as soon as i kneel down that something just came over and no tightness left and i just enjoy the lord now as time went by hallelujah um and i have got a friend so sincerely i come before him i said oh lord i would love to see when you save someone and i like to see right in front of me lord and you can help it once god come on the inside you want to share it so i remember i went to my friend hallelujah and uh i went to the dominican republic oh let me go back a little bit let me go back to the college because something happened there since when i fell in love with god and i fell in love with the bible and i left all the other books i remember one time i was reading a biography of a book called the seventh trumpet and the seven seal it was not brother brahms book but when i was reading it i see through the door a cloud come in and when i see that cloud coming through the door he stayed right in front of me and inside the cloud the figure of the man and he said pretend you got to read the book again you have to read that book again oh my when you say this it does something to you hallelujah in the college oh i begin to witness i begin to win soul for christ hallelujah i even brought it to the church and they got baptized in the church hallelujah and i used to have people knocking on the door lilo let's have fellowship glory hallelujah he cannot help it you've got to share what god has done in your life hallelujah it creates such a love a such a desire to see god in display hallelujah so i went to my country hallelujah so when i went to my country went to a house and you cannot help it in the house i began to testify all of a sudden there was a big crowd of people and inside that cloud there was some of them pentecostals and i began to tell them what god is doing in the last day i began with the days of luther wesley and pentecost and what is god doing today and somehow i mentioned something about woman preacher in the bible and after i believe it was 12 at night we finish the little meeting in the private house and the people came to me and they say i never heard anything like that before that is what god is doing in the last day fulfilling prophecy getting at people ready so we can lead this earth so those people went back home and they were talking about it what they heard that they never heard it before and they will say how come they don't preach about this it is in the scripture now for my surprise that's the first time they heard about the message so when they go back home and they were going to bed and talking about what they heard they say that through the door a clown came in hallelujah and he got near then and he told him three times everything the brother told you is nothing but the truth everything that brother told you is nothing but the truth oh god have his weakness everywhere hallelujah so i remember this young person i led him to the lord and in my prayer i always see the face a smiling face nailed down accepting the lord and hear some joy so about 10 or 15 years passed by and i began to wonder what happened to that young man did he hold true to his confession and i began to to to investigate and then i found out about him and i found out that today he's a pastor or 300 a church believer as a lord i'm so glad that he hold true to his confession oh and i fall in love with god more i mean so i when i come into his presence i talk to him i say oh lord i would love to see how you deliver somebody i want to see right in front of me lord and one day i'm delivering mail and here come a beautiful lady and she she had long hair but she is a drug addict and that lady is under a convulsion she's going through something that she needs the drug and she asked me would you give me some money i say i am sorry i am not going to help you destroy your life i said please give me some money and she was going like this i'm sorry and i'm gonna help you destroy your life and then i try to say something and i told her why don't you try to go to church oh wow somehow the world should rip actually say i don't want to hear about church uh uh don't talk to me about church or religion they're not gonna give me what i want and she was leaving but i know that god can turn around and i say excuse me would you come here i said are you gonna give me some money look come over here and that was in the middle of the street and uh i put my mail back down and i said look uh forget about church forget forget about religion give god five minutes and she said what i said look if religion worked for you follow it if not don't just forget about it but give god five minutes and out of her own will she said okay i said look there's two way of believing you believe through the head and you believe through the heart i want you to in five minutes be the most sincere you can be i'm she said okay and then i said repeat with me the siddhis prayer and she began back and forth lord jesus lord jesus you know me you know me better than i know myself and lord jesus lord jesus i invite you today i invite you today to come inside my heart to

it up and give a brand new star for your glory and the lady passed out so i didn't know what to do i had to deliver the mail but then i crossed the street i saw two ladies with long dresses with no makeup i said they must be christian i said excuse me sister come over here they came running i said do you want it yes will you take this lady to your church because today she's born again oh a town passed by i went by the same neighborhood hallelujah and uh and i saw three ladies walking on the sidewalk one of them taken running and screaming and i said you know me and she said yeah don't you remember me i said no you pray for me in this corner today i'm a new creature in christ oh what god can do hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and i'm because i've lost singing i remember one time how the lord dropped a song inside my heart and it's such a beautiful way when god does this thing it just make you to love him more and put you on the expectation the way he came and i remember all the word on the song i believe the song was share that beautiful name the name of jesus and as i began to deliver the mail i said oh lord you're gonna do something today hallelujah and as i'm walking i'm singing the songs hallelujah or suddenly i come to a a house and this lady sitting on the porch and she was very skinny but this lady had a bible on her hand and she was flipping through the pages and when i saw hope with the bible wow look at the bible and she said yes somebody told me i was gonna find the answer over here and i said praise god yes indeed because jesus christ is the answer to all of life problems to every problem in your life there is a promised world and yes the answer is there but you must know how to enter him would you like to enter it oh lord hallelujah and she said yes thy young lady accepted the lord and she was also a drug addict that son that i picked it up i took it to church she got baptized and as soon as she got off from the water no more drug habit all for the glory of god god is good and then as time passed by hallelujah my daddy got sick and uh they're rushing to the hospital when they're watching to the hospital the doctor said well there's nothing we can do is very he had a stroke or aneurysm uh it's very delicate so in this hospital hallelujah it was so big and they saw the emergency room is so vast big so many family in each table and each family with the number an emergency inside the hospital so one of those family was me for my dad so i told the doctor doctor you do what you gotta do but we're gonna do what we know we

family and they were screaming and crying and saying i'm sorry we're giving 24 hours so when i heard that i came today and i said excuse me is everything okay so no they gave us 24 hours do you believe in god yes do you mind if i pray i said please so when i pray for that person and i remember the prayers lord jesus give this man one more chance for when he leave this place he might tell someone about what you have done you have given him a new opportunity in the name of jesus i rebuke the spirit of death upon this man for the glory of god and next day the men totally healed and the men screamed in the emergency room we're going home i'm totally free let that your man pray for you and everybody look around who is that young man for the glory of god the men went home they know the suddenly another emergency and the king of doctor come and they bring the bad news to the family now this family hallelujah they have a pentecostal family in there so when i came over i got so happy i said oh lord they are believers we can unite our faith amen and break the joke and whatever we're bound in heaven will be bound on bound in love will be bound in heaven so when i came to them the pentecostal say why pray god's gonna take it home i said oh i didn't expect that answer but then i replied but there's nothing too hard for the lord and then the reply back but he already lives here i said i'm sorry it's okay god bless you but as i was leaving the wife is a catholic and i heard when she told the nurse i said he will only take a when i heard that i said excuse me lady you say it will only take a minute i said yes so you believe in god i said yes do you manifest pray oh she got so happy and then the pentecostal got upset i said lord i don't understand so i put the gown now when i went to this man hallelujah he had so many machines hook up onto him one for the long one for the kidney one for the to breathe and one for the heart but i said the same prayer lord jesus give this man one more chance that when he leave this place he might be able to tell other what you have done i rebuke the spirit of death upon this man for the glory of god so the next day hallelujah they start to come to the emergency room and say lady we had to unhook one of the machines because the kidney started working and the little lady jumped the prayer the prayer the prayer and then she told me let's go pray again i said no lady we already prayed no no no no let's pray again so we pray again and then the next day the doctor came back and said look the loan started working and we have to unhook another machine and the lady jumper said the prayer that prayer let's go pray again i said no lady we already prayed no no no let's go pray and we pray again and to make it short i was able to

that man to his home totally healed on his way out he had a heart attack and he died oh lord i spent almost an entire day praying and crying i'm a prayer what just one word lord why he was going home and after seeking the lord the lord in his grace and mercy he's come down and he said leno i was calling him home but you were standing on the way i said oh lord i never pray again for nobody i am sorry no i never pray again for nobody so i came back to the emergency room and the rumor spread that's the young man and i said i'm sorry i'm not praying for nobody ah that's it i'm not praying for the body about two or three or four days passed by and then the scripture was quickened now they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i said lord you cannot take the scripture away from the bible it is written you wrote it i said yes lord and then i said but what is wrong then i say oh i must change my way of praying and then i said lord if it is your will for this man to live give him one more chance oh and i felt the peace of god and i say okay lord i'm ready now order suddenly i'm not emergency or for the glory of god but it happened almost five times in that area that even the norse came and told me lino would you work for the hospital and help these people i say i'll be here until my daddy is here and for the glory of god my daddy came out and he lived two years totally healthy and healed but then my daddy had an accident and uh when he had that accident uh my family told me oh lino the doctor said that there's nothing they can do i smile i said do you know how many time i heard that there's nothing the doctor can do but my god can do everything so finally to make the the testimony short my daddy passed and uh god took him home now thou really shook my faith i could not praise the lord i couldn't see what almighty god was sir because every time i sing it i look up to her and i said lord you said the almighty god oh you let my daddy go you said oh you're powerful boy you let my daddy go for months my faith was shaken and one day there was another emergency in the family there was a a a close friend of ours that developed a tumor on the left side and the doctor said we have to operate as an emergency because it's growing too fast so the operation was on a friday but then on that thursday night they say call by the linos let's gather the believer and let's have a word of prayer for our sister i couldn't pray but i looked up to heaven and i said lord i bet you couldn't hear her but he couldn't do nothing for my dad so we prayed for the lady they let it go for surgery on friday and the doctor couldn't find the tumor oh he shook my face even more i said you sing lord but he couldn't do nothing for my daddy so another two or three week time pass by and still my faith is shaking there's another emergency in the family and this time is a close friend of ours and this person is illegal in the state has no drivers like he's driving had no driver's license has no insurance in the car and then it's illegal don't speak english had no short nothing and she crashed a car and the accident belonged to a uh uh a young man that a family job bought a brand new car for his birthday and she ate the red light no troubles license no insurance illegal she had everything against her so the policeman came and said to the lady you gotta go and face the judge so the day before that call by the leader god of the believer let's have a word of prayer and i looked up to heaven and i said lord i bet you're gonna help her but you could have helped but daddy so we said the world we pray so when she go before the judge the judge then a lady you can go home there's nothing against you this your man who knew christ his brand new car he's gonna fix the car himself i said lord i don't understand so finally i come to the lord and i said lord you took my daddy home so by his grace he'd come down and say leader if you tell your daddy to go back to earth because you need him he will not come i said what yeah he will not come you don't know where he is anyone that come here don't want to go back i said what then i remember brother brahms went to the other side and he didn't want to come back so that suits my faith and i renew my faith and my love back to god i said lord let thy will be done then i remember the old lady that she said leno you're spending on the way hallelujah when i was calling him home i said lord the lord give it and the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord now as time went by i move from one place to the other and every time i move i make sure i pray hallelujah i went to the play i'm doing the sun service i in the sun serving the congregation there's a beautiful sister that a color sister that when she's singing oh it's an angelic voice and she just blessed us so dearly honestly come with cancer and when she comes with cancer hallelujah it spread so fast that all the suddenly the doctor said there's nothing we can do now over here hallelujah the servant of the lord pray glory to god declare healing but she was still in the hospital so i went to visit my sister as a sister and when i looked at her she told me berlino i just tried to get out of here and go back to church and worship the lord oh that just touched my heart that was a saturday and that saturday night all through the night i spent the just praying for my sister lord bring her out lord give her a new opportunity father now at five o'clock in the morning his voice come down again i said leno i am waiting on the church when i heard the voice of god i i couldn't wait for the pastor to come and share with the pastor what the lord said i am waiting on the church i said pastor this let's dedicate this sunday to our sister that is depending on our prayer let's dedicate every song every minute let's bring the entire congregation into a burden and when a love is projected it will produce oh but if we were not in the same spirit you can read between the lines and then i say okay pastor don't do anything it is okay it is okay so that they are led to some service and i was the last one to leave the church i wanna close the church at two o'clock in the afternoon at the same hour my sister passed away oh i had a nut i wanted to scream and i couldn't i i wanted to to cry and i couldn't and i told the minister i'm sorry i am sorry i i i i don't know where i'm going but but i got to meet god i gotta meet god so for for a week for two weeks then i heard that there was a revival in another city and uh i called the brother in church and i said i heard you having a revival look i just want to be there i just want to be in the corner and i just want to feel the presence of god i said brotherly i've been looking for you you changed your number i said i'm sorry my brother because i heard your testimony one time and uh and i want you to give an opportunity and speak in this meeting i said my brother i never spoke before i said brother lina but i believe there's something there just come and i said who's there and there's where this this brother here this other minister's a brother they are more qualified let them speak no i want to hear you the way i was i went and that was my first time so when i went over there my first message was i am waiting on the church oh and the holy ghost poured out and then the phone call started going the holy ghost pulled out and they said who spoke brotherly who anyway so as time went by then the lord began to open doors and the door just up and wherever the lord opened the door i went i went to places that nominated would love to go but i did win i remember one time i was in uh traveling around i heard that there was a sister in the same area where i was when the sister died but belonged to a different church that she had cancer and the doctor gave it up i called upon the pastor i heard about the system yes my brother do you manifest pray for her i said don't just pray come and speak for us so this time i said satan this time you're not getting away i'm bringing the entire church this time i'm bringing the entire body so i told the church what to do and then we rebuked that spirit and when we repuke it we went then and visited her and today our seat is totally here with two brand new lungs that were full of cancer for the glory of god i just fully loving god i just love the way he does things it's so much to say i hope i don't know how much time do i have left but anyway so as time went by and the lord began to open doors uh so i went to to fellowship with them i love that brother so i believe i spent five years with him and uh uh by the grace of god from that day on i visit 22 countries and each one of them has a testimony hallelujah now something beautiful happened in that church i i believe i would love to invite a brother theo one time in miami is the miami believer tabernacle the pastor is so humble and uh and he is surrounded by a youth leader the minister a co-pastor a teacher and they made myself that i do the missionary and evangelism all over so every time i travel i just come home and give a report but something happened in that church hallelujah and uh there was a city that had a dream and the dream that she had was that the angel of the lord a supernatural life fall right down into the puppet and the end you had a book open and whatever your name is called you're supposed to come up to the pulpit and the enemy will give you a piece of paper and then you're supposed to go and sit down so the sister in this church when she heard her name she came up and the angel gave her a piece of paper but what she was sitting down she wanted to see what was in the piece of paper so when she cannot look and she looked down she only saw three and a half so and she gave the dream to the pastor so the pastor don't know and the part to gather the body of believer the minister with him i said brethren this sister had this dream i do not know what it is but i want to share it with you so you go and pray and see what the lord will tell you that he's such a humble pastor and i love him dearly when you preach in his church he don't tell you he tell you that something so all of the body the you know helping in the ministry we come to church prepare every sunday because you don't know well he said brother would you minister today you have to be ready now when he says that i immediately went to prepare something and i prepare out of three and a half by the grace of god and i'm thanking for that seven messages so when i'm done uh i didn't tell him nothing about it but in that church he said berlino uh where we spoke about the three and a half i shared with the church would you come and speak to us so i spoke seven times and he didn't know that i didn't have no more so he went immediately to the other brother now you speak now this is what i want to share with you there was another sister church in the area and the pastor in that church had an emergency he had to leave the country with the entire family so he called my pastor and he said do you have anybody that can take over my church until i come back it's only about three months and the pastor said yes to the leader will help you on that so as i went over there i brought the same thing i spoke over here now one of the messages that uh i was supposed to follow to make it short it was hallelujah uh the rapture of the church are you ready now i spoke one two three four five times and the next message was the rapture of the church but something was happening in the church i prayed to the lord i said lord i need to change my message because i want to help the believer and i pray and i didn't get no answer monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday and then on saturday i said well lord i didn't hear from you i believe it is okay to change the message of the rapture to to help the believer or something was going on in the congregation but on saturday now i am a mailman but all through the week or through the week i have a building of 16th floor and that building each floor has different offices and each offices receive a lot of mail and oh the majority of those mail is critical payment mortgage payment and some kind of payment now all through the week and having a rough time with one letter that a person forgot to put the sweet number or the office number and to make it worse it didn't put a return address so i'm going floyd my floor for all through the week is this little europe no is this little you no now in the post office when we find something like that we supposed to cancel it and then because it has no return address it go to a room called death letter and he stay there there's an old man with all his special when he get a chance he opened one of the letters to see if they can send it back now in my conscience the postman is trained to keep the sanctity of the mail in other words we are not supposed to open none of the mail but i'm having a mind battle because i know that letter is a payment somebody make a payment and it's not going to make it on time i say oh lord and i want to help this person and i'm thinking perhaps the person was in a rush i forgot to put the office number so i waited all through the week but on saturday i said well lord i checked all the offices and this letter does not belong to anybody i said don't forgive me but i'm going to open it just to make sure that i'm help somebody so his payment will not be late now saturday i made up my mind also to change the message for sunday because i want to help the congregation but when i opened the letter it was not a payment the letter says the coming of the lord is at him i want you to encourage my people with this word force testing responsive 416 i said what this letter was for me how can this thing happen and i didn't change the message i preached the rapture hallelujah oh what a mighty god we serve that knows everything now a week pass and when that will pass and some became i said well lord i don't have no more letters so i i hear from you all through the week today is saturday now sunday i believe i can change the last message which was the millennium or everything connected to three and a half but while us leaving the post office there was a lady that came running behind me now this lady in the post office gave me such a hard time because one time i did her route and when i finished i put i didn't know where everything was so i left it on the table so the next day when she came she said who did my route and they said leader so she came to me and opened the mouth and all the but were in the dictionary came out through the mouth sometimes inside of me began to boil but a middle of my lip i beat my lips and i humble myself when i say forgive me next time i do a better job and that lady changed her uh uh hot muffin i was just playing with you play with me anyway that lady came running i said leno don't go wait wait wait i said wow what does she want now lino yes i was listening to this song and something told me to share with you okay what is the song and when i heard the song it shook me because the song said i pray when i come they all be ready and then i said lord i'm not changing nothing i'm living the way it is i'll preach the millennium is coming oh the way god does his thing hallelujah so the pastor bless the pastor was so blessed to hear that the believers were well-fed but i never forget one thing i believe the last service on that church i came early that that sunday and i was rehearsing a song and i had to pass in front of the pulpit to go and get the instrument and rehearse it and bring him to the office so as as i passed through the pulpit nobody in the church i hear the voice of god so clearly like i heard it so many times i said little take away all of those pictures from there because today will be a standing block for somebody now i am not against picture but that's what the lord said and he had people the prime the clown jesus and many others so when i was coming back for the instrument the lord said the same thing leno take those pictures it will be a stumbling block for somebody i say oh lord uh but maybe i might be able to help somebody i can explain each one of them but i didn't obey i didn't obey so while the people started coming to the church and the church began to be full all of a suddenly i feel like somebody is having a fight it's rebuking is speaking loud and they say what's going on i said it what's happened that some of them believe a witness to somebody in the community and those people in the community they used to be idolatrous they used to worship saints full catholic and when they got converted they burned all those pictures all of the sting they burned it so when they came to church they saw the same picture and then i said you told me this was a christian church i burned all of those things wow oh did i cry i brought all the congregation and i came to the altar and i repented before the lord i said lord forgive me lord i pray that you give that person a new opportunity forgive me lord i should obey so i called the pastor from that church and i told him what happened pastor this happened and departed celino obey the lord take the spiritual away for the glory of god now as time went by so many precious things begin to happen i remember one time in this country i don't know how much time i have in this country hallelujah um it was about 11 churches i stood about two months on that country just from church and the thing that god did is so wonderful so wonderful i remember one time and there's a pastor that didn't want me to come to his church so uh he went away on vacation and the believer of that church they were hearing that's why faith comes by hearing the believer heard what was happening in that church so they called the pastor pastor would you invite brazilian to to to a church i said well i'm on vacation but as time went by the pastor investigated and uh uh he found out that i was leaving next sunday so that's something he came to church and i said well i heard brother lino is leaving sunday so i guess we'll catch him next time so when i heard that he was inquiring but i was not gonna come over to his plate because i was leaving so i cancelled my flight so when i canceled my flight the pastor was oh no now brotherline is gonna be in the church but for the people they wanted so i went to his church i'm by the grace of god so i'm look on the side and i see the pastor struggling uh uh having like a mind battle and i said lord help your servant i know you love him and he probably going through a mind battle the reason he heard some rumors and he believed the rumors that's why he didn't want me to come but as the minister the holy spirit pulled out oh how i love him the people run to the altar crying crying so when i saw that i left the pulpit and i went to pray for the people when the partner saw that he came to the pulpit and when he saw his own people receiving the holy ghost and then delivered with tear in his side in front of the congregation he said brotherly no and i look i want you to forgive me i spoke bad about you i said something wrong about you please but you forgive me i said brother it is under the blood that brother was so honest he didn't want a blessing for his people but god knows his sheep oh the lord is so wonderful praise god i want to share one more thing and uh uh it was in mexico in one of those churches way on top of the mountain as i'm doing a gut work there is a sister on that church that is a believer and uh and her husband told don't go to church but she can't come coming because god changed her life now she come coming she can't comment but the husband said i don't want you to go to the church she totally changes i want you the way you want with your pants with your makeup i said but i'm a daughter of god now and the husband beat her up that she called the pastor's pastor i cannot come to church because my husband beat me up or say okay my sister will be praying for you so what has happened her husband is a taxi driver so while he was doing his job he got hold up by robbers so he tried to defend himself and the robber beat him up beat him up so bad that he lost one eye so while he's in the hospital hallelujah the wife visited him and very softly i said honey you know i think this happened because of what you did to me so the husband kept quiet and the only thing he said tell your pastor that i want to see him so when he left the hospital came back to the home every time the pastor came he run away three times he run away but this time when i was there helping the believer doing missionary work the pastor said brother you know let us visit this family so when we went to visit the family he know we was coming and he left the place and he didn't came back into almost 12 o'clock but oh while i was in the house i began to feel something strange i said something is not right so i began to look around and when i looked to my right i saw a a a place so many same or so many like a a a word like how can i say idolatry all kind of saint of virginia peace and that in one little corner and i said no one though that's where those demons are coming from and then i said within myself i wish the pastor will have a word of prayer before we leave so the time came the husband didn't come so when we were getting ready to leave the pastor said well the husband is not here let us go and i said oh i wish the pastor will say let's have a word of prayer but when we was leaving there's a little lady that's crippled in a wheelchair she came running and she said please before you go would you say a word of prayer and i say oh lord you are in business and uh and then the pastor said brother would you do a world of prayer i say oh father may you be glorified so you must know what you're doing and you got to know what you say so when i when i become to pray i say lord jesus i want you to go holy ghost go to the room and we process that room for the glory of god when the united states invade another country they put a banner and i said this is did we claim this land so the same way father i got to the room and i claimed that bedford for the glory of god father i got to the kitchen and i claimed the kitchen for the glory of god holy ghost may you go up to that corner and we crave this entire house for the glory of god may every

was a youth gathering and i saw all of these young people and i remember brother bryan said that in every local church there is to be a fight for minister so with that in my i said brother look at all of this young men here so something came up and i said uh young man said yes sir tomorrow in service i want to give you five minutes just to say what is your favorite scripture then i told another one then i told another one about seven of them so when sunday came that though i was playing but when the time came the brother would you come and then gave the favorite scripture and they said why then

the to go to the library google it go to the secret period just give an answer it does not matter if any one of you choose the same one oh and something came hallelujah each one of them gave what they found but the lord was doing something so beautiful hallelujah that's why when god inspired you just go ahead and do it you take one step and god will come right behind and take the other step hallelujah now in that little church glory to god uh to put the young people in action we develop what we call a prayer warrior prayer warrior so we have a time when we pray all of us together and we try to teach all of them everything our prayer prayer for intersection prayer with fasting prayer breaking the joke a prayer in the morning prayer in the evening in prayer at night i mean they will cover with everything about prayer and we got all of the beautiful quote from brother brown what he say about prayer we don't have time we shall have time to share but anyway so we developed that group one time i said okay now we want to have a church deliver unclean and free from spirit so today but next weekend we are going to fast friday saturday and then sunday we will return the fast and we did it and we had a revival hallelujah we had a revival that all the gifts came alive even the gift of a young prophet he shook me even the gift or healing there was a young brother that a car killed a dog and he was so inspired that he went pray for the dog and they look in my life and we have a young man that is he called the path to pastor the spirit of the lord now that's the sound of a prophet the spirit of the lord lifted me up and drove me through the city and i saw what everybody was doing and then i looked at the church and i saw what the church was doing i'm pastor i saw when something happened something happened in this room then the door was closed and nobody couldn't get in and i don't know what that means so he shared with the pastor that sunday after the service the holy ghost pulled out in the kitchen so you see everybody being packed out and the door closed and nobody could go where the holy grail just so perfectly like the young men saw it all those young people were so excited hallelujah so we had a prayer warrior group now as i was traveling oh i hope i'm not getting close to myself as i was traveling and go to another country so when i go to that other country and i'm having a dinner in this house now in this house the owner of the house they have their own business in the house so when we were having dinner somebody knocked on the door so the host came and said excuse me i just need to take care of these people but just keep eating while i finish and deal with them but what was happening it was a couple that were doing business but they were going through a trial that they couldn't keep it to themselves and then share with that lady so when they share with that lady the lady came to us and they said no the lady told them look i have missionary here with us tonight for you one thing would you share this with them so they call me so when i go and i heard something that all just broke my heart and when i heard the story and this is the story they have two young men and they are they are black it's a black family they are the smartest of children i think they think they're young all the way to college they were the brightest and the smartest they get the highest grade in school so because of that they qualify to go to uh one of the special school but what has happened in that school uh they were maybe three or four of the same color now they gave a hard test and they pass it with a 95 and they were joking with it oh daddy i couldn't get a hundred but when they went to celebrate all the school they had a uh what they call a party or a feast something happened to those two young men when they left that party they lost their mind and the parents do not know what happened for three and a half years these two young men they spend the rest of their life in the basement the parent came and opened up the burden to this family i said i don't know what to do i took him to every hospital and they said there's nothing wrong with him i took him to a specialist and they say and the last they told me is you have to go and see an exorcist because there's nothing wrong with them but they are crazy they lost their mind so when they told me that and they shared that with me i said sir do you mind if i go and see them the the father cry i said you you are the first one that ever told me that that ever wanted to see my children please come so i go with the deacon to the house and brother when i saw these two young men they are sitting in front of a tv and the tv has no image it's just going around around and around and they're just watching with mount open and the eye wide open like that i said this is my children three and a half years for the last three months they don't come up and support with us i say with god all things are possible so when we came up we began to sing only belief as soon as we began to sing only believe those young men slammed the doorbell and the father scream don't close the door keep it open i said brother don't worry god does not need an open door he knows how to get them anyway so i left and i went back to mexico and i went to these prayer warriors i said pray warriors now we have a job to do for the glory of god i'm gonna bring before you this young man brian and brandon they lost their mind and they don't know what's wrong with them so we fasted friday we fasted saturday and we first sunday and when sunday came that we are about to return the fast before we did it the entire church they said teaching when all the church prayed together oh the church has so much power all glory so when the entire church got to get into a great meal i said wherever the spirit of brian brandon is we command you go back to their body we feed it return the fast and then i travel back to the country when i travel back to the country i did the same thing we fasted for three days but i told the family bring me a piece of clothes and when they brought a piece of cloth we pray over it and i said take it to them and we went back to mexico to the prayer warrior we are not giving up until we see result because we shall almighty god hallelujah and this young people they were so excited they want to see god in action they are believer hallelujah so when they reach i keep calling the family one week the dad took the clothes no the cloth is still on the bed i called that trick did they took the clothes no the clothes still on the bed they told weak did they took the clothes yes they took the clothes about a week later something happened that they began to talk to the father and the mother and the first thing they said mommy do you have a bible that was the first sign if god started it i know he was going to finish it so i kept on calling uh how the boys doing brotherly no they came out of the basement and for the first time in our family they are sitting in front of a desk having been together so i call again two weeks later how are they doing brother lino

god those two young men got 100 restore back for the glory of god amen amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord amen and this young people got so excited hallelujah and you know mexico is some kind of like like a dangerous place so the room will spread and the fear of god is upon them and then there's a believer that goes to this church hallelujah and where he lived the naval got kidnapped and the family called this christian family that got to this church where the brave warriors are i said please do you have a word of prayer they kidnap a husband and they're asking for money if not they're gonna kill out we have no money so the brother called me said brutalino would you get a prayer warriors and do the same thing as god did with brian and brandon so i called the young the prayer warrior prayer warrior let's pray again our god still on the throne so we fast and we pray and three days later they release the men with no ransom payment for the glory of god oh hallelujah and the people worship and another mom passed by then another emergency came into that church but this time it was a young lady this only a young lady got kidnapped and you know when they kidnapped a young lady for uh they called a sexual slave so the family called i said paulino would you get a prayer warriors this has happened so we call the prayer with prayer warrior we got one more job to do for the glory of god and a week later they released the lady untouched for the glory of god amen oh lord our god is an awesome guy i'll finish with this brother brother theo and there's so much more to share hallelujah in that same church when the pandemic came glory to god the pandemic got the pastor the wife the children and almost half of the church hallelujah and the pastor got the one that was hit the most so when he went to a doctor the doctor had five patients and he was the worst of all of the five patients but when the brother called me hallelujah not thinking that he was going to make it but for the glory of god hallelujah i share a scripture with a brother i said little brother teach you people to receive the holy ghost receive the holy ghost make emphasis in the experience of the holy ghost so anatomy look god one time was going to kill moses because moses didn't want to circumcise his son and the circumcision was a type of the holy ghost so when the brother heard that something happened to him he screamed out and i believe he had an experience of the holy ghost and he was healed and delivered on the pandemic so when he went to the doctor the doctor said you are a miracle because you were the worst one of all of them for the glory of god and so much more to say i share this with you right here in this community uh i heard something so beautiful of a husband wishes for his wife that he wanted to buy her this he wanted to do this for her [Laughter] and do this for her and when i heard that that that that just as the father that is so beautiful to hear from the husband to his wife and i kept it with him but two or three weeks later i heard he was struck with the pandemic he had coveted i said well we'll pray for him we trust that he will be uh free but a week later they say they've got to say that they give him up there's nothing they can do when i heard that i said oh no no father so i made arrangement to go and see him and visited him it was hard because they would not let no one come in but they summoned with the bible and they said oh are you a chaplain he said yes i'm a missionary just give me five minutes i leave right away um it was horrible by the grace of god they led me in now when i came in the north was taking care of him and uh uh she prepared me to go inside now as soon as i walked in all the all the machines began to to fall from from from from from green to yellow to red and all the machine began to sound the man was leaving he was going he was dying so the nurse ran for help and she began to call the other doctor as she left i then came in and i lay hands on my brother i said oh father may you give my brother one more chance that when he leave this place he might be able to tell someone what you have done father if it is your will for this man to live i rebuked the spirit of death on this man for the glory of god and i cursed that pandemic in his life in jesus name amen and as soon as i took my hand from all the lights begin to come back on and all the doctor was standing there and as i was standing there i left right away but then i heard that he was taken out as he's been taking care of and he's still living for the glory of god oh by the tia which i have more time thank you thank you so much for the lino actually since that was the testimony that stirred me this last test of money here and it's amazing that berlin started and talked about his life and with his dad and he kind of hate for how did i treated him and to see the love that he could tell his dad i love you and the whole line is such a blessing and such a powerful testimony i'm coming right back to that key testimony of this guy who better you know shared with me he wanted to do so much for his wife and he got stuck with kovid and he just you know couldn't be able to do it and but he'll even find desire in his heart for what he wants to do his wife here it is it couldn't be materialized in this condition that he's in that he'll go to pray for him and it's such a powerful thing because you know this whole burden of prayer and fasting and burden of god you don't hear much of it and it's so a blessing for us here to hear the testimony of what preenders and faustin does and miracles and so on like that like sometimes there's one day people still believe in miracles they have been hearing the word for so long mechanic mechanic mechanic that it's almost as if the dynamics or the spirit or miracles and signs and wonders it's like a foreign thing it is not jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we want to appreciate berlino thank you much better for these testimonies how many appreciate this the knights of mr knight uh he is our guest speaker and i certainly love and appreciate you and the joy and the zeal and the passion you have something that's rare is something that's outstanding and it is authentic it's not put on so at this time let's bar heads since we want to wrap up in oh blessed be the name of the heavenly father all right thank you for tonight and thank you for all these believers that i stood here listening to a testimony lord and only you could give someone something to that they could testify and we heard about the praying the miracles the deliverances the salvation and all that being uh used lord being done father and we thank you for that lord we thank you for the lino and his testimony we prayed bless him lord prosper his life open doors more doors for him and father may this testimony tonight help someone with this testimony tonight encourage our brothers and sisters to trust you more and to believe that you're the same yesterday and forever and if we act the same way lord and actor and give the right response we'll get the right results father bless you people tonight oh god we certainly appreciate all of them taking the time off to be here to their witness that you are the same yesterday to end today and forever we thank you for the testimonies lord and you know sometimes people seem to only rejoice when it's in their church when it's not in their church they can't say anything but lord we could rejoice because it's for your glory and it's fair kingdom and as we read the scripture that the true spirit of truth will glorify jesus christ and we know that you're honored you're honored to in operation in his life and and we are glad that you could send this witness to us that you are alive you are manifesting yourself you're showing your glory you're healing people from kovid and you would have seen me yesterday then forever bless you people lord bless your coming service is coming sunday i may be glorified in our midst in jesus name we ask it amen and email god bless you and have a pleasant night we are done for tonight god bless you prison
