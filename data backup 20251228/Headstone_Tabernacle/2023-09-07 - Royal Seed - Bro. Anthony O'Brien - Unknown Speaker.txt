we know that God is in control amen of all things so there's no need to worry amen praise God he's got it in his hands I have a title tonight amen my title is Royal C amen that's my title tonight Royal seed and my subject is the kingdom of heaven amen and my inspiration actually I got it from listen to brotherhood's message just almost exactly a month ago in August 6th amen and we're actions uh September uh six now it's exactly a month from now he preached this message uh seven steps to bring down the Capstone amen and um and that's where I got the inspiration for this from praise God because he was speaking and it just struck me praise God uh about something in the scripture and how he was bringing out that the return of the Capstone a headstone the Chief Cornerstone is coming back into its position coming back into its authority to sit upon the the body structure that he has built isn't that right age to age he keeps honing out an image and then he comes and sits at the head of it because he is Christ and Christ is ahead of his church and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell would never Prevail against it amen so it just got me all excited because I began to see that the King was coming back for his throne he was coming back for his Dominion here it was the world had been lost to the devil oh and All His angels and all his demonic forces but there is a promise laying in the wood I will restore oh Hallelujah to you all of the years that the canker worm that the caterpillar that the locus that all the years of Destruction all the years of famine I will restore to you the king is coming oh Hallelujah don't you worry tonight oh we have a message from the Lord we got the king's message tonight don't you be afraid there's something on its way something fixing to happen all that you have lost will be restored to you there is a Revival coming a Revival to sweep the sick off of their cots or the sick will be here the blind will see you the will walk the gospel we preaching as power when the king comes every devil have to run oh Hallelujah on every devil at the finest place because life has no communion with Darkness oh Hallelujah and fair and love cannot occupy the same space or he's come to make war with the Enemy oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God by the grace of God on Sunday amen fighting for homes fighting for families praise God I felt I was right praise God to come in here now and talk about this Royal seed Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah glory amen so what is it it's a royal seed so it speaks to our Royal bloodline isn't that right I know that it comes out of royalty comes out of a kingdom isn't that right and the kingdom has Kings and only the Kings they have a line of Kings which is the sons and their ears they are heirs to the throne and it's a Royal bloodline isn't that right if the king were to die then his sons would take over the kingdom isn't that right there's ears joint heirs with the king oh Hallelujah and God has a kingdom tonight and he also has ears showing ears with Christ that's who you are tonight you are not just anybody but you are royal seed cause and who we call he justified and who he justified he had already glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us tonight oh Hallelujah seed of God tonight pretestinated from before the foundation of the world to take this glorious stand for the gospel in 2023 God put something in your soul to stand against the Devils stand against the walls of the enemy standing in the darkness standing at the force of of evil signs against sickness oh I've seen you tonight oh he put it inside of you and what God put inside of you the devil cannot take it out of you no weapon formed against you shall prosper oh somebody say man oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory amen so we're talking about kingdoms powers rulers isn't that right a kingdom is a territory a kingdom is our domain isn't that right a kingdom talks about Dominion have the same rights praise God as a king as the rulers of that Kingdom isn't that right now the power to move they're the movers and shakers Hallelujah they can make decisions Holly isn't that right and that's how God had his son under him Adam when God created Adam and the Earth and everything he made him ruler over all the kingdoms of the earth of all the kingdoms of the animals of all the kingdoms of plant life animal life over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the Earth God had a man in position on the urge to have dominion over everything that was upon the urge he could speak and it was so he could create and it would be just like Dutch because he had the same power that the father had and God's gonna have sons in these last days with the same kind of power same kind anointing that was upon Adam that was upon brother pranam God's gonna have sons and daughters with the same power oh somebody say Amen oh hallelujah oh I'm all fired up tonight glory to God hallelujah oh this makes me excited Holland do you see what God is restoring back he's restoring back your sonship oh the truth of Zion Oh Hallelujah are coming back into Purity and light once more the world will hear direct from God amen so a kingdom is a political territory unit ruled by a sovereign and the short story is this whenever there's a kingdom if there's two kingdoms at War what the other Kingdom will try to do is to to topple the other Kingdom in order to do that they have to remove the ruler that is there they have to get rid of the king they have to get rid of his ears because if they kill the king and he has an heir then the throne remains so the whole objective used to be to break the line of Kings so if the king ran out into war with his soldiers this presented an opportunity for the enemy to get at the king or but if he has an heir pray then he will also be able to thrown that they are trying to destroy so it's one kingdoms War infractions do you get it now no wonder the enemies attack praise God he attacked the word because he was trying to get to Adam he was trying to get to Eve they were the rulers of the world at that time when they were in the Garden of Eden everything was perfect everything was lovely and the devil saw that and he saw an opportunity to creep in and to destroy the kingdom that God had set up here on Earth oh that was the attack or he's always been after the Sun of God always went after the daughters of Zion Oh it's been after you but all King is Victorious tonight our King is triumphant tonight he knows no Retreats he knows no surrender we have a five-star general and his name is Jesus and he is here tonight to give you what you need to bring the battle over the enemy oh kill a lot of how to pray Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so that's a paraphrase so now we see what Satan attack was it was after the sons of God because they have the ability to reproduce praise God God put something in there Adam was supposed to speak and more Sons were supposed to come out praise God but the devil tested that program isn't that right and introduce a different seed introduce our serpent seed and now we can trace that seed all the way down from Genesis all the way down to the Bible we can see that serpent seed laying in knowing laying here laying there praising all right always disrupting things but God has a seat also they are the generations of Jesus Christ they are the Royal Seed of Abraham they're just like their father they walk like their father they talk like their father they look like their father throughout ages and through our dispensations called seed has always stood the test doesn't matter the opposition doesn't matter what they face doesn't matter what year they were living in what time they were living in what continent they were living on they had a supreme deity failing them and they conquered they conquered the enemy oh Hallelujah oh that same conquering spirit is laying upon you and I tonight that same conquering anointing the mighty conqueror who conquered hatch who conquered hell who conquered a grave he is here to back you up tonight he is that Royal seed oh and he said as my father sent me even so send now you he spoke he breathed receiving the Holy Ghost oh at 120 near Peru receive oh the holy spirit in their soul quick and not seed brought it to life oh what shall we say to these things Brethren oh if God before us who can be against us God is fixing a poor out of Revival again upon the Royal Seed of Abraham who stood a test in this message through every trial through every test to every Temptation through every cruel interpretation of the devil trying to tweet the people left and right you stood because you stood in the Bible you stood at the promises of Malachi 4 and God will reward your faithfulness without pouring of a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire where there is Faith and spiritual knowledge hallelujah praise God Amen oh Hallelujah [Applause] my oh Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] that's why the devil is after that's why I hit you so much you represent the thing that he couldn't have he challenged God in heaven oh for the worship isn't all right and he got kicked out so because he got kicked out of heaven he had a personal Vendetta against you on all your children but we come against you did Satan with the blood of Jesus Christ we come against you oh all the power vested in us as sons of God we challenge the enemy upon every ground he stands upon we chop your head off oh how dare you the fire the armies are the Living God or who is you great Mountain before the rubber Bell thou shall become a plane and the head so shock her port with shoutings with shoutings with shoutings tonight [Applause] Hallelujah oh you have a right to the Holy Ghost you have a right to Victory you have a right to pray and have your prayer answered because you're not just anybody you are son of the you are son of the Living God daughter of the Living God thank you oh Jesus has set me free oh my God he connected you by Death I sacrifice by the cross we are no more strangers and pilgrims and foreigners we are now joined heirs with Christ Hallelujah isn't that right through the adoption of sons you could come into this inheritance the same inheritance and Adam forfeited in the Garden of Eden you come right back into that it's restored back to you oh what was lost back there I will restore saith the Lord hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Oh missing limbs will be restored eyes nose hairs kidneys speaking back into existence oh hallelujah or spoken word power it's getting ready to come from your lips amen amen oh man glory to God oh we're on the expectation tonight to see the miraculous because that is Who We Are we oh we come from miraculous you come from the world at half that you can't see or feel or touch Supernatural Kingdom it's not a natural Kingdom but it's a spiritual Kingdom praise God Hallelujah by faith you know that there's blood runs through your veins this Royal bloodline of Jesus Christ who is upon you he called in the back part of his mind he loved you there he gave birth to you there in the black part of his mind you are his son you are his daughter how can I forget Israel he they are in grief in the palm of my hands every time I look at my hands I remember my children every time I look at my hands I remember my son I remember my daughter how can he forget you tonight oh just reach up your hand to heaven and say Remember Me Lord Remember Me Lord Remember Me Lord remember your promise he is faithful to to what he has promised amen oh that's right Glory Glory so you see what the attack was against the sons of God you know brother said every son I've got a child of God has always been persecuted throughout he is because this world had hated uh Jesus isn't that right and Jesus said a servant is no greater than his Lord if they hated me they will hate you also blessed are you when you are a violent curse for my sake oh hello for you are glorified oh and when these things happen to you amen amen hallelujah he promised to take care of his own he'll never leave you never forsake you always be with you always have Flash and blue lights around you tonight praise God Amen Hallelujah what can the devil do oh Hallelujah and not what God won't allow oh hallelujah amen Oh Glory amen double actually came he came to church when but when he and God is having a conversation he say you have a header on job you have one I see it but he had a head wrong the devil said he had a head wrong I may not be able to see the Hedge but it was there yeah so you see he protects oh Jesus is a fence amen all around us every day amen you believe it praise God okay something I want to read here the prophet said to breach between the seven changes he said now when Adam's sin by heating his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word that's what made Adam sin his wife reasoned with Satan and then produced the product to Adam and Adam turn loose the word and sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember he said the day either of that day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life oh so I want you to get it amen's not right he did not only that didn't only die in that way but also his inheritance was lost praise God to write all things isn't that right not the father had given he lost that say God is God of the universe everywhere but his son had his this Earth under his control amen and that's the domain that he gave up when he sent in the garden even you get enough all right he said he could speak he could name he could see he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to do see but when he did that the sin he lost his inheritance and now Adam could say let this mountain move over here and it would do Adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and planted it would do it see for he had complete Supreme control as I might not go under God or father because he was a son of God you see it was a e now could we stop here a minute and just get a real sermon see he said oh then if the blood he said no the prophet said then if the blood has cleansed it back then what about now see look what the Son of God the second Adam did see he said the work that I do shaliru also he said Adam lost his inheritance the Earth but now it passed from his hand on to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith to God soul is Faith to in God to Satan's reasonings and therefore his eternal life is right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited every every bit of it to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan so you see Satan is controlling all over this world this Kingdom over here it's not right he told Jesus when he's up on the mount exceedingly great mount isn't that right and he told Jesus said to you I am rule over all these things all of these kingdoms of the world let's not run he said therefore now he said it had been uh and it returned see and he had been polluted and the seed of Adam was destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the Earth that's right he said the Sea of the seed of Adam and when wars were fought uh him it's not right okay all right here now so so we see the world is once again once governed by the spirit of God isn't I and sin came into the picture and then the world ended up in captivity to the devil but Satan just but God promised to restore his kingdom isn't that right Psalms 149 verse 1 says praise he the law sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King who is the king God is the king isn't that right amen he said let them praise His name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the Timberland harp said for the lord taketh pleasure in his people oh Hallelujah you are the object of his pleasure tonight when you give him glory when you give him praise oh Hallelujah when you awake earlier and praise the name of your God from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same his name is worthy to be praised oh he said he will beautify the meek with salvation oh let the Saints verse 5 be joyful and Glory oh let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the Heathen and Punishment upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles which settles of iron oh Hallelujah to execute upon them the Judgment written this honor all his Saints praise ye the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah you have an honor tonight to run the squatters off of your land to run the squatters off of your inheritance to run the Philistines out this honor have all the saints you have the honor tonight to take the sword of the word of God and go to chopping go to

the word of God and you go to Cotton tonight every promise oh hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah Glory amen I understand a long time ago they used to name their swords men used to name their swords

a claim can be enforced now to bring back anything to it to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs isn't that right so when this King something the king get uh expelled you know and some great Overlord comes in and takes over usually it happens if a kingdom is subdued by another kingdom that Kingdom that Kingdom becomes slaves to the ruling Kingdom isn't that right it's not right they're more powerful in there and they have no King the lines of King is broken most of the time these people end up slaves to the kingdom not a subdue them and take them over it's not right

but the only thing I come to recognize is back in Africa his father is a king of a tribe and even though he's here pulling the fields and pulling a cotton even though he's here slaving like everybody else he knows his father is a king somewhere and just the knowledge of it make him walk different make him talk different make him act different oh Hallelujah we are in the world but we are not of the
