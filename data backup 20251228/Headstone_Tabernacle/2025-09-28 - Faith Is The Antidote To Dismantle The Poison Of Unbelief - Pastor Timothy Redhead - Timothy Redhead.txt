You are the truth. away. I bless your name. I bless your name. Father God, we thank you for this morning. We thank you for your presence. We thank you because we are dependent on you. We see your moving of your spirit. You release an end time message that we can receive in our hearts. Lord, come and live among us this morning and come and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome to our Sunday morning feast with the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So I want to welcome each and everyone one of you here this morning. And uh first I want to salute brother Jonathan Martin for the three inspiring messages given over the last weekend. Will I find faith? The motivating force of our lives and the dynamics is here. &gt;&gt; It was such a refreshing experience to know truly God had his men everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men without agendas, men who are fearless, men who are not ashamed of the son of man or his words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also want to salute my precious brother here, brother Timothy Redhead, &gt;&gt; for ministering to us. and he'll be speaking to us this morning and blessing us with a word the gospel not so much for jump for joy but for a heart searching experience &gt;&gt; where men and women can get right with God. Now Deuteronomy chapter 28 is a powerful book, a powerful scripture where God say if you obey him what he will do for you and then he he talk about the curses if you don't want to obey him &gt;&gt; and if you obey him he'll bless you going out going in and everywhere and multiply and everything else &gt;&gt; but there's a particular verse there that was quite striking and uh brother Andrew uh Lulen brought that to my attention and I he says and and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for under upon the sea forever because thou servest not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things. So God want you to serve him with joyfulness &gt;&gt; and gladness of heart &gt;&gt; not with grump &gt;&gt; with grumpiness and every other negative sort of thing. And this is where Psalms 100 is so powerful. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord all the lands. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his court with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name. For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, and his truth endureth to all generations. Oh, give the Lord some praises this morning. So, that's how God want us to come into his house. Not with a long face, not like the whole burden like you carry the whole burden of the world upon your shoulder. No, but with joyfulness, &gt;&gt; with gratefulness. You don't hold tomorrow, but today. Today is your day. &gt;&gt; You are blessed to be here today. You are blessed to be alive today. You are blessed to have activity in your limbs today. So open your mouth and give God some praises. &gt;&gt; Let us stand. Praise God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The cross. I want to sing that song in the cross. Jesus keeps winning the cross. Oh dear, my Lord. &gt;&gt; Preious, [Music] &gt;&gt; free to all. A healing stream that flows that flows [Music] from Calary mountain in the cross. Hallelujah. In the cross, [Music] the cross be my glory. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh, [Music] in my wrath your soul shall find [Music] rest beyond the rain. Come on, sing it again. Oh, [Music] the cross. [Music] The cross be my glory. Glory [Music] in [Music] my wrestling [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give him praise. &gt;&gt; Lift your hands and give him praise. &gt;&gt; Give him praise. Give him praise. Give him praise. I feel his presence. &gt;&gt; I feel his presence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Thank you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. [Music] Glory. Praise. Praise the name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Music] Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Omnipotent God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are grateful &gt;&gt; and we are blessed &gt;&gt; to be in your house &gt;&gt; this August morning. Lord, you alone know and nothing happens just by chance. It's all part of your plan. And we are here this morning to be so small that you can be seen and that you can be heard Lord because you always use men but Lord we have found out that we need to become invisible so that you become visible. &gt;&gt; We don't have a message. We all were born in sin. Came to this world speaking lies without a hope. &gt;&gt; Had it not been for you and your power to seek &gt;&gt; and to save, &gt;&gt; we would not be here. And so we deem it a privilege &gt;&gt; and we deem it an honor &gt;&gt; to represent and to be part of the kingdom of heaven, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven, &gt;&gt; Lord, because without you, we are nothing. &gt;&gt; And without your presence, &gt;&gt; we would know nothing. &gt;&gt; And so I pray that you will just have your own way. &gt;&gt; Help me. Help us &gt;&gt; and build faith &gt;&gt; and dismantle unbelief. &gt;&gt; May your presence that we feel now become visible &gt;&gt; and explode among us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; and do your thing &gt;&gt; and achieve your plan. &gt;&gt; For we are unprofitable servants &gt;&gt; and there's nothing good in us. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what is in man. So I have not come here for fame or for any other reason but that your people can receive a word from heaven. &gt;&gt; And so Lord God, we need your help. We need your help. We're in a dark hall. &gt;&gt; And if you don't help us, we perish. And you said in your word that gives us hope. You're not willing that we perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that we make it. &gt;&gt; And your journey to the cross will not be in vain. Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be &gt;&gt; a bride. &gt;&gt; There will be somebody to identify and said, "I appreciate you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your coming was not in vain. &gt;&gt; The blood you shed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The drops you shed, &gt;&gt; the pain you went through, the anxieties you had, you even wept. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be in vain. So help us. God is not going to be in vain. &gt;&gt; And we will yet win &gt;&gt; and the bride, that little bride will yet overcome. &gt;&gt; We thank you that you were about your father's business and you would never deviated. You could have got married. You could have built a house. You could have done a lot of things, but we were more important. And our livelihood was more important. &gt;&gt; And you denied yourself these things. &gt;&gt; So that we wret sinners can become saints. &gt;&gt; We owe you. We can never repay you, but we can show appreciation. &gt;&gt; And that's why we are here this morning. Bless the brothers. Bless the people. Bless us all. &gt;&gt; And then don't forget me. Give me a blessing too. And we'll not forget to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory that is due to your mighty name, &gt;&gt; speak, touch, deliver, heal, raise up as only you alone can do. &gt;&gt; These things we ask in your magnificent name. I think of my brothers in Grenada who are listening and watching. May you touch them too. And wherever there are people of yours, wherever they may be this morning, don't forget them, Lord. We need you. &gt;&gt; If there was ever a time, if there was ever a moment, there was ever a period that we needed to get a word from you is now. And so, Father, I pray that you will we will not be disappointed because we come in faith so that you can meet our needs. These things I ask in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And turn around and greet the person next to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can have your seats and just bear with me for being a &gt;&gt; cry baby. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. I &gt;&gt; usually before I preach or not preach before God uses me, I spend the day in his presence and I avoid going anywhere so that I can first of all consecrate myself cuz this place might look simple but this is a place of life and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. and your souls and my soul are involved and therefore the things that you hear from me it must be from him. &gt;&gt; I cannot save you. He has already done that. &gt;&gt; I cannot heal you. He has already done that. &gt;&gt; But he can use me to reach you &gt;&gt; and he can use you to hear what we say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are praying that that's what's going to be done this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I yesterday I had a real battle and I realized that God wanted you to get something. But the enemy was determined to fight and whatever you do this morning. Even if you don't remember me, remember these words because words are what is going to judge us by &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; Words are not ordinary. They are spirits. and they have life or death in them. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to pay close attention to the things that I'm going to share with you this morning that the Lord has given me cuz I myself cannot do this. I don't have enough brains and I do not have enough degrees. I did not even go to a university. I I you notice I can't even use a computer. This is my computer. So, I am the least of the preachers and I pray that the Lord will be able to speak to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Isaac told me I don't have to panic about time. That don't mean I won't go forever, but it just means that I'll be able to go as God desires and stop when he says stop. Cuz whatever I say is not going to mean nothing. But whatever he says, it will be used on that day. &gt;&gt; So remember, you're not here to see one another, which is good. You're not here to show off the nice dand, which is good, but you're here to hear words of eternal life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In Grenada, whenever somebody dies, they say, "Rest in peace." But of course, that's because they don't know better. Cuz if you did not take the word and become the word, then how you going to have peace when everything the word said is stored in your computer, your heart? And every time you had an opportunity to hear those words and to live those words, &gt;&gt; it's recorded. God don't chase you. He doesn't have to follow you and to come behind you and see where you're going. This is what does it &gt;&gt; and therefore whatever you hear is what you're going to be judged by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because as the people say in Grenada, you're big on your sense. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you use that to be able to live the word that you hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's go to the word cuz as I said, you didn't come to hear me. You come to hear the word. And this morning for those who did not see what the uh monitor put up, I'm going to try to speak on faith is the antidote to dismantle the poison of unbelief. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that unbelief is a poison. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is the dreadest phenomena the Christian bride will ever have to deal with. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only difference between the bride that cannot be deceived and the one that is deceived is unbelief. &gt;&gt; And because unbelief is a deadly thing, we want to make sure we are not walking with it. We are not carrying it. And we are not we don't have it in us. &gt;&gt; Because after all is said and done, you're balling, you're crying. It's not going to help you over there. &gt;&gt; Anything you have to do is here. &gt;&gt; Everything you have to do is here. Once you close your eyes, that's it. &gt;&gt; And as a tree leans, it falls. You can't be leaning so fall back. So, and your works testify of your life. So, let's turn our Bibles to John 14:12. John 14:12. And I know that you are younger than me, so you'll get it before me. So I'm going to read now because I'm going to believe you have it. Father God, these are red letter words in this holy Bible. That means they can never die. And even though they were spoken 2,000 years ago, it is as real as it is today. &gt;&gt; And so, Father God, I pray you will bless it, multiply it, and let it bring back that which you sent it out for. Amen. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. And greater works than these shall ye do, because I go unto my father. And whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the father may be glorified in the Son. The second one is Matthew 13. Matthew 13. reading from verse 53 and that's tongue in the back. And may the Lord bless the word. And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed then. And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said, "Whence had this man this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter son? Is not his mother called Mary and his brethren James and Josie and Simon and Judas and his sisters? Are they not all with us?" When's then had this man all these things? Watch that. And they were offended in him. were offended in him because they didn't know that a man like that could be doing these works. &gt;&gt; And they said, "And he said unto them, a prophet is without not without honor, save in his own country and in his own house." Watch verse 58. You could read with me. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. He didn't say he didn't speak but he did not let the words that he spoke manifest itself into works. So you can hear a lot of words but the manifestation of that word to become life is a whole different thing &gt;&gt; because unbelief can block that word from birthing &gt;&gt; fake things like miracles and signs and wonders. You can have your seats and I'm going to go straight into the meat. As we said, faith is the antidote to this monthlong belief. We started it some time ago. And by the way, let me give thanks and praise to brother to God for men like brother or Isaac and and for bringing me here this Sunday morning so I can share these things with you. And as I said, I trust that it will help you. Now the most common reason I'm going to share these things and then get into the word to dismantle something is for maintenance, repair or to remove unsafe or obsolete items. The purpose can range from getting a better understanding of how a complex system works and we can also dismantle something to identify weaknesses or faulty parts &gt;&gt; so as to replace the damage or worn out parts worn out parts and it looked like some of the bride some of the people in this message have become a little worn out &gt;&gt; and it's visible in the way you sing in the way you worship. ship. &gt;&gt; It may look good, &gt;&gt; but God who has been in there since when the angels were in heaven and he compare how you were singing there and how you are singing here. He says, "Tim, go and talk to them cuz they can't come back up there the way they are now. &gt;&gt; They have to return to that old original place &gt;&gt; as Job saw." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was asked, "Where were you?" G. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we were there and we came from God and we going back to God, &gt;&gt; we definitely can't go how we are now &gt;&gt; because heaven is a wonderful place. &gt;&gt; You think you're wonderful? Turns to somebody and say, "I am wonderful with that face." Wonderful speaks of spontaneous joy and and light. Your eyes have light. It speaks of no offense, no uh whatever we call hindrances, &gt;&gt; no guide. &gt;&gt; It speaks of being trusting. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. Is a wonderful place filled with glory and grace. &gt;&gt; And then we say, I want to see my savior's face. Heaven is a wonderful. Heaven is a glorious. Heaven ain't going to have people who are not wonderful. &gt;&gt; You got to prepare now. &gt;&gt; You can't wait until after dead and do like the Roman Catholics. What you going? We're going to do a Dina and we going and see if we could raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to do that now. &gt;&gt; Fix it now. &gt;&gt; You remember how you were 25 years ago? &gt;&gt; Pull the tape and show you worshiping 25 years ago. and show you worshiping now. And the question would be, what have you lost? What have we lost? Uh why is there a a worn out service? Now, I'm not talking to you alone. Grenada is listening to me now. So, I'm talking to everybody. And I'm glad because you can't say who I talking to. So, if the parts are worn out, you have to dismantle. So once the change is done, it leads to improvement, smoother operation, more efficiency, superior performance. &gt;&gt; I remember uh uh fellowshipping with brother Clarence and we were talking about Abel and we were talking about Cain and Abel's sacrifice was similar to Cain but there was a difference. &gt;&gt; Abel's sacrifice was what? More excellent. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Excellent is a word that is only given to above normal. &gt;&gt; You don't say excellent is something that passed degrade or he did well. Excellent means beyond &gt;&gt; what is expected. &gt;&gt; And his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So talk to me. &gt;&gt; His sacrifice was more excellent &gt;&gt; than Cain. &gt;&gt; Cain was there. &gt;&gt; Cain brought his sacrifice and he had all his fandangle and his rituals and so on. But Abel, &gt;&gt; Abel went down into the soul. &gt;&gt; He went down into a place where his hands got dirty &gt;&gt; with blood. &gt;&gt; You know we are scornful. I want to touch this. Uh-uh. He was identified &gt;&gt; with that bloody sacrifice. He was not ashamed to be identified with his origin. But Kane who was a nice proper sad child you know decent &gt;&gt; came permanent proper &gt;&gt; oh me papa oh me you know what I'm talking about and God did not even stay turn his back on him and send no smoke to stifle him and chase him out &gt;&gt; he was not accepted &gt;&gt; and God can't change. &gt;&gt; Remember, you're not dealing with papa or brother T or me. Many times people come to please the pastor, but you're missing it. &gt;&gt; You here to please God. &gt;&gt; You're not breathing my air. I don't tell you breathe. Breathe. I don't tell you that. And you don't wait for me to say, "Okay, can I stop breathing?" No. God is the one that giving you breath. &gt;&gt; Then give him his praise. &gt;&gt; Give him his honor. give him his glory. &gt;&gt; So, let's go on with this um dismantling because for those ladies, you know, they're not too familiar with these words. So, I want you to get it. Dismantling means to break it up, twist it, mash it up, move it from where it was. &gt;&gt; And what is are we doing that to unbelief? &gt;&gt; Look at you sitting here. Can anybody see if you have unbelief? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Where would he be hiding? &gt;&gt; Not in your shoes. Not in your socks, &gt;&gt; not in your handbag. &gt;&gt; That old criminal is hiding inside. &gt;&gt; He took a trip. He took a trip with you and he says, "We're going to church this morning." &gt;&gt; And he and he jing it with you on the highway. &gt;&gt; And as I was driving, I watched 100 and I watched June. I said 100. And I realized in Trinidad, those signs are not for you. is for the birds. Might as well they remove it. Nobody don't study it. People are just gone. And brother T was talking about boundaries that is not for Trinies. I'm like I'm amazed. Everybody's boom. &gt;&gt; I wonder if they take out the signs what they would do. &gt;&gt; I wonder what you do &gt;&gt; behind God. I tell you what. But so I maybe that's for the birds. Now to bring this into a spiritual context, when unbelief is dismantled in a believer, it leads to a deeper, more trusting and powerful relationship with God. &gt;&gt; The defeat of doubt and unbelief allows for increased spiritual maturity, &gt;&gt; greater fruitfulness in one's life. Faith is definitely stronger because the previous obstacles between a person and God are obliterated. &gt;&gt; Big word but means destroyed. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now don't want I don't want you to just say amen. I want you to think about it. &gt;&gt; As I told you already, I'm a person that observes. I like to observe things &gt;&gt; because many people act automatic. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; they just do thing, but they don't even know why they do it. &gt;&gt; I like to observe. Why did I do that? Why did I say that? Where is it coming from? What's the source? That explosive temper. Where is it coming from? &gt;&gt; Is that really me? &gt;&gt; All right. So, it leads to a more intimate connection where one can actively taste and see that the Lord is good. Now these are notes on dismantling unbelief. So I ain't preaching yet. I'm just giving you the notes. So it does heighten personal experiences. Are you getting that? &gt;&gt; So notice them things. Intimate connection, &gt;&gt; closer walk, fruitfulness. So if these things are missing, you should by now deduce cuz I know you're big and you have sense &gt;&gt; why you don't have those things or why those things are existing. So, I'm not here to unsave you. I'm here to help you to really get saved &gt;&gt; to really connect with God &gt;&gt; so that when you leave here, the the anointing doesn't leave you. &gt;&gt; Cuz too many times the anointing lasts as long as you're driving down the highway &gt;&gt; and by the time you come to the next service, you got to crank up again. &gt;&gt; That should not be bride. &gt;&gt; Leave that for Pentecost. Leave that for people who looking for something. &gt;&gt; But you're supposed to have something. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to have something more valuable, more excellent. &gt;&gt; Then we have to demonstrate it. And I am one of those people. Like I said, I have a lot of good preachers. You had the brother from thing. And these are men. I can't even dream of preaching like them. But I like to when I come to you and God uses me that when you finish you have to check yourself &gt;&gt; because in the message you have a lot of nice people &gt;&gt; but not many Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. So let's go on. So overcoming unbelief replaces anxiety and fear because you have got peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; So now we graduate from questioning why me and instead realize that God is doing a work in you that is working for your good. &gt;&gt; A lot of people hear that verse all things work together for the good not me. It is for the believer. The things in your life are working for God's good in you, not your good. We don't we not good. &gt;&gt; We don't even know he's good. &gt;&gt; Because what we should do, we don't do. &gt;&gt; Do you know it's good for you to obey the speed limit? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Your car, not mine. &gt;&gt; Everybody get quiet, please. I'm visiting. All right. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham taught that too because he told Billy Paul, he said, "No, I'm my hand will behind your head like a hammer. So every time you go over the speed limit, you knock it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I was talking to June. She say, "I'm going to pay this speed limit." So I look across, I peep and I see 104, 108. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. So additionally, it's for your good. So, additionally, rather than placing a personal experience in judgment against what the Bible teaches, this new faith allows a believer to accept the word as the final authority in the issues we face in life, leading to a more excellent understanding of God and his plan. &gt;&gt; If the people of God could come to that place, then we could go back to the apostolic days. We talk apostolic. We like what we heard, but what about what we seeing, what we experiencing? Aren't you concerned? Where are those days? &gt;&gt; I believe in the book of Acts. I believe in the works that we saw in the book of Acts, but that is not for us to hear as history. &gt;&gt; That's for us to to model ourselves after. So the same baptism they got, we must have. And the same God they met, we must meet. And if we are not doing what they did, Call a heart. &gt;&gt; As I said, this is what God gave me to give you. &gt;&gt; If you vex, read the text. &gt;&gt; You would realize by now that unbelief acts as a barrier to the unbeliever, thus limiting what God can do in their life. However, once unbelief is dismantled completely, there is an immediate flow of God's blessings for it's a lifegiving power of explosion, what you call dynamics. It is restored and then the promises of God begin to come to pass. &gt;&gt; The promises of God is not for them alone. &gt;&gt; The Bible says is the seed is is not seed, not every Abraham alone, but the Abraham and his seed. Seed refers to faith. Cuz Abraham is the father of faith. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have faith, what do we have? &gt;&gt; You get the picture? Cuz you either have one or the other. You either have a doubting devil or a believing faith. &gt;&gt; And if we have a believing faith, it don't make us like that. &gt;&gt; We go up. &gt;&gt; Not like that. Cuz we are climbing into the statue of a perfect man. You can't be climbing into a stat in the statue of perfect man and every day you're going back to see what wrong with patience &gt;&gt; and you climb back down to see I wonder if my faith fix who move it and then you going back up faith virtue knowledge and then temperance and then you had to go back to see the knowledge right &gt;&gt; every day up and down what you think guys up and down the deck &gt;&gt; this is statue god building you not building it &gt;&gt; so leave it alone Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the word build faith. Let the word build virtue. Let the word build knowledge. &gt;&gt; And you can't build those things if you don't believe the word. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to come to the end of your way and then you say them preachers lie to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to make you feel good. I am not here to rub you and give massage. Got to go in them therapist to do that. I am here to make you check &gt;&gt; is all right. Is everything all right? &gt;&gt; Are you dying? Do you need the antidote? &gt;&gt; How is it going to be when you come to cross Jordan? Are you going to be at rest? Why you going to be screaming run all over the place? &gt;&gt; I had a grand uncle cousin rather and he wanted me to do his will cuz you know I work in the bank. I have a little bit of banking knowledge but he thought I have supposed to have legal knowledge. So he said I want you to do the will and he had a lot of children but very mis disagreeable and mischievous. So when I came to do it he was also sick and dying. So I said listen I'm going to New York and I came here to do the will to write it up. So he wrote it up and he leave people. I said what you do number that one is all your children. So I help him put them in because he said left of them they gain nothing. So I say if I sign and that I want to make sure it's as fair as possible. &gt;&gt; So we do everything ready to sign in ready. I say you sign it. I'm going away now. He said go and come back. Truth be told while I'm over there they said oh my god when he lying down he just getting up and run. He just g up and run. He can't sit down. Why the devil after him? &gt;&gt; Playback time. &gt;&gt; He ain't dead yet and he running. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he did a lot of wrong. &gt;&gt; He did a lot of things that he should not have done. And he he he prayed dead. &gt;&gt; Many of us looked like we okay &gt;&gt; until we start gasping &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you want to know. You know there's a lot of people like that. They have a lot of secrets but they ain't going to let them go unless they're dying. &gt;&gt; Been making things right unless they're dying. didn't fixing offenses and as said my God &gt;&gt; who does hinder us where we get that from &gt;&gt; unbelief. &gt;&gt; You don't can't be waiting until he dying to fix things. &gt;&gt; Don't man that ever get that chance was the thief &gt;&gt; and the thief had repent and Jesus forgive his sins. &gt;&gt; You there with Jesus you dying when he there by you right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only if you're in me. So you can claim that you thief and at the last minute I go wait until I get and then say Lord I surrender myself to thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back home in Grenada in the revolution. My my cousin was the wife of Morris Bishop and I found myself in the revolution. In the revolution the revolution was not in me. I found myself in a big following thing. My father kicked me out of the house. He said the Bible and the gun don't go together. And there I was in the what do we call the radio station looking for Americans and we were singing let them come. We go bury them in the sea. When you're stupid, you're blind. We even have a plane. We even have a helicopter. Let them come. Let them come. We go bury them in the sea. And we set a truck from Cuba. And I them cuz I don't know better. And I had a little Beretta. &gt;&gt; It's a little Beretta. And we felt that we were defending the country. I don't know if you hearing me. &gt;&gt; And I was defending something that I didn't believe in. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do I know that? Because all they have to say is crack and I home home. &gt;&gt; And many people come to church cuz the day with them. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Light and we take it to them. &gt;&gt; Any let's go on. So when you dismantle unbelief, a Christian can begin to bear fruit, spiritual fruit. As they say, you're connected to Jesus Christ, the true vine, because unbelief is dismantled. Faith is replaced. It strengthens this spiritual connection leading to a life that automatically produce the fruit of the spirit. Then here comes our lovely family walking through life. Here comes love, joy, longsuffering, brotherly kindness, temperance, patience. It's like a a lovely family going down. you is that family all that in you [Applause] but the devil don't want you to have that so he's giving you his lie he's giving you his truth that he turned his truth which is a lie you know the devil have truth &gt;&gt; the devil truth is his lie anything you hold on to is your truth &gt;&gt; you have god truth and you have your truth and when you go in court you have them truth That's right. &gt;&gt; We have three truth. &gt;&gt; But I know it's only one &gt;&gt; because if you are if you are called to connect and to give a account for something that happened, you have your side. &gt;&gt; Your side is your truth. &gt;&gt; And your truth is to protect what you did even though you're wrong. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you're hearing me. And then there's God truth, &gt;&gt; which is total truth. And that's his word. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm bringing to you this morning. And I pray God by the time you finish it's so dismantled that you even pick it up. &gt;&gt; You'll never touch it again. &gt;&gt; Cuz you need faith to have these qualities. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering. Something you get now and 6 months after it gone. &gt;&gt; God don't give like Indians. &gt;&gt; I mean American Indians don't take this wrong. &gt;&gt; Give and take back. you will give you because you know that you will keep it. &gt;&gt; So if you have eternal life, here comes the things that goes with them. Love, joy, peace, love that is permanent. &gt;&gt; Then what happened to the church? You came in a message full of joy, full of praise. You jump in your bubble and right now you ain't even have a bottle. [Music] &gt;&gt; Way it went. That's why I'm here this morning &gt;&gt; to challenge you &gt;&gt; to stop playing [Applause] &gt;&gt; this thing real &gt;&gt; is power as we dealing with principalities not because you see the devil don't mean there &gt;&gt; cuz if you had power over the devil he would not be able to dominate your thoughts &gt;&gt; and make you negative and make You have art. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't know if anybody have art against anybody and not even look at it as art and say that my right. &gt;&gt; How could art be right? &gt;&gt; She would do it. Not me. &gt;&gt; Hey, and I ain't Not because you're a Christian, you stupid. When the Bible says if you're going to pray and you what? Fix it. &gt;&gt; Make it right. It had nothing to do with he wrong and I right. You just identify you're in a place where there's you fix years. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am married and my wife is still like bobbing outside and she acts in certain ways that doesn't affect me. I be I am still a Christian. So I don't care what she do it. And when I say that we guard it now, I don't mean you don't you just do anything. But I'm saying whatever it is, it doesn't interfere with my responsibility and my faith to God to be a Christian to love them and deal with them in love &gt;&gt; because I said to God till death &gt;&gt; better or was &gt;&gt; still dead. If she behaving bad that don't change me &gt;&gt; it's still that &gt;&gt; otherwise don't don't interfere with them people think &gt;&gt; marriage is not for everybody &gt;&gt; marriage is not the white dress alone &gt;&gt; cuz after the white come many colors &gt;&gt; and some is black &gt;&gt; are you hearing me &gt;&gt; so as no matter what she does I am still her husband &gt;&gt; and I still Treat them with love &gt;&gt; regardless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's my faith. &gt;&gt; If God really do something for you, you don't have to go and and sauterize them. &gt;&gt; That's a word we have in Grenada. Sautterize &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, that could work, but not that. This could work, but not that." The life of Christ is everywhere. Jesus was so cool with Judas that Judas taking for granted. &gt;&gt; Every time you see him friend, it's not that time he call him friend. He was always calling him friend. &gt;&gt; Jesus was always calling friend and he get carried away with that. &gt;&gt; And he give him the bag. &gt;&gt; If he wasn't calling friend, he wouldn't take it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we are set up to see what we would do &gt;&gt; just to see what is in you. &gt;&gt; God knew Job, but he he wanted him Job to know what is in him. &gt;&gt; All those men that came and and dealt with Job, listen, if you listen to them, they were inspired by the devil. &gt;&gt; Yet they were believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything they tell him is to take away his faith to dismantle his faith and bring in unbelief. &gt;&gt; Job wife who was we don't know if she's a believer but she tell him boy cause God. &gt;&gt; Therefore you can't tell him cause God if you're in she god &gt;&gt; and she said boy your conditions too terrible cause God back up. There we go. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're done dead already. What? Job said, &gt;&gt; did he listen to his wife? &gt;&gt; He said, "You speak." He said, "I foolish. &gt;&gt; You and the man have the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; He just have faith in God. &gt;&gt; The atonement was not yet made. Men still going in paradise. &gt;&gt; So don't tell me it can't be done." &gt;&gt; Don't tell me, "Well, you know, I ain't had the Holy Ghost." Hush. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is an easy thing Pharisees did. &gt;&gt; You don't need the Holy Ghost to be kind. &gt;&gt; Normal, but we get so into the thing &gt;&gt; that we have to say something to justify our wickedness. &gt;&gt; Come on now, man. &gt;&gt; We could do better than that. And the devil love to hear you talk toishness. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, die." How you see it? Give him more. &gt;&gt; And you there in a proverbial, you know why you call it the decimal that don't stop. &gt;&gt; I mean, you you satisfied living like that. &gt;&gt; You come into church all the time and you even worried. Let me go and get brother to pray for me because this devil is time for me to burn him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he gets so the devil smart because when he see that you're getting frantic, he just cool. Cool. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden the torment on the way you were it get nice &gt;&gt; and you have people like that in church nice in church. &gt;&gt; Go and meet them home. &gt;&gt; I'm dismantling unbelief. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying it's time for the church of God clean up &gt;&gt; and go back to God. Go back to the word. Go back to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if we don't take stock, we ain't going nowhere. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I don't think brother go sit down and let the church jo me I ain't doing that. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this. If it's between me and you and going in heaven, you lose. &gt;&gt; There's no way I will push you in. &gt;&gt; Let me go up and see if I can pull you up. &gt;&gt; I go through all this life. I want to make heaven and I go play with it. When the rich young ruler did all ten commandments &gt;&gt; and Jesus say go and sell all that you have and come &gt;&gt; and the man could come. &gt;&gt; He could have come to ask him but he cannot come to live. &gt;&gt; Why it easy to talk &gt;&gt; something else to live &gt;&gt; and home have real donsai cash ching &gt;&gt; counting it every morning. And many people in the message every day they watch your bank book balance. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you did. &gt;&gt; You staying here. &gt;&gt; Let me move on cuz I really don't want to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; So, here comes the lovely family. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, and so on. And and at the helm is charity. Oh my. Instead of allowing doubts to cause hesitation and disobedience, this believer is now conquering the attributes of unbelief. The sin that once ruled you, now you have to overcome it. They have whipped it. They have conquered it. Watch out. Here comes an unstoppable energy of life emanating from the close position with God. And that's what the devil knows. And that's what he's afraid of. And that's what he keep coming to you in these things. &gt;&gt; He knows the power. &gt;&gt; How many years in a message are we saying? wait until the church get to know who she is. When &gt;&gt; when all are we dead? &gt;&gt; It's supposed to be now. &gt;&gt; And we as preachers had to get backbone &gt;&gt; and get some gill &gt;&gt; so we could get belly &gt;&gt; and preach it. &gt;&gt; We not here to please you. We are here to destroy the devil and please God. So watch it now. So you have overcome it the close. All right. So they are through with mental reasoning. They are through with mental um s swings. Oh mental swings, mood swings. That's another thing we just blame. We just say but you know the menopause the hormones. I didn't know hormones is a devil. You thought hormones is a thing in your body, a biological thing. We blame hormones for all the way we react and then we fly off in the house. Yeah. You say you know how the hormones be or this is monten month making you be so but we need to rip at the end because I prefer you how you are before the end. Hello. Why you quiet so God sees all of that &gt;&gt; and that's why the things that should be done the signs that should be seen &gt;&gt; oh the devil love it &gt;&gt; listen I can't bring you no new message this church get more message than I know where you have enough message here to be flying you guys should be like angels &gt;&gt; angels man listen you get word and word and word and if we become the word that we get. &gt;&gt; So I want to know where you putting it &gt;&gt; cuz you have no excuse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the Bible says, you are inexcusable. &gt;&gt; Don't you fear God? &gt;&gt; You have enough word to be able to raise the dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't bring you no message mysteries. Mysteries. You know what is mysterious to me? How come you can't overcome the devil? &gt;&gt; A lot of churches they they graduate mysteries &gt;&gt; when they preaching. You know many time I meet people in certain churches in this message and when they start to talk I mean I just listen to everybody. When they start to talk I I lost. &gt;&gt; When I tell you lost I in the message I'm send seven. I read the Bible about 15 times and them men lose me between this and that and how brother t this and tie that and I said brother must a seven them even making him brighter &gt;&gt; and where is the life &gt;&gt; where is the life [Applause] &gt;&gt; and when something happens all man got outside backslide dead defeated destroyed If th mysteries hold it, &gt;&gt; keep it. &gt;&gt; I want something to bring me up from that hole. &gt;&gt; Going down is easy, &gt;&gt; but coming up is selective. &gt;&gt; Not everybody going down. Coming up. &gt;&gt; You identify coming up here. &gt;&gt; You can't fool God. If you're not a magnet in your soul because I remember dead don't change you. &gt;&gt; I was coming down there and they were saying you know the the graveyard and them fill up they using new hole and because them hole and them full up and I was thinking well all them bodies in there where they going and then I realized that is irrelevant. This thing here &gt;&gt; is like a person that used to live in a nice nice house and the dead and now the house they have cockroach weed snake &gt;&gt; and all kind of thing in a house that was once a mansion. So don't don't so concern about this &gt;&gt; concern about which your soul going [Applause] &gt;&gt; in your patience possess what [Applause] &gt;&gt; and people here have no patience everybody want to drive one little road so you're supposed to wait because you have a traffic so they coming through &gt;&gt; Christians Sorry. &gt;&gt; And the devil love when we disobey and when we behave like that because he's an accuser. So you say, "God, watch that. Watch watch watch &gt;&gt; watch." &gt;&gt; And God sigh and say, "Okay, I'll keep sending them the word." &gt;&gt; And you get preachers from all over. What you do with it is important. You think you're getting away from this message this morning. &gt;&gt; It's good to be here, but it's better to be up there. &gt;&gt; All right, let's move on. I don't want to get bogged down. So, they are there with mental reasoning through with mental swings. One day low, next day high. They are no longer leaning on their own understanding. Why they are fully and unreservedly trusting in God. Watch that life worries are eroded because who the son of man said prays what &gt;&gt; is that only a memory verse? I see some school long say memory verse. What you think a memory verse for? To learn and forget &gt;&gt; to live. &gt;&gt; You give it to the children so they would live later. He said train them in the young and then when they old they wouldn't forget. &gt;&gt; I'm a product of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this generation ain't even going to church much less Sunday on Sunday school. &gt;&gt; I got while I was preparing, I had a real hard fight preparing this message. And the Lord gave me a dream this morning. And I tell you what, the bride needs to check herself &gt;&gt; and take action. &gt;&gt; And I'm using the word bride because I can't tell you nothing. But I can tell you this, things are not so clicking. things are not so what we would call okay. &gt;&gt; There's darkness &gt;&gt; in the place &gt;&gt; and we need to put on the light. &gt;&gt; Don't take things for granted. Check your life. &gt;&gt; This is time to leave. This is not time to stay. &gt;&gt; This is time to check yourself. &gt;&gt; All these messages is think oh my god. Are you going to be waiting until that time to say, "Oh my god, the rich man, remember what I told you about him in hell. &gt;&gt; He opened his eyes." &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me this man ain't seen nothing on earth, but he see it in hell. &gt;&gt; Open eyes means what? He's enlightened. &gt;&gt; He now wake up and for the first time he want prayer. For the first time you want to talk to God and for the first time you want to talk all of a sudden, Father Abraham, &gt;&gt; you didn't know him when he was here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's so bold. He didn't even say, "Can I ask a question?" He said, "Send." &gt;&gt; Boy, your days of having control is over. &gt;&gt; You ain't telling nobody to send nothing. &gt;&gt; The time for you to cast the devil out is here. &gt;&gt; Not over there. &gt;&gt; We have the We have the word and we have to use the word to deal with these things. &gt;&gt; But if we make the devil accommodating and we make him comfortable, you know what happened? in most ears than we think. &gt;&gt; The noise in the fish market is not sailor official. &gt;&gt; So we need to check myself. Now as I said you don't have to listen to me but later on you'll see it because this is what came to me after spending the day going through re waking up sleep waking up and on stressing going through all these things. Lord, what am I going to do &gt;&gt; that life? Okay, so let me continue. Do you realize unbelief robs a person from spiritual power? &gt;&gt; Do you realize rob the church from the power? &gt;&gt; The apostolic power. &gt;&gt; Hello. Don't you agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you agree that we should have been fured of where we are? &gt;&gt; If you not agree, something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what you think is the reason unbelief and people don't want to say that listen brother Brennham have a message if God is with us where all the miracles you know how much views he have 666 &gt;&gt; other messages have 20,000 &gt;&gt; who will not challenge that who's willing to go down in the on the grind and say God something wrong &gt;&gt; God what happening here &gt;&gt; you mean to tell me you just keep walking along moving along and you the word saying certain things you ain't seen it and it don't have you worried &gt;&gt; I rather be done &gt;&gt; and worry &gt;&gt; and go to God and ask him for something &gt;&gt; nobody want that hard work who going and spend time listen you living here so fast and so busy I just wonder how you making it &gt;&gt; because to go anywhere is not just jump and driving in Grenada we reach and we reach we go in the car you reach Yeah, he had to drive by &gt;&gt; and brother take me down in Arizona. I kind of g that drive so long and you say m what's wrong with you? You're too long because to go from here today and where you getting time to pray where you getting time to deal with them demons that's chasing you. The prophet said when a devil is cast out from a person, he's right behind here. &gt;&gt; Right here &gt;&gt; waiting to what? &gt;&gt; Come back. What you think this is? &gt;&gt; He tracking you &gt;&gt; day all the place because Dy house you want it back. Although &gt;&gt; vagrants now chasing people going in people house and taking it over. &gt;&gt; Same thing the devil doing. &gt;&gt; As long as they seeing life in the house they're going in. &gt;&gt; Where is the life in me? Where is the life in you? to prove that there is something dynamic in there. &gt;&gt; This is not no joking message. This is a message with power. The pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is what I came to. I left down there to come up here, not to sit down there. &gt;&gt; And I will go before God. Yeah. and keeps me alone. I will go before God and ask God what what are we doing wrong? &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; Most churches closed down now. They want to pay people registration and say that the mark of the beast the mark of the beast the mark of non-payment. [Music] You find any B see any BCI &gt;&gt; ain't prepar nonsense. They're robbing God. They're robbing the government. They're robbing everybody. &gt;&gt; I don't I am business. &gt;&gt; So let me continue. So do you realize unbelief robs a person from spiritual power? &gt;&gt; Faith restores this power. Jesus said when I come when you think is that when I come shall I what find &gt;&gt; God who knows everything asking that question we should ask yourself what do you mean by that &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; who knows all things &gt;&gt; trying to give us a little signal &gt;&gt; faith will be scant &gt;&gt; and faith is word &gt;&gt; because faith come by hearing the word. It means people will no longer be listening to the word &gt;&gt; or hearing the word. They'll listen but not hear. &gt;&gt; So a person could sit here and hear 20 message and then do not even 20 things. &gt;&gt; So what you have more of the same &gt;&gt; and then is much I much do about nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't going I ain't going. You going to take your debts off. &gt;&gt; You will be you leave this, you leave that. You come here, you're looking for God, and you notices something wrong, and you sit down there &gt;&gt; sleeping. &gt;&gt; Now, I can't tell you what to do, but I know I will do &gt;&gt; or make noise. &gt;&gt; I'm going call. And he said, "When you call, I'll answer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's true. We are lambs, but not to die like that. Lamb supposed to hear the shepherd voice &gt;&gt; and the shepherd voice supposed to give them strength &gt;&gt; and supposed to give them taking care of them. If they have a break, he come and he touch it &gt;&gt; and they jump again. &gt;&gt; Some of us can't even walk. &gt;&gt; I'm here to challenge you. &gt;&gt; I'm not a nice brother. I'm a Christian. Amen. So a lot of preachers preach for people to hey &gt;&gt; and when they done hey tell me why you preach a word &gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; kind of hungry now you know after sitting there so long wait until he come back where's the conviction cuz the word brings conviction &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit brings conviction &gt;&gt; when you let go the Holy Spirit you know he go fight &gt;&gt; do you know the lamb Sorry. The dove flies at the slightest provocation. &gt;&gt; You could walk down there with the dove and the wrong behavior. &gt;&gt; Make that dove gone. &gt;&gt; Dove gone and you ain't even know. &gt;&gt; No more cooling. &gt;&gt; Let me finish. He grew up among them. So he says because here what he says he brings God yet could he could not do any miraculous works because the people he grew up with and and were with his harshest critics &gt;&gt; they did not believe why they were afraid of him. And let me tell you something that the Lord revealed to me. &gt;&gt; You know one of the reason why they afraid Jesus because when he was small he said disappear in rooms. &gt;&gt; He's not disappearing when the Pharisees looking for him. Long he doing that. So they worried what kind of child is that &gt;&gt; they'll be talking bad about him and they say come and see and when they going in there &gt;&gt; he knowing them you know God never tell us all the things that happened from from the time he born to 30 &gt;&gt; you have a reason &gt;&gt; but I know because he's God and he's always God and he's the same yesterday and he start doing the thing young &gt;&gt; he knew he had the Here's his parents soal. &gt;&gt; You go three days. Have you ever been in your house? You have a 12-y old child and you in the room and you worried. &gt;&gt; First night, nothing. You ain't even checked and you all went on a far country and you're going back home. &gt;&gt; You didn't check. I wonder how much Mary and Joseph have. Mary didn't even Mary is the one that made the confession that the angel of God spoke to her and she believed and she said be it unto me. Then after it became a reality &gt;&gt; after you came in the message &gt;&gt; now you're having issues &gt;&gt; and he was always correcting her don't you know your father and I hold on &gt;&gt; your what? and dies without disrespect. &gt;&gt; Dies without disrespect because God still can't break the word to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; And he said the scriptures cannot be broken. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Don't you know what be about my what? Father's business." Telling her careful. &gt;&gt; He's not my daddy. &gt;&gt; And the Bible didn't say that he steps on a &gt;&gt; you didn't know about that. Jesus. Jesus didn't have no stepfather. &gt;&gt; Are you What's wrong with all? &gt;&gt; He didn't have no stepfather. But he was there and his brothers didn't like him. His sisters didn't like him because there was something about this boy, this young man that they could not stomach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They had unbelief in them. &gt;&gt; He had faith in him. and faith and unbelief could never agree. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You would always have a problem with people with faith. &gt;&gt; Your unbelief in you would make you feel bad. &gt;&gt; You didn't even want to be around them. &gt;&gt; So Jesus had to deal with that. He was just like David. David had problems with the brothers and sisters. Why? He always singing a psalm. Them nos to sing. &gt;&gt; Them never fac no lion. The never face no bear. You could imagine David brothers facing a lion gone. He done that for himself. He father put him outside. Why? Because when he was born, they thought that is not his. &gt;&gt; What they did with Jesus? They thought that was not his. &gt;&gt; That right Jesus and David could connect. &gt;&gt; They had issues growing up. &gt;&gt; You want to tell me that your younger son and you there in the in the bush and all them big boy and them in the house. The biggest supposed to be out there. &gt;&gt; You go and take care of the sheep. Little brother home. Thy father sent David. &gt;&gt; And there is David making 150 psalms. How much make &gt;&gt; not song psalms. You know where it come from? &gt;&gt; His experience. &gt;&gt; His connection with God. &gt;&gt; That man had faith. &gt;&gt; What is your experience? &gt;&gt; Where is your faith? &gt;&gt; No faith, no experience. &gt;&gt; And if you have an experience, then how you going to believe? That's why it's difficult &gt;&gt; until you see God move. It's going to be difficult for you to touch God. &gt;&gt; So we have a problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why am I able to speak like that? Because I experienced a move of faith in my life. &gt;&gt; And until you experience one, you can't talk about it. You'll be afraid. &gt;&gt; Supposed in what? Suppose something happens. Supposedly, suppose that [Music] sit up. &gt;&gt; That is like old time where we go to church and everybody have testimony and what is the testimony? You know, I have a testimony. I was passing so and I had food on the on the pot and it was I was cooking oil down. Hey, &gt;&gt; they used to drop that on us on church that was there blanket. No more testimony. Nobody standing up inside there and do what they want. &gt;&gt; It was not a testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we had to talk about what we know. &gt;&gt; We talking about God. &gt;&gt; What is your connection with the supernatural? &gt;&gt; How long you serving God? 20 years. And you want to tell me you have never had a supernatural experience in the 20 years? Who you been meeting? Who you been talking to? Who you been hearing from? Oh God, wake up. You dealing with a supernatural God and he can't give one supernatural sign. &gt;&gt; You can't even stop cussing. [Music] &gt;&gt; And they tell me slip crouch slip. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you're probably changing your mind about me now. &gt;&gt; But remember it not means the word &gt;&gt; and the word is what? Dig in into your what? &gt;&gt; Unbelief. If it have &gt;&gt; and that's why it it becomes a place where uh I agree with that. I agree that I don't agree that I don't agree that. But it's the life. &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, you can agree. Jesus was not agreed by everybody &gt;&gt; even among his own. He said he could not do any miracles there because of what their unbelief where Nazareth he born. Nazareth he wanted to do the work and Nazareth said no. &gt;&gt; Where should the works be done? In the message &gt;&gt; the prophet showed us. The prophet told us we heard about it. I want to see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can live alone on what he said. That gives me faith. But where's mine? &gt;&gt; Where's mine? &gt;&gt; I want mine. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Burnham and them had needs. &gt;&gt; So I don't have &gt;&gt; them want to live. I don't want to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sickness come because of sin. I don't want it to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean you believe in doctor so much &gt;&gt; and when he done what you do go to God &gt;&gt; that why the the king he tell him you coming home from the bed you know because you should have first check God &gt;&gt; and then let God tell you what to do but you went and check the ob man so you go dead on that bed &gt;&gt; if offensive Um, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. He displayed strange and wonderful attributes that they could not deal with because it was what? Foreign to them. And that's where the problem is. Anything you seen that is foreign to you, you can't handle it. And the disciples just like us when they see a ghost. Everything is there's a ghost. Oh, God. And they're afraid. &gt;&gt; Men chosen by God. &gt;&gt; Afraid to go into the night. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus walk in a water it &gt;&gt; because he was a praying. You notice they were never praying with him. &gt;&gt; Their eyes always heavy &gt;&gt; like some of you do when you zoom and the brother think you're listening and you're in Zoom land [Music] and you even have the bed say brother I sleep here. are knocking off and he talking to phone all you have real belly and nobody making confession you know brother the other night when you're speaking I drop asleep please forgive me for the disrespect let me tell you when when wrong become normal &gt;&gt; normal is wrong I'm coming down. &gt;&gt; All right. Where am I? So, one of Jesus. Okay. So, I was talking about him walking on water. He was always about his father's business. What about us today? I come visiting you this morning and I ask you to present him. Is he with you? Okay. So you are talking about him walking on water and here he is walking on water and who who in the boat see him? Peter. Peter is like us in the message who trying best but we still need faith. &gt;&gt; We still need that that anointing from God but we there we jam it. We ain't giving up. &gt;&gt; We will not rest &gt;&gt; until he touch me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That should be your attitude. Don't come and say well that's so is boring and if everything is one of the same hello ain't you still the same &gt;&gt; you could be the same but the service can't be the same &gt;&gt; hello I ain't saying the service is the same but it's what you look for &gt;&gt; and it's your mind &gt;&gt; that's why it has come late &gt;&gt; you should be here early &gt;&gt; to talk to God before he comes &gt;&gt; but we come any old time God could wait on me Sorry if you're hurting you. &gt;&gt; You know what caused that? When we just get get saved in the message, we reach him before the song leader. &gt;&gt; Now the song leader had to call us. You come in. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; We We need help. &gt;&gt; We definitely need help. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let me finish with that. Um Jesus on the water. Here he is coming and Peter see me say Lord because at first the door was a ghost. Imagine them men talking ghost and you know what ghost that jump behind believers. &gt;&gt; The whole thing in them still &gt;&gt; all true. You see them men and I'm afraid Jesus appear. Hey. Oh Lord, he come through the room. &gt;&gt; Peter outside knocking. They're praying for me. They in jail. The guy run back. I jump in in the door. I go in the door, &gt;&gt; Christians. &gt;&gt; Believers, &gt;&gt; this is no joke. &gt;&gt; This thing deadly. It started in Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this thing is not easy and the churches don't realize numbers don't mean Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; In fact, where the Holy Ghost is people &gt;&gt; because where the Holy Ghost is, you have what? Judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you just have also you can't play around and an Sarah could not play around. God killed them. Not Peter. &gt;&gt; And everybody free to bring that that apostolic time today. &gt;&gt; Why we want to play? We come out to play. We want to dally. We want to do it how we want. &gt;&gt; You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. &gt;&gt; As a big man, &gt;&gt; I'm king. &gt;&gt; I thought you surrendered your life to God &gt;&gt; and you say, "Lord, you be my master &gt;&gt; and you be my Lord." You know what Lord mean? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know Lord, &gt;&gt; absolute and complete ruler. You know, &gt;&gt; you have no say anymore. You know, &gt;&gt; you have given up your rights to him. &gt;&gt; If he say bend, bend. If you say run, run. If he say stop, stop. &gt;&gt; That's why the the prophet quotes, we only do what the word says or we keep. &gt;&gt; Hello. He said keep still. He then said dead. [Music] &gt;&gt; If my father promised me say okay if you do all this work here Christmas time I'll bring a bike for you &gt;&gt; and I going to do all the work. &gt;&gt; Why you think I want Christmas time? Bring my bike in. I'm waiting for my bike. Hey come. But you know I was planning to buy the bike but you know when I went down there um I remember I didn't pay the current and I didn't pay the water bill and I know son you understand I understand what what about my sweat? What about my my sweat that you make me do bring water for the last month? Don't tell me about about light. I want a bike. I made plans for my bike. &gt;&gt; I even give it a name. What you want me to do now? &gt;&gt; So that person will make noise. &gt;&gt; Cuz what was promised him? &gt;&gt; Engage. &gt;&gt; What have you done? &gt;&gt; Where's your noise? &gt;&gt; Where's your cry? &gt;&gt; Where's your call? &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Tell me. Speak to me. &gt;&gt; Where is it? You're going to stay there and die. &gt;&gt; God promised you certain things. &gt;&gt; And you're not saying, "Brother, brother, hold on. Hold on. We We were supposed to promise this. We ain't seen it. What should we do?" &gt;&gt; Joshua and them fighting. &gt;&gt; Hey, 36 men dead. What did he say? Oh, God. How are we dead? And he gone all night pray. God said, "Get up. Get up. &gt;&gt; Me ain't changing. You a change. &gt;&gt; I keep my promise. You broke yours. &gt;&gt; Go and check. &gt;&gt; Hear this. Israel not he Israel &gt;&gt; had sin. &gt;&gt; So don't blame and say well them brother this and you part &gt;&gt; you are part of it. &gt;&gt; You have a role to play. &gt;&gt; Brother say all of you have a post. Hello. Some of us have we post but we hitting it worse than how we walking outside. &gt;&gt; You have a post of duty &gt;&gt; to be here. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And if you have a walk that keeping you from your post, fire the work. &gt;&gt; God will give a work because not all the time God has give us. Let me tell you something less is more &gt;&gt; because the devil does give job too. And his job is to make sure you die being rich. You think I will take a job that I can serve my God? &gt;&gt; I vom that job &gt;&gt; bounce. Hey, later &gt;&gt; my God will supply. &gt;&gt; I let the devil show up on me. &gt;&gt; But we want the highest job with the highest pay for the less work. &gt;&gt; And then you have to make the sacrifice. Every day you're walking like a dog. &gt;&gt; And then when you die, you bury like a pig. &gt;&gt; You ain't even coming to your funeral. Who you walking with? &gt;&gt; You're on your own. &gt;&gt; That make sense? &gt;&gt; Let me continue. &gt;&gt; I find all you quiet. What happened? I'm doing something wrong. Oh, I was talking about the um walking on the water and he said if it's you come and Jesus said come now watch this Peter who ain't have the Holy Ghost yet but have faith to do what Jesus said began to walk &gt;&gt; so don't say but I ain't have the Holy Ghost yet listen where's your faith &gt;&gt; faith come for salvation &gt;&gt; if you say if you have faith &gt;&gt; all you have to do is build &gt;&gt; but you can't build if you have unbelief cuz unbelief would be like a vine &gt;&gt; that wrap around the good tree. I have some land, you know, farm land in Grenada and and I even come and they grow up and not make trees. So I asked the government for help. So we went there one day my daughter and I and we said well you going to clean up and when we went we couldn't tell the difference between a good tree and vine and then the man sat cutting he say you see that not make tree but they not make tree their own soul and what they white vine choke it let me tell you you think you bad you should see them pride they're wicked they wrap it wrong they to passo they pass they passo listen somebody doing You can't tell me that doing that myself. The the leaves that get black, no sunlight. &gt;&gt; No light, no rain. It just make sure I don't take life while I eating life. &gt;&gt; So you think the devil will just let you walk away &gt;&gt; when he come to kill and destroy? You think that joke? Everything the devil say mean it. &gt;&gt; You need to mean what you say. &gt;&gt; And I watch that thing and I feel sorry for the vine. We have to cut, hack, cut, hack, dismantle the vine. &gt;&gt; It took a lot. And you had to be careful how you cut it out because you cut the tree &gt;&gt; because that scamp over them leaf that is important with the nutmeg. He knows how to cover you. Take over your prayer life. Take over your service. Take over this. Take over that. Keep your py peasy peasy peasy. &gt;&gt; And the power you have, you have it again. You become powerless and a crying Christian. Everything is a cry. Oh God. Oh God. Not because of the Holy Ghost, but because you left the ghost. &gt;&gt; God didn't make you how you are. You do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God I serve make us victorious. Make us powerful. &gt;&gt; Make us with conquering power. &gt;&gt; His church is a conquering church. &gt;&gt; Not a church of their lazy loss of fear with no zeal with no nothing, no ambition. &gt;&gt; You know who do that? The same God that killed Pentecost come in a message. &gt;&gt; What's Pentecost? It worse than the Roman Catholic Church back home. &gt;&gt; Didn't even have a symbol of God. &gt;&gt; It bad. &gt;&gt; You might get a virtue from a Roman Catholic but not from a Pentecost. &gt;&gt; It bad. What did the prophet say in 50 years? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; It could be worse. &gt;&gt; That's thus said the Lord. It is worse. &gt;&gt; Now you came from Pentecost. Ask them to come and see you worship &gt;&gt; and if they will take anything when they go in. What if they go back where they was? &gt;&gt; You think they will be impressed? You think they will see a life behind the name &gt;&gt; that makes them hungry &gt;&gt; that makes them want to gravitate from where they are &gt;&gt; in the darkness. One of the worst feeling is in the home and current go so dread and the darkness so dread just sit down &gt;&gt; can't move &gt;&gt; cuz to move means accident especially if your house have everything close &gt;&gt; those rich ones everything spread out kitchen quiet down so there doesn't even play ball in it not for us poor ones everything you want when that current gone you stay and you pray. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with Grenlet? And Grenlet received the the verbal abuse &gt;&gt; cuz my payment bill &gt;&gt; and current corn when I'm ready to eat &gt;&gt; and we give like a mouthful. You dying spiritually starving. You're not as you were &gt;&gt; and you're not complaining. &gt;&gt; You complaining about light in your house &gt;&gt; that you going to leave one day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The real complaint should be here. Come let us reason together and said the Lord though your skin be as sins be as scal. I will make them white as snow. Lord what's up with mine? &gt;&gt; I seen shades of black. I seen shades of blue. I want white. Are you not concerned? &gt;&gt; By the time we finish, it's either you hate me or you love me or you go check yourself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'll go. You know where I'm going? I'll flip all that. skip all that and run to where I want to be. &gt;&gt; Gideon, I like that story. Gideon the prophet, he was approached by the angel of the Lord and it's in Judges 6 verse 11. Because you know a lot of things. So, I just want to just touch the highlights because I don't want to spend all the time telling you something you already know. &gt;&gt; But I want to touch your heart that was probably hidden by you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you could hide things. &gt;&gt; Your conscience could become a snare to you. &gt;&gt; Because instead of you receiving the word and changing, you receive the word and hide it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're not comfortable. &gt;&gt; You're not even happy. &gt;&gt; And you're not even making noise. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there came an angel of the Lord and sat under oak which was in Ofra that pertained unto Josh the Azerite. And the son Gideon thr wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said to him, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." Whenever I reach your brother, I read your brother. Isaac said, "Thou mighty one of me." And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallening us? And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us? Saying, did not the Lord bring us out from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midionites. And the Lord look upon him. Didn't our angel God now? And he said, "Go in thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent thee?" &gt;&gt; Did he not raise us up? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You don't have no questions. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have I not sent thee? And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, where shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I'm the least in my father's house." And the Lord said unto him, "Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Medidionites as one man." You hear that? As one man. Now, one of the things you have to understand is every word God say is important. &gt;&gt; He didn't say go smite the as army as one man. &gt;&gt; One man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you see it? And when the church comes into a unity, they're not moving like a a set of people, you know. They move like one. &gt;&gt; Everybody saying the same thing. Everybody had the same desire. Everybody moving in the same direction. And they had all things &gt;&gt; and they had all things. &gt;&gt; They were not commoners. They had all things in common. So where you going this D mine I want nobody touch it and look you take the bus my car clean I don't want nobody driving it &gt;&gt; and don't come in my house um stay outside in the ver here's two sandwich &gt;&gt; you know them nonsense going on &gt;&gt; for real because we have grades why that brother there he ordinary he he d a not he have a car so let's stay outside another one coming oh here is Isaac Isaac Come in. Come in. I sit down. You can even sit down over here. This is my soft chair. &gt;&gt; Isaac don't know what you're doing, but he appreciate what you're doing. &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; God upset with you &gt;&gt; because what you are doing is a preference &gt;&gt; from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Unbelief. &gt;&gt; They had all things in common. And that's what we supposed to have here. All of us should be saying brother brother Oid we we be we concerned be concerned. I was speaking to a fellow in the message while we were w um witnessing and they don't take communion and they don't do fit worship. So me and another pastor we jam him and we start to feed him the word. Feed him the word and he tried to block. Let me tell you he has some desperate people outside. They hearing the word and they're trying to dodge it. Eventually say okay feet washing. Jesus say if you're in wash you have no part &gt;&gt; and communion these are sacred things that we we have not to stop &gt;&gt; so he decide he going to deal with it how &gt;&gt; you know he had to face it's not something you could just go and change &gt;&gt; when the people become as one man &gt;&gt; then it's different &gt;&gt; but when this pulling so that pulling so that pulling so you ain't making no change you have strife &gt;&gt; what is the reason why the message churches are unable to produce the works &gt;&gt; that should have been there long &gt;&gt; and we keep waiting. We can't wait until we dead. &gt;&gt; I want mine now. &gt;&gt; I can be preaching up with God and talking about the miracles and I and they say when you see it uh and just walk away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This God we serving supposed to deal with your needs. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you desire. &gt;&gt; I have a lot of whatsoever. &gt;&gt; How much you have? You know what we have done? We throw it away. Well, it look we have that again. So, forget that. Let me fight up with what I have. Let me try and eat healthy and and by God's grace, I will see what could do. like the church where you reach. &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; He said if God is with us, where is the miracles that the prophet told us about? Because he knowed everywhere God went, miracles followed him. &gt;&gt; Wherever God would be, miracles would be there. &gt;&gt; And how can you expect God today to walk and amongst the people who doesn't believe &gt;&gt; in miracles? This you need to check. &gt;&gt; Do you know some of us really believe in God but the miracle part? &gt;&gt; We cannot directly say yes. &gt;&gt; We could believe miracles for that brother or that sister cuz it's not me. But when it comes from me, &gt;&gt; you going Miami. &gt;&gt; I didn't even know that the Lord just dropped that in Miami. and see some Dr. Harry &gt;&gt; Haiti [Laughter] that one is a stretch. So he said would how can you expect God today to walk amongst the people who doesn't believe in miracles? How can it be? Gideon again said may my Lord if God be with us then why is all this trouble upon us &gt;&gt; and where is the miracles that we were told about &gt;&gt; where is the things that God used to do among us now remember we are going there's a reason for the for the cutting down of miracles or for the cutting off of miracles there's a reason why Jesus could not do miracles why &gt;&gt; don't blame the pastor he trying &gt;&gt; but if he believe and you don't believe nothing happening He could have all the faith to raise the roof &gt;&gt; and you ain't believe. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet says you make the gift work. &gt;&gt; Your faith pull the angel. &gt;&gt; Your faith bring the power of God. &gt;&gt; Come down. So he said, "Lord, if God with us, why is all this trouble upon us? Where is the miracles that we were told about? Where is the things that God used to do?" There is a good way to trust whether the messenger is right or wrong. If he has a form of godliness, he will deny that power to do those miracles. If he's a messenger from God, he will not only speak of it, but he will have it. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; To produce it and to show that God that he talks about is with him and in him. Gideon was spiritual or scriptural in his response to the Lord. And if we understand that God is a great God of mighty works and he's a great God of miracles and if he's for us and if he's with us and he's the same yesterday, today and forever, where can I see his miracles? Where &gt;&gt; can I see this God in action? &gt;&gt; Where is he at? Coming down in my last bit. If he's for us the mighty man of valor, he said he could refer back to the old time. I heard of it and I know it's right because he know that God is a supernatural being and wherever a supernatural being is, he will do supernatural signs. &gt;&gt; Because the supernatural is in him, &gt;&gt; you just can't get out of it. How can you stand the face the face of wind? How can you stand in the face of wind without the wind blowing? How can you get in the water without getting wet? Water is wet and that's the chemical of it. When you set in water, you are going to get wet. And when you're in the presence of God, the supernatural, there's going to be supernatural signs, supernatural workings of a supernatural God. That's why it's a legitimate question. He asks, "Where are the miracles?" &gt;&gt; Where are the signs of his being with us and in us? &gt;&gt; Where God says, where God is, miracles are. &gt;&gt; God is a sign he's there. Gideon may be taught, I am a man maybe of 50 years old and I heard them talk about a God that work miracles and I went to church and I have believed the priests. I believe the prophets. I believe the written word all the scrolls and I read in the scrolls where God when he comes among his people something takes place. &gt;&gt; Gideon had a legitimate question. If there is a God and he's with us then let me see his signs. &gt;&gt; He does because he let me see the signs that he does perform. Then if this great tax last before me, this question could be easily said this morning amongst our churches. Where is that God &gt;&gt; that once lived? Did he die? &gt;&gt; Is he gone pursuing? Is he on a trip? No sir. Then if we say we are of God, then let's see where God is. &gt;&gt; If this tabernacle stands for God, let's see God moving among us. &gt;&gt; Let's see souls being born in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Let's see lives being straightened up. Let's see the sick, the blind, the deaf healed. Let's see his mighty works being performed. We must ask the question, if God is with his people and in his people, that person cannot help but do the things &gt;&gt; the same thing that God did. &gt;&gt; You can't help it. &gt;&gt; God is in the man. If that man sin, then God is not in him. &gt;&gt; If he loves the world, then God is not there. And we know that God has no dealings with sin. Jesus asked the question. Jesus was asked a question. He said, "You being a man, make yourself God." When he had healed the man with the policy, he said, "Thy sins be forgiven thee." Now wait a minute. You being a man forgive sins. He said that you might know that the son of man had power on earth to forgive sins or to heal. Whichever is easier to say, take up thy bed and walk or say, "Thy sins be forgiven thee." And the man got up and walked away. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees questioned Jesus. If you don't believe me, he said, then believe the signs. &gt;&gt; If I do that I do for the signs follow the word. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; the word we preach. &gt;&gt; The signs must follow it. &gt;&gt; If you don't see the signs, then we got to check. &gt;&gt; Is it me? Is it you? Where is the problem? God in dead. He's the same yesterday. Hebrews touching it. I am here to challenge you. And don't tell me God doing it. God will do it &gt;&gt; is if we want it &gt;&gt; and God will wait until all of us in trouble &gt;&gt; and all of us cry &gt;&gt; and then he will come but it might be late. &gt;&gt; You don't want to wait until you're in trouble. Take in front. &gt;&gt; Take in front regardless of what other churches do. Who is willing to go down before God and say, "Father, here is the word. Here's the word. Brother Tim, preach and where are the signs in my life? the signs in my soul. &gt;&gt; I'm hungry. I'm starving. I am wretched. I didn't used to be like that. I g the message long ago. But now I'm cold. I'm feeling sick. I'm spiritually vampish. I need deliverance. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you come and get saved. I'm telling you come and connect to God. Come and touch God. Come and be touched by God. &gt;&gt; We need to go higher. The prophet said what we have cannot do it. We have to lift ourselves. The church wants to lift. How you going to lift by the word? &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be willing to preach it. Somebody had to be willing to believe it. Somebody had to be willing to lead. But I don't care. Nobody coming. I'm going. Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; He tired. Call me. Now let me call him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need &gt;&gt; the end is upon us. The other day they say the the rapture is the 23rd. Now the fellow making apologies. You know the other people saying he know that again. &gt;&gt; Coming events what? Cast forth what? &gt;&gt; Their shadows. &gt;&gt; You know that quote only stop read books. Coming events cast forth their shadows. So if you see a man saying that is the rapture watch because when people stop look &gt;&gt; suddenly &gt;&gt; he shows he says in the last days like a snare &gt;&gt; pride of life &gt;&gt; lust of the eye &gt;&gt; lust of the flesh &gt;&gt; and the Bible said it will come upon who? Every single man &gt;&gt; woman and child. &gt;&gt; Why you going to do it on Bible? Why you going do it on what? Got it. You better wake up. Every word must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And God wouldn't send this prophet with a message like that for us to watch it, listen to it, and say, "Well, that's not for us." &gt;&gt; He expect better than that. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to reach a place. Listen, you're never going to go high unless you hit bottom. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you're going down, you ain't looking up. &gt;&gt; Now we at the bottom. It's time for us to go up. &gt;&gt; I want to see God. I want to see some miracles in me. &gt;&gt; Even as I'm speaking over confessing it, I want I have a miracle I need. &gt;&gt; I have some children that ain't safe yet. Am I going to let them go in hell? &gt;&gt; When he said the faith you had to save yourself could bring them. &gt;&gt; Well then, Lord, increase my faith. &gt;&gt; I ain't got one, I got two. I ain't got two, I got three. I ain't got three, I got four, I got five. Then I need fight. &gt;&gt; You stay and let your family die and go to hell. You think hell nice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why it is to leave your loss. &gt;&gt; I can preach this in Pentecost. I can preach this in Rome. The only place you can preach it is in the B. &gt;&gt; But the bride must know who she is. This is the time for action. Don't leave it for tomorrow now. &gt;&gt; Now. &gt;&gt; You want to see the works of God, then you have to have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Then you have to believe in him. &gt;&gt; God is not going to send a mighty rushing wind upon you and you even have nothing for the wind. &gt;&gt; We want to do a lot of mighty things and we can't even do simple things. &gt;&gt; Just to believe is a problem. Is God going to give you his power and you even have faith to have control? &gt;&gt; You want to bring down fire on people. &gt;&gt; You're not going to do that. &gt;&gt; And this is the hour for us to have a manifestation. Message has been going on for years. &gt;&gt; This is manifestation time. This is not no time for us to bring new message, new revelation and new gifts, &gt;&gt; new done. This is a time for all the word that been swed &gt;&gt; to show itself. &gt;&gt; And if you have received the word, then I got to see your faith. God must see your faith. &gt;&gt; And we got to get the devil on the run. God moved Gideon army from 32,000 men to 22,000 left. &gt;&gt; Them men answer the call. These preachers answer the call. And God tell him is unbelievers. Let it go back home. &gt;&gt; 32,000 become what? 10. &gt;&gt; And God still didn't finish. &gt;&gt; Wake up. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for people to come. &gt;&gt; You are to be the champion. You are to be the the demonst. The demo. You are the pilot. You have it on the air. Everybody watching you. There's a reason for that. I told brother this years ago. You have the battle in your hand. It begins somewhere. I am not here for chance. It has to start somewhere. And God wants you and you and you call to action. Call to the resurrection. Call to the dynamics. It's time. [Applause] And when my people which are called by my name &gt;&gt; shall humble themselves &gt;&gt; and get rid all the pride &gt;&gt; and get rid all the vain glory. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get no name. I don't care what you say about me, but I care what you say about your Lord and where you go. &gt;&gt; I have no axe to grind. I don't want to be a celebrity. I don't tell God. You know why God can't trust us? &gt;&gt; Soon as I let a miracle gone, we gone with the miracle of God. Hey, I can heal. You know why? You know, God, okay. And you want six men in front of you and six men behind you and a limousine. &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody who was blind, &gt;&gt; they say &gt;&gt; can now see. &gt;&gt; So you going in another place. God can't trust nobody. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's looking for a few &gt;&gt; good men &gt;&gt; and women &gt;&gt; that he could trust &gt;&gt; and that will put him first &gt;&gt; and will put him at the forefront. &gt;&gt; So, we know it's not me. We know it's not you. &gt;&gt; It is him. &gt;&gt; I love Jesus. &gt;&gt; When I watch how we move in the earth and the things he say, oh God, I love that man. Every word was measured. Every word was complete. Every word was powerful. Every action was deliverance. That man was a man from heaven. I emulate him. I want to be like him. I love that man. &gt;&gt; He gave up everything for me. I love him alone. I don't want nobody else with him. I love him alone. What a man. [Music] Jesus, &gt;&gt; I want him here. &gt;&gt; I need him. &gt;&gt; Oh God, Trinidad, [Music] &gt;&gt; are you going to go home the way you came? &gt;&gt; Are you going to find yourself here and said, "Oh God, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving &gt;&gt; until I connect. Until I connect. If God be with us, we are the miracles. Lord, the miracle begins in me. &gt;&gt; Change me, mold me, circumcise me. Oh God, dismantle me. Then something has to happen. Come out in your station. Come out in your selfishness. Come in now old sh get right with God. Fix the unbroken. Fix the broken line. &gt;&gt; I feel like stopping now. &gt;&gt; You're leaving here today. &gt;&gt; Are you going to this be the same? &gt;&gt; Are you going to let this word be your judgment? &gt;&gt; Are you going to let this word be your praise? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you not going to stop them nonsense? &gt;&gt; And get right with God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God is always holy. &gt;&gt; God never changes. &gt;&gt; He is always holy. And he says, "Be a holy &gt;&gt; as I am holy." &gt;&gt; How you can be holy with that kind of strippingness? &gt;&gt; How you can be holy and that kind of behavior man strip it, dismantle it, mash it up. I call for his destruction. Who will go with me? &gt;&gt; Who will go with me? &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; Remember, faith is not sensation. By pass sensation, bypass emotion and get right with God. &gt;&gt; Don't leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be busy today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do some stock taking &gt;&gt; check all your shelves empty. &gt;&gt; You need some grace. &gt;&gt; Softly. &gt;&gt; He was nailed to the cross for me. &gt;&gt; All the shelves empty. &gt;&gt; Somebody come, they can't even get virtue. &gt;&gt; Can't even get no strength. &gt;&gt; All they getting is why you hate and why you like and what you do. Time to stop that. Graviate. &gt;&gt; Graduate. &gt;&gt; Come out of that nonsense that ain't helping you get something that's profitable. &gt;&gt; I was with those guys talking and then they move in. I said, "Listen, I out of that because I not profitable." &gt;&gt; Vain words. &gt;&gt; Something must mean something. &gt;&gt; We are losing time. &gt;&gt; Well, not getting not getting younger. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to you? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It begins now. &gt;&gt; You need to cry out to God and go back. Come back. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; if God is with me, then why am I like this? &gt;&gt; And then if you are like that, you say, "Come, &gt;&gt; come home. It's supper time. Come home. Come and get clean up. Come and get pure up. Come let me dismantle &gt;&gt; the unbelief in you. &gt;&gt; The altar is open. You can make your walk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You saying your bench should die like that &gt;&gt; and you go on and never get change. Why? Because when God sent it, you didn't recognize it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your assent here &gt;&gt; will determine your legacy. &gt;&gt; What you do this morning, &gt;&gt; what you do now, &gt;&gt; you know God spoke to you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Make the decision. &gt;&gt; Is it you or him &gt;&gt; who's on the throne? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't give you. You got to ask him. &gt;&gt; You move away. You come back. &gt;&gt; Because when me tell you, sin brought you away. &gt;&gt; Repentance brings you back. &gt;&gt; Don't stay in your in your bench and say, "I wonder if I should go." That's the devil reasoning with you. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Am I in a place where he could not do much because of unbelief? &gt;&gt; Break the break it. &gt;&gt; Mash it up. &gt;&gt; You wives, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; You husbands, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, a business without a sign is a sign of no business. &gt;&gt; A church without a sign is a sign of no God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where are the signs &gt;&gt; in your life? &gt;&gt; My daughter was suffering from epilepsy &gt;&gt; in sleep and it drove me to desperation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I cried before God. &gt;&gt; And everything I tried, it didn't seem to work. And one day I read the book and he said, "Take off the clothes and in desperation I ripped that thing off of her and burn it." She never had another attack from that day. That's about 20 years ago. &gt;&gt; I know this God is real. &gt;&gt; I talked to him. He spoke to me and he showed me something about Trinidad. I can't tell you. But I can tell you this. You don't make that move now. &gt;&gt; When the other time come, &gt;&gt; you may not be able to. &gt;&gt; But there's darkness over the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the darkness ain't good. &gt;&gt; Cuz I tried to put on the light and it was not coming on. Unbelief will a church. &gt;&gt; Unbelief will you. It's a poison. Take the antidote. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to walk down You walk into sin, walk down to God. &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. He says, "You are ashamed of me, I'll be ashamed of you." &gt;&gt; Young people, what do you put with it? &gt;&gt; You know, I've been telling you the truth. Back in the world, you sisters, I'm polishing your fingernails at home and when you come to church, clean it off. All right. &gt;&gt; Looking at things of the world and the systems of the world and the designs of the world. &gt;&gt; Want to be in the latest this and latest that. Where is the latest prayer? &gt;&gt; Where is the latest move of God in your life? Aren't you God? &gt;&gt; Oh God, you mean to tell me we get to a place brother Brennan preach and he said but 10 people came. &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; You mean this unbelief so trapped? Hallelujah. And then he said, "If you can't see, you cannot come." Cuz you could only come if you call. I'm not calling you to get saved. I'm coming here to get dismantled. Dismantle unbelief. Dismantle. You're not coming to say, "Well, I want to get saved." You are dismantling unbelief. Right? The disciples had it. &gt;&gt; The people had it. Even in his resurrection, &gt;&gt; the disciples had it. &gt;&gt; It's only when the Holy Ghost came, they lost it. Can you really say when you're going home that you have no unbelief? &gt;&gt; Young man, I call you because you're strong. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? You're going to leave and go home. &gt;&gt; Are you going to say, "Well, that grenadian know he's talking about." Remember this is not grenadian talking to you. This is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You don't want to let this day pass &gt;&gt; and then it doesn't return. &gt;&gt; It is dark. I lie you not. &gt;&gt; Very dark. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And darkness represent sin. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to be committing adultery. &gt;&gt; Just have unbelief. &gt;&gt; Some of you probably need to get healed. &gt;&gt; But you lose faith because I went up so much time and nothing happened. Oh, you expect to get healed on your what? &gt;&gt; Healing and forgiveness go together. Not even if Jesus pray for you, he could fix you. He had to make it right. You say, "I can't make it right. What I did to me, I can't forget." Then God forget you. &gt;&gt; Nobody can do something so bad that you can't forget and forgive. When God forgive your sins, when God delivered you from where you are, you don't know if you're going down the road, you die. Are you taking a chance &gt;&gt; for somebody to pray over you and send you in a grave where there's no life? [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm closing now. I can't wait forever. And remember, you're not you're not staying back because of me. You're staying because you don't believe. Because if you believe, you'll say, "Lord, let me get myself before you and get my victory &gt;&gt; and get my deliverance." Or are you so caught up in your way that you ain't prepared to exchange it? The rich young ruler was not prepared, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to give up his band &gt;&gt; for heaven. &gt;&gt; People are still coming. I'll wait. If God is speaking to you, don't don't show up on him now. &gt;&gt; Do something now. You know, I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; You know, do something. Don't leave as you came. Some of you in the message, but I don't mean the message in you. Some of us come to church and we discontented. We ain't happy. How you going to live like that? God bless these little children. So for the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of heaven. What about you veterans in the message that nobody can teach nothing because you have all the books and yet you have enough grace to say Lord help me. &gt;&gt; Is that going to be your response? God wants to revolutionize your life. Bring back power in it. &gt;&gt; Bring back victory in it. &gt;&gt; Aren't you tired living a defeated life? &gt;&gt; I tell you, if I was not a Christian, I don't want to live. I don't want to live. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because of him, I live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And because of him, I'm here. &gt;&gt; Because of him, I can look for tomorrow. There was a time when in my Christian life I I I would I used to get saved every Sunday &gt;&gt; by during the week I g backslide I hear my father preach and I'll be ducking because it hitting me love not the world &gt;&gt; and I'll be ducking under the benches and I said he's preaching to me &gt;&gt; until one day God &gt;&gt; met me. &gt;&gt; I didn't meet him. He met me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that I will never forget to this day. &gt;&gt; Not one single day has he left me &gt;&gt; because he brought me close to him. I that's why I pray. I can't live without pray. I cannot live without his grace. I cannot live without his anointed. I cannot live. I cannot live. I cannot breathe. I can't. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't let your Christian experience be a religious one. Let your let your experience be a spiritual one &gt;&gt; where you could you say what brother pray on us get answered the devil answer too &gt;&gt; all them rich people in the world and they get the answer all them people who burning candle and and sacrificing people and they getting the answerful so don't talk to me about that the brother says Satan could mimic everything except love &gt;&gt; so you can depend on science I Young ministers in this message have a spirit of sex upon them and they have a gift to preach. &gt;&gt; So don't tell me you don't even have control over your flesh before somebody talk to you. You ready? Oh God, help me so I won't fall. What kind of thing is that? When God deliver you, he deliver you &gt;&gt; permanently. &gt;&gt; Give you power over the devil, power over Satan, power over hell. Now those of you at the front, join hands. &gt;&gt; Long time you hold somebody hand. Join hands &gt;&gt; cuz I can't come and touch everybody, brother. Connect with the people and let me hold your hand, brother so we can join. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now be sincere. It's not how much you ball, but it's how sincere you are. And as you stand, you said, "Brother, Lord God, I purpose in my heart from this morning. If you deliver me, I will never ever forget. I will serve you. So help me, God. If I go back, take my life. Take me. Don't let me live. If this is one more time I'm coming to you, let this be the last time. &gt;&gt; I cannot run out on your grace. I cannot abuse it. Oh God, deliver me. &gt;&gt; Set my soul free. [Music] Open. Let go. Glorious. Faith is a conqueror. Faith is at the victori. Faith is deliverer. Take your victory. Take your deliverance. Take your healing. Glory to God. Dismantle unbelief and go home energize. Go home singing. Go home shouting. Hug everybody in the house when you reach. May the power of God run through your life. May the power of God rip through your soul and energize you and deliver you. You'll never be the same. Father God, I have done as you showed me. You do the rest. Thank you for our brothers. Thank you for the people. They have responded. Then Lord, come and show yourself. Now we look for the signs. We look for the miracles. &gt;&gt; And we look for the wonders. &gt;&gt; You never change. We change. We repent. We repent. We return. We repent. We are sorry. &gt;&gt; Forgive us. &gt;&gt; And those we have offended, forgive us, too. And forgive them. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. &gt;&gt; Take charge, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We not forget to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory. Take us out of the world and the worldliness. Lord, I see it creeping in like a dagger, like a snake. Lord, like a like a squid. Cut the tentacles. It's snatching the young ones. It's snatching even the old ones. Oh God, cut. &gt;&gt; Give them a cleansing. &gt;&gt; Give headstone tabernacle ahead. &gt;&gt; Bring back the head. &gt;&gt; Bring back the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; we remove the systems &gt;&gt; and we bring back the water. Lord, all the time you were there, but the clouds were over us. Heavy clouds, dark clouds, but Lord, you remove them. &gt;&gt; Let us shine. Let us shine. Let us shine. B them thing, Lord. Deliver the people. Save the people. &gt;&gt; Lord, to whom shall we go? I can't go to nobody else. I bring them to you. You brought them here. &gt;&gt; Then the devil is defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; I curse his works. He cannot leave as he came. He would leave empty. Leave the God's people alone. Go back home alone. &gt;&gt; Let him return with the angel. Let him return with a pillar of fire. Let him return with a joy. Let him return. Oh God. [Music] We declare victory this morning. We declare victory for the king, king lamb, king lamb worship. We declare victory for the morning star. We declare victory for the son of God. Victory over debt. Victory over the devil. Victory over unbelief. It's ours. I confess it. I confess it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Move through this place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I give them to you now. in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? You love the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. And what can we say about the presence of the Lord in our midst &gt;&gt; and to see God's desire to dismantle unbelief &gt;&gt; to remove all hindrance, all obstacles so that faith could stand and &gt;&gt; faith could speak. &gt;&gt; The power is here, brother Brandham said, but it takes faith to move the power. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and perfect faith is based on your knowledge and revelation of your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the word brings clarity to your position &gt;&gt; and lets you understand clearly what belongs to you and the authority that is tied to your position. &gt;&gt; Because when you are on your property, you can speak because you're on your property and the law is designed to protect you on your property. &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for the message this morning. How many appreciate the message? Appreciate God's servant, Brother Redhead, who stood behind his sacred desk with a burden to see lives changed and transformed. So, uh, may God continue to strengthen him and use him mightily and grant him and his daughter who is here with us safe journeys back to Grenada. And by the grace of God, we look for more fellowship in the future. Amen. Can we put our hands together one more time? We do have a prayer request. This is from Sister Victoria Brown. Please pray for Celeste Wrio. She has been through a lot but made it to see her 10th birthday worthy today. So, we want to remember uh her in prayer. And if there's a request this morning that you want to show by raise of hand as we approach the throne of grace this morning uh with faith knowing that we could confess it with our mouth and know that there's something that happens when you speak it when you say it. So as you lift your hands say it into the atmosphere. Lord I'm coming to you for this. I'm coming to you for this need. This is the need I'm bringing to you. So, it's not just to lift your hands this morning, but we want to bring it before the throne of grace as we come in prayer and unite as a church, knowing that there's power in the church of the living God. And whatever we bind on earth, he has promised to bind in heaven. And whatever we loose on earth, he has promised to loose in heaven. So can we unite as a church in prayer all over the building downstairs in the kitchen wherever you might be online wherever you might be right now as we unite in faith if two shall agree touching anything we can have what we ask for almighty God the word has gone forth Lord with clarity of this enemy of unbelief that has crept in and has taken root but by the grace of God and by the wisdom of almighty God this demon demon of unbelief has been dismantled and we stand on the faith that you are the same yesterday, the same today, the same forever and there is nothing that's impossible Lord with you father and through you all things are possible father and Lord we bring this request for Celeste Dabrio Lord whatever it might be father we bring it to you Lord that you would touch this child in the mighty name of Jesus Christ Lord may you continue the work of healing deliverance restoration ation and all over the building to every hand that was raised. Father, every declaration that was made, every confession that was brought before you, Lord, you promise to be the high priest of our confession, Father. And unless we bring it to you as a confession, you can't operate as high priests. So, Father, there are there are needs in the house this morning of sons and daughters who are speaking for their healing. They are speaking for their breakthrough. They are speaking for their sons, for their daughters, for their wives, for their husbands, for their finances, for their health, for their whatever it might be this morning. Lord, we bring it to our high priest this morning knowing that you could be touched. You are touched by the infirmities. Lord, you are touched and you walk this journey. And Lord, you know what we are going through this morning. And Lord, he said healing is the children's bread. We come to eat of that bread this morning. May you minister to your sons. May you minister to your daughters. May you minister to everyone here in the sanctuary, those that are downstairs, those that are connected online. We pray dear God that every request would come back as a note of praise, Father. Lord, we pray for your servant with the Timothy red hand. Lord, that you will touch him. You will restore virtue and strength to him. You would anoint him aesh from the crown of his head to the so of his feet. May you bless his daughter is here, his wife, his family, the church in Grenada. May they go from strength to strength. May a revival break forth in that island that will shake and ricochet across the region and across the world. Father, may you touch your church here. Father, may you touch our pastor in a special way, his wife, Lord, the ministers, elders, deacons, ushers, trustees, musicians, helps and governments. Father, may you lift a standard. Father, you said when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit will raise a stand up. Lord, and there are so many churches gathered now, gathered earlier, well, gathered today. Father, Lord, all claiming, crying, pleading for something. May you move upon your bride body. We know there's not much more time left. Father, may you touch your people one more time. May you bring us back at the appointed time. May you grant traveling mercies and be with your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen and amen. You may be seated for a few announcements. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to give a few announcements and then we have some housekeeping comments that I'd like to give. So, I'll cue the tech team for when we will wind down the streaming. We could address a few housekeeping matters. We like to welcome Bobby Prince invited by brother Shane. God bless you and welcome to Headstone Tabernacle. Happy to have you here. We trust that the service was a blessing to you in a mighty way. Service continues this Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. We encourage you to make every effort to be here. We believe a season has changed and we have turned a corner and God is requiring more from us. So service continues this coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. This coming Friday is the first Friday of the month and we are into the last three months of 2025. So this coming Friday is our day of prayer and fasting as a church and that will uh lead into our Zoom prayer meeting on Friday night at 8:00 p.m. And I want to encourage you as a church to take this very seriously. We have not been this way before, but the Holy Spirit is here to guide us and lead us. And I don't want you to take any service for granted. Whether it's online, whether it's in person, whatever it might be, treat every single service with a level of sacredness, sincerity, honesty, transparency because we are looking for God to do something. And God could speak through the Zoom meeting straight into your home &gt;&gt; and break chains and shackles. And I want to challenge the parents as well. it is your responsibility to bring your home in order uh for the Zoom Bible study for the Zoom prayer meeting as well. So, uh and this coming Sunday, we'll have two services. Service at 10:00 a.m. and the Lord's supper at 300 p.m. And I want to remind the church as well that Jesus himself said, "Do this in remembrance of me." And you know in that whole uh expression of the Lord's supper, he said, "If you don't do this, you have no part of me." You know, so it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness. It behooves us to get our homes in order. It behooves us to rebuild the altars of our prayer lives and our sacredness and his sanctity and all of the messages that have been unfolding. And you have to be blind to not see that God has been doing something. This last three months in particular have been a real turning point from the convention in July into God unfolding things in August to what I could only say is one the grace of God but to the divine plan of God. Because as we would have said, if you would have asked us in August what this month would have looked like, there is no way on the plan that we could have had both brother Jonathan Martin and brother Timothy Redhead would have been here with us. But God in his grace saw it fit to send love gifts that are in the body to give food to the body. That this mystical body that we are in is not just this local church, but God sent his love gifts to us to encourage us along the journey. And we don't want to ever take that for granted. So we appreciate the Lord's grace to us over these three months in particular and to see how God has unfolding what he wants to do to bring us to our spot because truly time is short. So once again, service is coming Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. Uh our day of prayer and fasting and and church. This is for us to pray and to fast. Uh it's not something to be taken lightly. And uh I want to encourage you to commit to it. Do it. It's a small sacrifice. It's a small sacrifice to make. And we'll talk a bit more about some of these things uh in in the housekeeping. Uh and of course this Sunday we have double service 8 a.m. uh sorry 10:00 a.m. and 3 p.m. with the Lord's supper. Maintenance team group one, please meet with brother Popwell after the service. And next week, Lord willing, group three is carded to serve with his brother Andy Henry's group. So may the Lord bless you richly and I'll ask the tech team to uh wind off the connection.
