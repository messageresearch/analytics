august presence among us lord we we are not here for sure we're not here to put on anything we're here to hear dusty at the thus here the lord we see the world being interrupted lord the whole world being interrupted and we know what happens after an interruption something dynamic takes place and we are here today to hear from you take me out of the way as we try to complete this other half of the message from last sunday may you connect the dots together people's heart i mean you speak to them we need to hear from you father may you come down in our midst take me out of the way and may the angel be present release the unction to speak your word lord speak truth to the people i don't think we ever did this before but beyond our new grounds lord we on holy grounds father and i pray that you would heal the sicken helmets raise up those that are struggling and don't trodden and maybe depressed touch those who are connected to us live here now and those that they would hear the message that the anointing of the holy spirit would go into their homes into their hearts into their lives and change and transform them and jesus may ask it amen and amen god bless you before you have your seats i'd like to go into the scriptures this morning we will take the prayer requests and so on after service i want to read luke 17 reading from 26 to 30 first thessalonians chapter four we want to read from 14 to 18 revelation 8 1 and revelation 10 1-4 so four personal scriptures this morning luke 17 26-30 first thessalonians 4 14-18 is writing a down revelation 8 1 and revelation 10 1-4 good to see all of you all this morning we are looking to the lord remember governments may change times changed system laws change but this word can't change this is the only thing we have constant so let's look to luke 17 reading from verse 26 jesus speaking and it wasn't as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man watch it days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given marriage until the day that noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it as you noticed normal living but the same day that lot went out of saturn it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed sister celine chapter 4 10 verse 14 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the ear and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words revelation eight one verse verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about his peace of half an hour let me go over to revelation 10 reading from verse one to four i saw another angel come down from heaven close with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face as good as sun his feet as well as a fire he had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he cried seven thunders uttered the voices when the seven thunders had uttered the voices i was about to write and i heard a voice of heaven seen unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and we this morning and we pray come and interpret it to our hearts we wait on you in jesus name we ask it email you may be seated praise god god bless you and welcome again it's so good to be here and as we said last week we couldn't complete and i i'm not even sure about this week but we're going to try to see the best that we can i know there's so much to pull out of what we are sharing so we see what the lord do in other messages to come but the title of this message is but under the seven seal the bride's message i know it sounds kind of odd it start with a butt but we continuing from last sunday so last sunday was uh uh six seals ties up the loose ends but this is this sunday now but under the seven seal the bride's message that's the title but under the seven sea of the bride's message of a subject the seal of life the seventh seal and have an inspiration let the main thing be the main thing oh hallelujah we get so much uh distracted by things that are not the main thing uh we get uh sidetrack in homes and business and marriages and situations in churches we we focus sometimes too much on things that that doesn't really count it doesn't hold really value and in matthew 13 44 jesus said this again the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field the witch when the man found he hide it and for joy thereof go it and sell it all that he had and buy it that field he found the treasure in the field and then nothing else mattered after that his job was to sell everything by the field and get the treasure so we under a treasure hunt this morning oh glory to god so we just want to make a bridge from last week to now and i trust you'll go blessed by the i trust you were blessed by uh this week's service tie up the loose ends in your life and that message wednesday was a subset as we say of the sunday service about the messenger come to tie up the loose ends and the word and god don't like loose ends god like to close the gap close the circle go to all right solutions things have to be tied up before the full blessing could come isn't that right so therefore and then we had the will of god sanctification the bible study if you haven't listened to it just go back and listen to it but that message about tying up delusions in your life is very important it is the things that you have to do the pastor cannot do it for you let me tell you this your husband can't do it for you your wife cannot do it for you your children cannot do it for you you have to do that for yourself oh glory to god so time you sit in front of the mirror and say you know what i have to deal with me hallelujah you have to get that guy cornered he always ducking and bobbing scorn him and say where you're going with all them loose ends with all them outstanding things in your life that you have to take care of it's time you begin to look again and begin to take here go afterwards thing just run away you know yeah and it remains unhandled oh glory to god and i was reading for a meeting exhorting on friday we're talking about he that's private for the mastery his temperate and all things that is a different level altogether that is not he that working to be mediocre and we were saying that is not entering the race is the issue if entering the race they get a tick and the congratulations they enter then everybody who enter have a tick but sometimes enter and drop off the race it's not him who starts it's him who finishes so it's not that matter you're coming to church or you're entering to christianity is if you're going to finish the course and if you finish the course it have a target and a goal that's the only way it could be measurable nothing that have a goal and a target if you don't have a golden target it can be measured then anything goes live any kind of life and come to church and you're a christian but that's not true you will find out them spirits will take up everybody who on the loose ends so we warning you because then titan spirit has jumped and echassical spirits just jump behind the pulpit to pick up ministers on the loose ends ministers under six seals ministers that have interpretation on their own idea demon powers has dropped behind them oh yes an enticing spirit will drop behind believers who have loosens in their life oh glory to god because you wouldn't have the confidence to approach god and sincerity brings power and if you're doing the wrong thing and you're carrying it with foolishness you wouldn't be sincere to approach god for him to answer your prayer and you want god to answer your prayer if your heart condemned you he's greater than your heart i want to get in the message but i have to go through all that all that all that all that because the spirit must be picking up all that all that right here oh give the lord some praises so don't just take it as another message take it as something to apply all right when you see the message nothing else matters nothing else matters jesus blessed him except a man forsake mother father brother wife husband follow me not worry at me hallelujah because it's not the only world don't get tired you know this is not the only world you know worse is yet to come you know this coronavirus is the introduction and how was hot words had to come he said the man will die in the flesh and the word even die rotten in the flesh and they're not even dying calling for death and that ain't coming oh glory to god what is it the plagues didn't the bible talk about that poor defile and plagues on the earth but they are coming some sons born sons predestinated sons adopted sons they're going to stop the plagues stop the cancer stop the tumor you understand what happened when doctors can't do nothing about it and science cabinet and all them countries billions of billion dollars scrambling and god waited for a church to get an order for he could pour out the omnipotence and when omnipotence speak the miraculous take place don't you want to see that or you want an injection let me be seated hallelujah hallelujah glory so since the prophet left another interpreter's interpreters come after that loose and sexy what kind of interpretation on men's idea and thoughts and who is many prophets and who want to be a mini malachi 4 and all them kind of stories whose apostle is this who is this prophet and everything else and what happened to that we see what would live out it's just interpretation they were just laughing at that because we're coming up to johnson and jumpers you know we're here yet tonight janice and james and all skull degree people in them in witchcraft them under anointing they withstand moses when they drop them rot them drop down raw two they're rotten to snake too so they're operating under our power and he said as janice and jamborees which stood moses so they committed wisdom so it's no game it's not text versus text it's power versus power come on give me a come on now come on now preach back to me now [Applause] it's not tax versus tax in them no no no it's power versus power but you have a promise you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you so hear what how good so now what what we have known in the past is church church and i want to compare it to what jesus encountered when he came on the scene what he ended the concept was church pharisees sadducees herodians church john the baptist outside the system small church man blessing repent for the kingdom of god is at hand and crow satirical wrong john because there's a different move now there's a different beat now with different vibes now for years they know the pharisees and the services tall hats long guns pretty garments customized they hear a man with rugged camel skin while honey and a man come on the wilderness blast in the hole and they know he was anointed and from all her parents he looked like he was commissioned and he said to baptize people and they come down they know something moving you know and they want to ask are you are you the messiah should we look who are you he said i am one kind in the wilderness because all of them knew according to prophecy something supposed to happen they don't know when they don't know where they don't know how but they could feel it they could sense it they know it's going to come true some of them guess how they get conviction they start to get baptized he's had a bust at one time you better bring forth fruit oh come on me to talk talk if it's a act upon what we say in here bring fruit for repentance don't say you're sorry i'm doing nothing about it act do act do and one day john the baptist felt so anointed he started to preach he said there was one standing among you and jesus right there looking he said there is one standing among you he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire oh jesus hallelujah jesus sat down for 18 years hearing the interpretation under the sixth seal anointing of the old testament that they were wrongly interpreting and he was the seal of god himself and he said nothing and he came to john and get baptized and the holy ghost struck him and jesus led by the holy ghost into the wilderness tempted of the devil overcome by the word return in power found the place where it is written find his scripture and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and i could see a bright anointed power led into the wilderness overcome the devil come back to the scriptures find your scripture and get them devils running but are we on our way to our rapture we on our way to resurrection oh we on our way to the millennium what glory to god and this is what we're going into there will be no impersonation to it the devil cannot impersonate what we are going into there is absolutely positively no impersonation to it because it will not be man oh glory to god it will be god himself so just incorporation last week have you ever seen a picture of a cow in a bush you have to look and look did you ever see that see the picture of christ in a bush you say when the painter have it so fix up till when you look at it a certain way when you won't see it you can't see nothing else it's like a trick picture and it could be this way when you see it what you paint having it you can't see nothing else i want you to see the message you cassie baptist method is catholic pentecostal they can't see all them tv people that have the bogus discernment and all them kind of crazy miracles they have you can't see none of them nonsense you only see the messenger because every a's have a messenger every aid have a message if there was no noah you couldn't get into no act if there was no moses you couldn't get to here apply the blood you have to have a message in every age luther jammed the catholic church wesley john the lutheran church the pentecostal jammed the wesleyan church and when causing a prophet he chatted the pentecostal church and now we're going to jam interpretation we're going to jam man ideas we're going to jam the shock spirit on you and the religious spirit and you go get that jamming oh glory to god because you have to be cut down to the word only or give the lord a shout i don't care what kind of think you think you are discernment will call out the spirit that's upon you and some of you are religious spirits that you can be cast out do i hear amen if you are saying men are still preaching it i'm still speaking it [Music] religious spirits sometimes either deal with a sinner than a religious one am i saying it's easier to deal with your weakness than the son of religious freaks in this message hallelujah brother you're cutting this morning here yeah the axis layer to the root god call a message to get a bride out of a church which one you're in this morning oh glory to god you could join church anytime you could walk in and out of church any time but you can't walk out to the bride because he was part of his thinking in the back part of his mind it's not what you do you never commit adultery you never forget to never smoke and never drink you know that he put your name on the book whether you fornicate whether you commit adultery whether you're fully wrong that have nothing to do i'm not here in that show but right i wish i was down there i wish i was hearing what i am hearing behind here you couldn't stop me from shouting mask or no mask [Applause] god rich and mercy call me and i can praise him and love him this will go into hell america in hell right now when they're going downhill all kingdoms have to fall babylon has fallen fallen fallen babylon is poland oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] they are super plain nuclear bombs nuclear women they are more billionaires which are billionaires a million someone reached a hundred billion hey do you you can't even think about that how one man can have all that that's what they have and i virus the guys see your smell terrorizing them that's only the beginning you know they will run to the mountain and say rocks fall on us hide us from the wrath of the lamb he ain't coming back as lamb and judge no he come back he coming back and a lion you know he's coming back in joshua here come back to bless the lord and and the word it is judgment to declare the day of vengeance of our god is a different time coming oh god you better bless god you were here this morning because the spirit and the bride say come on hallelujah because the seventh seal is a seal of life you get life on the deer oh glory the devil don't have that he have death the wages of sin is still dead still that wages of unbelief is still dead oh glory to god nothing else matter when noah group saw it nothing else matter when john group saw it nothing matter when jesus group saw it 1933 voice came down bank of the hua river as john was sent to wind up the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the messiah just before his coming hallelujah so it's not just a message you know it's a message to bring on another person the messiah luke 17 30 the god prophet himself veiled in a prophet so it's not just william branham the prophecy was that the son of man will be revealed oh glory to god and when the son of man come he's the sower oh god help me this morning once the son of man step forward he's the sower of the good seed not bad seed salmon so no bad seed the enemy is so bad see or give the lord i shout give the lord a shout son amanda whoever shall no blood seed the sea fallen background [Applause] [Music] what you are hearing is the words of the son of man hallelujah hallelujah in the days of the voice of the seventh angel direction 10 7 every age had a messenger seven angels god work in specific numbers not eight and ten ages seven ages sam's not seven locks he created a creation in seven days he worked with specific numbers so we are in the seventh age time is about to run out time the angel when it came down he said time shall be no more in other words time it says runs out oh glory to god when the mighty angel roar time shall be no more time run out where you're going where's your plans is god in your plans are you running with your plans time shall be no more where you're going with your ambition your highness your ambition behind the word or you're pushing your own self be careful you get burned the hallelujah of the voice of the seven angel all this mystery that's written within should be finished there's only one thing left that's the seven mysterious voices of thunder that was wrote on the back side of the book now revelation 5 said version 10 version 4 rather he said after this i looked a voice to come up here i was in the spirit and um one sat on the throne russian chapter five so i saw in the right hand of him sat on the throne a book written within so the inside had writing but on the back side it was sealed with some seals so to go inside the book you have to break the seals from the back of the book if you don't break the series off the book you can't go inside the book hallelujah so those backside seas are very important all right let's continue he said all right john but on the backs of the bible the revelation has shown to daniel say that there is seven voices to be uttered that no man could open no man know what it was but the bible said as it was told to daniel in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church not the false church that real true church oh glory to god and christ setting his foot upon the land upon the sea the rainbow over his head remember this seven angels on the earth at the time of his coming oh glory to god so when that angel brought down the book look at the scriptures you know man like that events happen in heaven and events happen on it oh glory to god let me say it again events happening in heaven and events happening in it on earth adam lost the book when he fell satan's greasy hands tried to hold it it slipped out his hands because he do afraid to hold it his unbelief slip out his hands and the book had no choice but to go back to the hands of the original owner which is god himself and it waited for the last days for redemption claims to be made because our angel in the book of revelation who is were they who is were they christ have to come to pay the price blood price and calvary not just to save your soul but to get the book [Applause] how many no this is not a predicate church now we're not talking about jesus save now we talk about you being redeemed redeemers to bring you back now the devil don't want you to know that the pentagon said they don't know nothing about that all the evangelicals and so on they know nothing no jesus i'm saved i'm saved they want to dress how they want to dress wear what clothes they want to wear behave however they want to be and i am saying we're not talking about salvation we are talking about redemption and redemption have two parts coming out of and going into the majority of people have come out of the baptist and methodists but they haven't gone into what we're coming into here right now god has just called you all to believe our message go and call you out to go into something let me jam it now go there call you out to go into six well your seals weapon is argument under 16 is the only weapon is argument i am right you are wrong i am right you are wrong you are wrong i am right the devil is not intimidated by six seals jesus what are you gonna do with the first seal history that pass i can see pass third seal pass fought seal tribulation fifth seal souls on the altar for what fifty sixty rather it's tribulation isn't that right but the seventh seal silence nothing for a space of half an hour so up in heaven something taking place oh glory to god half an hour is fixed for that seven seal that means there's a time limit to get you out if you don't shout about that right now i feel god is throwing emergency mode and emergency gear oh glory to god the devil knows time is short time running no therefore the spirit has to go after your family no after loved ones know all go after their children after them backstage got the spirit of god oh glory mighty work of god a supernatural work of god let's continue so then you see at the end of the pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word of god we are supposed to leave a messenger that will take all the loose ends out there and reveal the secret the whole secret of god for the rapting of the church and then there's coming forth seven mysterious standards that are not written at all and i believe that through these those seven thunders will be revealed purpose in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapture and fate and that's why i say in coronavirus have a limit too because there will be a great gathering i don't want a social discipline you know there will be a great gathering so everything i've had time under the sun so corona have a time too just now the corona time will be up i can say so before the scientists say so i could say so before they have vaccine i can say so before they say anything because that was the word declare and the word can't lie virus or no virus this word can't like because what we got with what we got right now rough feet we won't be able to do it i wonder if you understand that this is not going to church business ago interrupted understand if there's a book in the back a pocket or a bible tap your head or you're sleeping with a set of bibles on top of you like a bible like a cloak that ain't gonna make it do god senior make a robot a or a you bible you know what he said you know he said what we have hardly able to do it there is we have got to step further a lot of people don't want to push they want a shortcut that's why they love the person so bad because he is the priest they have no work to do as long as he busts mysteries on them as long as they press the history on them as long as we bring the revelation to them they chill and they sit on the premises instead of understanding you have to bring an atmosphere you have to bring a revival you have to get fire and you have to start in your house don't come here and start it you know start it in your house bring it from your house to the church i'm not hearing you [Music] [Applause] i don't know if i can get you half of this bring it from your house it's a quarrel in your house bring it there don't don't say it i'm not calling her coral but deal with it go and pray satan i hear you i see you i understand how you're moving but i'm fighting

speak it them devils already running back and forth back and forth them short men show them out pass them out or give the lord a show yeah i don't have to study what any other church is doing and what other person is doing i am an emergency road and when you have emergency conditions you have to take emergency action so if you see me be even a little crazy forgive me and excuse me but this is not normal times and the sermon can be like normal sermons i have come to preach no normal message i have no normal expectation for this morning i'm sorry about that i am seeing something great something awesome something supernatural something powerful oh glory to god under this seventh seal that have to do with you and i and the devil is clueless because you don't know what on the deer oh he can't look on the deer he can't go under here he can't get an invite to come on the deer oh give the lord a shout come on bride you are my invite you are invited to come under the seventh seal [Applause] glory to god yes yes yes this is for you this is your message this is the prize message not loose ends not six seals but the seventh seal what's under there let's be seated so i hope it doesn't sound complex it shouldn't you are so plain and simple you're gonna bring it to you today hallelujah he said what we got right now we can hardly do it we have got to step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to have enough faith to be changed you ever making something home and you don't have enough sugar or flour you can't finish make it you have to leave all the mixture dear go to the grocery buy what you need to have enough of it because you'll make it with what you have it didn't come out right so we have to have enough say enough [Music] so if it's anybody supposed to be hungry is the bright the wise version want extra oil she want to have enough the foolish versions on run out so when they come here you have to come empty oh god i'm hungry oh i ain't no i ain't nothing i need him i need him i need him if you don't i do i come in here hungry every service looking for him every service i know you're gonna ride in one day maybe today's the day i don't know what if today is the day what the day is your day what's he coming to you today are you ready for him what if today's your day of healing what if the days are due of deliverance think about it now it's not just letter letter word word word what is the day of power coming to you all right so watch we have got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up of this earth and we will find after a while the lord will find ways written what written by the thunders are written he's talking about the messenger to come he's come for the gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age and then this anointed messenger arrived of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from serpent to the messenger uniform marine your plant what the seed of the entire bible and the secret is what the word is in the bride right so when that seed is in you the law of genesis 1 11 says what every seed bring forth after its kind so that's seed of the entire bible and there are three bibles right the zodiac this bible here and the pyramid so this seed what we preach and becomes that pyramid in you you can't put this bible in you this physical rhetoric can't go in you unless you have a real good operating doctor cut you open push it back inside you and tell the people that you're packing the word that's not how we go inside of you the words that jesus speak he said they are spirit and they are life so this text is not just text this is spirit given words so this word coming to you and form that [Applause] give the lord a shout under do you understand that [Music] let me go a little further the mystery of god comes down from god as the word of god and reveal the revelation of god and christ is him in his own word so theologians reading this text and christ is saturday and they can't seem at all they only see in greek and hebrew and all kind of understanding and text and they're reading so and uh an ordinary believer pick up a scripture and christ christ says jesus look look look look me here you're spitting here in the psalms you see him and matthew you see him all over the bible you start to see him my god there's a mystery book this book does charge you oh glory this is a book to read every day this gave your comfort every day oh glory to god because he's revealing mystery secrets to his wife or give the lord a shout nothing to flirt as to his wife oh glory do you love him will you serve him hallelujah hallelujah silver with all your heart oh praise the lord hallelujah thank you lord would you believe i'm still trying to break a bridge from sunday to here watch this here i hope i conclude with this we are do you believe we are living in the last days when the son of man wants to be manifested that would be all the word that's gathered up to luther wesley and all that and the pentecostal all gathered up into revelation of what it has been you see because all the ages already passed so what god offered to us is to reflect and show the clarity of what has gone in the past ages that we could look back where we are at it become like i could stand up here now and look back and see my children and see grandchildren you if all i'm saying then i can look back to the years because i'm reaching a certain stage in my life right now where my life has unfolded to this first was one me and one wife after then three little ones two little ones get big then them have little ones you and sam saying so now when we stand here we can look back and see the trail right so there are seven ages that was a mystery nobody knew they were reading that in simple form unto the church of ephesus i was just allowed these here but now we come to the end a prophet come and open the scroll and roll it out and say look this happened this happened that happened that happened and as you see it you want to know where we act because we at the end when it's unfold like this they recognize the cliff is right there we are the end there is no more ages okay the lord i shout glory to god there is no more ages this is not the asia born arrow and slingshot the last hundred years has been the most potent since man is on the earth in terms of inventions and computer and technology right now they could track a fly there's nothing they can do right now look how long the prophet got the vision he said which must come to pass cars driving on their own he says sensors a vision he saw it way back then 1933 he said this have to happen before jesus come no the technology is right it is here no cheers could come but the bride has to be made ready it's not just technology you have to improve you have to improve oh give the lord a shadow looked at me like a talking to paul said i don't run the race like just a run i run to obtain don't be content to church to come to church for people to feel like you're not vaccinating your back's living in church if you're thinking that amen remember amen i'll see you amen you come to get something that woman with a bloody straight come to see jesus everybody around jesus hey he talking and they're listening some writing knows something recording somebody somebody there they click the phone take them to this picture that woman say if i could know he touched him was garment i don't know what others come for this morning but i i want a touch i want i want a breakthrough i want my healing i want my deliverance yeah i want a prayer life i want an atmosphere in my house i i want a new walk i want a new talk hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah and all of a sudden all them big hardback men standing up there blocking your way them have no faith they have no revelation they have no inspiration never anointed human being flesh and blood standing there and your spirit has stood up fired up ready to go then you push this one and you and you holy spirit that you said bother with them they're pushing past this one pushing by this one because you have to touch him of his garment your money does the man next to your head you have nothing to give you have no virtue in him there's nothing perfect man standing next to you go for the perfect man hallelujah that's a living faith living virtue go for that and she pushed and she pressed and she fall down she get back up she run two legs and now when she touch it see if it's done for she you know she ready to go back home i could serve god better now i'm feeling better now i'm healed i'm sealed i'm delivered i am free free from oppression free from depression you cannot solve a problem if you don't admit the problem exists you cannot solve a problem if you don't admit it exists and you cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront give the lord a shout if you don't prepare to confront goliath he's coming back i can guarantee coming back is when you decide you see that devil you see that giant i will take his head off [Music] i don't want to take nobody hell of it somebody giant in your life you have to see your giant you have to see what is binding you what affecting your freedom and liberty oh hallelujah my lord help me jesus all right let's go now there are seven five sevens in god's plan of redemption now watch there are seven seals or seven stages in this great plan of redemption now remember redemption to redeem is to bring you back to bring you back you have to be dear before if it wasn't there before you can't go back we were there before because adam represented us so that's why we had to go back to eden that is why like if you put ink and bleach it disappears and that's what the blood of jesus does you have to cancel all your sin and your issues to justify you later as if you never did sin because going back to even mean going back before the fall so that's why moses was like almost like a test run of what it is to have a man that could speak flies and speak frogs as if he is god and that was not the blood of jesus that was the blood of bulls and goats caused a sinful man an angry man a temper man like moses to speak for flogs and fries what would the blood of jesus do that justify us as if we never did it and by revelation you never did it because you are joseph nothing against him that is god in you the word working his way out [Applause] [Music] so the devil got deceived because god dropped the seed in you and that seed of a life in itself starting to work its way out and when the life in the seed in you connects with the life on the out something going to happen inside because your body is in between fire on the inside [Applause] i don't know how much you know about long time before it had stove has been no stove i have a cool pot and i put it bake i have fire on top and fire below and the beak in between and you're waiting is fire on top and fire below and think cooking in between that's what we're talking about now fire will be on your inside fire coming around your outside and we shall be changed in a moment oh glory to god this motel will put on immortality this corruption will put on incorruption you shall be changed oh is this fairy tale or this for real man i believe this better than [Music] [Applause] i trust this word more than my senses i believe in god for this because i know when things begin to shake when los angeles sings not if when it sinks what do you think will happen to america economy what do you think china will do and russia will do and the opportunities that they have when they see america is full but abandoned preachers called the invasion of the usa and you wonder if it's real if it's physical spiritual you talk about the vision of devils we also say imagine when russia say stop you stop what you're doing we'll take charge or we'll shoot you down wherever it is it's over choice america has think about it what choice do they have right now if if back in if pakistan get a vaccine america will pay whatever they want to pay to get the vaccine to inoculate the people that's the power of having the answer that is the power of having the cure so you could understand why the prophet said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who have crossed jordan [Music] [Applause] hallelujah god breaks the seals on the back of the book oh glory to god that's jordan glory to god you can't cause jordan will come back empty liars oh god help me this morning when elisha come up with jordan [Applause] i don't know how i get to know this this morning listen elijah was about to go elijah demonstrated the power of god he knew he was leaving he had to get somebody to follow him he chopped the mantle on this young man called elisha and the man felt the power and they are coming back went and bought everything mash up everything to follow elijah and when he followed and schooled the prophets men who getting access to some kind of anointing said no you're not your master be taken from easily he said i know it hold your peace shut your mouth don't start to stop me i have a vision i have a purpose i have a goal don't try to hinder me they tried to better they tried to giggle they tried all through until he come to jordan and when he came to jordan look at elijah you just think he might have hit jordan and walked through hallelujah they take no boat hit the mantle and walk through so this man is following elijah i've seen him hit the mountain walked through and then when he walked you know he said what you want me to do for you you see only when you could persevere and come to that spot that god to say what's almost do for you i see you fight the good fight i see you oppressive battle i see you overcome this and you overcome that and you lay down this and you sacrifice that i want to bless you now he said i want a double potion he said that's a hard thing but if you see me go you could get what you asked for well elijah saw him go he dropped down the mantle and he feel the mountain now we pick up his own robe and put in this new robe and he say hey i feel nothing you see because you see there's a thing in the thing there's a book in the book and there's a message in the message you see if you look at the outside of the gift the box and that thing in the fluffy thing wrong filler material and you go for that it looks pretty but that is not the real thing so when elijah recognized is not this robe that have the power is the is not these seals written on the inside is the is he sealed on the outside that's where the power come from is the voices on the back of the book when he recognize that it's not what's written but it's the voices spirit he said where is the lord mystery behind this thing where is the lord god of elijah have you strike it you're not gonna hit it so because he connected his souls hallelujah and jordan opened up and he's had a walk you know he had catholic no boat and building a boat across the same way he comes the same way to go back he struck the jordan jordan open up and when them prophets see him come and they say [Applause] the spirit of elijah that rests upon elijah how do you know that how they know that because the same works that elijah did elijah is doing also give me a shout people give the lord a shout in the house same words oh glory to god there's a special anointing this year this morning okay all right here it is so he said now watch there are seven seals seven stages in this great plan redemption there are seven watts seven seas of redemption seven spirits of god what and then he quote the scripture law in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the eldest of the lamb as it had been slain having seven heads and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into only eight what is those seven spirits them seven messengers you mean spirit could be messengers oh yes there is in columbus arenas wesley martin and so forth seven spirits which are seven men then he says seven angels which are seven messages so the men are angels the men are spirits spirit is messages hallelujah there are seven seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns and seven churches hallelujah and we know a horn represents an age isn't that right or let's continue and this part i have here a market very important and this strange enough was in revelation chapter five part two this is what he said here the seventh and last one of these seals when they are open is in revelation the 10th chapter when you read the seventh seal which we read in revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the speech of half an hour the prophet saying here the seventh and last one of these seals when they are opened is found in revelation the 10th chapter there was a mighty angel came down and put one foot on the land and one in the sea raise up his hand and say the day is finished time has run out time shall be no more oh glory to god the last one of them is revelation 10 foot in the land and see time run out redemption is over he was a lamb then but now we come as the lion of the tribe of judah oh give the lord some praises you love that how many understand that the seventh seal when it opened reveals from revelation 10. in revelation 10 is when this mighty angel opened his mouth and seven thunders through his voices out the devil can hold them thunders the devil's cap catch them thunders those thunders is the voices of god he can't hold that oh glory to god he can't catch that that can be revealed to him he can't even impersonate that but there's going to be a bride anointed and commissioned hey that's the thunder that shake the devil i hope you'll see it sexy is not shaking him loose ends not shaking him mighty in revelation interpretation not shaking him but there cometh unknown time the prophecy who can tame them devils devils walking back upon the face of the earth but there came a voice one time somebody gonna step forward and tame them devils glory the goddamn devils have to be damned they have to be reindeer or give the lord a shout yes same man this is our jurisdiction we have authority on the earth when the lamb talked the book john said we shall reign on the earth that rain is beginning today beginning now beginning with you has to begin on the earth now [Applause] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah before the astronauts go up in the air let us take them in the rehearsal chamber to rehearse the atmosphere where they're going to be they can't just fire up their nose oh no god it's so light up here oh god wait where'd he come and he kept floating so no all that floating thing they could float on the earth here any chamber that create the atmosphere of water to be out in space the outer space is a different behavior a different way of getting things and reaching for things and when you see it get into the spirit it's a different behavior from the freshmen and if we do things in the flesh the way you reach out to things and you wait upon the lord and you're led by the spirit hallelujah you're not going crazy because this is happening that happened and when god says no you rejoice as if he's yes because you know it's god tell you no oh give the lord a shout give the lord some praises and you're blessing god for his happy no you rejoice because he said no did you hear that he said no oh glory glory god speaking to me he told me no blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] glory how do i show my love for god by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sent our way not with some long shower don't give god that are doing it about vex avec's way of xor cinnamon wave x4 hallelujah what you've expert going for he brought you all the maori clay he set your feet on a rock to stay he put a song in your soul [Music] you know how we ought to be and it's so sad with people they're not grateful they come plainly and yeah yeah let me say it girl i want to sting you yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah nothing's satisfied the president of america niche wrote a book he said that man is incapable of being happy unloved by his mother and his father was a terrorist him so he is a certain we and he can't help it because that is what the person is and you are going to become a person because that person's not coming to you [Music] you can be satisfied with you and that is all we have to get a real revelation of what good self is to die not bad self but good self you see good hiddenness perfect let me say it different good is the enemy of perfect i don't think you'll get that but you're good at some other time i'm not going to go to this one can't go there this morning if we go there we would not finish because this looked like a six hour seven and if i really took it home we would hit seven but that number something good but then nobody might be here when i finish all right let's continue what watch brother sister are you catching it god must all revealed you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be open in the last days those seven seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seven angels message here we go all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah that means elijah going to pack all the mysteries in him let's pull back a bit to adam what animal was supposed to do call names because adam had the book you know it was the book of names so adam was supposed to call you into existence as a spoken word son born of the word when adam fell we fell along to sex born of a woman let's continue but when jesus comes he says you have to be born again of what of the word and of spirit which bring you back to how adam was supposed to have you come on come on come on come on so when you talk about born again you actually have gone back to the original born again of the spoken word which is the original seed adam was a seed he was supposed to bring forth asset is kind when god finished christ he is called the creation god has seen nothing like him he said let us make man in our image god put an image and likeness intent and purpose i put a man there a spirit man [Music] and that man fell that man wasn't the holy ghost you know he was like the holy ghost he wasn't the only ghost holy ghost can fall let me say it again the holy ghost can't fall adam fell because he was in the image of when he fell the authority of the book slipped his hands and satan was squatting because he get kicked out he have access to heaven's portal oh they say heavens gallery but we're talking about the mind pure business up there and complaining and sons up there look what they're doing look what they do when complaining they call the accuser of the bedroom so he have what they call the accuser gallery you have a special place you can step up i said i see them or see them see what's smoking you see that yukiya bless them are you see it look at here i could play it back for you and he doing that day and night yeah where am i all over the earth you're looking for saints you're looking for you're looking for what they're doing he's he's looking over you some of them people look at me very strange and like it's real yeah but you're saying my blood my blood my blood my blood you better have blood there for you you know [Music] because jesus blood is what covering you and i without breath be finished you see satan can't get god to come for your sonship because sonship can be cancelled but he'll get you to mess up to screw up your blessing because blessing could be delayed but not denied it [Applause] oh give the lord a shout come on now so the purpose of getting in all kind of stuff is to affect the blessing because the blessing comes to laws the power comes to laws also that's why i told the prophet be more sincere it comes to certain laws he wants something from you hallelujah be more sincere the outside will not see in that god seeing that you see that certain things outside could see but that's something god could see what you have to be interested in is what god has seen in you yeah you could act in front of your husband you could act in front of your wife but what god sees in you that's the most important thing oh glory to god because he's giving the liberty to go before god when that man was saved a sentence that he was about to die oh glory to god god say make up your bed you're not coming off that bed go and tell him go and tell him he's not coming off that bed that money i take that ball oh god i got dead choose the box you're talking no choosing no box pick the coffin for me here not talking that talk that man said lord i serve you all these years i want more time god say i heard you i hear you hallelujah god give him our 10 years so much yes god give him more time on that show the prophet said you could change god's mind about a situation and about an issue if you prepare to wrestle with god and pray prayed sincerely to god that would have to answer heaven have to respond that woman in mexico with a dead baby the baby dead but she heard on her baby was raised from the dead and she wasn't letting them bury that baby she wasn't letting them take that baby from her she held that dead child came to the meeting she never know she can't talk english but she know the man up there god has answered his prayers [Applause] and god wants to bring you and i to that spot where people know god does answer your prayer i have heard your cry i have heard your prayer i have heard your tear oh glory to god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah deacon is trying to hold her she busting through dickens never get pregnant yet they may know what to have no baby they never had no baby so she stronger than weakness she pushing past dickens passing through the leg she causing havoc down there oh glory to god somebody come and tell me around her woman causing havoc in the service he says send somebody to pray for her and her desperation and her faith in the realm of the spirit let's see outside outside seeing a woman fighting machine baby and pushing through but inside of heaven in the ring of the spirit is a big red sign you're like getting police come and he likes flashing instead of heaven whoa when heaven saw the alarm heaven touched the prophet and said she said that there's an emergency that's ambulance coming here emergency there's a faith that faith fiery that is fire that's fire fire that hit heaven heaven hit the prophet the prophet said bring her to me faith could bring you from the back and bring you to the front oh give the lord a shout in the earth [Applause] next minute baby take the baby and the beat was reached from the dead oh glory to god god always see a desperate soul you see it on deep call to the deep people on the platform he's calling your name where they come from or what that always suddenly stop somebody pulling them the same jesus they're pulling the spirit that woman no the person in front you have to get go through and hope and try to get a prayer card you know so she says she's the lucky one you know but somebody wants no cracker who have faith god and they have faith inside the soul this person in front of the prophet and god interrupting this to deal with that because faith talking faith is like a red light you can't stop faith oh glory to god if you don't have it don't stop me don't hinder me because i'll blow you out i have faith to step forward i have faith to believe is fire going to fall i have faith for dynamics i have faith for them 700 voices to be uttered [Music] and i'm pushing towards it no minister could show me off no group could throw me off no concert could show me off not even depressed you may know nothing no family nothing nothing going to stop come true father turn back now i am forward gear hallelujah disconnect the reverse gears you have no reverse in this car it's either you move out or they get rolled over or give the lord a shout back whatever for whatever a bride on the match super church super race oh glory to god amen do you believe that [Applause] [Music] glory glory glory to god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen if having a church is the goal we make it we reach we could sit and relax and enjoy the tribulation when it comes if having church is it but that is not it it's having a church he said what we should make a church what kind of church that going to make a revival not not message church do you know no message church go somewhere else if you can't like it here yes not the exit right there some people don't like it but look at the exit there it have nicer passes than me it has better preachers than me it had more revelators than me hallelujah go but what we want here there's a people that are going to want a revival they go can't say the devil behind me and he never stripped me we have an example in samson devil strip him for years he undercover but the devil didn't see the seven locks choked out seven seven on the backside [Applause] ah oh glory to god they're looking at samsung history but they didn't look at something mystery oh glory to god oh i feel like running this morning they can look at your history of your failures of your sins of your past but the devil can see the mystery in your history [Music] all glory love god i went samson pull back and feel the locks he said oh god the covenant restored oh god the lamb take the book oh god break all the seals oh god the voice is in the back i have access now i can open the door now i can turn the key now leave me to the post boy i can't see but put me there put me positionally place me glory to god place in christ put me in the right position samson they say one more quote one more word you bunch of philistines god god deal with all you oh let me regret what you do let me die in peace take me back and samson walked quietly back to his jail cell and after many years samsung was buried in a gold casket and returned soon he arrived samson that wasn't it he wasn't going also you know he said once more lord that was the application form that hit heaven let me die with the philistines and when the application from hit him have him respond with power when samson pushed on that he killed more phyllis in his life than his death in his life he died with them you know but he take a whole bunch with him the devil was defeated what the devil didn't realize god put him in the camp of the enemy to destroy the enemy so when he thought samson was back sitting at something in the corner god with him as a bomb he was a terrorist he was a bomber for the kingdom of god and when he explodes show all them philistines come down this bride have a promise not to see that but we could be some bummers here we go bomb this place before we leave here oh glory to god just as the devil came in god's eden and bomb up the place we are in satan eden and before we leave here so help me god there will be a lot of explosion when the power of this church rises throughout our shelter knows when the power of this church rises if we bring the brethren [Music] all glory oh glory [Applause] [Music] hallelujah all the mysteries are to be made known in that elijah this last hour how that christ is put out of his church the son of god he is revealed of son of man again how that the church is to be put in order and everything in the last days here is no creed no denomination just absolutely the word living individual no groups which is you're going to oh you're going there no absolutely what the word living she recognized people who are these ill men right now they only need them to have this who's your pastor oh right right that's not what it's about you know but ram say you could talk to a person in five minutes he can know he's a christian you know a christian because in a long dress come on they have long dress adulterers long lost fornicators long dress all kind of haters long just jealous people long dress you're not a long dress like you're a christian or saint you ain't a saint unless you're sanctified it's your spirit he said you could talk to somebody in five minutes know if there's a question it's by your spirit he said absolutely would live in an individual i'll take one leave one i'll take this and leave this one no strings no denominations no bindings or nothing it's the heart with god and him alone no strings and a title or group [Music] not titan no headquarters not tied to anybody i happen on spider-man or even a web north strings you're connected to god to resource them to headquarters okay what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was the intel what was that the intelligence of man no the quickening power of god see the quicken power foretold what would take place oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him o praise the name of the lord hallelujah so the seven thunders which are seven voices seals the book they hold the secret or the mysteries that are hidden in the book the book written within its six seal mystery is revealed or unfolded by revelation 10 7 the seventh angels messenger to the seventh each age of revelation three even the prophet of malachi 4 and the person of william aaron branham a star on the right hand of god seven voices seven spirits to reveal or unfold to make manifest the book now when they asked brother branham about what was outside the book he said cannot be something outside the book because you can add to the book it has to be something hidden in the book so the seven voices is to reveal what is hidden he said it cannot be something outside of the book because god can't do that it has to be something that are hidden in the book therefore the prophet took the thunders that was uttered in revelation 10 3 and 4 and slide it under revelation 8 1. and that's why i read for you he already prophesied and said when the seventh seal break and open you'll find it in version 10. so that night that seven seal night he came and he said it unfolded but i only see one fold of it and the four he saw was seven thunders uttering one two three four five six seven banging in that order let's continue now therefore the prophet put the thunders that was uttered in version 10 3 and 4 and slid it on the revolution 8 1 silence for this piece of half an hour o praise the name of the lord so while heaven the angel lamb taken the book and things unfolding in heaven something happened in the earth god set another prophet to catch the book because if version 10 the angel brings down the book somebody must be on the earth to catch the book isn't that right the scriptures cannot be broken john was on the earth isn't that right the voice said come up in the spirit you begin to see things unfold first seal second seal third seal fourth seal six seals now the devil i have written here is the respiration i wrote is not intimidated by the first six seals or by 16 ministers or by ministers who preach this message under the anointing of loose ends what intimidates the devil is the seventh seal because he don't know what it is he don't understand it because the seventh seal is the seal of life the life of elohim seven perfect spirits that connects with the coming of the lord oh glory to god that's why the seventh seal is connected to the coming of the lord because the seventh seed brings them back who is he the capstone so them seven thunders have to be connected with the seven steps to bring back the capstone and that will be christ coming isn't that right so therefore they had to have something that the devil couldn't touch or denominate this is the book in the book all that get to the book that is the many but there are those who are chosen to go inside inside and there's a quote you say in the book was the book of redemption in this bible here was the book of redemption there's a book hidden in the book you see that book in the book is those names that under no circumstance they could be erased [Applause] and that's the bride do a shout in the house in the book general have everybody names but in the book in the book in the section in the book that blood section that seal section that back of the book section that back of the yellow mind the section can't go back there because he was not back there he only came in the beginning and in the beginning was the word but before the beginning it was seven spirits [Music] we'll give the lord a shout or ride with me this morning ride with me this morning or give the lord a shout [Music] the book itself have names all the names that subsequent said hallelujah foolish virgin all the names because you're called by name but there's a section in the book we call it the book in the book that book of redemption that will be the lamb's wife she will be with him at the white zone judgment judging all the other church members she is the wise virgin judging the foolish versions in the second resurrection oh glory to god hallelujah this is not a man's message first thessalonians 4 the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god hallelujah when jesus the lamb broke the seals the voices on the back i say this it goes into him caught up in him or he guards them up the book is written then begins to unfold oh my so the first seal is what white horse rider second seat black horse tooth seal red horse fought sealed peel horse we're still in history here right six seals fifth seal souls under the altar the jews sexy earthquake the great day of his rat had come maybe i just might read that one that one for you here all right i beheld when i opened the sixth seal although there was a great earthquake is that was andre sinking i don't know but why no one is sexy break great earthquake and the sun became black and sucked out of here the moon became as blood the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree cast online befigs as she is shaking of the mighty wind and the heavenly parted as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and island will move out to their place every mountain and island every mountain island would you analyze again all right we'll move out to the place hope that kept too much i hope you check your plenty all other grounds are sink and sand on christ the sun is rock i stand hallelujah oh praise the name of the lord praise him so we read how the prophet he gathers up all the loose ends and that produces the son of man all the word gathers up to bring it back to son of man all right all right let's continue now under the set of the mountains watch and the kings of the earth and the rich men and the rich men and chief captains and the mighty men and every bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks and the mountains sit on the mountains and rocks fall on us hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his right to come who shall be able to stand this is six years here up today the six seals and it's interesting because the numbers by the cliff was perfect this is the sixth chapter and it closed out the six seals when you go to chapter seven that's an interruption chapter seven is an interruption and chapter seven interrupts with after these things i saw four angels stand the of it stopping the four winds the angel from the east identifying the jews to be sealed watch how god numbers working so chapter six reveal up to six years chapter seven is an interruption and then you go to chapter eight when you open the seventh seal there was silence oh my first piece of half an hour hallelujah praise god and look at chapter seven after all the robes they tried to identify and if we see them said and all the interested around the throne and about the elders four beasts and fell down at the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power so a lot of noise a lot of activity in heaven a lot of shouting and praising and worshiping that is in chapter seven and all of a sudden i could imagine the tension now because six seal already gone there's an interruption with his vision of the four angels are you with me of the angel from the east of all these tribes being sealed and instead of worship and rejoice and thank god and all of a sudden and when he had opened the seventh sea there was silence it was a shocking thing he said they were owed by it all heaven all the activity just stopped all of a sudden it stopped silence for half an hour oh glory to god and that opening of the seventh seal is revealed or unfolded in revelation 10. so from there you go to 10 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven with a book open all seals broke now oh glory to god where was those voices in him and he opened his mouth the book was open all the written mysteries was open but when he opened his mouth as when a lion roared seven thunders seven thunders threw their voices out it was irregular voices this is supernatural voices i'm about to write just seal it don't write it oh my hallelujah oh glory to god thank you lord jesus the worship activity in heaven noise in heaven has been identified these are days who come out the great tribulation this is revelation chapter seven and then you go to revelations chapter eight all this taken place in heaven and in the meantime something is taking place on earth a prophet is getting ready prepared by a vision that came and a message preached december 30th 1962 says what time is it so he had the prophecy the prophetic utterance and vision he identified his church and now he's going to connect with his angels now are you with me hallelujah then he went now to the open of the seals on it sees breaking heaven now they break into it now and that seize was on march 18 1963 to march 24th 1963 but before the first seal was unfolded there were two messages preached before he opened the first seal the morning of march the 17th he preached god hiding himself in simplicity then revealed himself in the same and that evening 1963 17th march he preached the breach between the 70 changes and the seven seals then for march 18 full seal then second seal to the sixth seal on march 23rd after the sixth seal there was an interruption instead of preaching the seventh seal in the morning he preached question and answers on the seals and then in the evening of march 24th he preached the seventh seal the devil was clueless because the silence was on and he said when the seventh seed break it starts in silence but at the finishing of the seventh seal you're supposed to be all the way up here to know who god is how he lives his being his nature oh glory to god hallelujah and i say this morning the devil is clueless still and if i get the time and i'm going to read it for you where he said the prophet said it's the turtle and the devil don't understand it he just can't get it so let me just continue he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the open of the seals then revealing christ first six seals as loose ends mysteries to be tied up and then a hidden mystery of christ himself that is only for his wife could the wife say amen this morning don't say you're not worthy and i'm thinking i don't go there don't go there because you say you don't have to you know you have not chosen me he said i have chosen you so don't try to pick yourself he chose you and he chose you as you are not that you're going to remain as you are he chose you as you are because you will become his wife remember when this full revelation break only his wife could make herself ready because the wife will catch a revelation of preparation or give the lord a shout now you see i keep thinking how do you get a people that have been sitting for 50 plus years listen to messages listen to preachers listen to teachers listen to revelation how you could get them activated to begin to act upon what they hear someone never become very arrogant somebody very annoyed all cattle and nothing and last service which is something you should listen to tie up the loose sense but i'm talking about make yourself a christian you're not born a christian fight as a christian you're christian too we're here that from where you get it from god on a grandchildren it doesn't work soon you have to become a christian go to the samurai against the wall and you do yeah are you capable because this happened when god took away brahm's wife and the daughter was next little baby daughter when the wife dead and gone the devil telling brother branham you're people in the flood rescuing people and his own family perishing and the devil he said he started listening davis had to tell him things that i write he said look at that little baby day and you say god is a god of love i explain he's playing up here there's all these senses to anoint all these senses and emotions and things and he said something in him then that he thinking and figured okay how to deal with this no it wasn't something in him says the lord gave now you see we could say amen to these things i talk about me too but when you're going through the process it's not easy you know [Applause] it's not nice to lose our loved ones and with a loved one you know he was young but he didn't listen to the lord and the lord was disciplining him not punishing him so when an adoption he said he could take your wife again you could turn your wife against you i know people might even want to see him into that but that's okay let's continue he could turn your husband against you he could take nature he can turn the church against you that's the easy one you know you'll just walk in that church and escape you overcome the test no virgin supposedly children who changed against me now they gone no i still got silly wood he could do this he could do that he could cast about a sickness what do you say all of this is adoption tests and when god finished with him he was still a prophet he was still a servant of god he lost there not even five years and he had curse i think other than five years nobody got healed because he didn't have the anointing but he still saved god he tried to shoot himself shut him shoot himself and the bullet wouldn't go off he didn't try one center more than once and when he finished with that foolishness and he shoot the bullet went off god can stop bullets god could hijack your disaster plan [Applause] yes god could hijack your your destructive element to protect you from yourself because he purposed to get glory out of your life devil can rob you of that he can't cancel what god raised you up for moses run over 40 years and that and that commission was not cancelled he was waiting to be activated by pillar of fire and the purifier couldn't meet him in egypt it had a museum on the back side there's something about that backside there were seven seals on the back side of the book there was something about coin on the backside oh glory to god hallelujah what are you saying preacher your message is under the seventh seal oh glory to god amen hallelujah when elijah talked thought he was the only man remain god break the season show him there's seven thousand that haven't bowed and if you think you are the only bride they have bright around the world that hearing all kind of false anointed and all kind of story and what kind of intellectual nonsense being preached when the life hit them so they will fly out there will be a mighty deliverance all through this message god will deliver his elect i am telling you that's dusty at the lord i have a word from the lord concerning it and the bible said the spirit and it might say come you see in the elect have a gene inside of there that connects to the spirit nobody can stop that i was a catholic and when that mother eager fly over me i fly all the cathedrals so fast and after i recognize his wings the catholic wings they were sticking on me all the time but always an eagle but then catholic wings followed so fast because i was born to fly i was born and raised up to see this entire message nobody can oh talk not to that they can't come and tell me guardians and a prophet what foolishness is there two ways god said baptist wait where did you get it for sent catholic or what would you script it for that did i behold i sent you like the prophet then if it's not william branham who it is pope francis who it is you have to find him because god's kalai if he says he goes senator elijah before the gate and terribly he have to fight that man and we say today has already come and if he come then where are we at what glory to god if he last has come then where are we at how close are we down the road listen all governments floundering right now under this pandemic oh glory to god and i am seeing 2020 as an interruption oh gloria and something always happens after interruption

effect and if the b system which which which have the image getting life the image of the beast have to get life what about the bride where where does she get anointed from the first seal from the second seal the third the fourth the fifth the sixth no your seal of life [Music] is from under the seventh seal don't let nobody talk you out of that nobody appreciate all that we are staying with the world this is the word of god that image will come alive he said no other life can work in her the thunders did not in heaven the thunder's utter on it the devil got tricked god pulled on a revelation of himself no wonder he said when the virgin he himself acted to make his word manifest in the virgin the devil is a liar this morning the god who started to work in you he's going to complete it he's going to complete it oh glory to god the mighty angel brought down the thunders it flashed oh glory to god god sleeps in the word and god packed the word inside of you and now god about to activate the voices of them thunders to reveal the hidden mystery it will be christ himself them thunders to belong to one man those thunders don't belong to our group those thunders belong to christ and those thunders were released to gather the bride together to give the bright fate shoulder might hurt to be pure to reveal the hidden mysteries that are sealed in the word oh glory to

have to learn to be silent before god could give you power over other people other things you have to pull over yourself and that had to be vindicated and confirmed that you have power over you there are many people too selfish and that way they're not blessed as much as they could be blessed and should be blessed your own self is just keeping you back as soon as i break out of that watch your blessings opener hallelujah god don't want to hold back anything from you as we heal our own selves i want to close my lord let me see let me let me take a little peek and try to see i'm on page seven and i have 27 pages so i don't know what i will do with this but i'm going to wrap up by gorge grace my my mind let me see if i get that please say closely you say these seven thunders oh and revelation 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they are mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be right away and when it do it will give faith for that rapture and grace for the church to move out okay i want to get a step here all right i'm going to skip up here notice when this messenger not when he starts when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing second paul prophesying purple the opening of the word the mystery is revealed but what the opening of the word the message revealed however when the seas was open i believe it's christ the mystery of god revealed this after this is open now he said look at the clock it's two o'clock second pull is over two pull is at hand so that means more had to be unfolded so it was not just march 18 to 24 more was going to be unfolded because our invite was going to go out to come to the unveiling of the mighty god in other words the god that was veiled silently in the prophet after tying up the six seals was now about to take the veil off of himself to bring the hidden mysteries of himself and that was for the bride oh glory to god hallelujah and he put someone who is just mentioned he put some in the oddball he put something majanivores he put mysteries all about it was all about himself but one of the most important one i wanted to get to you he said the book is open just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified with the coming of the lord i don't ever want you to forget that quote oh glory to god let me forget that i'm gonna wrap up here music i'm gonna please how close here we go this is it here the book is open just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of christ oh hallelujah and you know whenever you know when that that that was done oh praise god let me see like a skip right down my my my my oh glory to god thank you jesus hallelujah thank you jesus how can i find it boy wow oh glory to god oh just worship him so he's looking now waiting for the seventh seal to be identified will come up with christ and this was spoken uh i think 1963 but but but in what shall i do which is called the christ he said the first thing no right yes this is the 24th of november 1963 but the rapture just before barbara died the 12th of the 4th of december 1965 he said the first thing comes he starts descending from heaven after reading thessalonians 4 16 there's a shout what it is a message to get the people together a message come forth first watch lamb trim in time hallelujah praise god the seventh behold the brahman cometh lam truman time so the message was to get the people together what the seven thunders were supposed to do guarded the bride together so then you see the first fall of the shout of the seven seals the seven thunders and that seven thunders was not identified in the coming of the lord as the shout out because this first session before is jesus coming oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah or give the lord some praises thank you jesus hallelujah glory to god hallelujah just just a few more are we going to start it up up here i want to get to the life all right so here we go now systems doesn't have life he says back to the word he said they are built so many systems around the world he says it's back to the word so life systems doesn't have life it's only god's word it has life so the systems is built around it but it doesn't have life and it has to comfort something that cannot be denominated the entire seed has to come forth see how they nominated on one word and another word in another word there's got to be something that cannot be denominated it is the entirety of the life that's in there has to produce itself again on a bride so you get it now the life itself cannot be dominated and here is where i get the believers will be called out the true believers listen to this notice here the life that was in the stork and castle also end up in the seed the life comes out of the original seed come to different processes the seven ages three different processes and then turns back to its original condition i am the happiest person in the world that god will let me see this because this is a hidden mystery that god will put the seed in you let it unfold and then it comes back to the original life isn't that right they waited the ages seed rendon in the ground and then god reproduced that seed isn't that right three stages hallelujah praise god amen all right let me just skip here now oh here we go there is not okay when it comes forward it looks just like the green but when the green light begins to leave the husk to go to make the grain the bride the horse open up and excommunicate the green is that right that's exactly what it is now when the seed word begins to grow forth the husk puts from itself the life here we go and i'm close with this are we going to continue by god's grace the life leaves all others to follow it that's the true believers they follow the life wherever the life goes oh i'm done for now i reach half the message but i want you to get that the true believers they don't follow bishops archbishops churches systems they follow the life in the old testament when the pillar fire move you guys don't boy i know by my chair you know no feeling restish no no no you have to move because the pillar fire moving when the cloud began to move moses was taking instructions from the cloud and from the pillar of fire moses wasn't given the pillar fire instructions or given the cloud instructions oh glory to god when the cloud came down and the cloud came down god asks the prophet if you're looking at the cloud the right way he said turn the picture to the right and the seven become one and one day this same seven could we stand and give god some praises all the sevens will become one one lord one faith one baptism he said the end time message is to bring it to that what is that another ephesians i have all that here but i couldn't go in that today let's all just praise and worship as you please something oh glory to god hallelujah [Music] let's seal away still a little bit of jesus yesterday for gideon
