change the order of service we invite you to come into your word lord because you underwood is the same i pray to speak to our hearts tonight take me behind the cross and hide me behind that cross lord may your blood through your blood you speak tonight thus saith the lord to the people we need to hear from you tonight are we thank you for sunday service and we come here for more lord feed us lord feed us truth feel us life feed us oh god and strengthen us in the inner man granted lord and we believe here inspired and drawn closer to your granted father and jesus may ask him to email tonight we want to turn to one portion of scripture from hebrews chapter 11. we want to read a couple of verses there one read verse one then one with the five and six and then 31 to 40. hebrews chapter 11 reading verse 1. now faith is a substance of things before the evidence of things not seen verse 5. by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him but for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god i without faith is impossible to please him for he that committed god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's go down to verse 31. by faith the hard rehab we always talk about the harlot and so on like rehab but is by fate by faith the hala riya perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spice with peace what shall i most say for the time would feel me to tell of gideon of barack of samson of jephthah of david also simone of the prophets who true faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped them out of lions quenched the violence of the fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong villains and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and squadrons year moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were shown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskin and goat skin being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens caves of the earth and these all haven't obtained a good report through fate received not the promise god having provided some better things for us the day without us should not be made perfect may god bless this would you be seated i want to take a title from verse 34 where he said quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong watch brilliant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens and the title i have tonight is out of weakness they were made strong what a time last sunday uh the continuation of the book of the generation of jesus christ i believe the holy spirit used alberta mightily to bring out uh the the history and and and the channels that god used having some real colorful uh stories and tonight just wanna draw some inspiration out of weakness they were made strong another thought is very strange but changes equal pressure over time that's like a formula like a piece of achiever so happened i want to do some work around here at home and i'm looking for i couldn't get my um the fire the final cutlass so i decided to do it the old-fashioned way of taking the carpets and rubbing against the stone it's an old fashioned way to sharpen the cabbage and recognize that i had to apply pressure and had to take some time but i every time i keep pushing the cutlass on the stone with some water you keep firing you see the edges getting shiny getting sharp i could feel the sharpness of it so i begin to think about what pressure over time does not just time but what pressure over time what it does it brings a change and this life of faith is not a one-time thing faith is a walk it's a life by faith you come here tonight you come here by faith tonight and if you come by faith you're going to receive something tonight because it's not just natural you come in let by the spirit you come to hear something from god it's not right praise the lord judges 6 14 and the lord look upon him and this is this is gautam the gideon in coleman go in this thy might and thou shall save israel from the hand of the midianites have that i sent thee he said unto him o my lord where it shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manhassee and i am the least in my father's house and the lord said unto him surely i will be with you and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man it is amazing how god will take the least yes the lowest the weakest the one that you didn't expect or you wouldn't even think to do great things with hallelujah so god will use and channel and go past human weaknesses and struggles and whatever it is that his sovereign purpose will be accomplished and that is why that book of the generation of jesus christ that is so important to know by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was prophesied do you believe that so all these different brothers because hebrews 11 is the chapter of the heroes of faith but is out of weakness they were made strong david wasn't a big mighty man with muscles and qualified for the army but god used him as somebody under-qualified and not qualified to qualify him to deal with goliath so when you think you're not qualified or you're unqualified god could qualify you because it's not my mind nor by power it is by his spirit nobody like to have their weaknesses exposed but god did identify these characters in the bible to show not only their strengths but their weaknesses to not only their strength but their struggles and to show that he can't he would deny them because they are part of him they are part of the plan he planned on this great mystery isn't that right jacob i love you so i hate he knew all about jacob before jacob was even born hallelujah he know the kind of person jacob was going to be but that didn't stop him from predestinating jacob onto our desired end hallelujah so all what you go through have a desired end behind it oh glory to god the stories of abraham of moses of sarah all of them you don't only see their faith and their strength but you saw their weaknesses also hallelujah and that is why hebrews 11 is so important because hebrew 11 didn't take to account just their weaknesses it showed their faith in god it didn't say raya but a prostitute he said by faith the hard rehab by faith she didn't perish for the rest of them because she operates under the level of faith it shows how much god honors faith oh glory to god by faith the elders obtain the report and by faith you have a good report tonight but god reserves something better for us that david on us and that made perfect so god call us something higher something further therefore the battle for you could be hotter and heavier because it's a great thing to take us out to this age oh glory to god it will take a great faith to pull along that cap you believe that even the prophet said the third pearl is for the whole weakened fate some people don't have bulldog faith and go go get him speak in faith just speak the word oh glory to god amen do you believe that hallelujah so this fate built out of weakness built out of struggles built out of battles hallelujah old man abraham and god say you have a son hallelujah an impossibility but what drop out on him to see how his faith will get activated how could the old man his wife pass child parent could believe god and the bible said abraham believed god oh glory to god and that belief was imputed unto him for righteousness and the bible said blessed is the man unto whom god will not impute sin oh glory to god because the faith that he had it stood in the gap and the blood of jesus wasn't shed yet oh glory to god and god call that man righteous go do i hear a shout in the house jesus there coming calvary and paid a price yet but the faith and abraham god called the man righteous oh glory to god righteous seed oh yeah i hear you tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] so i want you to see faith is a journey faith is a process faith as as as in time because it takes abraham 25 years and i love the phrasing that the brother branham brought he said when abram came to the fullness of believing you think he didn't have struggles you think he didn't have doubts when sarah didn't want to make breakfast for him you didn't think he'd get heart problems but he believed god not sarah face not sarah looks but he believed god sarah physical looks wasn't encouraging to him because it couldn't be possible even sarah encouraged him to go unto the higga until yes quench the violence the fire escaped out of the sword out of weakness now there are many people inside of that scripture there you know their name everybody you know he said time would fail to tell all these stories of all these people here the who are god heroes not just god people they know they are god heroes hallelujah quench the violence of fire you could talk about shattered vision escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax valiant and fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens oh glory to god woman received their dead raised a life again they wasn't taking no for an answer oh glory to god you can't give up you can't let go you can't let the condition so get you depressed and done out that you want to give up and let go you cannot do that we're not going to have these heroes inside of here and not been gossiping a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers oh give the lord a shout it has always been about the faith let me say that it has always been about the faith because sin is unbelief [Applause] the collective stories and histories and testimonies they were stoned they were sworn asuna they were tempted are you tempted they were tempted too temptation is part of it they were tempted they were trained with the sword they wonder about the sheepskin and ghost king being destitute afflicted and tormented it wasn't easy because it was a journey because when abraham first got the breakthrough to look for this city he was thought he was going to find that city you're looking for cities making buildings god every time you journey here you say you find that city anybody see that city you see anything resembling this thing we're talking about i'm looking for the city all the time he passed this one he passed he gets an old but he's looking for the city he know there has to be a city somewhere because he belonged to that city he belong he is one of them citizens of that city oh glory to god you don't belong here you're not a trinidadian you belong to the kingdom of god the king of the most high god oh god you have citizenship of that kingdom nobody can deport you nobody can say you can't enter in or give the lord a shout oh glory to call your passport stamp you belong there oh get the lord and shout the hatred amen you are part of this kingdom you are part of that city oh glory to god amen hallelujah glory to god amen thank you lord hallelujah praise the name of the lord [Music] a lifetime of obedience a lifetime of subjection a lifetime of listening to god and the voice of god brother branham a message of the father he was saying yes my word is life and the only thing the letter kill it but the spirit gave it life what i trust now with all my heart that god will quicken which means to make a life quitting the word to you know by his spirit people still look at it regardless of how accurate and how clear and how revealing or how teaching a man could teach or preach or whatever if the spirit is not yet to quit me it's just head you know how many of you stand there the mightiest teacher could come and teach if the spirit is not here to take what is being taught and quicken it it's just knowledge and understanding jamming you're intelligent that's why all these brothers we're talking about here it wasn't knowledge just jamming the intellect because if something was was under the knowledge intellecting when they closed the gate on samsung to lock him up all he was going to watch to get oh god who are the king can i now leave could you open up and as far as some is concerned the understanding is thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy as far as samson concerned this is in my way that that that app is supposed to be so it's either move it and move something out of the giveaway but i ain't here sign up together i just have to knock a little gate i ain't asking for no key i am the key to that gate i'm moving it with the post and pack it on a hill that's sons of god that is by faith samson that is what we're talking about nothing gonna stop in your way glory to god you talk about the mighty army god gonna raise up you talk about the anointing people are gonna have [Applause] [Music] glory oh god are you gonna be part of this history i could be part of the generation of the book of jesus christ i will be part of that [Applause] is your name will be added to hebrews 11. oh glory does god your name have to be insider there too oh glory to god amen may be seated so when i saw went forth to sow seeds and while he slept another sower came by and so tears and he went ahead and told the parable the disciples couldn't understand him and jesus explained the sword is the son of man the field is the earth and the seed is the word of god notice the seed is the word of god whatever god will say is a seed everything god says a seed now the way you raise a crop is first get the ground ready is that right take all take all these stink weeds and the briars the creepers that's his unbelief and doubt sweep it out of your heart get ready then the feet is broken i am not very much on this dry i repentance i like to see a man come down before god and say i'm sorry father receive me broke up and the grong is ready for the word a real inner breaking people stop crying i want to see back tears i want to say cry i want you tears tears of anguish you're looking for a breakthrough you're looking for god to help you you're not afraid to say oh god help me i'm needy i need an out and so on like that need a breakthrough he said i'd like to see a man come down before god and say i'm sorry father receive me broke up the ground is ready notice then any divine promise of god is a seed this one we're not preaching nothing new you know this is the same egg whether we boil it to fry bake it flip it whatever the same egg yeah it will rain sunday go rain money go rain choosing a rain people in the afternoon one day they have to be complete and the ring will begin to fall oh glory to god so look no no new mystery every mystery have been revealed already i ain't bringing nothing new this is to be freshly anointed though must prophesy again he said bring a fresh prophecy of the prophecy okay the lord i shout the word raise god raising the standard is to say the same word and make it more positive the same word you know but tonight is a special night that the same way that you know becomes quick unto you made a life inside of you that that will make the night special it's not i'm special or this no no no it's the spirit is special making the world alive to you now when you go back to endeavors as you enter the front doors they never leave the back door as you come to the front door they believe in the back door because you know something happened with you there is something upon you by faith they drive all them aliens they run them out and you have some devils to run out all right let's continue now no any divine promise of god is a seed that's why we preach your promises i wanna understand what we're doing and peter said by these promises you become a partaker of the divine nature we're not here to bring explanation and stories we're here to preach promises all right so watch and that seed in the right ground will produce its kind nothing wrong with the seed in the right ground it will produce so no excuses first we have to have the right seed now i say out of a group of the two seed of the word because they are fallen seed but they're going to be a group with the true seed of the world out of that group god will get our beloved bride oh give the lord a shout every a seeds that fall seed too but there's going to be true seed and once that corn the right drug had got to come down they have to be signed and what no oh glory to god you tell me we have a word seed sent by a prophet all these years and there is no fruit impossible [Applause] nobody could kept me to believe there was no fruit impossible not when our original spoken word seed loosed all over here seven spirits spread forth thrown all here echoing this message that's impossible [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not 1906 pentecost original pentecost that we had at their pentecost when their pentecost was fully come all glorious dynamics fell upon them and everybody get their portion everybody was anointed and commissioned oh glory to god we're coming back to that we have to come back to that if we had come after that then he last failed in his job but we say he laughs already come and he did what he's supposed to do just messing with literally turn the chance of the children back to the faith of the father is what the message is hallelujah hallelujah notice what he said these divinely revealed mystery truths that's different see how the washi tape another finally revealed hallelujah all right let's continue then and that scene the right ground will produce produces kind gold corn will bring corn valley will bring valley which will bring wheat and any divine promise of god will bring the results if it is placed in the ground and they're watered watered with faith prayer trust god shall bring it to pass i am seen with experience i want to add something to that because elsewhere in the message you get that i want to say watered with faith prayer trust and praise if you want to write down something tonight write that down this seed has to be watered so it can just sit down and boil as a seed it's a seed and have the seed no the seed has to be watered like how said the damsel that come and water this canal let that be the woman for isaac and then rebecca came and watered the camel and the prophet said the camel was a power and he said the word is a power and he said the same camera she watered is what took her to isaac and the same word that your water is not going to take it to the jesus and you say how do you water the word with praises with thanksgiving with worship that's why all hell is against worship that's why you hear me say give god some praise i'm not just talking that and just saying that because i feel to say that that is the way to water this thing so the church is going to have an atmosphere without that water is your stone dead you will pack up shop and join jehovah witness hallelujah hallelujah and make this a kingdom hall but this is not kingdom hall we preaching the kingdom of god is preached and every man pressed their way into it oh give the lord a shout so the pressing is the pressure and over time you're gonna get into it oh did the lord oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah every man after press shelter press push oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] you may be seated if this message will don't understand the other person people will be sitting within the rapture or whether tribulation come they will be holding holiness ministers who didn't tell them they should have been pressing and pushing all along because the minister is some kind of big messiah bringing manna for them when god when jesus died he feel ran from top to the bottom and and flattened all the ministerial posts and then high priest behind the veil thing and god's showing that this thing will open and no kind first and no high first and however i can't keep you from this thing hallelujah my customer the secret thing and like you see me they need to do that kind of thing behind the people don't know what's going on but when she says bust that veil you say oh no no going on that thing finished with no you have direct access i've given you a password or given a pass code they have direct access to this glory direct access to this presence because this person is the producer not so faithful ministry it's with the sons and daughters of god oh give the lord a shout in the house not a bunch of men we call the original gospel when they take it and take it from the people and put it on men then i'm with the pope god ain't gonna do that no more go ahead and do that at all calling let no man take no glory not no when the pentecostal mess it up when the nicolaitan spirit messes up god will get glory in this hour that means god gonna bring man to know they are nothing that is the divine revelation when we know we are nothing then he becomes everything then he can get glory then what could crush you in your weakness to show us not by your might not by your intellect not by you human spirit he don't need nothing that you have or give the lord a shout he don't need anything you have he just want you to get flushed out that's why some people have to fall because they're too strong all glory and they think it's their strength god you may be seated hallelujah yes yes goddess make sure things happen away that's why when gideon had all them said and said the men god said night too much of people they will say the numbers conquer this thing and then they had a semi test with drinking water this is another on the other and then it comes out of three hundred men he said like this man you're going to defeat the enemy so then people have to notice god boy there's 200 men versus thousands and thousands of people with his thousands versus thousands like you could say yeah i mean i felt very skillful boy the scripture already swore the scripture on the horse but when you see the few men that god choose oh holla and you see how god and how they lick up and run the aliens you know it's god this is how god wants to be glorified so you have no money yeah they can't buy this but god and all that too you're poor you're discouraging all that too you can't get forget that god in your business too you have to begin to see god in your business oh god how am i not like he wanna like she i wanna like them forget them god in your business you're the least of your father's house god in your business too you are going to do with them you have to do with what god wants to bless you with that's how you gotta have faith if you're if you're stopping watching what others do when you have no faith at all then you're jealous and you're fighting for what this one have and that one have and you want to do like them and they plant oats and you want the plant oats too and they have corn and you want to plant corn too and your land is for cattle and that brother land handling corn real good you can't plant that corn in your cattlemen run them carefully underneath of grass oh glory to god that's placing that's positioning that is you in your anointing you and your calling and when you in your groove nobody could stop you nobody could interfere with you oh glory to god because you know god is with you that fire is upon you okay let your in your groove you're in your anointing oh give the lord a shout [Applause] oh hallelujah [Applause] oh glory oh glory hallelujah look at the anointing here tonight look i cannot [Applause] very few he suffered no man to do them wrong saying touch not my anointed to my prophet so ham oh glory oh god [Applause] glory glory love god don't let the devil polarize you in your weak time and your weakness in your lord time and your daughter now don't let it ever do you that and talk to you negative forget that who you thought you recall he called you know what you're gonna do all your failures all your shots coming and you order out it and he still call you [Music] you think that general salman who end up falling in love with his rehab you think he can find some other person god before the foundation in the world put it in his heart and love that woman over here [Music] [Music] wasn't born yet so god knows the generation is coming down there he already knows generally so he know we're gonna make it you know what you're gonna overcome you know you're gonna break her temperature you know the night is a special night he knows what to put into you and in your weakness you shall be made strong [Applause] [Music] you haven't set a consideration so it's easy no water right but say there'll be a famine in england elijah shut up this guy already and say dynamics [Music] do whatever you want to do let me save some hearts sometimes unlock the heavens that the ring will unfold dynamics are coming to be called [Applause] a big one that is a big one you know hallelujah you may not brag or cover that name is yes unlock the heavens and let it rain fall and then every seed before that after his kind but the price he will bring forth after this came to the son of god will bring without the son of god kind too oh glory to god how could there be a manifestation of the sons of god all this full word god brought brought us as a seed to preach to the bride think about it now all the messages the seven angels come from eternity to gather all this scattered water type back into the world to bring a seed that bring down the holy ghost if the holy ghost will come that celia staying right there some time ago they found a sieve of something in egypt and they planted and grow that life was in that sea for how much years hundreds of years that life was still inside that seed but they will stay a seed until they go along in the ground until water strike it and you can't stay that seed that seed in the bride secret the bride the seed in the bride the wild and the bride all that is nice but fire water something has to come upon that seed to manifest that seed that's what we're preaching for that's what we're declaring time for water to come upon your seed and your water with faith in whatever trust your whatever prayer and your whatever praise or give the lord a shout out oh glory to god you take a seat into your heart you got to water it [Music] [Applause] it might be seasoned now you have to know it is your seed [Music] if it's your seat at your seat brother you can't pick your neighbor to watch it for you so looking for sisters to encourage you i just want to help you i think you know is your seed you better water that seed let's continue i'm thinking now that the best doctors united states got two years ago said reverend branham there's not a chance for you you see i turn to the old world whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them i said father place them in my heart i shall water them with feet be a knight and tonight i stand in perfect health once a blind man led me by my arms i couldn't see a thing just objects in front of me moving only daylight was dark and tonight my ice test 20 20. he said why i took god's word no one with a gift to cast the spirit away the word will do it faith in god's word [Music] yes faith in god's word jesus had all the fine qualities of god in him do you believe that he had powers upon powers but when he met satan he never used his power he gave an example for the weakest of christians when he met satan he said it is written man shunned by bread alone but by every word that proceeded the mother of god the weakest christian can take that stand god in his word and every time when he would meet the enemy he said it's written he had power to do it but he met satan on the same grounds with the same word you can meet him with it is written you believe that one is written whatever things you desire when you pray believe you receive them watch the order of the word believe now present tense you receive it and you shall have it it will be given to you later but believe it now before you can get your crop you've got to plant the seed and water it and believe it don't dig it up every morning to see it and you dig it up you delay it much more it will never grow if you keep digging it up hey remember the agent where you put down the seat you put that seat down inside of it [Music] [Applause] there we go when you settle it in your heart that gods heal you sister you little boy you brother any of you separate in your heart and believe you take god at his word and start testifying about it give it plenty of water fertilize it watch what takes place the word of god will produce just exactly what it says if that is not the inspired word of god i wouldn't be standing here i wouldn't be believing it but i know it's the truth oh glory to god heaven will pass away but my will will not pass away i the lord have planted it and water damn it leave some pluck it over my hand there you are god is in his word oh glory to god amen hallelujah are you giving them a promise tyrion you see jerusalem until we do and perform on high and they stay there until paul come on but i want to get to something here now oh glory to god and remember the quotation the word of god will defeat satan anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition the word of god alone alone i won't emphasize that alone not the word on our gift not the word in a preacher just the word alone [Music] the word of god alone it is written will defeat satan no matter who he is what form he comes in where he's at it will defeat satan the written word of god so the devil don't want two things here now he don't want you in praise and worship and he don't want you with the written word these people in ignorance now watch now here is another statement i want you to remember and that's you especially so sick sitting here with cancer cases and so forth tonight you want them to remember this that the right mental attitude this is your mind now how how you choose to think that that is your how do you say that your mind dispositioned them because somebody could tell you something and you could choose to receive something negative or you choose something positive he said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass can you understand what i mean the right mental attitude was any divine promise of god will bring it apart if you will take the right mental attitude towards anything god has promised did you hear that anything [Music] anything god promised you could have it let me say it again anything god promised you could have it [Applause] you could have the angel of god coming to your house you could have the pillar fire in your home you could have a rainbow over your house you could have healing you could have ceiling you could have deliverance you could have multiplication in your house your food could multiply in your house whatever you have listen when brother bryan give the testimony of speaking squirrels says the hearty right says that's nothing but the truth now that statement nothing but the truth that wasn't just a normal statement you know that actually passed dimensions when she said that that that past dimensions and went into the it break and went into heaven no heaven not up there no happiness right here enough to be mentioned nothing but the truth god heard that and that was so pleasing to god that god dropped down the prophet and said give that woman whatever whatever whatever did you hear that whatever whatever she wanted oh glory to god whatever she wanted it was available all glory to god because this son had access to give that woman whatever she wanted because she said the right thing that means you could say the right thing have to write that is true that's what we're striving for to get people to say the right thing speak the right thing act the right way get the right results hallelujah we find out we find him as soon as god came upon him he was anointed so jesus he was waiting for his anointing age 12 to 30 he was waiting for his anointing and that came when he got baptized fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him he was anointed he made the christ is not right so what's something now now when he god came upon him he was anointed went in the wilderness and out after 40 days and he defeated satan by the word of god and he did that so he brought this is the part one again any divine promise in reach of the weakest of christians if he was god why did he let satan say if they'll be the son of god before the miracle he says written and so then satan always tries to quote the word so what that shows that you can defeat satan on the word of god no matter the word of god will defeat season any place anywhere under any condition it's if it's in the belly of a whale if it's an alliance then if it's on the bed with a cancer it's laying yonder bleeding to death in an automobile accident the word of god will defeat satan anywhere and the weakest christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it oh glory to god did you hear that now it's your privilege to quote back that word the lord that keepeth thee the lord that keepeth thee the son shall not smite me by day not the moon my night he shall preserve thy soul it's your word the lord is my shepherd i shall not want it's your word he leave me beside the still waters it's your word he restored my soul here do i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil for god with me thy run and stuff they comfort me oh glory to god hallelujah is his word it's your word for glory to god when you take it and you apply it's your word it's no longer in the bible it's yours but give the lord a shout out [Applause] your word [Applause] watch you're not saved because you feel like you're saved if somebody say i know i'm saved because i had a children to me that's not why i am saved satan could whip me around that stump anyway and he can you too upon your feelings that's right but when i walk back and say thus saith the lord my faith is built on the word of god he can't whip that away [Applause] he can beat you on your feelings but he can't beat you on your face [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] because your faith is resting where on the word and he cannot defeat that you're feeling up you're feeling down you're feeling good you're feeling like a christian you're not feeling forget that you don't feel like a christian forget that tell our feelings go somewhere else you're a christian because god said so you're a christian because god called you your christian because god put your name on the book and you see your name like john and you're shouting and you're worshiping [Applause] it's not fearless though this is believers though this [Applause] now listen let's continue remember remember jesus had all the qualities of the father in him do you believe that he sure did all the final gifts of god was in christ he was the offspring of god but notice when he met satan now i guess not different parts of the message so i will put it together like this i find something repetitive but there's some key things inside there i want you to get all right that's why i'm seeing it back but watch but but when he met satan for you for your example he never used one gift on him when satan came he says it's written and he was quoting deuteronomy 7 19 7 14 to believe on the psalms man shall live by bread alone so what jesus does quote in the word you know jesus wasn't just or not you know he's eternally stolen the bread jesus gave him a scripture man shall live like bread alone but but by every word i proceeded under the mouth of god satan don't know who he talking to he talking to a bible believing quote and christian okay the lord i shout come on now come on now satan don't know each other he is talking to a bible believing quote christian [Applause] so jesus was floating on the coats he was floating on the scriptures he went giving back to it and the word manchester united alone but descriptors say that so i'm not arguing with you satan quoted up in a pinnacle again it is written so satan reckons jesus in the wood now so he had to go scripted to us we in this day we brethren no not so far the scripture says i mean give a displainer because i still know who you are because on my file i kind of record of this performance i catch noah drunk i catch david in this i catch all the emperors in that i can't catch this man at all there's only three tests to give the man is money popularity a woman his lust of the eyes the last of the facial pride of life you must get questioned one day in the morning one one them have to hit him because he's a specialist you know he know the art [Music] knowledge of the principles of life that's what satan had you understand no tree formed thing lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life so that why jesus had to bust that and destroy that and show the devil here power over himself now he fit to rule because he proved me of character there was nothing in him that he could hold on to couldn't pull him with temptation couldn't pull him here and pull him here because he was clean on the inside from all unbelief a life of faith was inside of him faith was flowing through him that's why he said peter come and you come it's faith talking you know and then fellas responding because they are seeds of god they don't know yet who they are they just fall in a man with a beard you tell them come i will make you fishes of men and then drop the lessons out of the following you see parents say no god if only fortunately business was all about women i know spreading my net building business and they're both building business and i'm a fishing business and all of a sudden things crash because my sons fall in that man with that beard preaching about the kingdom of god hallelujah let's continue now get it but i want to get notice here it is i want you to see it and get it now the word of god the written word of god will defeat satan anywhere any place any time it is written there it is listen this is part i want to get here everybody wouldn't have gifts [Music] so jesus brought it down to a place where those who do not have gifts that to do that do not have very much faith could say it is written [Applause] everybody don't have gifts so jesus brought it to a place where those with all gifts because it is written it is written i don't need a gift to say that i just need to say it i am the lord thy god of healthy of all eye diseases it is written i will never leave you and forsake you but i'll be with you even in you it is written oh glory to god i shall be filled i shall be see speak it down must prophesy again [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you there was a little woman in germany about a year or two ago she had translated on the back the translator did in english i could read it she had been crippling a wheelchair for 15 years and she got this she read how she must call the pastor there's no pastor called some christian didn't confess everything that she had everything that she had done wrong and make it right with god and then lay that over her heart and pin it on her underneath garment and then her feet so when she got all this done her pasta was there she put it in her heart she said now old man devil you have had me long enough get away and up she got and when walking that is how simple it was perfectly healed normal it is just your simple fate in believing people try to make fear too complicated it is not complicated it's a simple child like fate you know the blood in the old testament was applied by hyssop you heard that so many times you know what hyster is just common weeds you find it anywhere in egypt it grows out a cracks in the building where the wind packed the seed they get it a little diamond shaped believe hyssop is common so what does that mean you don't have to have a super faith to apply the blood of jesus just common feed believe it that's all [Music] amen hallelujah let's see if we can hit the home stretch here wow from perfect strength brother branham read this scripture where god told paul my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength to smite perfect and weakness and he said for my strength is made perfect and weakness and he says now he said no this is unusual text and this takes some weakness because we are always testifying we are so strong we try to make our weaknesses excuses we want to tell how big we are how great we are and i think that's one of the things that god gave me this text for was to get that out of our mind the little things that we do and what we come to teach for is to find out where our faults is and the things we might better ourselves if we would come to church for any objective i'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places house to see how little we are and put up a trust in somebody that is strong but so there are so many of us like to testify or like to think we are insufficient therefore we make it an excuse i have no education i have mobility i'm unable to do this and if you keep that up and do that in that way keep going like that then you can't among anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weakness god uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get in that condition so he can use us we take the excuses and say well i can't do this i'm insufficient i can't do this and god takes that very thing to do job it's true and the reason why he chooses us is because we're in that condition now that sounds strange just a few minutes we get to god's willing we find out that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is god heroes that are conquerors in the front line take those who are feeling themselves unworthy and as i said that i remember when but i was preaching with the seals and unfolding the wood and so on he said when the voice said the lion or the child but judah had prevailed and you know where that was in the garden of gethsemane so it sounds dramatic the land of the time but judah has prevailed to oops the seven seals that time jesus bought in fire every possibility his compass jesus battling in the garden of gethsemane hallelujah to take the full mantle to go to calvary and when he overcome his human spirit and the choice of will and the battle with his inhuman will and you overcome that and you recognize that he's going forward he overcame right there that was the lion oh hallelujah praise god so you see what god called great god you mean what what man called great god called foolish and what god man called foolish god called great oh hallelujah praise god amen people are laughing at samson and god drop something like this behind me enemy line because god going to allow samson now in that condition to be in the right place to be led by a little boy hallelujah praise god he is weak now his eyes are out are he going and destroy muffler sign that he evident in his life oh he gonna bring a great victory to give god glory he couldn't do that when he was all alone in his power and his strength no god had to let him pass through this whole delilah routine and set him up in such a way to bring honor and glory to god oh in his weakness god brings strength inside of him to make manifestos for his glory oh glory to god there by some say once more lord they have no right to take on my eyes and venge him in my eyes once more lord oh glory to god he had it before he could have it again oh glory to god once more and we had this before what are we talking about we're not going back to something we never had we had it in the garden of eden when godzilla's man he was talking about us oh give the lord a show did you get that when god said let us make man he was talking about yeah big man that was us but the man that god put there to unfold us he fell so god had to go and reboot and start it another way understand this adam was supposed to speak for us because adam had the names adam had the book so he was the speaker for us to come forward but when adam said the book went back and he had the original owner so the names that were seated in adam hallelujah was a mystery those believers they didn't know what it was living out abraham was a mystery all of them says was mysteries and the book was calling them with all them knowing they're being called they were only staggering out of this and staggering into that staggering out of this even joseph said don't leave my bones here [Music] because i know where that power coming i know where the messiah coming he coming in the promised land don't leave my bones here make me a pledge when you leave here that if when you leave here take my bones with you they have no resurrection coming power coming they know the nurse is dying and just to be dead and done no even job all this book he said i know my redeemer christ said die on the cross yet drove by inspiration he said i know and how did he know that how did he come to revelation when he was scripting boys it's not when job was intact and everything was fine it's in his weakness god brings strength into him to see the resurrection to see hundreds of years down the road he said i know you come in the community community coming i know my redeemer limits and in this flesh oh those are skin worms come on now come on now do the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god so his crippled condition his is in his body's condition that didn't stop him from seeing glory seeing me with the eyes of fate that's what sun's about is a journey god took job from being on top everything's secure family fine everything a hedge around him not even the devil touching job god had to invite the devil to look at you he said look at this man that is my man on the earth there's not one on the other like him that man living out something jesus said said give me a chance because i see a hedge him wrong he said you think it's that do you think it's his wealth and what protector wrong him of himself no it's not what are wrong him it's what in him he didn't tell the devil that but god knows what in him that man so when something inner man you could lose anything you want around that one god put a faith in that man are you touching that faith you challenging god himself you think this faith we're talking about in our own faith it's the faith of god inside of you by faith abraham by faith by faith gideon oh glory to god god knew he didn't had it in him gideon didn't know it but god knew it oh i feel i shouted tonight that's why he called again a mighty man [Applause] a man i found my boy what's my shoulder boy think about another swords man of the train soldier and got some mighty man of allah let's go talking to him look and say who was in the room when you reckon he alone me you serious yeah i'm dead serious mighty man no he's not seeing that but what's he in faith oh hallelujah see when god see faith man understand your works and your words could express the faith that god's people can't see your faith you know they have to see your works you could talk talk to a fake all your mouth you could talk faith but when the ceo works they will know that his fate in operation so before enoch was translated he had a testimony that he pleased god you can't see your faith but this life of pleasing god was evident amen that god is with this man and he here we go pressure over time as a formula bring changes he is a rewarder of them that seek him no no no not seek him because you could seek him hey one lord lord i want to seek you i want to see your face all right until next week and then you can tell people you apply to see them that's not what you're talking about them that dinogenicly energetically enthusiastically passionately pressure over time bring a rewarding result oh glory to god you have to have an attitude oh glory to god you have to get it if you don't have it you have to get it started tonight oh glory don't go you can't just listen if you rub any cutlass or a knife against his own soul you could be hold and do nothing because there's no pressure just rubbing the kill in time it's sharpening you're cold you're four months you'll look one way you're sharpening and you're in church i praise now and again i nothing happening with you there's no change but when you start to press i have to take the cutters and press you see that action you see only rust at the edge is that i guess silver because i want a blade i'll go are going uncut i want to cut clean i want a good shot if it's not sharp you have to put more pressure to cut down the grass and they cut down the trees and whatnot but we never shower blade it's swish wash wait till them seven turns until that they're going to slice and cut so right now them thunders go bring a sharp blade when you're sliced and cut in this clean cut glass head cutting clean off let me tell you guys where can i clean off finish glory hallelujah oh glory hallelujah the sons of god will get the sword of the word of the same soul they have the same way they have take it and cut up oh glory to god listen man could just step forward and bring this with alive the same when people reading dead they're dead struggling with them words it will just come alive that's what brother bradham did he just came out of nowhere and make that word begin to live and he challenged other ministers to come forward with signs and one of the miracles but he stepped out because the voice said or stunned the baptist will send the foreign the first coming of christ you have a messenger foreign my second coming of christ god give him a message oh glory to god and before that message thundered he had was three pulls three stages three phases the first ball of second point oh hallelujah a healing ministry to catch the people that have confidence god is with this man but the message will come in and have healing ministry he going to baptist methodist pentecost for everybody they love him they have them rigged revivals the churches falling up big tent meeting and showing like that and afterwards as he gets a little message they start to pull back hallelujah because they can't take the word why because they were always shocked to begin with god waiting for your generation got the ring to pick you up to be the continuation of the book of the generation of jesus christ god knew the pentecostal was going to be shocked god as part of the cruel process of the planned life hallelujah but after the shocking will be seen so god is waiting on you so you are the people that god was backing up you are the people that god was voting for you are the people that god was talking about hallelujah all the others were just stages of the black life but this is the recovery of the life and gardener together in the seed and at the end of time all the life is drawn into the seed and the shock is dead the tree is dead everything else is dead this all the life is in the seed after all the life could be in the bride and she would have the quickness power and the magnetism of the holy ghost going to be in that seed and the seed going to be in you so when that great mighty magnet come over that seed you must go because the rapture going to be in you so you bite that fight into when you're up to you know the bride will be in the rapture because the rapture going to be in the bride that fate was an enoch oh glory to god hallelujah he couldn't share that faith with his wife there's nothing sponge cake you know get your wife half and you get half that's not that thing nobody's not that this has to be in you you can't share it enoch had a testimony please god and one day he was walking he got lighter and lighter and lighter and then he took off let me finish [Music] [Music] practically every hero god ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had nobility at all then that's the person in the good shape so god could start using them when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god start the whole of them and do something with them when we are thinking that we are able to do it then god can't use it because we are wanting to do it ourselves yes see and then we get the feelings now on the other side we're insufficient we don't want to do it then if we just listen to the call of god that's the very thing that god wants us to do the kind of shape that so he can when there we go here we go what all this weakness is about what all this talking about listen to this part when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit so sometimes go layer on your run until you feel and flop because you run in your run you're doing your do and when you recognize you can't do it then you give room over here to do it because you try and you fail you try and it didn't work out you put your best foot forward and it still wasn't good enough god don't want your best foot forward he wants your foot to be out of it all together he wants you to give room that he could step in to show you with the boss and it's not by your might or power but by his spirit i want his spirit come upon your life then that's what happened to samson the spirit of walking up on samson happened to david spirit walking up on david all them guys who spirited walking upon them and they did this and did this and afterwards they felt it was the flesh and all kind of but the spirit would come upon them and this was accomplished so in this age god put the word in the bride to use the word in the bride because the spirit came upon the pentecostal and was a whole disaster and a mess so god did not do that again he not anointed flesh he announced in a word so that's why it take all these years to get this word in the bride you said the word is being preached so god ordained that this word is preached to get inside of you no you have to know it is inside of you you have to believe it inside of you that's what faith is about inside of you [Music] faith is something that reveals you that is not yet but you know it will be so you have a revelation but you're not ripe in an experience yet you're right and you're getting revelation but you don't have the experience of it yet that is faith oh glory to god so when god dropped isaac on abraham he had a revelation he couldn't give it to sarah as far sarah is concerned she is barren she can't have no child she's past childbearing age so don't talk that talk to me but as far as abraham concerned here do you see that isaac is not manifest yet it's in his fate it's in the seat inside of him he have to testify to syria god said so because sarah is the womb that he going to use to make this seed in abraham heart manifest so he can divorce hero he got drunk sarah he can't give up sarah he got somebody to kidnap sarah sarah can stay right there whatever condition she's in however crunchy cranky she is that is the woman that gonna be used by god to produce this child call isa and if you believe isaac coming here the military will be changed so it will take some pressure it will take some time it will take 25 years [Laughter] but that change coming i will return unto thee according to the time of life transformation is coming change is coming it will take some pressure it will take some time [Applause] oh glory glory to god amen when we are insufficient ourselves i'm going to close then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit as long as we think we can do it we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it that's the problem there we think we can still do it but we have to come to a place it's a revolutionary where can we where we know we can do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it so that if it is us trying to do it we will feel i think i want to read it again if it is us trying to do it we would fail but when we just yield ourselves a god then god can fail [Music] when them guys come with all moldy bread to joshua joshua didn't concern the lord they say because of our country oh god i think that time is the next place they go and conquer then they end up saddled with them characters for the rest of the time because they make a covenant with them characters who are supposed to be defeated wiped out everything yeah daddy gave credit to the smart man who come with the old clothes revelation moly bread become half our country there's some bread has some old mole in it and some old clothes which i will fulfill god retired make me wish see smack my revolution joshua but joshua not supposed to make any comment whatsoever see all these are lessons for us to learn dollar no smart man come on don't smart here you say write them all write them out put your neck on the king's head put your neck and cut them off what is that is your land better possess this land okay all is have a lot of lessons [Laughter] but when you see the surrender come because he got that joshua every place you put is yours no man shall be able to stand before the days of my life otherwise most i would be with thee but i didn't shock the people and when men said the fall long dead joshua said no no no no no no no no no this guy worked this car worked this is not how he was supposed to be they know what god said god can lie save things going off key something going off key because god have to keep his word he is god this is land possession time moses was drifting from egypt to this land the journey was a direct one god sent them to the wilderness in order to to make sure time and pressure change their mind but egypt was in the heart yes it was a short journey you know but god passed them a tough world to hope that time and pressure will change their mind and change a heart from them the leaks and onions in egypt but it was in their heart oh glory to god hallelujah you want them cross over and run back and afterwards what kyras mania when they stumbled there and they said we can't take it that was the god had said had enough that was it that was it all that willingness journey god was behind with them he could handle that but not when you land in front of your man so could you imagine they reached this point this is 2019 and and doubting god's promises and and don't believe you can take it god go finish anybody want the question or go go finish with them we are nearer now than what we first believe so i am back in long no we never know we are well able oh glory to god to be part of hebrews 11 we are well able to be conquered with them all and brothers with faith we are well able don't tell me god god bless you here and do this for you here i'll make a way for you here and open that door for you here and that border was closed that i don't have to open we will move the door we have to remember oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] you see lack of strength or weakness let me talk about that i'm not almost sinful weakness but weakness is a lack of faith because faith is a victory that overcomes the world and if you study you you wouldn't go very far but god brings the word bring bring the word now for you to have faith in him fit in the word so when you take faith in the word this is what this is what power in you then you see all your cell phones get charged up because you will get no calls you have to charge up your cell phone and some people don't make no mistake right if they was reading the bible as much as the charger person right now forget the church and revival right now but they don't want to miss the call so they had to charge it up to effectively function when somebody backs it and they lost all the charge and then the funeral home just called them outside afterwards selling a church losing charge they're discharging in church because there's no pressure over time that's what prayer does too you know you can't say good morning good evening you got to take some time and stay there with intense elijah a man of like passion prayed honestly did you hear that kind of prayer he just say prayers he prayed earnestly that he will not reign then he prayed again for reign so it's an approach of desperation his approach of illnesses that was just the axis shall be given secretly shall find knockout shall be opened if somebody take that and run and say ask yesterday and oh god i get it now and i seek and i didn't find and i knocked my dog but then he went down further he didn't ask it he that seek it he that knock it it has to have the condition to jive you not just to knock once but to keep knocking the door open when you understand this door open it where you want then you're not stopping this door open you want to want to come to go back and come to get in they come to get your requests made known make manifest let me see all mine [Music] remember one thing we must master especially young preachers and members alike there's one thing that you've got to master if we expect to fulfill god design our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our intelligence and our abilities we have got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay the sight till god can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability but it's beginning we have got to surrender complete surrender to come to god you've got to surrender him both soul body and spirit everything you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and i no that's hard i know so he's not saying that is a is an easy singing that's hard i know because we are always wanting to do our part in something we know you know we want to do it we say well i just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong god will never use that effort maybe with the help of the lord we're going to get into that few minutes to show you how god cannot use your ability so he put his ability in you and used that not your own is his ability so we are here tonight by the ability of god we speak tonight by god's ability hallelujah are you with me no and what what what no no ability i don't care whose it is will never be usable in the sight of god god has to get all of our abilities out of us before we can achieve his purpose so he got something for us to do as long as we feel we're doing a pretty good job out of it then we'll never you people use of god what good did he do nothing he said it what so what then god can achieve his purpose by sending not a revival he needs to send a killing so we can revive you need to die before you can be born again he needs a killing of ourselves this tabernacle needs a killing on me with it all of us we need a killing so we can be revived to a new life to a new whole to a new hope to our new experience we first need a day of mourning that's how we call it a day of mourning we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead so much and depends upon schooling upon programs or campaigns and and rely upon so many ministers to cooperate we allow so many if we can't get some money we won't do it we won't go into the cities without that he said we've got to get away from that that is human ability you want the ability of man and fight for when man go contrary to the leader of this fight folk young he said he put a modifier so he had today a man we fight for tomorrow he's no fall he's already full because the bishop the head bishop kicked the and immediately that person was a soldier fight for minister he's now a fallen angel fall from where from a man's sister immediately becomes a fallen ninja oh hallelujah that is when man appointed and then man get disappointed he must get disappointed in mana point but when god appoint there's no disappoint when god appoint a man nobody could unappoint him but when man appoint there's a different thing about it you're looking for disappointment that's how you have to seek the lord you have to hear from god god have to speak to you oh hallelujah let me let me see now watch he says so we have got together from human ability we got to get to a place that we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife so we know what pastor and deacon and elder housewife farmer mechanic whoever we are we gotta surrender completely to god that we are nothing then god can start using us and he said that includes all of us everyone that's the thing we got to do history proves history does that god always choose that nobody is to becoming somebodies god takes a person that is nothing and i hope this gets done deep to us both here and in people too that you realize that you've got to become nothing none of them know it all not a great somebody but a nobody and you've got to come to dust and you've got to come to a place where you know you're nothing and don't ever rise above that as soon as you rise above it you rise above god you've got to keep yourself in the dust could imagine people saying i am the holy ghost look he's sitting here you're staying he does he rise above god man playing god hallelujah praise god you got to keep yourself in the dust on the road to damascus you got to keep yourself off your high horses that's for everywhere here and in the table i often said the greatest enemy i've got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shows god right out the picture when i can get rid of that guy then i can get to a place that he's out of the way and god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about hallelujah glory to god so god passes nobles and get weakness god passes those who think they are something to take somebody that knows nothing in order to work his purpose in their life god said to paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness oh my i'm going to skip you if we ever get to happen let me say let something to console you i'm going to close here is something that encourages us are you ready out of weakness and humility god chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church we will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and casted by the world and knows nothing i'm going to close i want to read a scripture and this is from okay and it kept the past when david and his men would come to ziglag and until the day that the americas had invaded the salt and ziglag had smitten ziglag and brunei with fire for taking the woman captive and were therein they soon not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold he was born with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and then david and the people that were with him lift up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep so this is this is depression on steroids they weep till they have no more tears to weep they're doing the lord's business and come to see their wives taken away the city pillaged so then david and the people that were with him lift up their voice and wept until there was no more power to weep and they were two wives were taken into captives his israelites and abigail the wife of nabal the camelite and david was greatly distressed for the people speak of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved just imagine he taught him to stone david that's how upset people are now he's the pastor he's the leader he's he does he's he's that he's a champion i think and look all his children gone his wife gone family gone every man for his sons and for his daughters but okay but he called the soul of the people will grieve every man for his sons and his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord and this is what faith does this is what a life of faith does every body depressed and is a legal depression it's not like if god did prayers no we all serve in the lord and look what the devil come and do and look what happened and everybody around david is in this mood and david encouraged himself in the lord he's god i like that but david encouraged himself in the lord his god and david said to abhiya the priests i'm america's son i pray that he bring me here to the ephod
