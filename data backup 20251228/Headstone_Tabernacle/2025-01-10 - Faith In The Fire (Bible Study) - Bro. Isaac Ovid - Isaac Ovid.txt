it has been uh quite some time that we have had one of these sessions and by the grace of God we are looking to have a time with the Lord um by the grace of God we intend to have these Bible studies every other week so it should be prayer meeting Bible study prayer meeting Bible study you you get it there so um uh I want to it's it's it's it's it's somewhat uh touching because I I have a thought tonight on fire and I got a note a short while ago um of a home I think the Phillips home in Gonzalez that was consumed by fire today and um it is just the timing of the message and we want to certainly remember them in prayer I'm not sure what the situation is there but I remember being in that home as a young boy so we want to remember the family um in prayer and I was thinking about fire and how fire is such a consuming thing and how fire is such a powerful thing and um my title for this Bible study tonight is faith in the fire because life and and I believe may have said it a few times that if you don't become unbreakable life will break you you know life is designed a certain way and even God operates a certain way fire is something that's really powerful and it's it's it's part of what God is so I have a few scriptures here to speak about fire and then I want to go to a specific context in the Old Testament but just to kind of lay uh a foundation tonight we have in 1 Peter 4 12 where Peter is saying beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you and as we are in 2025 I believe it was oest night I had the honor of speaking to the church and I was speaking about reframing your thinking to address that difference in what is happening to me versus what happening for me and what we see here is Peter reframing the thinking of those he's addressing by saying think it not strange in other words I want you to rethink something he said think it not strange he's addressing he's directly addressing their thinking he's saying think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you so there's a purpose behind the fiery trial as though some strange thing happened to you so our trials our situations our oppressions and and we have heard this before but we are being reminded by the word tonight that it's not a strange thing in other words the opposite of strange is actually a familiar thing meaning we by now should be a customed to dealing with pressure dealing with situations dealing with surprises dealing with things that we have not experienced before because this is all to try us and when you're putting someone on a trial example you put somebody in a job you put somebody in a position you put somebody into a new environment to try them in that role the whole objective of a trial or a test is to see if you can handle something it there there is no value in testing you on the same thing over and over again I I I want to repeat that there is no value in testing you on the same material again imagine if you go to form one and then you move from form one to form two and they give you the form one test again and you move from form two to form three and they give you the form one test again and he move from form three to form four and they give you the form one test again there's no value in that because as you move from step to step the test or the trial that is to try you is supposed to move in parallel with what you are being exposed to in parallel with what you are preparing for So within context here we see in Peter saying there is a fire or a fiery trial that is the trial that's designed for all of us tonight and then I want to go now to the Old Testament Isaiah 43:2 when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee that's a comfort now Isaiah 43:2 when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou West Through the Fire thou shal not be burned what an encouragement that no matter what the situation you are going through whether you're going going through the waters I'll be with you you're going through a river that trying to push you here or there they shall not overflow thee so there are limits to the trials that come your way so in other words the trials and the situations and the obstacles and the opposition is not meant to destroy you it's not meant to make you fail it's not meant to overwhelm you it's not meant to make you drop your hand in the air and say I don't want to serve God anymore it is designed to bring out the best in you and God is saying in all all of these things I will be there so the question tonight is are you seeing God in your trial are you seeing God in your fire are you seeing God in your flood are you seeing God in each of these situations Deuteronomy 4:24 for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire he him he himself is fire can the church say Amen all right first Peter 1:7 this is just for a foundation before we get into into what we want to address tonight 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ First Corinthians 3 verse 13 Every Man's work shall be made manifest I want to pause there for a minute every man's work shall be made manifest in other words there's a proving time there's a revealing time there's an unveiling time there's a manifestation time of of your work of who you are of what you represent of your efforts of what you have been working on there's a display that is coming that will make visible all of your prayer life all of your study all of your academic Pursuit all of your career Pursuit all of your spiritual Endeavor whatever you count as your works every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is in other words it is only through fire we can really see the stuff you're made of so if you want to prove the metal of a man if you want to prove the substance of of a woman if you want to prove the caliber of someone put them under pressure put them in a fire and we will see the work that they are the quality what material they are made of because if it's a flaky flimy material the fire will just make it just just destroy but but if it's if it's gold then the fire starts to filter out impurities because it's not being proven as gold that's stried in the fire Revelation 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich so the counsel here is not just to buy gold it is gold that has been tried in fire because take gold and put it under the pressure put it under Fire put it under the condition of more heat anybody with me tonight you will understand if it's quality or not so what we are being encouraged here by the word and by the scripture because it's it's faith in the fire we are being encouraged tonight to level up to to to climb higher because we want to make sure that the substance the quality the experiences we have if we see it for not what is happening to me but what is happening for me can I handle more because more pressure is only going to bring on more you know how many times in life people have the option and the opportunity to give up every day we are faced with the opportunity to give up I want you to dig into that a little bit every single day there's an opportunity to give up to give up means you lose your cool and you blow off a handle and the version of yourself you thought you left a long time ago shows his head again that's giving up giving up can mean walking away from a marriage giving up could mean walking away from your testimony but something holds you and says don't give up there's a businessman somewhere who is on the verge of should I give up or not there's somebody who is holding on and and the whole issue of giving up means the intensity of the fire has pushed them to an edge and the message tonight is to keep having faith in that fire because if you can have faith in the fire knowing that God will be with you in the fire you're going to make it through every success every achievement was made with the opportunity or the option to give up I want to say that again somewhere along the journey whether it is invention Discovery trial and error we look at someone like Elon Musk and Space X and all the attempts to get the rocket up and it was got it wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong and then it start to get right mistake mistake mistake mistake and then success fire fire fire opportunity to quit opportunity to give up opportunity to walk away opportunity turn up and this is the challenge now when we say they don't make them like they used to make years ago because years ago people had no choice to fight because if we didn't fight that was it but now people feel comfortable with giving up people feel comfortable with saying I quit this is why even in the Army there's something call a desert you deserve the Army is a it's like a they will lock you up because if everybody quit in in the middle of the war you imagine you going to war and this people start to abandon you brother poell imagine you about to attack and you're about to charge and at he point you about to charge people have to walk away from the fight and is you alone on the attack how you'll feel you know what happens if you not solid you give it up to you know because you recognize is you against the Army all by yourself so the encouragement tonight friends in 2025 because it is harder it is tougher it is more difficult it is more challenging it is more overwhelming more people are talking about the pressure and the strain and the stress and the anxiety and being overwhelmed and it's all this and what it is is the world itself before the actual purification fire that is that that that that the prophet spoke about this whole world will be consumed by fire we are going through a fiery experience to separate those who are going to make it from those who will not make it can the church say Amen so tonight as we go a little deeper I found myself looking at three familiar characters in scripture we have never spent time talking about them too much because they were part of a bigger narrative and we focus the bigger part of the narrative so we are really heading tonight to the Book of Daniel and within the Book of Daniel as we know uh there are a number of characters in The Book of Daniel and we talk about the the Hebrew boys right the three Hebrew boys Shadrach mesach and Abednego and we would have had a couple references uh to them the subject of the main part of where we will be tonight will be in in Daniel 3 but is worthy of touching where it actually all began which is in Daniel 1 which is really the Exile that period of Exile where Daniel shad mishak and abeno were being unwillingly forced to move from their homeland of Israel almost across 1,000 miles of desert more than likely in Chains more than likely in conditions that they did not hope to be in like to be in chose to be in desire to be in but be it as it may they had to deal with life as life dealt with them so to speak and despite the opposition despite the situation despite what they were something happened that allowed them to maintain their testimony even though things were not the way they would have liked it to be and I want to say that again because many times we have a picture of how we like things to be and we end up with excuses and we end up with blaming people because of you know if it was different I would have been different if I had a little more money I would have been different if I had a different family maybe if I had a different whatever you know but here it was being forced against their will Daniel and the three Hebrew boys are pushed into a spot where they are being tried by fire and then we'll get into the actual literal fire so just by way of background I want to just touch on Daniel 1: 1-3 we would have touched this a few years ago just as a background to before we jump to Daniel 3 itself in the third year so we in Daniel 1 verse one in the third year of the reign of jeim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came to to Jerusalem and besieged it and the lord gave jeim king of Judah into his hand with some of the Articles of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shina to the house of his God and he brought the Articles into the Treasure House of his God which is the god of bell who was a chief god of the Babylonians then the king instructed asanas the master of his unics to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king's descendants and some of the Nobles as a background a few Generations earlier the nations of Judah had turned away from God so this here is really Judgment at work it's the hand of God allowing things to happen to unveil the entire Master Plan of Redemption and all the pieces of the puzzle as it were on God's chest board and the nation of Judah had backslid and followed other gods so God judge them and allow the Babylonians to conquer them ancient Babylon as we know is modern day Iraq and I would have said before Saddam Hussein when he was alive was quoted as saying he's a modernday King Nebuchadnezzar a lot of the young men were taken back to Babylon and Daniel was one of them verse four young men in whom there was no blemish but goodlook gifted in all wisdom so so the king is not looking for vagabonds he's not looking for people who have no purpose people who not trying to be something people are not trying to be you know on top of their game they were gifted in all wisdom that's a powerful statement gifted in all wisdom possessing knowledge and quick to understand look at the description we we touched on this before but it's worthy of repeating again in 2025 what kind of learner are you what is your approach to wisdom what is your approach to knowledge can we repeat this again young men in who there was no blemish but good-look gifted in all wisdom young and wisdom normally don't go hand inand so this there was something unique about these young men that they would be young yet gifted in all wisdom they would be possessing knowledge this has to be more than spending time scrolling Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and spending time watching TV series and movies and even watching the news being politically aware because it says possessing knowledge quick to understand gifted and wisdom and who had the ability to serve in the king's Palace do you have the ability to serve in the king's Palace do you have the protocol of the understanding of protocol the the the knowledge of how to approach people so in other words the promotion and the value we see on Daniel and the three Hebrew boys this was their resumes you know can we can we look at this can we can we talk about this a bit the Daniel who we admire started somewhere the Hebrew boys we admire started somewhere they starting somewhere was a a interview of sort because there had to be a process to identify them the command of the king to asanas was to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king's descendants and some of the Nobles the word I want to highlight is some some of the children of Israel some of the king's descendants and some of the Nobles in other words don't bring everybody find some and when you want to find some of something you don't choose the the lower end of the of the pick you try to get the best of the pick and I've said it to the CH before when I was in school and they had football in school and something like that and they picking people for the football team they would say well we picking you first picking you second when they finished pick first second third fourth my name was not there I was not part of the sum who was picked because I was not qualified to be a football player anybody is with me this evening so the point I wanted to identify here is that these young men who were picked who were part of the sum who were qualified to even advance in their career both naturally and spiritually had a foundation that was Rock call it what are you doing with your time because this description is not accidental we could argue that no blemish might have been hereditary we could argue goodlook could have been the grandfather or the grandmother maybe gifted in all wisdom maybe it's environment but possessing knowledge quick to understand ability to serve in the king's Palace that is a function of you being in a position of mentorship and experience and fire and that's your wrong way this is the right way people don't like to hear as your right way as your wrong way people like to hear as we say in Trinidad we like it so but this is forcing a paradigm shift a reframing of our thinking that as a Christian as a Believer you could be quick to understand you could possess knowledge you could have the ability to serve in the king's Palace and not a Israelite King not a king of Judah only not a king of the North or the King of the South but serve in any King's Palace anybody with me tonight we're building something and whom I'm still reading verse four they might teach the language and literature of the Chans so these young men had to be more than well I know Jewish history and I know the history of the north and I know the history of the South and I understand Abraham and Moses and Joshua and and and and David and other to be able to flexible enough to learn something new because it's a requirement of the role it's a requirement of the environment it's a requirement of the conditions can the church say Amen Daniel was a young man probably around 16 years old or so and he would stand before royalty these were young men we are addressing stand before royalty in the king's Palace so it's around 16 or so by around 19 he's expected to serve before the king so I think it was around three years or so they would have spent their three years of training as it was so around 16 or so he was put in a captivity because in verse five it says and the King appointed for them a daily provision of the king's Delicacies and of wine which he drank and three years of training for them can you take training so that at the end of that time they might serve before the king in other words the king saying and I want us friends I'm speaking here tonight and I'm trying to get to my subject and I can't get to the subject because I want us to look again at the resume and then the training these men were already gifted they already possessed knowledge they already quick to understand they already had the ability to serve in the king's Palace they were clearly qualified to learn the language and literature of the Chans and they still had to go through three years of training so that at the end of that time the Bible says they might serve before the king in other words the king came with all of the resume and this is the challenge we see today in the workplace there are young people who come out of University and they have no work experience so they don't have the training because a degree is not the training a degree is some knowledge that has not been tested it has not been proven you don't know what it is to sit in front of a director and be challenged on your thinking being limited or otherwise and you may assumptions based on a lack of experience you have to go through some training and as the same thing in the army of the Lord you have potential you have ability you have knowledge you bring a certain skill set but every single son that come to God must be tried must be tested must build experience you can't come today and be able to sit in certain seats you're unqualified anybody with me it's a is a is a shifting of mindset a shifting of thinking that is necessary and this is one of the reasons why people end up failing because they're not ready for training they are very eager and anxious to go and do things and then they wrap up or end up into failures that could have been avoided because they were not placed in the environment to properly grow anybody with me verse 6 of Daniel 1 and now from among those of the sons of Judah would Daniel hananiah Mel and Azariah to them the chief of the Uno gave names he gave Daniel the name belto shaza to hananiah Shadrach to Michel mesach and to Azariah Abednego Hebrew names are very important because to them they signified Destiny the blessing and how God was going to use them you would remember when we preach about Joshua and Ephesians and the placing of the birth place of the name back then how they would grown and travail epim and the naming happened in the birth because the name was an identification of where they would be in the land are we are we here so naming is important and I want to to look so it it meant and when you study history the names themselves it is very evident that the strategy of renaming them was not random because their names had specific meanings and the new names they give them had specific meanings So Daniel means my judge's Elohim Bel Taza the name they change it to means B is my judge so it changed who the judges from Elohim to their deity in other words they trying to redefine his identity are you with me hananiah who is the one uh to Daniel to Hanah Shadrach Hanah means under yahweh's grace Shadrach means under aku's command Michel who is what God is mishak who is what Aku is so each of these names they were given them was with an understand in other words like what is your name what is your name okay so I given you a different name and the name they are giving you is an attempt to change by name your identity it is an attempt to change your purpose it is an attempt to change your calling and I would have said this 5 years ago you could rise above the labels or the names that people put on you because names could be powerful sometimes and and a name is not just the name you call or the name you are given or the name that you go by but people end up being caught up in names of even situations so somebody can name you or label you a failure people walk around with names of alcoholic that that's a name it's an identifi you know the alcoholic man who was live in that house without needing to call his government name as we say you know who who they talking about because names carry with it an association of behavior of qualities of characteristic of history of Destiny of purpose everybody with me so I'm just laying on background here because I don't want to spend too much time on this aspect but verse 8 but Daniel purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's decies nor the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the chief of the Uno that he might not defile himself and here we see Daniel is making a choice he's making a decision in a place that's not his own in an environment that is on his own with the opportunity because many of us in Opportunities or situations where nobody is monitoring us nobody's policing us nobody's overseeing us we take a crack we take a try we take we we end up into a road that we shouldn't be in because we don't have internal discipline and internal accountability and because we haven't gone through enough to trust God to be and and I want to just pause here for a minute friends if you really trust God love God you will serve him or no the challenge is there are people who claim to believe and they ready don't believe because if you believe God is real and you believe this word is real and you believe this word is truth and you believe there's a purpose for your life and you believe you are predestinated and you believe you are called and you believe you're an overcomer and you believe you are called to something greater and you believe that that that there's there's another place there's another dimension there's another realm that only perfect love could take you there then why would you lower yourself on a daily basis to the kindal things of this world anybody with me tonight So Daniel in the king's environment with access to the finest thing could still say no I don't want that no I don't want that no I will not have that no I reject that why the label they put on him the environment he was in was not more powerful than the seed in him that let him know who he was and this applies to us as young people it applies to us as adults it applies to us as parents to understand that the seed in us is what should Define our Behavior our attitude our conduct our word what we eat where we live how we deal with situations how we deal with conflict how we deal with challenges how we deal with issues can the church say amen I like that scripture Daniel purposed in his heart by the will of the Lord by the grace of God I want you to do a Bible study soon on aligning a few words mind heart purpose and will there are four different things and if these four things are in Conflict you live a miserable life mind heart purpose and will here we see Daniel purposed in his heart purpose is a powerful thing if you do not know your purpose you will be abused you will be abusive Daniel purpose in his heart so he's connecting purpose and heart so take note of these four words you can start to study it because it maybe the subject by the grace of God of my next Bible study mind heart purpose and will half the problems we get into is when our mind and half not in alignment issues in homes with parenting is many times mind and heart you love him or no your mind say disciplining but your heart feel too sorry and that conflict creates a state that the child will get the right correction because your heart soft your mind knows you wrong thing but your heart your heart weak that's why the Bible say as a man think in his heart alignment mind and heart will and purpose Lord if it's possible this is Jesus let this come pass nevertheless not my will but D be done his thought was walk away but he understand will so you have to connect mind heart purpose and will here we see Daniel purpose in his heart connecting Purpose with heart that he would not defy himself with a portion of the king's Delicacies the king's Delicacies could be anything you know much Delicacies come into us every day all kind of different Delicacies and it's not the the the man in his street is it King's Delicacies know people want to get access to the king's Delicacies but Daniel purpose in his heart that when he see the king's Delicacies the purpose in his heart was more powerful than the attraction of the king's Delicacies this is not thing you need to pay for is being offered to him the king's Delicacies meant it was prepared for the king you know how much people want to eat like the King live like the king be like the king you know how much discipline and conviction you must have to see food going to the king and say I don't want it anybody with me purpose in your heart friends to be a Christian purpose in your heart to be a real man a real woman we have so few of them the one or two that do it stand out but always said years ago the difference between ordinary and extra extraordinary is just the extra because so many people are ordinary just a little extra make it extra ordinary we live in such a world of mediocrity and complacency and accepting things as they are that the moment you do one or two or three things different you breaking records anybody tonight you could break records tonight your faith could break a record tonight your confidence could break a record tonight your joy could hit a new level on the on the on the measuring scale tonight your confidence in the Lord could hit a whole new level on the confidence scale tonight your sleep could be better tonight on the confidence scale because your hope and your trust and your faith is in the Lord I don't know if this is helping somebody tonight but I believe it I believe it is could you take some more what are you purposing in your heart because if you have a purpose in your heart towards your family towards your work we've said it before we this is a an an interesting conversation to be at the beginning of 2025 because half of the people who had New Year's resolution and bring it break it already how you people who set their hearts to do certain things that don't go through the window know already but if you purpose in your heart that this year you want to serve God like you've never did before and it's a purpose in your heart and you approach every day I salute you for being here tonight I salute you for not taking it for granted I salute you for being diligent and aggressive about your heart about your the destination of your soul all right so let's jump to our substantive scripture tonight Daniel 3 and we will spend the rest of the session there by the grace of God so here we we we jump in The Narrative of the story in Daniel Daniel 3 finds us in a very interesting spot we're in the Book of Daniel but in the entire of this chapter of Daniel 3 Daniel is not here Daniel is noticeably absent because the picture of this narrative does not include Daniel and that is interesting because if you look at the Book of Daniel Daniel is the main character and I it almost speaks interestingly that here it is because many of us if the main character is there there's a boost there's a confidence we roll in the pastors around the the leaders around the captain of the ship when you see the captain like there's there there are times you know you you're on a plane and you see the captain walk the aisle if ever experience the captain of the plane or the pilot walk the aisle you're G nervous like there is the the the autopilot that they has put the plane on but you get a little nervousness when you see the pilot walking the aisle eating food because the question I have is who is flying the plane because if the pilot is not in the cockpit who is flying the plane so there's always a comfort when the lead or the main persons around but in this chapter 3 of Daniel the word Daniel doesn't even appear Nebuchadnezzar the King Daniel 3:1 made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits which is around 90 ft that's massive and the bread thereof of six Cubit which is 9 ft that's massive and he set it on the plane of dura in the province of Babylon so it's a incredible structure his tree would tell us that this would not have been solid gold more than likely it was a wooden structure overlaid by gold then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which neb the king had set up so this here is idolatry at its maximum it have small idols and it have big Idols this is a massive Idol and the king in the spirit of idolatry calls for basically based on this description every possible leader whether in government in the police whether in the Army whether in the Judiciary wherever you are from the captain look look at the prince royalty the governors which is govern to the captains military the judges that's Judiciary to the treasurers that the Ministry of Finance to the counselors well that could be anything all kind of different things to the the sheriffs all the rulers to come to the dedication so everybody who has any kind of title anybody who above a certain pay grade is in this thing then the princes the governors and it's repeating it the captains the judges they giving you a context of how serious and how much attention they place on idolatry I if there's a lesson to get here I want you to understand the level of attention being placed to idolatry because this is what is being described here in his purest sense here we're dealing with worship being set up is really worship we talk about the Hebrew boys didn't bow down but here it is there a dedication service and all of the dignitaries are being brought here then the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then an Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people Nations and languages that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute half sackbut Soldier dulmer and all kinds of music he fall down and worship so we always say bow down but I want you to look at the word choice here follow and worship the golen image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and whoo fth not down and worship it shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace so here we have a situation where there's a call for worship but there's also a consequence of non worship here we have a whole set of attention to the instrumentation the music there's a call and response so when you hear music behave a certain way I find it's just an interesting parallel because here we are in Trinidad here now and we about to go into the carnival SE season call and response is a big part of Carnival everybody put up your hand everybody do this everybody jump everybody wave every call and response there's some music there's a behavior that's expected it's worship everybody with me tonight so I want you to understand that what we go through now and go through here is nothing new you know it's the same spirits that set things up here you have a stage you have a idol you have people getting told whenever you hear the music start stop what you're doing and worship and if you don't worship you're going to the fire the very hour let's go whosoever fth not down and worship it shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace verse 7even therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute hap sackbut Sury and all kinds of music all the people the Nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up verse 8 wherefore at that time certain charans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever you have to admire how this approach these days say oh King live forever thou oh King has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cornet flute H sack but Sury and dulma and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and who so fth not down and worship it that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews and you know the prophet speaks about seron upstream and being at rainbow trout and going against the grain and the the fact is the moment you don't line up with what the enemy want there's somebody out there trying to disrupt your day disrupt your life interrupt it so so here it was this is not the king notice this is this is there are certain Jews whom thou Hast set over the Affairs so so these brothers are solid Brothers they are in positions of influence and they just have business with the King degree Hallelujah he said there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mesach and Abednego these men so these these certain Jews you know you know there are people who talk a certain way there are people who are like what going on and when you dig and dig is already one person or two people people who like to speak for like I hear a word like a few people already like when you're dig and diger dig is one person so here there are certain Jews who you know already lining up and when and as you say here when he Magus is really Shadrach Mish and abedo these these men these men oh King have not regarded thee in other words these men in the amplify says pay no attention to you I love it they serve not thy Gods nor worship the gold image which thou has set up friends I want to encourage you tonight no matter how high you rise in business in career in society in living in this terrestrial plane here let this be the description that they say about you that you pay no attention to the things of the world you do not serve their gods you do not worship their golden images our God is a living God he not a stationary static God it don't take a bit of music is our God don't need music to trigger worship we can worship anytime any place under any condition the hour cometh and now is when true worshippers will worship we don't need a call and a response to worship he deserves worship all the time this God is talking about does only get worship when they play all them lists of instruments anybody with me tonight verse 13 then nebuchad in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Misha and abedo now now this is interesting because this speaks volumes I want to pause here for a minute it is very evident because the king broke his own law here I want us to catch just for a minute because according to the Constitution the same time you don't bow you're supposed to go into the fire the fact that these men had to come to the king men they had to seek the king's permission as well in other words these men had to be so valuable in state in government in leadership that they had to tread carefully around them I want us to understand the context of the setup the conditions that had to exist here if you read in narrative they said the moment you don't bow there had to be a condition where they were standing there they didn't bow and they felt cautious we can't just lck them men up in know because we don't know how King will respond if he hear Shad Mish go get burned I want us to understand the context here the it is very clear the lawmakers of the day could not have taken immediate action on these stream men are you so valuable that people have to tread carefully around you did anybody catch that even the king himself I want us to understand this if the King was just going by the letter of the law he said well if you have anybody who didn't bow burn them but the Bible is saying here that the king in his rage and fury he had a choice at that time to send them to birth he commanded to bring them in other words he wanted to reason with them the only time you reason with somebody who goes against your role your rule of law because they are important to you and look at the conversation then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach mesach and Abednego do you not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up and the King goes on almost to plead for them now if ye be ready that at what time you hear the sound of The Corned flute half sagbut Sultry and DOA and all kinds of music you fall down worship the image which I have made well in the Amplified it basically says uh but if you do uh that if you are ready when you hear the sound of all the instruments which have made very good in other words the king is saying if you're ready now I want you to catch if ready now music I have a problem we could let byon be by guns but what is represents is the enemy trying to figure out if there's a way to still get you to worship the idol in know and he follows that with well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that God I like that question he say who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands and I always say this God is a defender of his name the moment you challenge somebody challenge you they're challenging God and when they challenge God God is very well able to defend himself verse 16 we're almost done Shadrach mesak and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter in the amplify that also says we do not need to answer you on this point in other words we don't owe you or response on this matter in other words the purpose in our heart is you might value US you might have position rank quality you know our resume but on this matter on this particular matter on this particular issue if it's the way the water and the electricity and the things and all the other things that's a different conversation but on this matter when it comes to worship on this matter when it comes to my God on this matter when it comes to to to to to who I God we are not careful to give you any kind of response if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not and I think if it's anything we could hold on to because this now is fate at a different level because many of us we say our God will deliver and if we don't see signs of it we starting to think our approach but these brothers were rooted and their purpose was strong and said if not be it known unto thee Oh King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up and I think as Believers we have to go beyond the we will not bow down to to if not in other words you have to be prepared for the consequence of If You Don't See a sign of Deliverance you still standing your ground because they were prepared to pay the price for their conviction and that's in challenge with many of us we are not prepared to pay the price of our conviction we are not prepared to say if God doesn't show up I am not moving from my conviction anybody with me verse 19 then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury and the form of his Visage changed against Shadrach m going AB B go and this is something interesting here because this is more than just his face change it is almost as if his his whole view of them changed it's almost like he was seeing them for the first time anybody with me he knew these men these men served in his Palace but it's like he start to see them for the very first time recognizing these men are not with me you know they were their God therefore he spake at that point now bear in mind at this point he didn't send them out with the music to Bow that's their response their response to his word is what made him give the order everybody W with me therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was one to be heated meaning seven times hotter than usual and I've preached this before and he commanded the most Mighty Men his elite soldiers his very best of the best that were in his army the Bible said he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army his top people to bind Shadrach Meshach and ameno and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach mishak and abedo in other words the very best of the King's Men died trying to put Shak mesak Ando into the fire the king lost his most elite soldiers because he was playing with the wrong ones verse 23 and I want to underscore that friends you see when Moses said the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more you will realize the enemy doesn't know when to stop you in the situation with the Egyptians they drive straight into the water and were swallowed up here it is the king underestimated these Hebrew boys and underestimated their God underestimated the situation and he lost his best men and these three men shadra mesach and abedo fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors and Rising he has a small little secret about life did not we cast listen all of up to this point is only the king all of a sudden when things start to go wrong he look around to these men around him did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire all of a sudden it shift from the King's Command to we are the ones responsible for this Fiasco the nature of humans to blame somebody right did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said to the king true oh King he answered and said l i see four men loose Lord help us walking in the midst of the fire so this was not the Tre boys there tied up and and the fourth man standing up they were having brother Powell a whole Fellowship in the fire the Bible said they were walking in the midst of the fire this wasn't standing up hoping this thing this fire sto hoping this thing work up these brothers end up having a whole after service Fellowship as it were I would love to hear the conversation they were having in the fire what the whole concept of walking in the midst of your fire having faith in the midst of your fire can the church say amen he see and then said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach me isak and Abednego ye Servants of the most high God if is one thing you have to acknowledge is the transformation at least in verb verbage or wording of the king I can't speak to whether his heart was changed but that experience of seeing that here the king's conversation after this he came and spake in the Shad M Ando ye Servants of the most high God come forth and come hether then Shadrach mesach and Aben came forth from the midst of the fire and the princes Governors and captains and the King's counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power my my my my my my my can I say that again on Whose bodies of fire had no power you mean that you could live such alive that the fire have no power over your body that sickness have no power over your body that doubt have no power over your body that unbelief have no power over your body that depression have no power over your body they were witnesses that the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head sin so it wasn't as not a here had neither were their coats changed so they had the same clothes on that they went on with nor the smell of fire had passed on them church when you walk through the fire he'll be there with you this is taking it to a whole Next Level because some of us when we think about this we think well when I walk to the fire God is with me but you still will see I was burnt these brothers were not burnt when you walk through the fire with God nobody even knew you were in the fire until they talk to you until they experience a change you until they feel the strength of your character because friends walking to the fiery furnace many of us or some of us might say well King here this I will bow know because as they got closer to the fire brother popwell they start to feel the heat you know seven times hotter it is amazing to me how these three brothers kept walking together that we didn't hear about the three Hebrew boys who became two that one decide to stop walking and start to scream and say I want to go back home and I go bow down all night because I don't want to thisp fire they were they were purpose in their heart that they're not going to bow down they did not know the outcome can I say that again they had no idea how this was going to play out they did not know if God is going to come but they were prepared if God didn't come and the way God came was beyond the best way they could have even thought it was because here it was their bodies the fire had no power there was no hair of their head singed neither were their coats ex change not the smell of fire had passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach mesach and Abednego who had sent his Angel this is deep because this King that to speak about certain things that that that he really shouldn't know about he had sent his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and change means to refuse the king's word and yielded their bodies that yield their bodies means surrender their bodies meaning they were willing to pay the price are you willing to pay the price of sacrifice that they might not serve no worship and a and a and a see the differ say words serve no worship any God except their own God friends if there's an idol in your life on the 10th of January 2025 it's time to cast it down if you have been bowing complying yielding responding to Idols Idols could be money it could be people it could be things it could be technology we have preached many times you can make anything your God you could even make a spirit your God you could make depression your God you remember that man who was beating up ministers in the days of the prophet and when he came in the prophets meeting the ministers ran out the platform and he Prophet stood there and he said you're going to fall over my feet and when the police officers came they say is there any help for him or whatever and he Propet say he worship he worshiped the spirit you can worship anything but here it is the king is able to identify and I my encouragement to you as a prepare to close out this session with a few verses Left let it be said about you that under no circumstances will you serve or worship anything else but the true God verse 29 therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything a Miss against the god of Shadrach mesach and abedo shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made down hill because there is no other God listen to The King's words now there is no other God that can deliver after this s in the amplifi it says it there is no other God who is able to save him this way he said is the way he said this way after this sort the way this God operates there's there's no comparison there's no other God who could save like this God then verse 30 the king promoted Lord help us promoted Shadrach mishak and abendigo in the province of Babylon so after this whole thing them fellas leave this experience with a higher job a higher pay a higher position you could imagine the respect in their jobs when they say you was the one in the fire who never get burn nobody could challenge your pay at that point you know nobody can challenge your office at that point no because people know at that point your God is a mighty God nobody Crossing Shad Mig and abedo after that experience because they know that their God fight for them can the church say Amen we need to live such a life that people know that your God is on your side can we say that one more time people must know that your God is on your side he said if you stand for me I'll stand for you he said my people shall never be ashamed well we thank the Lord for tonight and for his word and for his grace and I pray that in some way that you take some lessons out of this in closing because this is the common theme between both Daniel and the Hebrew boys they clearly purposed in their heart if you take anything from this tonight Beyond dealing with the reality that fires a part of our experience in the message the handwriting on the wall brother bam said and Daniel was going to purpose in his heart he would be true to God and God's word and while he was down there the Lord could use him why could he use Daniel because had purposed in his heart and if you want to be used of God is there anybody who wants to be used of God tonight if you want to be used of God purpose in your heart that you love him and serve him and everything will be fine I want to read that one more time why could he use Daniel because he had purpose in his heart if you want to be used of God purpose in your heart that you will love him and serve him and everything will be fine can we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for these many examples in scripture and we could take day after day meeting after meeting and never exhaust Lord what you have placed in the word to encourage us with different situations and Lord just coming to this session tonight and thinking about fire and thinking about trials and thinking about testings and situations and Lord there's such a cry among the people for so many things to know that we could have a comfort and peace in you and if we could just purpose in our heart to serve you everything would be fine Lord we thank you for the inspiration and we thank you for those who have gone before that we could look back and take faith and courage we pray dear God that you would strengthen your people tonight every brother every sister every man every woman every child every Young Brother every young sister Lord that we could withstand the attacks and the Ws of the evil one and we could stand in our day Lord and knowing that we will not bow down we will not worship any other God and even if you don't deliver father we will still stand our ground knowing that you are faithful and true and knowing that you put us here for a purpose may you Lord touch every heart every life if there's any backslider who has connected tonight may you restore their Joy their peace their experience in you Lord the psalmist David Cried Out Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation many of us we have found ourselves bowing down to all kinds of things that have nothing to do with you and over time it may have seemed small then it became something more and something more and something more and then we fell away from our first love father May restore us to your our first love may restore us to commitment to dedication to consecrated Lives May the fathers take their position the mothers take their position the young people take their position the officers take their position father may as Sons and Daughters We Stand our ranks father at stand at attention when the world says do this we are standing at attention when the world says do that we are not moving we are not going to respond in that way because that's not who we are they could change to our name they can label us anything they want to but we know who we are calling us something doesn't change us the seed in US speaks for us Lord give us the faith the courage Lord even when Jesus was here he told Peter Peter I've prayed for you that your faith fail not and so many Believers Lord their faith have fallen weaken but Lord there's a prayer that you pray that Lord our faith will not fail that you said the devil has desired to sift us as wheat to shake appears a right it's his his desire to do these things to discourage us to move us but father may you strengthen us father May healing rain pour out tonight into every home Healing Rain Lord not just for physical healing it's important but healing of our mind healing of anxiety healing of stress healing of confusion Lord May a spirit of love and forgiveness and Lord dropping of arts and removal of grudges Lord Lord and a peace that knowing that Lord you give us good rest tonight Lord and Lord the weekend and Sunday for the two services so we could worship you because there's nothing more important there's nothing more valuable there's nothing more critical Lord and making sure our heart is right we could we could mess up doing a lot of different things but Lord we don't want to mess up with our souls Lord and to be encouraged through this word tonight Lord to be the best ambassadors you said Lord through your Prophet we are your advertisement boards father that the world must see
