shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord as I come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in monkeys I'm and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord had said and the remnant whom the Lord shall we learn from Luke chapter 4 with in verse 17 and they were delivered unto him talking about Jesus the book of the Prophet is ass when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord may God bless his word he may be seated or praise God appreciate the service on Sunday oh praise God what a tremendous message that last three killed with Anthony and that particular court means a lot to me I feel a commission right inside of deer under that last great kill surely there's a crop somewhere and I'll be bringing back that cool tonight surely there's going to be a crop somewhere so tonight our title and it's on the scripture from Joelle the title is I will pour out my spirit this is going to speak and have an inspiration come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again and this is actually a direct quote from the Prophet so the title is I will port my spirit inspiration come back to the original inheritance to real Holy Ghost again now this here is direct prophecy I will pour my spirit before we read that for marine Lateran you will eat and be satisfied you'll be eaten plenty I will pour my spirit upon all flesh the Spirit is the ring what God is saying they grab seats and the rain is gonna fall and every seat gonna bring forth after its kind o glory they're so brilliant Brannon Keenan put seeds and that those seeds goes let's see this way out of a group of the seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride so they I see them their true seed so the true seed that was released by that prophet out of his mouth original seed spoken word but the Tipsy that original seed going to bring forth after in sky the spirit is guaranteed to pour out you're not wondering we're not poor bill this is dusty at the Lord the spirit is guaranteed it's very already filled is if you prepare for it if you have to see for it but I can guarantee you I will part my spirit saith the Lord nothing will stop it hallelujah not even unbelievers stop it this is what God said nothing but to hinder it hallelujah this I will pour my spirit is directly connected to I will restore all the years that the cankerworm and the caterpillar under Lucas because the world had to be restored before the spirit could be restored the restoration of the word make provision for the restoration of the spirit or glory to god ii himself didn't want the wood to be connected together and god spaces without to seven angels knowing in the last age he was in a profit that's gonna restore all things and once all things is restored we could go back to the original which is the original Pentecost which is back to the original church which is back to the alfaab right once we go back to the Alpha bride we are ready to face the rapture the Millennium the wedding supper but we have to one pick up what they had so he sent a prophet maternal hats back to the faith of the fathers it was it the faith back there which is your personal faith or glowing of God the resurrection feet and that feet have to be on the earth and Jesus say when the son of man comment or give the Lord a shout tonight shall we find faith on the earth would you be able to answer that question shall we find faith earlier put that faith in you I says want to be in you because course enough profit to bring your heart and to till in life back to the faith of the fathers or glory to God me in four exciting times when every time I come to church you never know when the Spirit will come to the temple when Jesus will come to the house you never know when this day is your day or glory of God he found the place where it was written Oh blowing I thought he was reading about himself he placed his self in the scripture or give the Lord a show tonight or glory like water when Jesus came the first time he came to declare the acceptability of the Lord and that TSA of Jubilee are you of deliverance a year of release and if Jesus coming in he must let you believe again the freest people from sin from punished from sickness all I'll write this trail once more there'll be one more I'm Oh blowing it for Jesus ask for the ride the trail do you believe that - Oh glory to God hallelujah so tonight I'm going forward and preaching we be doing some reflection on the Azusa revival that came in the Azusa Street 1906 we'll be looking back again and summarize what happened back there because something supernatural happened back there and God brought the atmosphere before he sent the Prophet he made the atmosphere trouble 1906 become profit was coming and I probably have to bring the world in the atmosphere and the Pentecostal revival the Brico back you know 6 it was God sent it must call ordained it was got inspired and up to know it influenced the entire world Oh glorious God and God took one man can use that man in such a mighty away Oh glory they've all gone using for looking for many that he could use in a mighty way Oh glory to God so when God called him out he provided my lamb he provided a manna from heaven he provided a rock to drink from they were thirsty he provided a brass serpent to heal them when I was sick I would all an act and I never even discovered I know discover something they wanted a theological experience I never realized the ology could give them experience Oh hallelujah jail of a theological experience another Holy Ghost experience a geologic experience is an intellectual experience whoa girl when your mind gets stimulated go glory that God the Holy Ghost experience is your destiny little more glory to God so watch they wanted a theological experience so they could have something to fuss and organize and break themselves up so this is what the teal as she does I better than Hugh Amerasian and you I see in industry you seen it our way and we a giri first like geology that's the same thing that happened to a Pentecostal fathers over 40 years ago God call a man in California a Negro man one cross I give him the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and from there form Azusa Street be all Azusa Street mission till it scattered to instruct the whole nation from nation to nation after nation until Pentecostal revival was built in everywhere what a blessed God was provided by grace many of them couldn't write their own names some of them come to church and ranks they walked on the rail or truck and pick up handful of porn be the modern attract little models to feed their children so the husband could preach the gospel they wander about they were made fun of they were must call Holy Roller spent all night in jail they have to be some of them they wanted to put them an instant institution listen they were crazy God had provided for them one of the greatest revival that this nation has ever known I don't care when it was there has never been a revival like the Pentecostal Reviver Wesley never had it Spurgeon Calvin Knox great Roma's they never had a revival by the Pentecostal revival it's the greatest thing that struck the earth since the Holy Ghost fell honor their Pentecost OBE lorina God give the Lord some praise [Music] that man Seymour I'm fine before that Reviver breakout he was praying for five hours every day for two and a half years yet such I'm looking for prayer such a hunger in for God so Britney was they were steeped in prayer and that's how I want the church there was breathing prayer the

praise God let's press the reset button and cancel everything you think you know because what you don't know you don't know what you don't know cancel everything that you know or glory not because where we go and we have not been there before or give the Lord a shout the prophet said you don't know what power but power is coming he said you haven't seen power yet so let's talk let's talk tonight Oh hallelujah you haven't seen how are you when the anointing struck the elephant revival they can feel it blocks away people will fall along in the street because of the power of God the most boys toys and bigger people will come over preachers with your ties and they straighten up and when they come soda and smacking to look what's going on the poor garbage strike them down and they'll leave their broken lamp men on the floor it wasn't something to look at it wasn't something to look at it was something to receive and that revival is coming back the Holy Ghost is coming back that's

trinny you have to be converted from you need to become like him hallelujah something of harmony inside it's a conversion by his spirit he said not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord Oh glory to God hallelujah my world shall return unto me void but it shall accomplish a purpose I said it won't accomplish he sent his word that cross the warm touch bench he sent this word for us to be filled with the spirit he sent teachers to teach us the way to put seasoned us why that the Spirit come upon them seeds not to teach us that we get educated not the teachers that we get PhD

couldn't work no more they're speaking in other tongues equipment power who was all over them it was equipment power they were saturated with blood it was saturated with the spirit it was so much in them that when they lay hands on the sick the sick have to recover because power was coming true them how I was vibrating through them and Jesus selling us one it you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you we have a promise Regan you have a promise of dynamics same spirit same word dynamics to the mechanics Oh glory to God mind my mind are we gonna get you this tonight my Jesus but about say whether we make our mistake like Israel did we couldn't get along going away the Holy Spirit was leading us we have to add something to cause unbelief to comment if Israel would have went ahead following the way the Lord was leading within two weeks they had been in the promised land two weeks ten to forty years they almost did just two weeks and the in the land and because unbelief came in God sender forty years not only seven forty years you know judge them that they're not going to hear it and the people that came out going on 100 you're winning on your children not you God put judgment on a whole generation and say your seed have to use what go cross wrong not one of you to learn Mexico I say the same God that brought two million people of the symbol that church them I told a Mexico his sink or the pink note in this mess if you touch this message seemed quarter this message not a different one hello the same one another different one on the bring my mother Egypt and he touched them and when Jesus came on the scene they said our fathers if my levelness Jesus still live and dear everyone dead and that dead means separated from God somebody sent me a quote about people ministers and different not even saved not even saved nice people good people not even saved they come into church I come with the church I come to church this is the calling of God this is the election of God the predestination of God the hearts has subdued something and if the Pentecostal church would have move on in the spirit the way God or dealing to go and had already proved that he was in it we work we would have been living in the Millennium and he said the Bible Corinthians says these things happen for in examples whom the end of the wolves are coming now we could learn from these guys learn from their failures mean from the attitudes leans on the arrogance and pride that we don't follow their way then that's what we here for to learn from them that we don't do what they do because God touch them what happened to this group we couldn't go on being led by the spirit in a group of believers we have to have something to talk a name unto us we wanted to make an organization they have formed and made it somebody got a revelation that somebody only baptized any man Jesus Christ in Jesus instead a family goes what happened they make an organization called a pee-pee JC and different ones one coming on a horse one coming on a cloud and that's where you make your mistake that is where you're horribly sin why didn't you leave it alone if that's named Jesus and all the things you cut wasn't right God say every pant that my Heavenly Father wasn't planted and rooted up he said it will come to naught if it is not good if it is not God it will come to naught but if it is of God who will stop it who was top this bride who was the move of God who was top what I want to do my spirit I am convinced when the spirit move it shuts up everything do you mean I can say casanov God a healing God a resurrection God who wanna stop that God when the is walking when the brain is seeing when the death is here and when the Thomas speakin when cancer diesel or and I'm

Pentecost going back to the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] if it's not leave it alone let God be the ruler but we have to organize oneness to nest rhiness broke up fussing one little group we are the biggest being a minority real a majority we at this we got the best we got more money because more missionaries we are not divided we shouldn't be all one body we when I hope on in doctrine one entirety Israel wanted the same thing God with them with him they come to Samuel s this time will give us the King because we see fellas thanks I want this one I want I wanna will be one one we want to see we want a king Samuel King what a man you want a pope you want a prospector you want somebody's a hehehehe hissing man we have the man of the hour and God told Samuel good get him a king he said they have not rejected you they rejected me God knocking must come in dice David he said a walking give him one and that's holy catch sadder with Saul who started good and end up being drenched when cause had enough attacked enough because Samuel was gonna pour oil any maintainer pointed King goat say listen forget II yes who even weep for him Golda Jesse and anoint one of his sons to be king over Israel hallelujah Gordo God anointed gun pore over here Eddie I have a representative go and anoint a son of Jesse anointed king he going to anoint David who not even ready he's going to anoint David who still young you're going to anoint David who have just potential you're gonna anoint David who not even have thinking about kingship and thinking about Ron David G he couldn't anoint him but what God put on you can't stop it has to come to his fulfillment it has to come it to his accuracy what God put to you must come to his greatness don't you give up on God he's not going to give up on you there is something brought upon your life nor devil to change it and God Himself not gonna cancel it or give the Lord a shout but the yelling I said not definitely change it God not going to cancel it or hallelujah the Spirit of God is upon me said Jesus for he had anointed me or Chloe does not appreciate gospel oh my god I shall come to pass God went to pour out your spirit upon you the progress that no church could hold the Holy Ghost but individuals or catalana show individuals that all individuals can hold the Holy Ghost you can feel it you could have it you can receive it it could come into you that's your promise you won't have somebody that half PhD we have some of these great titles and so forth to make us somebody to look up to now the rest of the presidency where they fuss and fighters chew out of the corner of the feather of the hat it's a disgrace it brings unbelief the Bible said and butter brown I'm going back to the wood now watch how it goes to the Scriptures the Bible says how can you have feet when you are regards one to another how can you do it when you try to say that this trip man is in we have to listen to him the bishop is in we have to listen to him the first picture is in we have to listen to him trying to be somebody in your organization you can't do it and have faith in God because they have to look down man let's look for some kind of headquarters but when you're connected to this power source of the Holy Ghost you have to look down on man you're looking to the leadership of the Spirit because the spirit is sent to guide said the Spirit of Truth won't leave you and gave you into all truth particular Asha it's not the spread of air it's the spirit of truth it was released it was sent to guide you into all truth all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my mom said I often made this remark I find out two classes of people in the world that's Pentecostal for one unfunded mental think about just to the fundamental people positionally know what they are in Christ by the promise of the Bible but they haven't received the Holy Ghost to know to have faith so they have acknowledged the information that it consciousness but not the faith now we take faith to produce an atmosphere because take fate our expectation when will reveal the Simeon given an expectation he's old man they say if he slip under fixed in a fallen grief I just making an expression here he has there already but God revealed to him you shall not see death until you see the Christ so you can tell about God I could almost hear let me go and buy a coffin for you you can see we won't see me and not enough see man I get an frightened Grim Reaper didn't wink I hope my buddy hope scholar whatever it is he has nothing to do with that because God told him you shall not see death so he pushing that aside until I see the Christ I can't even talk to me that I even come near me until I see the Kranks he could swim through that he could cross over that he could jump over that because God said you have to see the Christ and every day going to the temple waiting on the same Holy Ghost that came upon him that revealed after him until in the expectation when Mary passed the Holy Spirit so that's the one I see one that's the one spirits talking right there Mary is there and to confirm it is right blind manner she can't see nobody no he see that you spirit leave him come on did the Lord of song visit this for sure is called a blind woman she's coming through she's brain and she stopped right binary God could lead a plane [Applause] oh my god I feel inspired tonight Oh bloggers will be talking about going to lead a blind woman keep her promise on the hour did you know what I said coralina blind person to the promise of the Messiah will come suddenly to his temple what if he comes tonight one of the Holy Ones come to you tonight be ready to be fundamental nor the promise of who they are but if I receive the Holy Ghost to have faith the Pentecost our people receive the Holy Ghost but it renewed yeah so like a man got money in the bank and don't know how to write a check any other one could write a check and hasn't got no money Demark if you could get you two together money and signature then you can withdraw Oh hallelujah so then let's continue if the Pentecostal people could settle themselves I said last night I actually believe with all my heart the Pentecostal church was in a better condition in those days you all's retreat meetings that you speak of so much I've read books of the early Pentecostal church 30 40 bucks years was in better condition for the common of the Lord than right now they rarely was right down to good Christians they lived it and they believed it they lived it and believe that we don't have the old-time Pentecostal that used to die out and really come true with God that real genuine feat they just got act called monument or no went on so forth today God can come down and shame said miraculously right among the people everything and I say well I just guess like this very well you know Graham says you know you had too much teaching I never taught us out that I never even knew had that much it taught so well that is taught of the feet so the common did know what taught it unknown another would become ever more towards you say you have too much teaching looking for new light so afterwards you same promise this fine piece of steel so then they want new revelations studied manner to bring up all connecting and then afterwards they get a connection a line connected to be pit I'm no see I'm mushi first after bring up some things on here boy and if you don't watch it and you know what's that word your figure is God but just Lucy with his tricks again bringing up revelations normal knowledge listen to me sis it's in here's a factor so the shake so you see you anymore you have anymore teachings and all she was to see it was God said she don't eat of that tree potential and what shall I concept so he said the daily eat the day we die hallelujah I ain't touching that tree get behind me Satan Paul said if I angel come down from heaven I'm preach any other gospel Paul went and see I come back and preach something different than I preached originally you say forget it let me be accurst or give the Lord a shout in the house or glory to God we have to stay with the original women because the original word is arisen on season and that is what the rain coming for or God the Lord Ashok I love him tonight I'm going to steer this thing I am NOT gonna move because I know he will pour out his spirit spirit gonna work it could happen tonight or going it can happen now you see if the power is to come among people it would be mitad prayer it's maybe the grace of God it could happen tonight it could happen now it could happen to you Oh give the Lord a shout have faith in God tonight I'm number two people here I'll preach this week doesn't matter who is here well glory to god I'm wrong with an expectation because God is caught tonight if God is God shows him that the gonna answer by fire that part be caught tonight he's the word of action all glory that God is a God of movement he's a God of War he's a goner Ronnie's he's one of deliverance sort of healing he's a quarter that struck the trumpet that brings on a jubilee that chip will go free from your pathway from your sin free from your failures Oh glory Nicole you just have to accept it walk out and Chuck the whole go free tonight oh you are too much teaching looking for a new light that's what Eve was looking for when she got her eyes put out just go back to the Bible and stay right where the old trend don't leave the old pathway of the first love the first not come to you live with the Holy Spirit don't get off on some other tantrum stay right with God right in his word and the Holy Spirit will never make you do anything that's contrary to the word the first Steve Wright with the would know the Philistines Andy Sampson what are you going to do about it oh we got greedy nomination we have greater membership than ever before but may is the spirit where is the holy ghost did you choose speaker which is just better this is a condition which is of elders and everything else but we're not ready teacher not where's the book but where is the tapes we have the Bible you have that but where is the spirit where is the Holy Ghost I'm reading that's what the devil has done he would the church window just come to me come to me and I will give you a great big time and I could overhear if you will get rid of that fanatic preach in your gut and get a man a doctor of divinity that got some sense we will build a big change and we'll be like the rest of them he says shame on you I rather have a man didn't know split coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost that was uncompromising by the power of God so they could talk what they want to talk this is what God wants not-not-not on y'know preachers does the sketchy similes evangelists customers but this is and I say what is just is involved the tests teach them the teachers are teaching that the people can

in South Africa which is a local church here because in this period you want to say what is this you know what you do it all the demons have doped before imagine whoa but God put the feet inside here to believe it will be done hallelujah so I believe my commission is dying inside of here what God want me to do God send us another Church tell me for the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come unto her in the demonstrations of the Spirit and this is preaching the gospel not teaching and explaining unrevealing because revelation can come to is it become by written it will be who you are I am the Prime Minister on this that's written that's what I revelation is personal so they posted if I'm mr. Kazama say I am he what is I am II so it have words have manifestation always the revelation but this is specific that the Holy Ghost come in the church with the demonstration of the spirit mark 16 can follow the church acts 2:4 which is the refill in 38 which is the fill it all of it will be followed right along in the church signs and wonders accompany the Apostles what churches accompany apostles and teachings are come signs and wonders was part of the pitch that Wendy with the apostolate Church if we are going back sure we have to have that I wanna say it again we have to have that to vindicate we have been turned back to that because that is where the faith must express which is expressed if we go back to the theater the forest where are the works the father's did put the air shout today on that it's not the teachings of the father's is the faith of the fathers and works express faith show me the works then is a great signs of the his resurrection accompany them while we in person surely God is growing a crop somewhere for that last great kill maybe you my Christian friend here this morning maybe your strength had begun to grow I put up this message this morning out into the land where go I trust this message will bring the spiritual vitamins that will grow our spiritual power back into you life again o me the Samson of God be the truth in heart me those who are longing and crying pleading description look at the description may those who are longing and crying pleading I'm holding on me this day with its Lord until this new crop grows out until there comes forth a joy in Zion that they come for a group that can recognize and understand and that can see the mercy and the hidden powers that is hid from the world that did not understand now God granted that they were sealed before we ask in Jesus name Oh glory to God hallelujah so as we wrap up the the Jubilee Jesus the prophet said he came to the template appreciate September year and precious was busy from his lips and that year was called a jubilee well every man that I've been captivity could go three one hundred the years are past but the same God had sent Jubilees and them days in the same God who sent you beliefs today all the people that have been captured and was in captivity they had come unacceptable here when the trumpet sounded and all the ones that when captivity didn't have to pay any price they could go absolutely go free they could drop their whole they were hoeing whatever instrument they were working with could we go three but that was my choice you have to choose to go free when you hear the trumpet tonight a trumpet is being strong it once the world we preach is a strumpet it's a gospel trumpet Oh glory to God Amen Alleluia if they didn't want to go free then they were taken to the temple and was bought all in the air and then it could never go free again oh my so we find out many of us in these last days this pattern I got to this is important okay in the last days in our organization of Pentecost we have come in and organized ourselves and rejected the lesion of the Holy Spirit by the wisdom of groups of people instead here we go this is instead of having fellowship one with another it's divided us separated us into several different organization of people and in doing so it has blue Oh inheritance he is seeing inheritance get break up by the divisions and kind of a set of foolishness these walls inside if we ever get wall into a place where we can't accept the wooded and the holy spirit and after take the Creed's and so forth of a church instead of the power of the Holy Spirit that you really will never mean nothing to that person no matter how much you can say a mother left you inheritance daddy that your inheritance and whatnot he said but accept dogma that was injected into your fellowship instead of being free in Christ letting the Holy Spirit lead us along back in the age when it will be church was getting together immediately they have to go to organize in and when they did there was afraid that somebody else would be a leader but getting a little group dad issues that came in and then they had to organize these issues if they are left alone let the Holy Spirit read out and bring out and lead in and put in the church will be far too advanced let the Holy Spirit I mean every heavy inspiration and I'm teaching and things not right God but listen God is Guardian abortion God removes people off the ER tenem Boris if things are wrong enough for his purpose in whatever plan you know listen the Lord Himself descending in first Thessalonians for you to get this right you know you think he will let some man man and his wife not this Jesus I'm talking about the Lord Himself this time with a shout for them playing with at them for someone she could only hold church members they will never hold a bride and if they have to cry the bride will come out or blowing up or without key shepherds in the last days or glory that God himself no one man and his family could go back to the original Helen returns if they hear the jubilee trumpet song and know what it meant to them if they heard a priest on the trumpet the minister that trumpet is the gospel they had a privilege to come and receive again their heritage what your loss you go back to it oh my what we lost what they have a Pentecost we going back to Oh inheritors let me read it you see one can especially from the hour of Jubilee okay our Pentecostal experience years ago we find we have walled up ourselves away from that so far that we got to hear what somebody see instead of Gloucester the Lord and you can hear the word of God say no is the hour of Jubilee go back come back the way is affirmed come back to your original heritance to the real Holy Ghost again remember he could go free he didn't have to be nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go just just think about it you could get up tonight and go free go and sin no more son of man set free is free indeed cleany asleep IKEA sleep what if he knew the song of the trumpet but he had to know the song on the trumpet for thee as sons of God no faith come by hearing here in the Word of God when we hear that we are free and refused to act upon our freedom then we shall be sealed away from God to receive the mark of the peace for to hear is to receive when we hear we are free then we can accept it oh my when the here at the Jubilee song and he didn't want to be free sealed away from the kingdom he said today in celebration of the Holy Ghost revival that we used to have musician how a piece I hear or father's talk about or the Indians came down and sang in the meetings and the power of God taken over the Saints were born again and things happen and it come from an old-fashioned sky blue cynical and preaching all Sassafrass type men did not know the ABCs but a note Christ I've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that is what we hunger for today is an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost and a pouring out of God's blessing back to the old line again if the devil has took you captive it is Jubilee time it is time to come back to the OL experience again back to the old-fashioned Bible back to the place where we can feel the power of God Church true that will call heaven to the altar that will make them stay on your face all night long and pray to God and seek for deliverance what a time what we need today is a color note I'll pull it out I'll pull it out jubilee old-fashioned revival is what we need or are we painting to Calvary what we need is to revive what's exactly what we need a good old-fashioned revival Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God if you want in Azusa Street return just lead them and be shaved all the way down with the Word of God Oh hallelujah stop kickin stop fussing become a sheep becoming a lamb get shaved I know it's a privilege it belongs to you because you were born as sin she iniquity comin all speak a nice but will be forfeited and become a lamb the lamb was not grumble ax the Bible said he opened not his mouth when he was reviled reviled again that's the reason the dove could see on him but us let someone do something against us we got hot in the collar the Dove take is flight the Holy Spirit leaves and many times you wonder why we can't have that peace we used to have Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah but in order to be around before fee that is right in order to die in your stead he was alone you say brother Branham what is the way back to the old fashioned meetings just become lambs again just get back to being a sheep the Dove hasn't gone very far he's just missing a chance to get back the road back to Azusa Street there's a place back back to the Azusa Street meetings again it's a return to a land me Tia you can't expect a wolf or any scavenger and i SPECT that over peace to dwell in you he won't do it you've got to become a lamb your nature has got to be changed and if you look at things different you wouldn't fuss at the preacher when he preaches this trick old-fashioned Holy Ghost religion you will just get rid of that word spirit or a scavenger spirit and get the lamb nature and you're ready for with all the things that you've once done all your worldly privilege that's true as I'm standing there Christian friends humble yourselves don't try to know it all see how much it can forget that what you know is the best thing only know one thing and that's Christ when the assumes has tree people home by themselves and became ours the Holy Spirit came in he will do that this very minute right in this building if we would be willing to pay something so if we willing to forfeit all the so-called we have to humble ourselves and become lambs and look how this message people get so arrogant because they have a few extra knowledge then nobody Pope you know what room nobody sees and what in lamb or whatnot and they can get a good fellowship a good hug I gotta love you oh my and then he talked to destroy about his slave bruger came by the plantation they noticed one young man he walked with his chest up chin up
