word of prayer this morning and before we pray i do want to remember our precious sister coming and prayer as well and the family and the believers at third exodus assembly and our brother vin and on the transition from the earthly to the heavenly of sister ceto it's not an easy situation and it's a pastor's wife so we want to pray for the church the family as well and as we open this service this morning purchase bar heads oh gracious heavenly father we have come into your house lord we have lord gathered in your name to worship you lord we have made a choice we have made a decision lord to break out of our routine as it were and to acknowledge you as our god as our king as our master as our leader as our father each of these words carry its own weight and its meaning to us lord and we don't have the words to thank you for being all of these and more to us we thank you for preserving us we thank you for guiding us we thank you for leading us we thank you for bringing us safely into your house of worship that we can give you praise as the psalmist david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord so we are glad this morning lord both to be here and lord for those that could not be here for some reason and are connected lord that they would lord make their sanctuary where they are at lord that the holy ghost the presence of the almighty god can move in where they are at as we know you are here already lord because your word teaches that where they are two or three gathered in your name you are there in the midst of them lord not only this but there's a special unction and anointing that follows the sacred word upon which we stand firmly and we are resting on this lord the same gospel that goes all the way back to as the prophet would say we preach what paul preached so lord we welcome your presence in this place and we thank you for what you have already done and what you're about to do lord we want to remember our precious sister coming in prayer lord on the passing on going home of her sister sister sita lord brother vin's wife and we pray dear god that lord you would bless her and bless brother vin in a mighty way lord and the church stood exodus assembly the saints over there that you would be with them at this time lord now as we approach your sacred word may you bless your people bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding to the scriptures father we dedicate this service to you in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen before we read let's just sing that song [Music] oh we have come into his house [Music] we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship him hallelujah we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship christ all along hallelujah glory worship him worship christ oh lord can we give the lord a hand of praise you appreciate the lord this morning happily even at house of the lord oh we welcome you lord how many appreciate the special service last friday amen i was blessed i was very blessed amen to see god being able to use each one of us and it's we should all have a testimony you know at any point in time we're supposed to have a testimony we have so much to thank god about testify about tell somebody about we all have a testimony if it wasn't for the lord i wouldn't be here this morning if it wasn't for the lord i wouldn't know who i was if it wasn't for the lord who pulled me out who called me who put my name in the book who wrote my name in blood the devil is mad but i in business a sister donald can say i have business if the devil is mad i am so glad because he called me and he called you so i want to salute but the gideon brother stephen for the andy sister donna and brother clarence for yielding yourself to the holy ghost and to be a blessing to the body of believers so at this time let's go to the scriptures of three portions of scripture that we want to read this morning reading from the book of isaiah and also uh in the book of revelation and for a few weeks we have been on a certain road uh in revelation and um beloved speaking there in revelation 10 and then we went you know between revelation 22 and so i just want to kind of pull some things out there still and we certainly appreciate the service last sunday amen i appreciate the pastor this morning amen and i don't often um listen back to messages that i speak but um i was blessed on wednesday night with have we not enough because it's a challenge still a challenge to me and still a challenge to us all with have we done enough you know so i think god has really been kind of directing us in the right way in the right approach both in the live services the bible studies the tapes that are played and even said the service last friday being led by the holy spirit you know because if it's about one person being delivered that's with it all if it's about one person finding out who they are in the mind of god and the purpose of god then it's worth it all so let's read uh we'll start in in isaiah 55 and reading verse 6 seek he the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon you know we have read this scripture many times but i want to highlight something interesting because verse 7 says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord so this wicked man this unrighteous man being described here is not just some random person this is somebody who once had a relationship with god and is being challenged to return to the lord or return unto the lord so so what the scripture is directed at here is not the man who doesn't know god or not interested in god or god didn't write their name down in the book this is a different kind of wicked this is a different kind of unrighteous because for you to return to something you want had to be there you must have to have a relationship first you can't come back to where you never were anybody with me so i want to read it again from that perspective seek ye the lord while he may be found in other words there's a time clock on finding him that when that time runs out you cannot find him anymore anybody with me seek he the lord while he may be found calling upon him while he is near because there'll be a time when he'll no longer be near verse 7 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return because he once was in a better place than he is now but let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him he could only have mercy upon him because of the pre-existing relationship that he had with him because god only came to get those who he had a relationship with by writing their names by predestinating them by calling them can the church say amen and to our god for he will abundantly pardon let us go to the book of revelation 10 and we have been in this for a few weeks but i want to touch on revelation 10 from verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and our final scripture reading revelation 22. [Music] i spoke two weeks ago on this same subject but i want to pull something else out of it revelation 22 we're going to read from verse 10 and he say it unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen certainly a privilege to be in the house of the lord so i do have a title this morning and it is connected to a message i spoke over seven years ago but as i was meditating this came back to me strong so i believe it's for somebody this morning so i have a title do not cross the line final warning do not cross the line final warning and a subject connecting to the subject but over it had last week make your calling and election show and an inspiration time no longer and before i left home this morning i was sharing some things with my wife and i was like you know i think i'll mention it this morning i said you look at the workplace today you look at society today you know and and to do anything in life you need to be inspired to do anything in life that's worth doing you need to be inspired you need to be motivated there needs to be something to drive you to achieve it if somebody has to wake you up in the morning to do what is important then you are not inspired you are not motivated so i was sharing with her you know the reality is my role and i was using it in a natural context is not to motivate people to do certain things because there are people in this world who are motivated and the people who are not motivated it is very difficult to motivate somebody who don't want to be motivated it is difficult to motivate somebody who don't want to achieve and who i don't want to grow and so so it is an effort you have to have a real burden if somebody's supposed to be doing something and you have to encourage them to do what's good for them if you know you're not supposed to eat certain things are you supposed to eat more vegetables i can't be calling every day to motivate you to eat vegetables i could do it for a while but afterward by punch i will get tired because at some point in time you supposed to know this is for your own good at some point in time you supposed to wake up for yourself i'm not needy alarm because you know you have certain things to do when somebody is motivated they can't wait to get up you know if you have something to do if you're excited ever and when people want to fly overseas and think are they excited to go on a trip somebody sent a ticket for you until they come up come up to new york comes and you're excited you could hardly sleep because excitement over here to get up to do something else your dear day wake them up you're telling me you're telling me when you're excited to do something nobody had to wake up you know you're packed three days ago because you can't wait to go you can't wait to experience something new and because of the interest and experience in that nobody has to motivate you you carry your own motivation you carry your own battery nobody to charge you you carry you have your own charger and something really struck me and it's in the natural and it's in the spiritual because the bible says in peter for god give us all things pertaining to life and godliness so a believer who overcomes in the spiritual will overcoming the natural and there's a connection between overcoming in the natural and overcoming in the spiritual it's connected so motivation has to come from within you have to be motivated you have to be inspired to be a christian it cannot be every sunday the preachers have to work up and and praise god and and come when you can make it you don't know yet that you could make it you don't know yet that god called you every sunday you had to be a world cup and a wind up on a let me turn it and get it there we kick start every sunday you need a kick start everything there's jumper cables every sunday is paddles give us some more people who are motivated who are inspired in the natural in the spiritual you can't wait to do what you're called to do you may be seated it's not that motivated people don't have challenges it's not that multi-page people don't have obstacles it's not that things don't go wrong but their motivation and their desire and their inspiration and something in them drives them that no matter what the odds against all odds against all opposition against all challenges against all situations against what the doctor says against what the government said against what your neighbors say against what your boss says against what the devil says it doesn't matter because you are driven from within you don't need somebody on the outside to tell you you can make it you know you can make it you don't need something to tell you you could overcome you know you could overcome even if you're down in the ditch you know you can overcome even though you fell you know overcoming is built in so a motivated son will get back up no matter what goes wrong no matter what happens something on the inside tells you lift up your head square back your shoulder [Applause] more than a conqueror more than an overcomer [Applause] you have to be inspired to smile motivated to smile because sometimes life beats you up and you don't want to smile you don't feel like smiling you don't feel like laughing you don't feel like being positive but something on the inside get you to look above that situation [Music] these struggles of life i don't know why i'm saying this there's nothing on my nose it's not anywhere here but i just woke up this morning saying we need to be inspired because if you're not inspired and you're leaning on somebody else when they're not here you can't stand and we need to stand whether nobody is there or not and it can only stand if you're inspired you can only stand if you have what it takes [Applause] not about looking around who doing what who's saying what who pressing i don't care who person i'm motivated for the rapture listen i ain't cut out for the tribulation you know i'm being honest i'm not built for that i'm not built for that i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna survive in the tribulation so the best thing for me to do is make the rapture [Music] i ain't cut out for that tribulation stress not me i know how much stress i could take that stress not that stress give me this stress that shaped me into the word image so i can manifest perfect love because perfect love is what will take me there rapturing condition anybody with me this morning i will take this stress any day tribulation stress i can't handle that wheeling and wailing and gnashing of teeth i can't handle that [Applause] take me through the test take me to the child take me through the water take me through the flood oh cow come on now somebody help me anybody in the house this morning [Applause] no matter what comes your way you have a choice and that choice inspires you you want to buy a house you have to be motivated the house don't gonna happen it takes a plan it takes a sacrifice it takes effort it takes savings it takes research it takes understanding to make the right decision you have to be motivated to make the right decision in life and in god [Applause] there's a good way there's a better way and there's a perfect way i want us to see the difference you could get away with a good way you know you can get to it a better way but i want the perfect way if there's the best way to do something why do it half-hearted that's what the brandon preach god don't make her free christian with a christian community halfway why it can't be a real hundred percent version a real authentic version a real true version some days every day i don't know why i'm here this morning motivated inspired and you know what helps that you have to love what you do i was saying to my wife some time ago nobody has to wake me up to do my work sometime four o'clock in the morning i'm up working preparing because you know what god put us here to work in them [Music] i said it before there's no scripture for retirement it doesn't exist in the bible there's rest god after seven days rested as the sixth rested he didn't retire he rested if you finish your traditional work your work changed the winning souls your work becomes your prayer your work becomes your worship your work becomes intercession [Applause] your transition from the natural needs to the spiritual ones but they still have a plan because god we went through this in bible studies without a plan what are you without a vision what are you doing you get everyday aimless you have no plan you have no desire where do you die you know now whatever happened happen i do my due i don't walk 10 years so what now so god put yourself float you are a balloon whether you win carrier you float people lose the motivation you have to love the kingdom of god you have to love serving people you have to love being a christian it can be a grudging christian and you're you're forced to walk this journey nobody forcing you god enforcing you you have a choice but if you choose this thing fall in love with it and we have more than enough reasons to fall in love with jesus and i can guarantee you falling in love with jesus is sweeter every day than the day before [Applause] i don't know why i'm saying these things this morning but i don't even who is going to help or how it's going to help [Applause] never forget something where the nico told me he's if you love somebody and and and she in toku and you in porter spain you're gonna find yourself up here you know because that's what love does make you do love does make you do some crazy things lovers make it a crazy kind of way love does make you save extra find ways to make things work and if you love god then you will find ways to make this thing work because the god i serve he found ways to make this thing work he left glory take on a different form to tuck your take your place to make this thing work he has done listen you may be seated i don't know why i'm saying this this morning but in our marriage it takes the two sides to make it work enough well i have news for you god has never not kept his side of the bargain you could never accuse god of not doing his part in this relationship because every time you call him he answers whenever you need him he's there when he needs a shoulder to cry on he can count on him because he stands closer than a brother closer than a friend [Applause] hallelujah this helping anybody this morning so we need to look at ourselves because brother branham said if you ever lose your connection with god then retrace your steps because god don't walk away from us we are the ones walk away from him so you want to find him start to retrace your steps go back to where you left him [Applause] [Music] young people oh people tell me i lose my joy i'm not gonna be kind of joy i mean how much effort are you putting into this relationship how much effort you need dating somebody yeah you want to call them until if you're serious about anything you wouldn't call them once a year usc you are you are serious you you won games the lord teres help the brother who trying to talk to my daughter how much time he called i'll teach her the litmus test to filter who's serious i'm not serious because if you call in once a year in the dating where would be any marriage we need to do our marriage conference that whole separate thing because a lot of people telling me how it wasn't as good as it was when it was dated so so if we if we start in back we only get worse see the immense drive there but i don't let me come back let me reverse the car hit the reverse make a u-turn 3.4 pointer and come on that street come out that street leave that street alone people say come over here not today but it takes work it takes work natural marriage takes work it takes work to succeed in your business and your job and anything takes effort it was work for god you know on the first day he worked on the second day he worked and he under then he rested and then he didn't stop because the moment things fell apart he started the rebuilding effort and he hasn't stopped yet [Music] we spoke about entitlement people just are so entitled they want things to work for them without work friends you have to be motivated yourself to get your work done anybody with me this morning let me check my time i trust that was that's my opening comments i have no note for that but but the grace of god trusted bless somebody so just to touch in my text a little bit for a few minutes being conscious of the natural situation i just call it that do not cross the line final warning i would have preached this message over seven years ago to the young people and back then it was prompted by something i read in a quote that affected me then and it still affects me now it affects me more now because god has allowed certain things to unfold to filter and test who is motivated you'll see how it connected now right and i want to read a quote because this is in the deity of jesus christ brother branham said father we come this morning as your humble children i realize that we are living in the last hour closing time something can happen at any time men women boys or girls here are without god and i pray thee father you be merciful i pray thee to be merciful to those who have received and now realize that you're near in their hearts and realizing that little things of the world little things of the world it does not big things little things of the world through cares the things we care about the things that we concern ourselves about the way we spend our time i pray god that every one of them this morning will be really consecrated to you for the coming days to come if this quote was ever relevant it's today it's now how much longer we're going to wait before you're coming we believe it's right at hand now and after a while listen to the prophet they're going to try to get saved so an attempt will be made brother benjamin an attempt will be made young people to get saved to get it right to get it together and i'm thinking brother branham said of those young people that night down there at the altar trying to be saved but had crossed the line no redemption for them they were gone could not be saved you process that how could a merciful god how could a god who wants to bless and wants to redeem allow you to come to the altar and now say can't do it it is not that he cannot do it it's because the time for doing it is gone the opportunity to do it is gone the chance to do it is gone you had it and now it's taken back so we're going to touch on this tonight today as i go through a few things and when i've read this then and i have a few other things i want to comment on this morning to shake us because i've observed during this pandemic the issue with the pandemic is not the world the issue with the pandemic is not the church the issue of the pandemic is filtering a bride i remember before i got married i think i told my wife this brother hugh williams said to me i don't know if you remember this whenever you get married make sure you know how the person is when they get angry but here you remember telling me that he said make sure you know how the person is when they get angry but the thing of it is it's an interesting thing to think about because typically in in the nice part of the fears there you do already have you do you do your best to not get people upset so it's almost what we call counter intuitive to have a scenario or a scenario must present itself because you can't be guilty of orchestrating it but you want to know if when this person gets angry if a plate will come flying with such able precision that it will connect with that point right behind your head where you'll snap to a reality that you did something wrong but the reality is this you only get to know people when situations change and this is connected to the virtues because for you to demonstrate temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness situations in our lives must change that allow an assessment of our behavior under these very pressures and these varied testings and what i love about god god don't have no skip in class and not passing the test and he's not marking only on the curve brother stephen there's no curve you have to pass and the tutor is passing by assessment and only he ever say in the assessment i can't put in a word for you i'm sorry so i'm saying this pandemic has created a situation where now people have to give a true account you know and the account is not to the pastor because during the lockdown where we couldn't gather together you have to decide if you're going to connect to a service you have to decide not god completely completely did what he has wanted to do for a long time you know put a test to the people to see if they really wanted themselves by looking at your approach to god not your approach to church you know because if you don't see it as god trying to build a relationship with you using different ways and you miss the picture but your approach to god and i started to think about this cross in the line thing are we going to get into a few things not much but a few it's a choice you make when on a wednesday night you have to connect a service and you actually make a choice you know what today i'm not connecting because of x y and z and it's in your power to connect and you don't connect you know whatever i'm talking about that's still small voice that conscience speaking to you that warns you he said after a while when that voice say you know he's supposed to be in service you know he's supposed to be a primitive you know you're supposed to be in church he said every time that voice speaks to you and you ignore it the voice gets quiet a little more quiet a little more quiet and then after a while you're not going to hear me anymore let me say it again because that voice was placed there to guide you you know and that voice don't tell you to do the wrong thing you're supposed to forgive no you know you did the wrong thing you know you lie you know that's not the right approach you know you didn't have to say it that way you know you're supposed to be in church you know that's not how you're supposed to speak to your father you know that's not how i speak speak to your mother you know that's not how speaking to the deacon you know the pastor telling you to do something and you're doing something different and we make choices to lodging volume until there's a point where the volume is off and by the brandon describes it as you lose your sensitivity even me speaking this morning here in the church and through the internet there's a voice speaking to you telling you pay attention we're going on a certain road here that that you don't want to miss this thing here because we're in a life and death i never call it don't cross the line to look at the final warning because we don't have time left he was filthy filthy still he was righteous righteous still the angel already declared time no longer don't hush that voice that voice tells you to repent just dive in that water repentance that water that that void make things right you make it right one time back then i said it and i say it again today my heart is heavy burdened by what's happening all around us more so now than seven years ago but ibrahim said it influenced what we have seen happen should put every soul into action to make a church that would make a revival we have to be motivated to do that not depend on nobody some years ago my brother say well i'm not seeing this and i'm not seeing anything what are you doing because i'm not looking at what other people doing i'm doing brother eclair's everything that i could do i'm trouble today because of falling away young people calebs people who should know better need to return to their first love [Music] [Applause] and i want to challenge and i would have preached this message years ago to young people i want to start with parents because like it or not you set a tone for your house in particular the fathers and the head of homes set a tone for your house you set a cadence a beat a rhythm a way things flow you have more work to do if you have people under your care i love what is the donor said on friday she was doing all she could do to help her family but she realized you know what let her put on her mask first you know in a plane they say the planes have to depressurize if you have to help somebody else put on your mask first because if you don't put on your mask first or look at both getting the problems so you fix your mask first so that you get an oxygen you could help somebody else because the moment you start to lose oxygen your brain don't function as well you know you start to make poor decisions and so too in the spiritual we have a great responsibility parents to give an account and to accept responsibility for what god has placed under our care it is difficult for me to conceptualize complaining about children when more could be done in your prayer closet and more spiritual understanding could take place because there's always a better way and we have to strive to find a better way we have to strive to even move beyond the better way to the perfect way because it takes wisdom the bible says a wise man is who could win souls you know and sometimes within our own homes we have to be working to win souls we have to be able to convince to persuade to encourage to show to demonstrate to explain to invite peter didn't just come like that jesus invited him you know jesus had to know his approach to invite peter you know you ever thought of it what was jesus approach to convince peter to follow him what is your approach in your own home to be contending for the life of christ i'm not asking you to be perfect to be but your approach matters anybody with me i don't know why i'm going here this morning but this is what allah put in my heart so i'm troubled because i'm falling away and back then i was speaking to young people but it's also adults seasoned people who have lost their burden and they would say i am motivated i need a push i need a charge where why where where is your battery pack where's your charger where do you connect what do you connect to to get your charge because church is just a place to get you inspired to go again you know but the reality is every day you're supposed to be listen if you if you don't charge your phone every day we've had it if you don't pay your phone it will die you know think about it people they if you take their phone they're in trouble i saw somebody put out an ad don't get covered because somebody in your family will have your phone for 14 days our phones are so precious to us few if any forget to charge it in fact people get upset you see the charger who movement charger i left it who take it with a boring charger and and it's a big issue don't touch my charger this is my charger because you want to make sure your phone that's supposed to keep it connected to all kinds of stuff remains charged people will change course to get up to buy a charger to make sure that they phone charge people take preventative action like switching off their phone just to preserve battery life you can have to make an important callers and they don't afford to run out you could have to make a call anybody can talk about it and you want to live life as a christian without charging how could you overcome and how we expect to make calls in life and i want to see the calls in life being calls about decisions and choices and you want a call you want to make a call to know if to do something you want to make a call to everybody's right to approach you want to make a call to know how to move on your job you want to make a call on how to and you have no battery your phone dead and when you could thank you brother when you could get guidance from making a call you have no guidance because now you have to rely on your own strengths when you could call god any time simple message you know because people have all kind of mysteries and knowledge and information and no listeners and they're not praying every day check yourself we look at your operations we look at the priorities so to help you remind you maybe we could connect you too because you're disciplined to charge your phone so when you plug on your phone leave it and go and pray tie the activities together because you don't forget you see me don't forget to charge your phone so once you see it when you think about phone and charging an aim of battery running there hey my spiritual battery boy one time start to connect the two together make a connection that's how learning takes place so i don't need to teach you to charge your phone but when you see your battery going low and say well let me tap up my battery let me talk to god a little bit because i getting a reminder that i need to talk to gordon and say good morning lord and i and i approach it should i take this maxi or the maxi behind it which one should i take the first seat right here the front rod or the back of the car should i submit my report no or two minutes from now on you'll be surprised how god can handle all of your questions and give you all of the guidance and you know what the bible said in all your ways acknowledge him i saw a friend of mine he's 70 something years old and he said isaac in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your part he said every meeting i go to i say lord i acknowledge you as i walk into this meeting and it was so simple as a principle but it broke it builds your relationship with god because we need to be walking around as if we have no relationship lord i acknowledge you go into a meeting just give me the right words help me right now let me know because if this is not for me i don't want to be in here you know but if it's for me lord give me the boldness and your wisdom to say the right way i had to talk about a 55-hour prayer before every meeting but it's a relationship so go to it but i know that voice that's better malay talking to me all day holy talking to me everything you everything he coming to me with i know him i know sister paulie in every situation you bring into me she's not a stranger to me the angels had to know you know what he said to visit somebody regular everybody said start to afterwards annoy you say a little talking moving talking the angels had to know but that's a prayer war is a relationship [Music] become a known factor in heaven let heaven recept us keep saying it's sister karen again it's just a rosemary again unless he says a rosemary again [Applause] anybody is this helping anybody relation because what god wants he will come any cooler evening to talk to adam every day it was a habit it was a coming that god wanted think about it after god went through he said listen i need to go on talk to adam until one day came and said adam adam where are you not that adam was physically lost but adam we can't talk the way we used to talk how much he must have pee in god because this whole plan of having relationship had been interrupted and what was interrupted relationship anybody this morning with me let me try to find a place here time is source going so quickly but it comes as no surprise to us because brother branham told us there'll be a falling away people just can't stand anymore they just allow but what caused it you know what causes it the cares of this will you know the distractions the social media the news the entertainment the old talk the gossip the the everything else that just come to choke your life and you don't realize it until you're not dead in the grave no spiritually dead separated from god you're in church but you're dead because your joy gone because you haven't felt it your worship gone because you gave all your effort and your time to things that don't matter [Applause] i'm gonna have to find a place to close i don't know if i have to finish this message some other time but i want to read a scripture here for you in hebrews 6 and i want to read it let me get it here because i'm speaking to believers this morning this whole message about crossing the line and do not cross the line was the people who have a desire to get it right at some point you know to return but their desire to return by the end it was just a little bit too late when they could have fixed it and got it right and make things right and repent and get the holy ghost and i have the quotes for it they will live in two borderline but around them call it living on the edge borderline believers this is a scripture to address this falling away in hebrews 6 whether the bible says therefore hebrews 6 1 leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of fear towards god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame i want to read it in the amplified therefore let us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrines of christ the messiah advancing steadily toward the completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity anybody wants to be spiritually mature and take our conversations into spiritual maturity not as i said cranking up every sunday oh gosh press press press press let us not again be laying the foundation of repentance and abandonment of dead works their formalism and of the faith by which you turn to god in other words we have to get past the elementary things we're teaching about purifying the laying on of hands and resurrection from the dead and internal judgment upon these are all matters of which you should have been fully aware long long ago so in paul's letter he is saying there's something that should be basic common understanding as a believer we can't keep rehashing the basics of worship and sanctification and living right and doing the right things anybody with me this morning if god permits we will now proceed to advance teaching this is the amplified of history for it is impossible to restore and bring again to repentance those who have been once for all enlightened who have consciously tasted the heavenly gift and have been sharers of the holy spirit and how felt how good the word of god is and the mighty powers of the age and the world to come if they then deviate from the fate and turn away from their allegiance it is impossible to bring them back to repentance for because while as long as they kneel upon the cross the son of god are fresh anybody with me this morning is this shaking anybody let me try to find a place to wrap this up i know there are many people young people calebs who are on fire who are pressing on who are fighting the good fight doing all that they could do to make it they are determining their hearts to stand and have it on all that they will stand i believe there are people like that in the house this one if there anybody like us in the house this morning no matter what comes your way come hell or high water you are determined to make it you are fully persuaded that nothing present nothing past nothing to come could separate you from the love of god which is in christ jesus and i salute you for your faith i salute you for your stand i salute you for your courage and confidence and love in this great vision of god that he has for you and that is wonderful it's not easy but we know we're going to make it it's not easy but we're going to keep on fighting we're going to keep on pressing but while we have those who have seen that i know that there are also people who are living on the edge standing on the edge of a line that they don't even know exists for a few minutes i want to speak about that line a line is used to divide an area of space a line helps you understand boundaries and limitations a line help maintain order and balance if there's no line in the middle of the road and people driving all they want you know what will happen lines help maintain order almighty god created heaven and earth and put a line between them a line doesn't have to be visible countries go to war because of the line that separates one from another you cross the border it's invisible but now you're in another land people die because of lines they do not see they cannot see you know many young people kill one another getting the fight over a word or an and the word that was spoken it's not a word that or the phrase and that's something somebody wasn't used to but they crossed a line an invisible line that triggered something in somebody else that they didn't realize that just took it too far anybody with me this morning there are some lines that are safe to cross and there are some lines that are not safe to cross whenever there's a nuclear meltdown or a chemical exposure or viral outbreak a lion is set up to keep those that have not been affected from becoming affected that is the line i'm speaking about today a line has been set to keep those who have not been affected from being affected it is very serious because if you cross the line there is no cure as we read the court no more redemption no more hope [Music] if you cross the line there is no coming back in brother branham's words for those who cross the line no redemption for them they were gone could not be saved final warning church where are you standing this morning if you are trying to live on the edge be careful and do not cross the line this line we are speaking about this morning separates the lord's side from the devil's side the only two sides it's not about doctrine is that about teaching it's about the lord and the rapture of the resurrection the millennium the holy city your inheritance your purpose your adoption your filling you're refilling your family that's on one side of the line and on the other side is torture and torment and wailing and judgment and gnashing on teeth and devils and demons of the devil himself where are you standing this morning so many so many people making decisions choices decisions and giving away their soul thinking they are comfortable being in church but they are standing right on the edge and because they are so close to the edge any slip you make you're falling over and if you fall over you're gone cannot be saved no more redemption borderline know the truth in church but you're just touching the edge of the line you're there doing things on social media having conversation with people doing things playing around with the world during this pandemic you're supposed to be connected to the service but you're doing something else that's the edge you know thinking nobody can see you no pastor no assistant pastor no elder no deacon nobody there and you're just there on your own thinking about the struggle of people coming to church years ago he had a story that were going through windows to come to church i think was since the donald said against her family support she got baptized you know many stories they are like that against their family and friends supporting them my own father against the family background he made a decision he had no support it was real but now church comes home because of the pandemic church has come home and now you could switch between and you're multitasking it is now like adding something to the menu of your life so you have your main course and church is now something i decide it's a add-on it's an extra it's a feature it's a benefit but it's not the product because no real control put in your hands for if you want to be a christian in your heart [Applause] help us this morning lord we're playing games we're playing games during the full lockdown we couldn't gather people who were used to getting up early in the morning i don't know anybody i'm not i'm not directing it as a specific person but the effort to get up in the morning and get ready and prepared for church and to travel to church and to get into the anointing and to pray at the service and to get ready for 10 o'clock service people roll casually on their bed wait for a notification pick up the phone and rest it on the side of the bed at ease and zion and they're moving closer to the edge to the edge until it becomes like any other piece of content you know so i watch something on youtube and i want something else on youtube and i learn something and i do a course and i empower myself and i get a little word to feel empowered and stu's too too blessed to be stressed and i'm going to the rapture which rapture cross the line friends it's not about impressing me god gave his life and we want to be casual with this thing second peter three musicians get ready i'm humbled the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us what not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance long suffering long suffering god will do he will wait as long as he can wait he will call as long as he can call he will invite as long as he can invite not willing that enemy shall perish it is not god's desire to kill you his desire is to reconcile you to himself do we understand that do we appreciate that are we convinced of that are we concerned about that but the day of the lord shall come as a thief in the night in which heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the work that therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be ought ye to be am i to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat i believe that this message this morning is a final warning to those who will hear it no excuse today do not cross the line i don't know how many quotes i could get to but just let me see very quickly i want to read something here i'll have to skip most of it friends the key is get far away from that line as possible because when you're on that edge you want to hear people on the edge hearing all these voices on the other side you know you want to hear the worldly music you want to look at the world he's tired and he fashioned you you're being you're on the edge you don't want to miss anything think of and have preachers before remember lot's wife had the opportunity to leave the opportunity judgment started with a punch and her heart was so embedded there that she couldn't resist to look back god knew what was in our heart you know and he still gave her the opportunity to escape it is not that god did not know what is in our heart because we know the bible that he knows what's in our hearts and he's still because of righteous lot because of the head of his home because the head of that home extended the blessing and relationship with lotte his wife but her heart gave her away oh god help us to not live on the edge trying to be in church and still get pieces of the world let us go beyond the basic things friends how we dress how we move the music we listen to the conversations we have we have come too far to be still playing those games i understand somebody now come but some of us young people some of us caleb's 5 10 15 20 25 years and it's still struggling for the basic things but i'm in the messenger token says you see that's borderline believers that's on the edge right borderline they come through these different elements and true church and joining church and baptism unfolds but when it comes right up to crossing to get the token the closer you're on the edge your car you the token is is fully in on this side of the campaign when you're moving to the edge go when you cross you're now your car your car get no seat no more redemption you need to come back from that edge and get into the holy ghost you know i challenge you church cut off those worldly connections that are pulling you to that side that's their only purpose is to steal your soul the devil will come in and show you his face but he's sending all kinds of distractions using that kind of technology to pull you and every day you're weaker until you can't find yourself i i don't know what's going on it's so much years but you are nowhere near ready because you're living on the edge it's a warning [Music] final warning church i'm trying to close out oh my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah young people listen jairus one time had a little daughter that was dying but he was a borderline believer he believed jesus but was afraid to confess it so whatever someone certainly described borderline and young people i don't know i don't know what it is i don't understand it brother stephen they will put up whatsapp stuff to start us facebook starters instagram set up doing nonsense and the scary thing is if you're willing to put it into the public domain what would you do that god will see that we cannot see and it makes you wonder if they understand that hell is on the earth and the lid of hell is uncovered and their streams of demon powers dispatched and we are fighting a war this morning to pull it from the clutches of the devil and to pull you from the edge back into safety i hope this helped somebody this morning listen to the prophet in the message perseverance there's always borderline believers i call them people that will come to church they'll enjoy a message maybe from the choir or from the singers or from the minister or testimony they'll enjoy it but to come in and be a part of it to participate in it they won't do it they like to listen but they won't be part of it they do not want to be identified with them so because of that on the street they dress on the edge but equally so you can't be sure that they are christian they live they use words and their language and their conduct is like the ed because they don't want to be identified with them holy rollers they don't remember but you're a church girl or church boy god help me i'll tell you at the beginning of service helena aye cutter for the tribulation call me a church boy i church mouse at church whatever anybody with me this morning listen to the prophet in the message which is this one don't you borderline with god don't you just be a good man or a good woman you'll be filled with the holy ghost baptized into the body by the holy ghost don't take no hearsay nothing about it stay there until you're dead and your life is new in christ and your whole life is changed don't just take an emotion a sensation don't do that stay there until something actually happens that changes you completely this is not a statement it's not a profession it's not a declaration it's a complete transformation i'm trying to close out i hope you get this set of semantics and words and missing this thing and people think they're comfortable and they're on the edge not realizing that with one slip because stuff happens in life when you live on the edge if you slip your fall on your car get back i always see the people doing rock climbing and thing i can't do that one mistake berliner you're going falling why would i even do that but people like that trill you see this thing there's no trouble in living on the air you know young people there's no trill enlisted in the world in music and for some it's not well it's not really really really you know so that version the version one version two it have really really worthy and really worthy and worthy and not solid and slightly do you know that satan is a talented musician and he slips thing into music that changes your mood they have trees back people who went and do shootings and stuff to the kind of music they were listening to why is there such a relationship between music and certain types of music and certain types of activities not just internet around the world because there's a high desert there's a connection that come with the music that gets you ready to go and shoot and kill and do this because that's in the music and people feel themselves on that before because they could do certain things what are you feeding yourself on to be in the spirit to be holy to be eternal i find that music too slow i finished just another needle and you don't even realize and we said it before when you listen to some of the gospel music now you're you want to know if it's really gospel music because the spirit of the world finding ways and before you know it the beat is the exact same thing as your world so you don't know when at what point the lyrics change and you march into a beat that he never write the script the beat is the same so you can't tell the difference you don't know if from a distance if you hear the only words clearly you don't know what you're listening to and what you're dancing to and what it puts you into bring back the old-fashioned way it sounds crazy but that's what we need i'm trying to finish here i'll just close out with this you have come too far now to backslide come back from the edge you have come too far to give up you have come too far to quit when you're on the edge you hear too much voices from the other side come back into safety we don't have time to finish this message today friends but come back into safety come back into safety i don't know who this is for this morning but the lord put it on my heart to snatch somebody back maybe it's one person maybe it's two maybe it's four maybe it's five i don't know who it is this morning but if you've been on the edge get back to god this morning if you have silence that still small voice raise the volume under still small voice and say lord i'm coming home [Music] i've allowed the distractions in the world to cloud my judgment cloud my thinking but this morning lord i want to turn that volume off and hear what you want to say to me i need the old i need it but anthony [Music] is that how you feel this morning

praise god hallelujah give my song leave me alone i'll follow we will go out to that just for a few announcements um service continues on tuesday uh with the bible study and so on on zoom to praise god we uh will i mean an expectation for that amen and see how the lord will lead and speak to us wednesday night will also be uh stream service so want to hook in and be in the atmosphere in the spirit as much as possible you know and but isaac was laboring and speaking to us this morning to create an atmosphere where you are in your home your life wherever you are you know wherever his spirit might find you you just find a way to shut in god let him speak to you and really zone in and zoom in on what god has for you sometimes praise god uh it just takes just getting away from all the distractions to really hear god speak to us and so we want to do that as much as possible so wednesday night service you know we have the zooms uh our stream service will be service will be streamed on wednesday so we want to all hook in on that by the grace of god to hear what the lord will speak to us friday night also will be another zoom service as well and we see what the lord will do and then sunday will continue in the battlefield amen at 10 am prisoner uh maintenance team group four please meet with brother marlon alexander after the service okay so maintenance team group four you just meet with brother marlon he's here uh and you you'll have your assignments for clean up and of course we invite anybody else who willing to help and participate that's fine we certainly appreciate and thank you for that uh next week will be group six led by brother adrian joseph's group okay so just posting you to the future just a reminder also um i don't know but over i think about overdone mentioning this uh a prayer service also that uh of a ministry of prayer and uh we want to as much as possible keep just like a one hour of prayer minimum every day uh so just a reminder to you that uh every day you would want to try to make at least one hour of pray and it doesn't have to be one straight hour you can break it up however you want 15 minutes segments or half an hour whatever but you know it'll be effective to you and i think it's such a wonderful thing because you know you're striving throughout the day and you know you have different things happening and we know that but we take every opportunity to pray you know and um and and you know sometimes maybe let's face it maybe you may not make the whole hour maybe you press and you make 50 minutes and that is still a victory in itself because you would have spent the day continually in prayer praying always in the spirit as the bible encourages us to do amen these are the things praise god that what another ephesians is all about practicing the presence of god so you continue to do that and try to aim for an hour at least every day to talk to god anything that's on your mind just let him know if it's a burden you want lifted a prayer deliverance or maybe you just want to praise him and thank him for what he's done feel free to do that anytime you want praise god whether you're washing the dishes you're ironing your clothes or washing the car give god praise every day amen so god bless you as we leave those in your announcements amen and uh joshua's come leave me lord i'll follow lead me lord i'll go may god go with you today and bless you amen hallelujah [Music] and i will answer who lead me lord who and i will [Music] will fall [Music] and [Music] would [Music] when i [Music] when i will go [Music] oh me [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
