we take our Bibles reading two portions of scripture thank you musicians thank you brother Anthony for the song service reading Zachariah chter 4 and reading from Isaiah 59 just these two scriptures this morning Zechariah 4 and reading from verse 6 and Isaiah 59 reading from verse 19 starting in Zechariah 4 and: 6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it Hallelujah and reading Isaiah 59 and verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word can we give the Lord a hand of praise you may be seated so I have a title this morning and my title is not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord amen can the church say amen amen and I have a subject Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and an inspiration the spirit raising a standard to meet the challenge of the hour amen and the message just for a background Revelation 4 Revelation chapter 43 brother Bram said all right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undei lives walking around the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how much you holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil now I want to say something this morning church it's not what the devil does it's our response to what the devil does it's not what takes place in our lives that God is looking at he's looking at our response so that Sanctified holy life say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be God is not looking at how much you shout and jump but is that Sanctified holy life and I want to say this morning the devil has a response to the scriptures that that's why when Jesus was in the wilderness the devil was probing and probing the devil has a response to the quotes because the devil he could read but that is not what the issue is the devil has a response to all of that but he has no response to the life because the moment you vibrate that life the devil has to back up he has to let you go when you present The Life of Christ the devil has no answer to the life of Christ you don't have to say word but the life speaks something and the fact that you are here this morning is speaking something you are supposed to be backslid but you are here this morning and that's a problem for the Devil the fact that you are in the house of God this morning because coming to the house of God opens a road to the blessings of God uh it's up to you to walk on that road but when you are in his presence uh and you are Under The Canopy of life something could happen to you your word could come to you because we have heard the message before we have heard the word before it's not a new message but when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would raise a standard but the brandham said my making the same word more positive so the raising of the standard is not a new inspiration uh it's not a new doctrine it's not a new idea it's not a new move uh but it's the same word more positive you heard it before but all of a sudden this morning it's a reality to you you've heard it before but this morning it's alive to you you've heard it before but this morning you feel a little different about it you have heard it before but this morning you're a little more fed up of what the devil has been doing so the word is more positive to you this morning you just woke up on the right side of the bed so the word is more positive for you this morning you woke up knowing that no weapon formed against you nothing the devil could say to you nothing your husband your wife your brother your sister your neighbor your friend could move you and the same word is more positive to you and because the word is more positive to you you are more positive you are a positive Christian this morning we have too many negative Christians we have too many sad Christians we have too many depressed Christians depressed and Christians those words should not come together frustrated Christians those words should never come together tired Christians those words should never come together but now are we the sons of God now are we the sons of God oh hallelujah oh my I want to encourage your faith this morning encourage your walk this morning it takes an effort to get up it takes an effort to fight it takes an effort to make it and brother Bram said in the message the world is falling apart he said friends we are not promised a system we are not in church for a system Jesus would have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promise a system we will promise a kingdom and how do you get into it by by one Spirit we are all baptized into this Kingdom it's the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal King giving forth his Eternal Word with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life uh so I'm not speaking to your flesh this morning I'm not speaking to your mistakes I'm not speaking to your failures I'm not speaking to the sickness in your body I'm speaking to the word seed in your soul because of that seed in your soul your body will have to subject itself to your confession because of the seed in your soul oh can I get a witness in the house this morning did we come to have church today are we here headstone Tabernacle are we in the house of God my glory my my my let me say that again it's the kingdom of God it's a kingdom of eternal life there's no death in that Kingdom there's no sickness in that Kingdom there's no depression in that Kingdom there's no sadness in that Kingdom there's no frustration in that Kingdom there's no Mortgage in that Kingdom there are no bills in that Kingdom there's nothing negative in that Kingdom and that Kingdom has an eternal King the pastor is not the king there's no president there's no prime minister there's no Emperor there's just the King of Kings and the Lord of lords who is mighty in battle who is Sovereign and if he elected you because of his sovereignity he needs no permission to bless you and if he elected you because of his sovereignity he needs no permission to fill you with the Holy Ghost and if he called you because of his election Grace he needs no permission to heal you he doesn't need permission to come into your house he does to need permission to clean up your life he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah you may be seated so get excited about him we are in the spirit this morning church you can never get blessed unless you're in the spirit uh I want to be in the spirit uh on a Sunday I want to be in the spirit on a Monday I want to be in the spirit uh in the morning I want to be a spirit in the night time I want to be in the spirit all the time because one of these days this natural will no longer exist this physical will no longer exist I want to be magnetized to The Headstone because the headstone will come as we read in the scripture with shoutings of Grace Grace Grace Grace it's the grace of God you are here this morning it's the grace of God you woke up this morning you may be seated oh my oh my you may be seated I've said it before it's not your alarm clock that woke you up this morning I've said it before it's not your alarm clock that woke you up this morning if you take an alarm clock and put it in the MOG nobody's going to get up but it's the grace of God that woke you up this morning I don't care how much bills you have I don't care how much pain you're in I don't care how much trouble you're facing the God we serve all he wants is your worship this morning he wants your obedience uh he wants your praise uh he wants your adoration he wants your love this morning can we do that for him can we give him worship can we give him praise can we give him glory god is looking for some real Christians not some Christians of convenience only when things go bad only when things go wrong only when things didn't work out but you were Christian 24/7 it's the Thunder that shakes the devil the devil cannot move you the devil can't upset you give the god a shout of [Applause] Praise My you may be seated this is just the background I'm trying to take my time this morning I just want to take my time and bask in the presence we came to the house of God to spend time in the word to spend time in the presence so put your seat bels on we're going on a journey this morning Hallelujah you might as well get comfortable we have all day today is the Lord's day I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship Him the bill will take care of itself all that you're worrying about Hallelujah when the disciples had no money he said Go Fish they got food when they cut the food there was money in there he took care of their physical he took care of their financial what are you worried about he is still Jehovah Gyra he is still Jehovah shama that has not changed he said I am God and I change not he is still the same yesterday he is still a God of War he is still a god of judgment uh he is still a god of blessing he is still a god of Mercy to those that repent and come back to him let us return to the Lord this morning not by might not by power but by my spirit say the Lord oh my you may be seated from the same message the world is falling apart we are dead our lives are HID in God through Christ so through Christ Our Lives are HID in God so there are certain aspects of our life that are secret that are HID to God that's why you are Myster to the the devil that's why when he encountered Jesus he had to ask the question if thou be because his life was hid there's a covering over you there's a mask over you there's a covenant over you and when the devil looks he's not too sure he's probing he's probing he's probing Hallelujah and it seems deceptive to him because you fall and you fail and you make mistakes and for the Devil the mathematics are not adding up how almighty God would pick you you know you better than I know you the fact that almighty God would predestinate you and put you under under the blood the devil cannot figure it out because the devil has a file he has everything that you did but when God sees the file and looks through the blood he says there's nothing on the first page there's nothing on the second page what are you talking about the devil is the accuser of the Bron he has a file on your wife a file on your children but when God pulls the file and he looks through the blood he said there's nothing against my bride what what you talking about that's my lady I chose that lady I've engaged that lady I'm going to be married to that lady don't you talk about my lady you are predestinated for the marriage supper of the lamb for the wedding [Applause] supper Hallelujah somebody give God a shout up Praise You may be seated man you are going to the wedding supper not as a guest in the wedding supper but there are two seats and the wedding supper for the king and for the lady for the groom and for the bride you have reserved seating don't worry about your seat because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ angels have to step aside prophets uh have to step aside Apostles have to step aside behold [Applause] the Bride of Jesus Christ that's who we are Abraham wish he could have been a part of this but this is bright time this is seed time you may be [Applause] seated hallu we are dead our lives are hidden God through Christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination organization that's the prophet we are resurrected in the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is within you that's the prophet yes sir why all these man-made systems Must Fall not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political whe not a denomination but a kingdom and its subjects are dead to the systems of this world dead to the system on your job dead to the systems of the culture dead to the systems of the fashion dead to the systems of what the other young people people are doing dead to the systems of what other men do and it's normal and everybody else is doing it you're dead to all of that I don't care what the other wives do dead to that I don't care what your cousins and your sisters I don't care what they do dead to it because your life is hi in Christ everything you do is measured by Christ not measured by the church but measured by Christ can the church say Amen have that's done everybody can the church amen oh my we going to have a clean church we going to have a pure Church we're going to have a holy church we're going to have a church where Jesus feels welcome to walk in through the aises uh and sit next to you and say God bless you the same he sat there in the temple before they called him Jesus was just there he was in the church it was his custom to be in the church but he didn't even realize who he was and there's some Sons and Daughters here that we don't even realize who you are but you are attribute sons of God I don't care how you're living doesn't change the fact that he called you for such a time as this [Applause] Hallelujah brother brandom said in the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness you have your seat belts on right we're going for a ride amen hallelujah hallelujah God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them that's all God wants to do take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like at Pentecost at Pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up but it was all standing there where their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty vessels so God can fill them up listen carefully friends God cannot use them as long as they're already filled up so when he saying Lord fill me if you not empty there's nothing he can do amen amen yes Hallelujah because to pour in there has to be room for him to pour is there anybody willing this morning to [Applause] empty empty themselves to empty your thoughts to empty your qualifications to empty the chip you have on your shoulder to empty who your family is to empty this is what makes me what I am to empty this is how I feel about this brother this is how I feel about this sister this is this is the problem that I have many people are filled up with their problems filled up with their issues filled up with their situations Hallelujah can we empty ourselves this morning so God can fill the vessels because if he fills the vessels everything will begin to change because when he steps into the picture nothing could stay the same way one time Aaron left his Rod by mistake into the holy of holies and overnight it started to grow because it was in the presence imagine if that presence gets placed inside of you what will it do to cancer what will it do to diabetes what will it do [Applause] to light and darkness cannot stay in the same house house if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you the Bible says it will Quicken your mortal body it'll Quicken your mortal body you may be seated it doesn't mean if you die it just rais you up again but it means you could be walking and being quickened because that life has an effect that Spirit has an effect there's a result whenever that Spirit comes in contact with something they has got to be a result can the church say Amen Hall oh Hall but the challenge today thank you Lord is that people don't want to give up amen people don't want to empty up people don't want to let go because people have their own biases their own feelings and because God is so good he gives you free will he's not forcing himself and anybody he's a gentleman he saids behold I stand at the door and knock amen and if any man hear my voice I'm not coming and breaking down your door I'm not doing that but I'm going to knock am and I'm going to knock am and I'm going to knock until I get tired of knocking because the Bible says seeking the Lord while he might be found call upon him while he is near so there's a time limit when God will no longer knock what will your excuse be for not opening the door it was my mother it was my father it was the pastor it was the church it was my job I had no money I wasn't feeling well I was vexed I had a bad day I had a bad week I had a bad month I had a bad year I had a bad decade I had a bad my whole life what will your excuse be some months ago I preached a message no more excuses because when Moses stood in front the burning bush and he said I can't talk I can't walk I don't know this I don't know that after he was finished God say you're still going you have any more excuses because after all of your excuses it's still up to the in individual you cannot blame anybody and if God says you are going you have got to go you may be [Music] seated Jonah thought he was okay when God told him go this way he said you know what let me slip out Hallelujah let me slip out the other way and while Jonah is slipping out the other way thinking he's flying under the radar he take a ship he say there's no way God will get me off of this ship I on the ship and while the boat is heading in the wrong direction the Bible said a storm came and as the boat shaking Jonah has to feel convicted that's when you know you're call you know when you start to feel convicted when you know down in your soul this ain't right amen this road are going down here right Hallelujah everybody else on this boat but I am out of place this party I'm in it air right what I'm wearing today it air right how I left home this morning it air right this music I'm listening to it a right this conversation I'm in it air right this job I'm in it air right Jonah say listen it's not always is the problem I am the problem God give us some Christians who could say I am the problem you may be seated listen you see whenever you hear from God your vocabulary changes from you them to I when Isaiah met the Lord he say who is me I am a man of unclean lips whenever you meet God it's never about anybody else you look at your own life and say Lord I'm a sinner I'm a sinful man I need help I need a touch so Jonah confronted the real of his existence and say I am the problem he said throw me overboard he had to have Fai in he said throw me over boat I don't know if Jonah could swim but he just said get me off of this boat he had enough confidence that if he get off there be fine and when Jonah got off of the boat there was a prepared fish for Jonah Jonah didn't even know this fish had GPS because his fish was programmed to take Jonah direct to his Destiny I want to say Church you will get to your destiny the easy way or the hard way Jonah had the option to go straight to Nineveh he took the hard way but he end up right at Nineveh and you young people in the church you could take the easy way or you can take the hard way but you are going to get the Holy Ghost you are going to dress right you are going to live right you are going to act right you will respect your parents you will honor God the easy way or the hard way but it's going to happen can the church say Amen not by power not by might but by the spirit say the Lord can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine everybody feeling good everybody feeling in the spirit my you may be [Applause] seated so God God got to have empty vessels so he can fill them up and that's what all the situations in your life that you cannot explain is all about all right it's God's desire for you to empty out because when you are filled you depend on what you are filled with so when you have too much money your money is what you depend on when you filled with wealth you go by the doctor no wonder the woman with the issue of blood it was when her money ran out and she was empty that she had to look for an alternative solution to the problem she had had she had money she would have found every single doctor but the Bible said she exhausted her resources she was empty and her emptiness brought her desperation to look for alternative medication is there anybody in the house looking for alternative medication this morning you tried money you tried fornication you tried drinking you tried false Doctrine you tried being a good church member but that's not the same thing as the medication of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when the spirit comes upon you it's a whole different walk it's a different talk it's a different life can the church say Amen Hall Mall from the message speak to this mountain amen I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole [Applause] world the shaking of this world is not because of natural Powers right now there's political shaking there's there's there's government shaking there wars and rumors of wars there's oil and there's recessions and all of this this is this is scripture being fulfilled we shouldn't be surprised in fact we have the heads up we know what's going to happen before it happens people have to go to school and study economics and thing and say well it's boom and bus cycle we know that already I don't need a degree to tell you this whole world going on in the financial ruin the Bible says so people go and study for seven years to get a doctorate in in in economic toity currency this and that and that the Bible already tells you that already wars and rumors of wars you already you already have the script but the end is not yet Hall but this gospel will be preached and then the end will come that's our gospel that's our message that's our word so nothing Russia could do could affect the plan of Rush has to wait on US president Trump have to wait on us they have to wait for us to sign off and say Lord we ready we we have preached the gospel in power and demonstration we are ready for the Rapture then the end will come that's the gospel [Applause] H amen amen when Jesus stood in front of pilot and these guys he said power what powering is my father give all the permission to you have a little piece of garden and is my father give her the garden you have what you talking about if I want back up I call in back up they didn't realize who he was but Jesus knew who he was and his knowledge of who he was and the position of who he was gave him a certain authority of faith and confidence to live a certain way and that's how we ought to be he wasn't in the best position when he was in prison but he didn't change a fact of who he was Joseph in prison didn't change the fact of who he was Jesus sleeping on the board didn't change the fact of who he was so whether you are tired weary sick or frustrated doesn't change the fact of who you are and the power that's locked up inside of you somebody say Amen H Hallelujah god brother BR said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire Lord don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfill oh it's going to happen pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting but braham's faith for so much this is 1959 huh I'm waiting I'm wanting it to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and she rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by a word the blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we are in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to strike the Church of God soon and listen listen to the promise and it's going to start a Revival that will shake the world I believe it [Music] [Applause] amen so in every age we know there was a thunder amen and this age and this time all all the Thunders from every Age come together because is the last age and in the message of the expectation with theam said now if God has promised a Revival we're going to have it am so let's make ready for it if God promised to heal now listen this is so powerful because but the Bram is just bringing the promises to the people he's not speaking to their situation he is speaking about the promise she said if God promised to heal let's make ready for it so he is speaking to people looking for healing and he said well if you are about to be healed get ready for it I want to to sink in a little bit if you if you're on a destination for the Holy Ghost then get ready for it because it's coming if your children are going to be restored get ready for it if your daughter is coming back to the house of God get ready for it make preparations for it begin to buy some extra food for when they come so you can have the food ready to cook for them because they're coming make ready for it brother BR said move out everything get ready we're right in time he said now it'll seem foolish now you say well how it's going to happen in a day like this and I don't care what anything contrary is to that is wrong we can't see it I see a hope of it look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow because God said so I'm expecting it somebody say Amen my so anybody expecting a Revival I'm under great expectation Hallelujah for real Revival amen amen yes sir in about 40 days we'll have our convention here in the Tabernacle and I'm under great expectation amen if you are under unex for your own life and your own walk that's you but I'm under expectation amen but the brandom said and I want bring it back to the church so we know what we are expecting but the B said that a Revival causes five things he said a Revival brings souls to Christ but said it will bring the church back to the spiritual condition it should be in he said a Revival brings close communion with God a Revival brings Fellowship among the churches and in a Revival you pray for the sick and mother band in the message making the valley full of ditch he said that's what we need tonight is a good oldfashioned backwards sin killing sky blue religion bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost amen that's what we need and in the third seal it's a familiar Cod that's the reason that the revivals that we are supposed to have we have the nomination revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we have got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere but the say the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stirred a bride yet we are looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so what are you looking for preacher I'm looking for a manifestation of God that stir the bride for a reality that'll make you walk different talk different live like a Christian can the church amen oh my Hallelujah the seventh Thunder Revival is the pride Revival if there's no seventh Thunder Revival there will be no Rapture if there's no seventh in Revival there'll be no Resurrection the seventh tunders is what gathers the bride the seventh tunders will give the bride FEI the seven Thunders will show the bride how to go but the said this is still my background I'm getting to myt shortly and the only way you're ever going to see your way out of whatever you're going through is an oldfashioned spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an oldfashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival hits the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things then you will wonder why these real CHR are hanging on while they are praying for you can the church say amen amen oh Hallelujah let me wrap up my initial thoughts here Glory but the brandom said the church is a born again bunch of Believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost right led by the spirit of God that's what he describes the church as they're not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world am that's what makes them what they are so what makes them what they are is their difference from the world Hallelujah that's what's make them their life is dead and their hid in Christ dead in Christ ande and sealed by the Holy Ghost they away from the things of the world Hallelujah sons of God are led by the spirit of God not led by some of the Fanatics or some organization or something or another they're led by the spirit of God the Holy Spirit listen was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise the church children of God not our Bishops and Cardinals and so forth but the Holy Ghost and listen to what P said I'm expecting this is my expectation also I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or a pend I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that will go to meet him filled with the power and the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believe that God promis it that there' be a church without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said so can the church say Amen am so let me strike my text a little bit the spirit raising a standard to meet the challenge of the hour yes sir now every hour has its challenges in the days of Noah they had their challenges in the day of Moses they had their challenges in the day of Moses they were in slavery they were working for the Egyptians they were under the oppression of pharaoh that was a challenge that they were facing and they had to have something to meet the challenge of that hour so when God sent Moses down to Egypt they finally got a hope to meet the challenge of the hour am in every age in the Dark Ages the Christians were being killed in Lions then and this that was the challenge of the hour and they had to have a great faith to live in that hour how many people wish they could be in that age where are the in that age it was easy you know it was just one question are you a Christian and there were only two possible answers CU there was no maybe it's either yes or no if it was yes it was Lions then if it was yes it was hang at the cross if it was no you go and you live your life and I'm not with those people that day was easy this day is harder the Bible say there'll be a day where it's need day or night he's in the middle everything is gray you're not too sure you have a lot of Mayes now that's right there's no yes and there's no there's are you a Christian kind of I'm in the message gray area in the messy but the M's not adding up walking in the middle amen but there's a challenge in every age and there a challenge of this hour and something has to come for us to meet and match the the challenge of the hour now I shared this with the church before but everybody was not here it was a communion service a long time ago I think about a year or two ago and I was speaking about when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would raise a standard against it we all familiar with the scripture right so I was meditating on this scripture when the enemy comes in like a flood and I always wondered why did the Bible use the word flood to describe it why not when the enemy comes in like a earthquake or the enemy comes in like a tornado or the enemy come in like a hurricane but it said when the enemy comes in like a flood and a flood is defined as an overflow of water that submerges land with is usually dry a flood is when water ends up where it's not supposed to be it usually takes time for a flood to develop Rain Must Fall for a prolonged period of time for a flood to develop am a earthquake lasts a few seconds but a a a flood is different a flood destroys lives property change the landscape and it could last for a long time in nature you can't fight a flood if there's a fire you could pull a fire extinguisher but what do you do when there's a flood a flood is something it takes time and it it it happens and and and you just have to deal with it you could build a house to handle earthquakes tornadoes fire but a flood is different yes yes the average tornado could last 10 minutes maybe an hour but a flood could last for months in Noah's day the flood lasted 40 days and 40 nights the three worst disasters in the last thousand years have all been floods in 1931 it was estimated that up to 4 million people were killed in the hill River flood you could try to to prevent it but you couldn't stop it Hallelujah a flood comes to destroy it comes to break down it it comes to break up but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would raise a [Music] [Applause] standard and many of us in our lives in our walk it has been like rain upon rain upon rain when you thought something else couldn't go wrong it was rain and now you look around your life and it seems as you're standing in this flood but when the enemy comes like a flood that's when the spirit would raise a standard and in the spiritually the enemy has attacked there has been flood after flood flood of evil flood of sickness flood of interpretation but every time there's a flood the spirit would always come and raise the standard can the church say Amen the three Hebrew boys they were there and they had their testimony and they told them listen you can't pray you can't worship you have to bow down and they said we will not bow down and they had to deal with their own flood they had to deal with their own Challenge and they say we will not bow down but when they enter the fiery furnace the spirit raised a standard and stood up to defend them and they overcame the flood the situation that they had to deal with there's no flood there's no situation there's no temptation there's no trial that the spirit cannot raise the standard against it can the church say Amen not by might nor by power but by my spirit say the Lord so maybe you're dealing with the flood of high blood pressure when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit will raise the [Applause] standard in every age Lord they had their floods that's right and we have all floods also God doesn't have shortcuts amen and God is not in the business of making it easy for some people all that come to God have to be tried have to be tested and you have your personal flood that you have to deal with in your life you will have the hurricanes and you have your storms too but the flood is serious but we all have our personal floods but when the enemy comes in like a flood the Bible says the spirit would raise a standard Hallelujah and I shared it before because I know many people don't know what a standard is and in ancient times a standard identified who you were so the tribe of Judah would have its standard it would have been a stick with a symbol or something on it that would represent the tribe all right so when the Philistines and the jebusites and the Hittites come they would all have their standards their banners that represented who they are the standard would say whose side you're on the standard would represent your history because you would take time to have a standard so Judah might have been a lion and whatever it was was the standard of the tribe and the tribe rep the the standard represents what you believe the stand when you see the standard it's a reminder of what you're fighting for amen amen hallelujah standard is supposed to keep you together yes because where the standard is that's where your the rest of your people are because the Army moves with the standard so when the tribes of Israel come together for war you would see the standard for Judah the standard for God the standard for Nalan all the men of War would stand with their standard amen and when the standard be said charge you would move with the standard In the Heat of the battle the standard would mean hope because you could be under pressure but once the standard is being lifted you know there's somebody else on your side who is holding the standard [Music] up if the enemy has you on the ropes you got to look for where the standard is because the standard mean there are more men around the standard oh you don't hear me this [Applause] morning hall hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated and normally the standard would be whereever the king or the general is amen amen the general will stand there because he represent the last Bastion so even when men would go to fight the general will be there with the standard to let you know we are here and if I need to send in more reinforcements the reinforcement will come from the standard okay man over there over there over to that side amen when when the standard Falls it means you're finished all right all right if the standard Falls it means the Army is finished because whatever happens the men would fight to defend the standard even if there's one man left with the standard they would take the standard back to whoever was remaining and form another Army around the standard that's how powerful the standard was when you see the stand it means rally when you see the standard it means this is where we make our stand if we must die here we will die here but we are standing with the standard you may be seated depending on how you use it the standard could mean charge the standard could mean go to the left this stand mean go to the right the stand mean to pull back Hallelujah you may be seated in those days they had no walkie-talkies they had no radios they had nobody saying I'm on channel two move to the left mve in now no the standard is where the instructions came from so when you see the standard circleing it meant something it means everybody get into war right when the standard go up and down it means something that's how important the standard was the standard Bearer had to know when was the right time to move the standard the right time to raise the standard because you don't want to give away the move before it's time the standard bearer was one of the most important roles outside of the general but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would raise the standard it wouldn't be man raising the standard it wouldn't be oh you don't hear me it'll be the spirit itself given the cry to charge when it's time to for your children to come back the spirit would say time is up bring them in raise the standard prepare for war time to [Applause] attack you may be seated [Applause] Hallelujah so I want you to understand what the scripture means and in context Hallelujah God is not trusting this standard to anybody else all right all right he said for this flood I'll raise the standard myself amen I will give the orders myself I will give the instructions myself now in modern times we don't have standards like those anymore in modern times we call it a flag that's right that's the modern version of what they had a standards years ago so when soldiers go to war I know there's some brothers here who would smile when they say when man went to the moon they put the flag on the moon there's some brothers who say well man didn't go to the Moon that's a different message but wherever you go and you claim the territory your standard marks possession that's right amen amen so when Joshua would have entered into the promised land every place you put your foot is yours they would make sure when they took an area they put a standard up this is bur Judah God whatever it is the standard represented ownership can the church say Amen the standard the banner the flag it means this is our territory yes this is my family this is my house as for me and my house we will serve the Lord there's a standard in my house there's a standard in my life can the Church Say Amen amen oh my and I shared this I shared this story back then when I preach on this there was a story of a war that was going on and brother Knight they were losing the war right and the standard Bearer he was running ahead of the other men and as he is running the men around him are being killed left and right but he knows that they have to get to the other side and the general of the army scream out to the flag bearer he said bring back the flag we got to retreat and that flag bearer scream back I'm not bringing it back bring up the men bring up the backup I've got to keep going I've come too far to turn back now bring up the men I've already reached this far I'm not going to retreat now I've been a Christian for this long I might have lost Brothers I might have lost sisters but I'm heading to the promised land bring up the men bring up the soldiers no retreat no giving up I might be tired but I'm not giving up I might be weary but I'm not giving up I might be standing alone but I'm not giving up bring up to men and this morning I say bring up the men the land is a good land it's a flowing land flowing milk and [Applause] honey oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah prise God praise God so when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit Hallelujah would give the final charge and all through history we have had standard bearers Gideon was a standard Bearer he said the sword of the Lord and of Gideon what a declaration what a faith the sword of the Lord and of Gideon Joshua was a standard Bearer The Enemy had come like a flood and he needed more light he couldn't do it himself and he spoke and said Son stand still and the spirit raised the standard can the church say Amen oh my and I said it before you may be seated Joshua was just so focused on winning the war Joshua wasn't study about physics or geometry or geology because as anybody knows the sun doesn't move around the earth it's the Earth moves around the Sun so when Joshua says son stand still he actually activate some mathematical equations for the earth to stop moving Joshua wasn't bright enough to know it was the Earth had to stop moving amen he say son stand stand still and God said you know what to do stop the Earth because a son needs some backup so you might didn't even say the right way but when he say Lord help me God knows what to do it's his son it's he could oh you don't hear me this [Applause] [Applause] morning that's why sometime when you pray the words might even come out I might be a groan I hear the Cry of my people you might even be able to say it in words what the situation is but you're you're deep down in the ho say Lord you know I need you know I need you know I need and God said fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it I've heard the cries of my people and I've come down to deliver sometimes the words can even come out it it's too painful but he hears every cry he hears every scream he hears every moan he knows every [Applause] situation oh help us Jesus help us Jesus the things that you can't even see he knows what's going down in your soul but if there's a cry in there he knows what it means you may be seated oh church if God right now Hallelujah were to come to answer the desire of your heart Thank You Lord what would that amen desire be what would that desire be this morning because he is here this morning he's here to heal the brokenhearted that's that's what he does that's his that's what he does he's here to to heal the sick he's here to comfort them that mour he's here to to touch you he's here that's what he does that he can help himself that that's his nature that's his being that's his attributes to call to himself oh backslider come back home this morning sinner come to God this morning father mother Young Brother young sister come back to God this morning not by might nor by power but by my spirit say the Lord friends we are not creating amen a standard we are lifting a standard the standard already exists it's not a new standard it's a standard of Holiness it's a standard of Purity it's a standard of righteousness it's a standard of humility it's a standard of holy decency it's a standard of Bradly love it's a standard of forgiveness it's a standard of Charity it's a standard of perfect love it's a standard of seven and Living Voices it's a standard of adoption it's a standard of perfection it's not a new standard the standard always was always is and always will be the standard is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is there anybody in the house who will help me lift that standard [Applause] up oh Hallelujah the standard is the king of kings the standard is the Lord of lords the standard is El Shai the standard is the breasted one the standard is El Elohim the standard is the rose of Sharon the standard is the lily of the valley the standard is my shield the standard is my buckler the standard is my sword oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated the standard is one Lord It's one Faith it's one baptism they are not two standards there's just one standard brother brandham came to point us to the standard he came to forun the standard because the standard is the greatest weapon that the world has ever seen the standard is the word the standard is spirit and when the word and spirit comes together the standard is called Dynamics the standard is called mechanics and Dynamics together T and lat rain that's the standard the standard was laid down on the day of Pentecost when brother pandam said uh before the doctor's hands touches my wife the standard was being lifted to show that the standard is still here oh you don't hear me this morning the standard has never left can the church say amen and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would raise the standard to give you hope to keep on fighting to give you hope to keep on pressing to give you hope that your son is coming to give you hope you're going to get the Holy Ghost he is that hope that standard is Christ in you the hope of [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated and I love it I want you to really sing down because people want to claim that they are holding the standard that the standard is in this church and the angel is in that church and the anointing is in this church and the Bible says when the enemy comes in because the enemy came in and that church that was established on the day of Pentecost fell into the ground and that flood took the church out and in every age a flood came but the Bram said the floods came but Luther that standard was raising his day it wasn't Luther raising his standard it was the spirit raising his standard and when brother Bram left the standard did not leave the standard didn't hand to any man the standard was always in the hands of the spirit the standard has never left the hands of the spirit but the Holy Ghost as a standard Bearer would stand with any man who stays with the word you don't hear me this morning the standard Bearer who is the Holy Ghost will identify himself with any son who stays with the word with any daughter who stays with the word with any group who stayes [Applause] with oh my you may be seated the standard Bearer the spirit is the standard Bearer you may be seated the spirit has no loyalty to man The Standard Bearer only has loyalty to his word oh my and once you stay with the word that's why the prophet said full obedience to the entire word entitles you to being accompanied by the standard be because it's the spirit that follows the word it's the spirit that brings life to the word it's the spirit that quickens the word you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah so the flood in your marriage you don't need a marriage counselor the flood in your marriage you get the word and watch the Spirit come and work the word because when you apply the the word to your marriage husband love your wives wife reverence your husband once the word is present the spirit the standard Bearer is obligated to raise the standard and dispel all enemies dispel all a somebody help me this morning to the flood on your job you take the word to your life and be sweet be humble be a Christian and watch the standard be make himself known make himself present and raise the standard whatever the flood [Applause] is you may be [Applause] seated you may be seated brother brand hallelu he prayed for that man who was blind amen and that man went away God and he came back Hallelujah he said I'm still blind and brother Bram said it's because he didn't have faith and Faith come by hearing the word so he hadn't had enough word that was mixed with faith to activate the prayer that was already spoken so but said I can't pray for you again because I already prayed for you once I pray I already activate the resource from heaven now it's on you to have enough Faith to receive it so we told a man go around saying by stri I'm Healed because that's also the word so when that man started to say by Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed what he didn't realiz every time he said it it became more real to him the standard bearer was walking closer walking closer walking closer walking closer because the standard Bearer always follows the word the standard Bearer once there's Faith mixed with the word the standard Bearer he is attracted to it he a sh H HJ somebody say Amen oh my what flood is bugging you down this morning what situation has you overwhelmed this morning I don't care what it is there's no flood that this standard Bearer can't deal with you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God worship somebody give God praise somebody enter in this morning hallelujah oh [Music] my Hallelujah hallu brother Isaac youall you haven't touched my flood you don't know my flood what I'm going through huh you don't have the my flood is different this flood it's not like anybody else's flood and that's how many of us feel sometimes Hallelujah Lord come to church and you do your best to put on the best message Christian face you could put on Hallelujah you're in a flood amen you have on rubber boots live jacket because you don't know if you're going to fall down and float in this flood amen hallelujah I want to challenge you this morning amen I don't care what the flood is there's a word for every flood there's a word for every every situation but you have to find the word for your situation you have to find a word as David did to encourage himself the word that encourages you will be different from the word that encourages somebody else because we all have our different floods we all have our different challenges we all have our different struggles that comes with this Christian walk walk at this Christian journey I challenge you Church of the Living God to stop looking at other people's floods and trust God to bring healing in your soul and healing in your life that you could live the kind of testimony that God could say there's my son there's my daughter you imagine a flood that job was in he lost his property he lost his children he lost his money and his wife is there with him in the flood and she say why don't you curse God and die but job kept standing because there was something in him to standall friends backsliding is not an option Hallelujah hallel giving up is not an option even though sometimes you feel like giving up some God will catch you giving up you know what the Bible says I believe in Luke Chapter 5 Jesus comes and he sees some brothers Simon and different ones I believe it was the Bible said they were washing their Nets anybody familiar with it I heard let me read it in Luke 5 verse1 and it came to pass that as the the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God speak name of Jesus he stood by the lake of gazar and saw two ships standing by the leak but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their Nets and normally when you have to ask a s question if your nets was in the water why you need to wash it but these men were washing their Nets because they were done they were finished they had caught nothing we see it later they had caught nothing but they were finished they had given up they had resigned themselves and saying we are going home without food amen amen but this day was different because Jesus comes by them and the Bible says he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him or asked him that he would trust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship and when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering him said Master we have toiled all night long that's why I was washing my net yes it's not that I didn't try to be a fisherman it's not I didn't try to catch it's not I didn't try to to come to church I tried but I didn't catch anything so I found myself washing my Nets I have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net oh God Amen and the Bible says and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break who and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ship so that they began to sink Hall and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus's knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were pared with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from hence before thou shal catch men Hallelujah fishes of men but I want to touch on something here friends you know many times as Christians people have this bravado they would do Glory Hallelujah and there's stuff going on it's okay for stuff to be going on in your life it's okay to be tired Jesus himself was tired that's why he was sleeping under the the boat amen when the storm came Christians get tired Christians feel weary sometimes and these men as I heard somebody say one time he said as a businessman he would never employ people who want to give up but Jesus came to these men who were quitting the job with results and he was still willing to work with these men friends many times in our Christian Journey we find ourselves washing our Nets amen we are willing to give up because things didn't work out for us the way we planned it's not easy to toil all night and catch nothing amen it's not easy to work hard and see no fruit of your labor amen that's right amen but Peter said something powerful he say at Thy word I'm willing to try one more time and if it's anything the church gets this morning is to be willing to try one more time willing to give God your all one more time willing to live the right way one more time willing to forget the toil of the night the toil of the last year the toil of the last 10 years willing to forget the pain and of not catching anything amen you sit in church you see other people get blessed and you wonder Lord where's my blessing I want that kind of blessing amen I feel I'm going to wash my Nets Hallelujah I see people in church and they happy and they're rejoicing but I don't know what they're having but my walk is different and I'm washing my Nets I'm ready to just give up friends there's a word this morning cast your net one more time give God your all one more time I said the beginning of this service I want to encourage your faith this morning Amen to not give up to don't give up to don't quit I don't care what the challenge is do not quit do not give up keep on fighting it'll be all worth it the Bible says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us friends the standard is still there the standard is still standing the standard is not moving the standard is not coming down all these years God had been waiting for the right people to Rally around the standard for the last great kill for the last Showdown for the last outpouring of the Holy Ghost that the brand said will be so powerful this world will not be able to contain it so powerful it'll be a short quick message that'll shake the whole nation so powerful that your family will have no choice but to come back and if you have doubts about it if God could take Lazarus from being dead and Lazarus had no choice to come back what about your son or daughter who is living wherever they are doing whatever they are doing God is able to bring somebody who's alive if you could bring somebody who was dead back don't you worry about it the standard is still standing High not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord when but the Bram left the standard did not leave the standard has been here all the time and the spirit is holding the standard and every flood that comes he lifs the standard to say Keep Your Head Up Square your shoulders back lift your head up and keep moving forward the promised land is just ahead the Holy Ghost is just ahead your promise is just ahead your Revival is just ahead can the church say Amen oh my you know when brother man said Satan will be powerless amen powerless before this bride no power before this prde sickness will not stop this bride false anointed will not stop this prde oh my could you imagine young people oh myoo glory to God the musician can get ready am Hallelujah getting ready to finish out hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah the angel of the Lord is on the earth now Messiah is here he was here with the prophet and when the prophet left he stayed here and the Holy Spirit came upon you to repres produce the grain the word seed in your soul and he has never left you he will never forsake you he will be with you in your trials he will take you through everyone of your trial there's no trial that is too great no trial that could overcome you it's impossible there is a way of escape this morning and if you have a lot of Trials this morning count yourself blessed because the more trials you have it's just the enemy trying to stop the seed in your soul and it's a sign from God that you are elected of God because the devil will not try to stop his own he will only try to stop those that are going against the Green and you are an oddball this morning you are going against the graen every time you lift your hands with a pandam said you are defying the law of gravity you are defying the law of nature every time you come to the house of God you are making your identification with the banner with the standard you saying Lord I'm on your side who is on the Lord's Side this morning oh oh my oh hallelujah oh I'm trying to find a place to close out you preached me out already my my my my my Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah oh Hallelujah so the spirit friends is here to take us all the way to the Rapture don't lose sight that we are heading to a rapture don't lose sight of the fact that we are heading to the end of all things don't lose sight of the fact that there'll be two in a bed and one will be taken and one will be left it's so easy to get caught up with this and that and and not realize that no matter what goes on you have to display the token that's it because only the token will be accepted that's it only the token is what God will recognize and Bram said in the token apply a church now don't fail and the BAM says it over and over don't don't don't let the sun set don't don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token that's it all that God has done through his word over all these years were to bring it to a spot that the token could be in your heart could be identified that you could be identified with a token and more than that the token be be identified with you but the BAM said you say I believe I believe the message you say that's all right that's good but you must have the token do you hear brandom Tabernacle and I say this morning do you hear headstone Tabernacle you must have the token displayed amen without it all your believing is in vain see you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother brandham that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very light that was in Christ be in you when I see that hallu I'll pass over you Hallelujah but the man said now look at yourself we're coming to your house now we're coming to your life now look at yourself don't look at anybody look at really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God remember the Bible said in the last days when this time takes place he said a marking Angel went through the churches yes sir went through the cities and sealed only those who cried and sighed for the Abomination that was done in the city is that right Ezekiel 9 we know that's the truth Jesus that marking Angel went forth and put a mark on their head forehead seal them them that sighed and cried after that come the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth which is coming right away we see it com in Wars moving right in that'll kill the whole earth off there was nothing they couldn't touch but them that have that Mark my God I wonder this morning church if the marking Angel the sealing Angel moved through this church this morning I wonder how many people would be marked how many people are sighing and crying for the abomination in the city God does not recognize your attendance in church Hallelujah because that's not what he's looking for whether you come or don't come he's key already give his word he said forsake not the assembling of his said that's already spoken but this is going Beyond you coming to church this is going Beyond you being in the message this is goes down to what's in your heart Hallelujah that nobody else could see because coming to church for some is just a formality being in the message for some is just a formality Hallelujah but this is going deeper to those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city Hallelujah those that recognize that judgment is hanging over not just the world but over the church because the Bible says begin in My Sanctuary begin in the house of God judgment begins in the house of God because we ought to know better we have the word but what are we doing with the word church we have the encouragement every week but are we sighing and crying are we praying are we seeking are we Opening Our Hearts to God and say Lord I am willing like Samson to die with the Philistines my God Amen I am willing to give up everything in the world Hallelujah I'm willing to give up the worldly life I'm willing to give up my worldly commitments I'm willing to give it all up Hallelujah for the sake of this token hallelujah oh my God praise Lord friends we have to be in rapturing condition that's what the spirit is here for not to make us jump and shout and just be in the spirit but it's to get us into a condition a condition to go into the Rapture a condition God like Peter when Peter walked people could be healed in his shadow he was in a condition what's your condition this morning this Rapture is not for a group it's not for the church it's not for the pastor it's it's it's for the individual they are pastors who will miss the Rapture they are preachers who will miss their Elders deacons song leaders and musicians in the message that will miss the Rapture because the Rapture doesn't respect your position it respects the token hallelujah hallelujah friends one taken one left you could have knowledge and miss the Rapture you could speak in tongues and miss the Rapture you could feed the poor and miss the Rapture you could give the body to be burned and miss the Rapture Hallelujah but you must have charity Dynamics the token the life seven thundering voices Christ in you the hope of glory to make it to the rapture conventions will not place you in the Rapture believe in the right Doctrine will not bring you to the Rapture amen thank you Lord It's that life hallelujah it's humility it's that Thunder that shakes the devil friends don't let us lose the focus of why we are in the house of God this morning we in the the purpose of why we are here is to get our lives right with God it's no good to just come to church and and feel good and be encouraged and we did the encouraging part you're going to make it you know that but there's something you must do you must live a certain way we have become too relaxed we have become too complacent we have taken things lightly Hallelujah we have lost our sincerity we have lost the burden to be holy go ahead the standard has never been dropped it's still the same standard be ye holy because I am Holy it's still the [Applause] standard the standard is still Thou shalt have no other gods before me that's still the [Applause] standard the standard has not changed and God will not lower the standard we have to come up to his standard amen I don't care how bad the world I don't care what your boss says or what everybody else is doing in University it does not matter the standard is still the standard because everything that can be shaken will be shaken and only the standard will remain hallelujah hallelujah I know this is a part of the message everybody loves the shouting part everybody loves to see the standard take you out of the flood now I'm going beyond the flood you out to the flood now amen amen but you have a destination and for that destination there is a requirement and God will not change your requirement if you have to travel you need a passport if you need to go to the US you need a visa God is not going to change your requirement because you are who you say you are you have to have your passport you have to have your Visa stamp with I am in The Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says by one Spirit you are baptized into the body has nothing to do with who your pastor is what church you go to that's foolishness Hall have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe uh it's been the theme of every Apostle since the day of Pentecost and it's still the message today we need the spirit we need the Holy Ghost we need the baptism of fire to take the evil [Applause] out h Hallelujah you may be seated that's the only way your money will fail you your body will fail you your mind will fail you but this Holy Ghost will never fail will never fail oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh I don't know why I'm here this morning but we are here this morning we are in the world this morning we are in somewhere this morning I know young people it pains me amen it pains me with how much we have now that those who went before us didn't have there was a time when the spok would books would come and it would be a rush to not only get it but a waiting list to read it because it was food for the soul that was before technology now the message is on the internet the messages on apps on your phone and people don't even want to read it right there was a time Bibles were not allowed to be in your houses that's why Martin Luther found the Bible chained up in the Catholic church and he found the scripture that josa live by feet he didn't find it in his house because they had taken the Bibles off the street now we have Bibles in our homes we have Bible on our phones we have Bible on our iPads and people don't want to read it and God told Joshua meditate on the word day and night so you have good success what's wrong with us what Rapture are you going to if you don't read your Bible what kind of Christian are you if you are not even serious about making your calling an election sure God help us when the enemy comes in like a flood this morning I'm dealing with a flood of formality am the flood of being lukewarm the flood of being complacent the flood of being lazy the flood of being ungrateful second Timothy 3 Spirit heav highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we make time to do what we want to do but call a prayer meeting and you can't find the church that's the flood that we are dealing with this morning but when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit would raise a [Applause] standard I want to see some of you show your job to the angel when he ask to see the token look my job look how much hours I have in I work so much over time this is what will take me to the Rapture are you foolish are you crazy your job is a means to an end it's not the end there's an end there a your job is not the destination hallelujah hallelujah when the cealing angel moved through Egypt and went from house to house all he was looking for was blood Hallelujah he didn't want to hear talk explanation reason and justification when let me send you an email about why I should pass by this house said I'll pass through Egypt this night Hallelujah and smile all the firstborn but if I see blood I'll pass over Hallelujah if I see blood I'll pass over have you applied the blood on your house Hallelujah have you apply the blood in your life oh are you so lazy about applying blood you now have so much time to do foolishness you find yourself living in sin because if you are busy doing God's business you don't have time oh you don't hear me this morning make yourself busy about the business of God and see God bless you see God make you prosper see God open doors for [Applause] you yes there is a flood there's a flood in our marriages there's something very wrong in the message very wrong in the message when people when we have just as much separation in marriage as in the world it may not be visible [Music] separation but there's no love in the house amen there's something very wrong in the message when brother brandham labored and Paul labored and irenius labored and Martin labored and Columba labored to bring a message to us for us not to be different from the world we read the quote we ought to be different we ought to do better because we have been given much and to who much is given much is expected if we spend more time praying and seeing seeking the will of God we'd have less problems with our children less problems with our marriages less problems with the person next to us behind us in front of us but when the enemy comes like a flood the spirit would raise a [Applause] standard Hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah no Revival prise God no breakthrough could come without sacrifice look through history every Revival came because of prayer came because of sacrifice the Bible told him in that day dig a valley full of ditches you haven't had rain but dig a valley but if you dig the valley cu the rain is coming the more you dig the more blessings that you're going to get and we are counting down 40 days to our convention and I'm saying the time has come for us to dig if you have never dug before if you have never prayed before if you have never read before we are calling for a time of consecration in this church a time of if you are in this church we are calling for a 40-day time of consecration what do you mean brother Isaac hallelujah amen every day in the morning yes you will make time to read you'll make time to pray you will cut movies out you will cut the television out you will turn down a pot if you have to there's one day we have a prayer fast a week you make another day your day but you consecrate yourself for God to do something in your family for God to do something in your home you who have worldly music I don't care how positive encouraging it is get it out throw it out throw it out separate yourself from the unclean things uh you and God to do something for you leave whatever you love leave it behind forget Sports forget it all the news can't even help you what we need is Jesus we don't need more news we don't need more politics I don't need to know what Trump is doing we need more Jesus a time of consecration sanctify yourselves sanctify your house sanctify Our Lives you set time out for your own walk if Jesus had to pray how much more we have to pray what are you doing wearing makeup what are you doing wearing the clothes you're wearing are you crazy and you want to come into the house of God and expect God to do something for you when the least that you could do he said present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy which is your reasonable service it's not a hard thing to do it's reasonable for you to present your body as a Living [Applause] Sacrifice [Applause] [Music] is Give me liberty or give me death there's no middle ground we could have no Revival on Middle Ground we could only have Revival if we are giving our all to God too many of us we give a lot we give 90% we give 92% % we give 75% we give 99% but God is a jealous God and he wants all of you he wants everything he wants all your worship he wants all your praise H he wants all your love uh he wants all your adoration he wants all your worship he wants to be your all in all he wants to be your everything he wants to be the reason you woke up in the morning he wants to be your is there anybody in the [Applause] house [Applause] the holy spirit is raising a standard here this morning hallelujah it's not a new standard it's the same standard it's the same standard that said sisters don't cut your hair it's the same standard that says you should cover your knees it's the same standard that says don't listen to worldly music it's the same standard that says pray every day it's the same standard that says read every day is the same standard that says to forgive it's the same standard that says be holy it's the same standard that says drop your hearts it's the same standard isn't a new standard is the same standard God will have a perfect Church it could be three people it could be five people it could be 10 people but oh God I want to be one of them I want to be one of them amen some through the fire some through the flood but all through the blood hallelu you can begin to play something softly prise the Lord hallelu hallu hallelujah the worst place Lord to ever be Hallelujah as a Christian Hallelujah is when you lose your sensitivity to the spirit Lord because when the word Goes Forth there's conviction that lets you know Lord I'm not living right that's oh Lord I need to do more Lord I've been trying but I could try more something should be happening friends if you stifle that Voice Hallelujah after a while brother brandham said you will no longer hear it and you lose your sensitivity and when you lose your sensitivity you're almost as good as finish R Jesus so I challenge you this morning if you hear that voice tugging at your soul Hallelujah saying come back home make things right you have given so much time effort Focus energy to so many other things and God is saying what about me what about my time what about your soul you spend so much time with the natural what about the things that are Eternal that will last I want every head bowed every eye closed throughout the sanctuary this morning maybe there's somebody here this morning Hallelujah maybe you have been in church for a while maybe you have not it doesn't matter thank you this is not between you and the church this is between you and God there's a call going out a cry going out Hallelujah to return unto the Lord hallelujah yes there are floods yes there are trials yes there are testing but you are called to higher purpose and God will never give you more than you could bear maybe you found yourself washing your net giving up on life giving up on everything but there's a word this morning and maybe like Simon Peter you can say Lord at Thy word I'm willing I'm willing to be a real Christian I'm willing to read the word of God every day I'm willing to pray every day I'm willing to fast and seek your face and Lord if I have to die with the Philistines let me die with the Philistine but once more Lord is there anybody in the house this morning is there
