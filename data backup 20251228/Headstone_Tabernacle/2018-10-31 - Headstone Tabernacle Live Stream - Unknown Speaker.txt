is very specific it is instructions of Joshua as to the land and as to what they have to possess it's not how many describe the land he describes the borders of the land he describes a closed describe the occupants of the land currently told them little by little once you clean go portion of land it matters all right keep it he said don't don't don't don't overtake let's align become desolate

shouting keep praising God stay active stay practicing the presence of Almighty God if you stand still or you'd be mocking time you'll be exactly where you are and it's a sad fact of life there's a lot of people that are contented where they are you look around you see people content maybe with where they are their allotted Porsche isn't that right or whatever they were able to possess isn't that right come around five years they got the same car they have the same house they got the same job doing the exact same thing they were doing five years ago hallelujah they're people like that and I wonder hallelujah what what what week's him up in the morning honey I wanted to look around and see he was seeing the same things around them or do they want more for themselves because there's more to be had it's more learn to be process hallelujah hallelujah ten shows but they go into the grave buried with all those great potentials inside of them some could have been this some could have been that God does not want that to be your state tonight cause something special for you we did not come all this way just to live on no no no hidden purpose hidden us why you are here tonight all you have to believe that oh that's got to wake you up in the morning it's got to drive you to prayer it's not to tributyl call on God that's what makes me put on my butt on my church because I know when I come into the house of God I come into my father's house the girl doesn't understand me people honest and me but caught on the stands because he knows all things and he put all things in existence he knows my name he knows my purpose tonight and he knows your purpose tonight he knows every time I have honor he know why he put them there he knows every grain of sand on the beach that is the infinite wisdom that is the infinite knowledge of God who knows all things he knows what trial you're going through tonight he knows what tests you're going to tonight he knows what you feel in your hearts he knows what burdens you you know what pains you he knows what you pray about he knows what you're looking for he knows what I'm asking for Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know do you think about when the nights are long and then lonely sometimes you find yourself alone maybe you stop praying or maybe you stop thinking thinking about that loved one thinking about that child thinking about that friend that brother Oh hallelujah thinking about that situation on your inner but tonight I challenge you all of the porters for possession tonight whatever you have need of he has already provided it tonight whatever you ask him for he already knows about it tonight all you have to do is ask rouhani says ask and you shall receive Oh [Music] oh if you ask anything in my name hallelujah you shall have it it's not that's anything that's anything the Bible says some things but it said ask anything not all some of the borders but all of the products whatever you desire and prayer believe that you have received oh come on now I need somebody who knows a Bible who knows a scripture what the scripture said these are the scriptures you use when you go down on your knees and your prayer time and you wave it in the devil's face I say I've got a promise for my family I've got a promise oh I loved one I've got a promise come on now for the Holy Ghost I've got a promise for

go to the Joshua campaign God is very instrumental and how he deals with the children of Israel isn't that right there's specific instructions and specific things are supposed to follow a man is now I go to Joshua when I'm about to take Jericho just got to wait for instructions isn't that you were sharpening his sword he was getting ready he was doing all that God told him to do he was told to one circumstance the children isn't there a key the ones who were born along the journey Brie's body had to be circumcised it's gotta be Alcorn hallelujah praise going on out here waiting on God what we were doing waiting for God waiting for his promise to be fulfilled isn't that the Prophet dramatized it is that the people talk maybe Joshua was washed up maybe the torch was finish maybe taught the address little five-minute a ministry maybe that's about it but he was waiting on his office he was waitin on some dirty place he was waiting on Selena's burner and he waited in prayer waited in reverence waited in obedience hallelujah waiting upon God waited for God to come and fulfill the promise he made to Joshua if God made a promise to Joshua okay Josh will go ahead and I try to make a promise but nothing is too hard for God tonight I say unto you to my record tonight is any trial there's any circumstance there's any situation and okay how hardheaded you feel your relatives how you feel a sunny for your tortoise I don't care how we would I don't care how paxil embrace car or disabled is anything too hard for God the appointed time he will visit you another time of life is coming

Sphero it and leave your ass out and they leave all the good stuff and they leave all the trials and they leave our intestines they take a pot they like Oh talk about rapture but you're not interrupting condition but it's come a time of all that we preach impart prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in pop will be thrown away in which what we are looking for is not a Ministry of God but what we are pressing towards tonight it's a miniature perfection it's a ministry of adoption where stone to be cut to fit into hallelujah hallelujah strong that is our ministry tonight that is why we are here tonight it's a greater purpose it's alcohol I don't watch is given much is expected where much is required at 9:00 [Music] and you've got fun but pre-scored this wood is going good tonight a man I know cord is he it's very specific in there right okay give instructions it's nice when Jesus was on the Mount and he ascended into heaven he gave specific instructions he told him Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high they had to wait there they had to tarry there the tyranny so wait they couldn't run off with their own thoughts they couldn't run off with their own ideas of how things was gonna turn out they had to wait for the power they couldn't empower themselves they felt the power before is not that's my to 10 power is not about waiting we'll wait to know what they were praying for what they were looking for without seen much 16 power power to heal the sick not power to raise the dead hallelujah power to positionally please the church for that time Ohana is night it was a pillar of fire stood over each and every one of them policing them as apostles that age want Russell thought

overflowing halleluyah halleluyah oh don't you know what your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom when they say lo the kingdom lo the king now don't you worry about it the kingdom is inside of you - snoring the kingdom is the word of God I've been preaching about Malachi turn into power inside your soul do you know what that means people run around people placing emphasis on a church emphasis on a group but God wants to turn individuals into his personal being the roads where he can lead you into the wilderness into the balanus but to know that God is with you you know that corners alive and he will not leave you comfortless he will not leave you lead a less but if he is needed you don't have to worry he can lead you to a ton of strong you don't have to learn you like
