name amen you love him tonight what a blessing it is to be gathered together once more amen amen thank you Jesus thank you brother Steven brother Anthony amen amen amen while you're standing if you have your Bibles i' like you turn with me to just one portion of scripture reading from The Book of Romans in chapter 12 just the first two verses there Romans 12 just verse 1 and two and it says I beseech thee therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that he present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen the Lord had a blessing to reading of his word may we just bow our heads as we open in a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord Lord we love you so much Lord words could hardly Express the way we feel about you Lord Lord we pray tonight that you have your perfect will in this service Lord Lord I pray that you anoint the the words that I would share Lord take me out of the way speak lip air to your people and I pray that You' speak directly to their hearts Lord Lord I pray that something be said tonight that would cause lives to be transformed and and Minds to be changed and hearts to be drawn Closer to You Lord Lord those that might be connected on the Internet or those that may see it afterwards Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit and your anointed would flow wherever they are and meet their every need Lord those that need to be healed sealed filled restored delivered set free Lord Lord you know your people you know the needs tonight Lord Lord I pray that you would have your perfect way Lord Lord I pray that everything will be in position that that no word would be said that you don't want said Lord Lord I pray that your message will strike home tonight Lord Lord I pray that you will bring it all together and Stitch it together Lord Lord that it may be a blessing to your people in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats you love the Lord tonight my I believe we're in for a time I believe something good good is about to happen and something good is in stored I don't believe we gathered together in vain I believe he has something predestinated and specially in store for us tonight amen hallelujah after reading that scripture I just want to say God isn't asking too much of you he's asking for what's reasonable amen he has a special desire for you to to be blessed but he also desires a sacrifice amen he desires that you give certain things up he desires that you live a particular way he desires that you operate a particular way Amen in saying that I want to say in in the natural if if you want to lose weight they say you need diet and exercise sometimes you need to give up some of the things that seem cool some of the things that you might like some some of the things that that you find oh gosh I can't do without this but you need to cut those things out because you have a goal of losing weight likewise if if you want to learn to cook or learn a trade or some something new sometimes you have to put aside extra time to take a class or a course or or you know to get some level of schooling or tutorship or so but you may need to sacrifice time where you could have been doing other things in order to upskill or rescale or retrain yourself amen so the the same thing would apply if you have to pass an exam sometimes you have to take time when everybody else is playing to to review your work and to do it over and to to make sure quote unquote they burn the Midnight Oil to ensure that you are prepared amen so you me you may need to sacrifice in different ways and at the same time if you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost you need to to to make certain changes you make need to make certain decisions you need to make certain sacrifices right and you need to put those things in place because you have a goal and objective and ambition to achieve particular things now God has outlined certain sacrifices that he want of and in this scripture we read Paul said listen he beg you he beseech you he call you he say by the mercies of God he want you to present your bodies a Living Sacrifice so he say listen I want you to be holy acceptable unto God he said that is your reasonable service so that's the sacrifice we want to talk about tonight your reasonable service the sacrifice that God has called you tonight to make in order to achieve the blessings and the things that he have set out for you amen now if you ever ever study the subject of Economics there's a concept called opportunity cost and that concept basically says what you give up in order to gain something else right and when you evaluate that I went and I even checked the meaning of sacrifice itself that that almost almost encapsulate or is the epitome of sacrifice because it says sacrif rice refers to the act of giving up something which is valuable so you're not going to give up anything he don't want your spare change he don't want your your off time that that you're not really so so busy so you give him that time no he want the valuable something to be given up he wants you to give up something that may seem meaningful to you when everybody else is doing it but you can't and you choose not to because you give that up and it goes go on to say or Surrender an offering for a sake of something that's regarded as more important amen so that's what we want to look at tonight the fact that God has called us to sacrifice something in order to gain something else that's deemed to be more important amen the same way if you have to get the Holy Ghost that must be more important than Ling with your friends that must be more important than watching TV that must be more important than spending time on social media that must be more important than some of the things you you you believe to be interesting some of the things you believe to be important you must find these things of God are so important so valuable that you're willing to give up the things that seem valuable to you amen I I know last Sunday you heard about the value of your home and the fact that Satan wants to div value that he wants to devalue you he wants you to to to feel less than you actually are but God wants to see appreciation God wants to see the value increase God wants you to see you apply the promises that he left for you to your life that you could become perfect that's his objective that's his goal he want to look down and say Hey There is my spirit flowing freely he want to look and see hey that's my son there he want to boast about you he want to say look I duplicate myself there you know look they they're doing Greater Works they're doing more they have a kind of faith that we could only compare to to to those of old the kind of Faith they have now I haven't seen this kind of Fai for a long time amen that's what you want to see and I want to take us back to the Old Testament when we look way back at Canaan Abel and there we would have seen they were called upon had a desire to make a sacrifice unto God simple Sunday school style Cain and Abel two brothers at the time called to make a sacrifice and in Hebrews 11 verse 1-4 it says now Faith is the substance of things hope for you know the scripture the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and in verse four he said by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he became dead he being dead yet speaketh so what we learn here is that there are sacrifices that could be made but there's also a more excellent sacrifice is the kind of sacrifice that God could look at and be pleased and say that is what I desire that is what I want once again it's not my opinion and my idea but what does God want for me what does God want from me you know just before I slip past and I almost forgot my title tonight is where is your sacrifice because a time comes when God calls you to make a sacrifice and he wants to see it and he asks you where where is it you had all the time to prepare you had all the time to work on it but I come to assess it now where is your sacrifice so that's the question tonight where is your sacrifice and speaking of of Cain and Abel there the prophet in a message end time the end time paragraph 40 he said I'll review a certain thing here I said last night if God only required religion if that's all he required then and Cain was justified so that's not it Cain Come Just As believing just the same as Abel believed Cain come with a sacrifice just the same as Abel came with a sacrifice but Cain's sacrifice was by works he raised his garden brought his fruits the best he could find by works but Abel was justified by faith he come with a lamb watch you'll see where fanaticism began you'll see where every one of these Cults begin you'll see where all this confusion begin and by God's help May the Holy Ghost place it in every heart here this afternoon I say tonight so deeply it'll never come out right so God is not in confusion he wants things very very clear and he's hopeful that by the end of this that you'll be so clear as to what is required of you you wouldn't wouldn't make a mistake you wouldn't be mixed up and confused as to what he requires down in paragraph 44 he says they were brothers in the same church so church is not it group is not it Association is not it it still comes back to an individual Revelation amen he said there were brothers in the same church amen oh I love the word look it sets life in you notice that's God's word now when Cain offered his sacrifice religious bowed down in worship and as far as fundamentally he was just as fundamental in his religion as Abel was so he had a form of godliness he did all the right things he knew the right things just like Abel if God talk about fundamentalism God requires worship can worshiped God requires sacrifice cane give a sacrifice but he did it in the wrong way we're going to start with this cause I see times moving quickly now let's start with these two Vines right here I can take anything that you wish to that's on Earth today and show you in Genesis and she's coming to the seed now that's why we got so much confusion so we don't want confusion tonight it's putting out otherwise see like a grain of wheat started with a grain but it ends up with many grains that's where all these isms come from all this nonsense come from where all this adultery come from where all this immorality come from it began in Genesis in the beginning skipping down to to paragraph 46 notice these two coming now out of Genesis let's bring them up there he was Cain as soon as he seen that God blessed Abel he became jealous is that right a religious worshipper becoming jealous imagine that now Cain died but not his Spirit then he come over and killed his brother is that right perfect type of Judas and Jesus again see let's bring them on further we could bring on Bring It On Through To The Ark all the way but I want to get something to you before it's time to get away notice let's bring them up on through the Bible watch in the days God called Israel out of Egypt perfect type of the church and when he already come out God that night give Israel a command by a lamb to make a sacrifice kept up 14 days must be found without blemish and was killed in the evening time all Israel laid their hands on him and then he was killed the blood was put on a little old doors and so forth and went it under the blood and stayed under blood once it stayed under the blood until the marching time come perfect type of Christ no one could find any fault in him pilate said Bring Me Some Water I'll wash my hands of him the Roman Centurion truly that's the Son of God speaking about about Jesus Judah said I betrayed innocent blood no one could find fault in him the perfect sacrifice he was the faultless Lamb of God that was tried before the wicked rulers of this world then in the evening all Israel give witness to his death let his blood be upon us and our children and he was killed there wasn't a bone broken in his body the sacrificial lamb of course perfect type so here it shows God is not just looking for a a sacrifice he's looking for perfection ction he's looking for a perfect sacrifice you know too many of us want to be blessed we want to see the rewards we want to see the results but we're not willing to let go and to sacrifice the way God wants us to we're not willing to trust him and take him at his word it's your reasonable service Paul said he said listen he want you give your body a living sacrifice for it's your reasonable service that's what's required of you when we look at Abraham in Genesis 22:9 he say they came to a place which God told them of now this is when God tempted a Abraham to sacrifice his son he said they came to a place where God told him of and Abraham built an altar so it wasn't just make a sacrifice before your sacrifice you need to build an altar you need to make an altar before you sacrifice amen you say there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heavens and said Abraham Abraham he said here here am I in verse 12 and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything upon him for now I know that thou feest God seeing thou had not withheld thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him for burnt offering in instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen in verse 15 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn said the Lord for because thou had done this thing and hath not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy so there we see it's not just about building an altar and making a sacrifice but that yielded instant results the angel said listen in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven so it means your sacrifice has the power to impact your seed and your generations to come it's not just about you your sacrifice for your seed and your Generations as well it's that important it's important to them they don't even know it but it's important that you do it to ensure their success to ensure their blessing cuz it said in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sand upon which upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy so if you want your seed possess the gates of the enemy the sacrifice came first the altar came first those things had to be in position for God to be able to bless this way now in a message and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy paragraph 55 it says now I want you to notice that this promise that God made Abraham wasn't only just to Abraham I want you to catch this now but it was to his seed after him now many people say oh if I had have to be like Abraham if I had been where God had talked to me and give me the Assurance like he did Abraham then I would have you know I would really have faith brother brandom if I just had if God had talk to me like he did Abraham but you listen you have the same promise that Abraham had that is if you are Seed of Abraham then you say but brother brandham I'm a gentile I could not have the Seed of Abraham listen the Seed of Abraham wasn't the natural seed this is for you now it was a spiritual seed for the circumcision of that was nothing the promise he even give him before circumcision but it was given to him before circumcision and it wasn't because he was circumcised and in the Covenant with God that way is because Abraham believed God and the scripture said that when we are dead in Christ we become Abraham's seed Paul speaks of it and that which is Jew is not Jew outwardly but Jew inwardly therefore if you are born of the spirit of God you are Abraham's seed and are HS with Abraham according to the promise see therefore every promise that God give Abraham is yours because spiritually you are Abraham's seed so God listen God love you so much that he gave the example of Abraham to show the connection between you and him to show that you are the Seed of Abraham so the same promises he made to Abraham are applicable to you today amen is he places such great value on your sacrifice you know we've gone through the story of Moses many many times and we talk about the burning bush and the attraction and and God hearing the cries of the people and come down but one of the things he often said he said listen I don't want you to go and take them out of Egypt and send them to the promised land because I want to do that he said but I want them to come there to make sacrifice unto me not just come because I want them to take a trip I want you to take a journey no no no no no I want you to move them for a reason they can't make sacrifice unto me in Egypt and need them in position and need the altar to be rebuilt for this sacrifice to be made in Exodus 3:14 it says and God said unto Moses I am that I am and we know it and he said that thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am had sent me unto you and God said moreover unto Moses thus shal thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord of your fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob had sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my Memorial unto all generations go and gather the Elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done unto you in Egypt and I have said I will bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites unto the land flowing with milk and honey that's a Promised Land amen and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shal Come Thou and the Elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto him the Lord God of the Hebrews had met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the Wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord Our God that was the purpose that was the message let us go let's travel for three days that we may offer sacrifice unto God Amen now often times even though we are called to do these things there are voices competing interests distractions that may come along the way to shift us off course to get us away from the Target and just like that we found that same scenario took place and and brother brandham expressed it in in modern events and made clear by prophecy paragraph 109 he says now we find out bam of course he couldn't see he went out and looked upon the people and said now just a minute we are a great big people up here you're just a scattered Bunch you see and we all we all believe the same God sounds nice that's true they all believe the same God they all worship Jehovah look at balam's sacrifice seven altars God's perfect number the seven Church pies see seven Rams speaking of the coming of the Lord fundamentally he was just as fundamental as Moses was but you see there wasn't a Divine Vindication in there but they were both prophets but under Moses Ministry there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire a light that hung with a camp there was Divine Healing there was a shout of the king in the camp Great Signs Divine Healing and wonders and things performed among them it was a sign of a living God among his people fundamentally they were both right and balam tried to persuade the people he tried and bewitch them into it when just before they reach the promised land just when they are on the verge of the Breakthrough just when it seems like you're almost there he comes to distract you he say but now I'm afraid this is a hard day or two they'd be in the promised land you say but now I'm afraid this is a hard Mark to make some of these days I'll shut for it but remember this the churches are being Bewitched by this equal Council he's taking you right into it saying you're the same group you're not the same group come out from among that stuff and be separated certainly is it's true we to keep away from that stuff as far as you can from it bam said we're um let let your children marry together because after all we believe the same God how can two walk together because after all we Les they they be agreed how can you walk with God L you're agreed with his word how can you add Creeds and so forth to it when you're ordained not to do it or commanded not to do it you can't do it there's no way of doing it brother sister you can't mix the leaven with the unleavened oil and water will not mix Darkness and Light will not mix light so much powerful it's just put the darkness out and so we cannot mix it together neither can you mix sin and the world together you can't mix the church and denomination together you can't mix church and Creed together you can't mix the world and the gospel together it won't mix come out from among them be separated said God I'll receive you to myself you'll be my sons and daughters I'll be God to you we can never do it until these things are manifested and the word of God for the always proed to be the truth following the footsteps amen amen so it proves your faith when you could be obedient to to the word of God and make sacrifice as he desires as he requires and not be distracted by every win and Doctrine and every fancy word and every fancy tongue amen I want to quickly move to Elijah and in the book of First Kings chapter 18 it says and Elijah said unto all the people speaking of another sacrifice here and just to to to to paint a picture here we had 400 so-called prophets spending some time trying to get God to come and consume their sacrifice trying to get God to approve what they had laid before him and Elijah came and in in verse 30 it says Elijah said unto all the people he said everybody come come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar here we see it again the first thing he did was rebuild the altar get it in the condition it was before before the unbelief before the distractions he had to rebuild it when he build it up and he repaired it this altar is the one that was broken down and in verse 31 and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put wood in order and cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood pour it all over and he said do it a second time just in case just to ensure that I don't take the praise that IID don't take the glory and we don't say you know it's a heat spell and perhaps at this this time this hour the sun is so hot it it might catch a fire no pour some more water make sure it have no chance of unbelief and doubt make sure we're very sure what is taking place here make sure nobody else could take the glory amen he said do it again do it a second time and they did it the second time and he said do it a third time and they did it a third time and the water ran round about the Altar and he filled the trench of Al with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and I am thy servant and I have done the things at Thy word this is not a doing my own ideas and I doing my thoughts and I trying to follow follow what what brother so and so doing know because I like that program no no no he said listen I am following at your word at your word I will do as you require of me I will rebuild the Altar and offer a sacrifice the way you want it in verse 37 he said hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou has turned their heart back again amen then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed a burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and picked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god that's what we need today brothers and sisters listen in a message God's provided way the prophet said paragraph 146 he said that's what we need that's what we need bring every believer together just like Elijah brought the people together he said bring every believer every believer together and preach the gospel don't hold anything back but preach a full gospel of Christ until the baptism of the Holy Ghost is poured up upon the whole church that's the only way to have a Revival so here you get the prescription if you want to Revival this is what you have to do get everybody together and preach in season out of season friend or no friend line upon line precept upon precept and you'll see the Revival come not by the minister but by the people getting together in one mind one Accord he said now get everything together get me a stone here to represent each one of them put his sacrifice upon it walked out there and he said now Lord let it be known that thou art a god of heaven and I am your prophet and the fire Begin to Fall brother when the Methodist can forget that they're just the only people on earth and the Baptists they're the only Pentecostals they're the only amen Hallelujah we can all get ourselves together and say Lord send the fire we're going to get somewhere that's right when the oness Pentecost the Tess Pentecost the threeness Pentecost and Fess Pentecost and all them can get their head together when all the Methodist can forget about sprinkling or whether you're baptized or whether you're poured or what whe whether you do this and everybody get together forget all about all them little old things and say God send the power everything will take care of itself get the heart right with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will take care of the rest of it yes sir amen I believe in that kind of a Revival get God provided way roll up the stone of Salvation I believe that roll up the stone of speaking in tongues I believe that roll up the stone of interpretation I believe that roll up the stone of Divine Healing I believe that bre Brethren get ready for the fire now that's sure now I'm just going to forget all about uh theology Lord I'm just rolling up those stones I'm going to lay myself right across and say oh Lord burn me up burn me up he will do it don't worry he'll get you that's the way you want to do it brother take everything out of your mind and let God word his word be the provided way that's the way we do it not a Methodist ritual not this and and that that ritual this theology or that theology let the Bible be right God said let my word be true and every man's a lie the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic Lutheran everybody else I'll pour my spirit upon All Flesh come out from among them my people that you not that be not partakers of their sin I will receive you amen that's the call of God tonight T yes sir you know at the end of the day this call to bring a sacrifice unto God is not just a command it's something that must be done out of love because you love God and you want to please him you sacrifice and you do it the way he wanted he desires that you present a perfect sacrifice because you love him that's what he wants from from you as we know Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice in John 3:16 it says for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen amen and in the in a message of token paragraph 82 he says and now how could there be a more perfect sacrifice than God himself becoming the atonement himself when God was made flesh in his own creative blood that the only way that a life of God could ever come back because all of us were born by sex and therefore the life that's in there is of the world and that life will not stand amen it's the thing that's already judged and condemned you can't patch it up there's no way to patch it up there's no way to smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die that's the only requirement there is it's got to die this old flesh man has got to die and the substitute a life of Jes Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ amen so many examples before us musician could get get ready we're just about winding down amen now in a message power of transformation that's what we need to be transformed amen paragraph 256 say is that right he said listen you can't cross that line he don't want you to cross that line he gives you an opportunity now to part yourself to him to surrender to him to be obedient to his word amen he say like the children of Israel did in their Journey coming through the Wilderness Israel did the same after they heard moses' message and seen it Vindicated listen to a false prophet that said oh now look children we were all the same and we went through just now we should marry one one among another and we should do this and that and and Moses told them differently just like the prophet today the prophet message is there as a as a really specific guide you have all the books and tapes and it's accessible but at times we choose to be distracted and inadvertently we are distracted but we have a call tonight to go back go back to his word back to the Bible back to the message back to the promises that are yours amen Moses told them different and seen God vindicate it because bam seemed to be a more instructive man than Moses was see he had come from a great nation where there was a great people and was all organized together the land of Moab great armies and great things that the people in them days would have fared and here come a prophet down a prophet anointed one false anointed one see come down to an anointed one look how close and taught the people and many of them went after that don't you never forget that see went after the thing that wasn't the word the Vindicated proven word don't let someone come in here and tell you something different watch what God is vindicating and proving now if them people look back and say Moses god appeared in the skies and a man spoke into existence fleas flies frogs took out of existence boils and diseases open up the Red Sea and we came and fed us Mana Out of Heaven oh that's our Prophet but here come another Prophet down glory to God I'm a prophet too say now you all I tell you no now you understand I use better grammar than Moses and am this way and that way see and so forth and the first thing you know they fell for it that's why we study the scripture that's why you study the message I will study the Bible so you can say just what the tapes say that you could hold on to every promise of God [Music] Amen now you say I use better grammar than Moses I'm this way and that way and so forth and the first thing you know they fell for it and every one of them perished right in the wilderness not one of them lived they never did they won't be in heaven not one of them Jesus said they said our fathers eat Mana in the wilderness and he said see Pentecostal is right see they had really come through all the experiences see Pentecostal is right they come true all the experiences they are a f man in the wilderness he said and they are everyone dead death is eternal separation they'll never rise again although they had been through all these experiences with Moses figuratively speaking they had spoken in tongues danced in the spirit and everything but when it come to the showdown between the word and the two prophets between the two prophets one of them on the word and the other one off the word both of them Prophets You Understand amen one on the word the other one off the word both of them prophets proven to be prophets but one with the word see false anointed ones in the last days prophets both to them prophets one on the word Vindicated by the word and the other one not Vindicated by the word Cain and Abel again see two faults one false one true all right you see when God calls for your sacrifice I want you tonight to remember Romans 12 that scripture read where Paul said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice we've seen all the examples we've seen the byproduct of having your sacrifice the right way of rebuilding the altar of giving up and the blessing associated with that when you not be tossed to and through when you could believe and stand fixed and firm on the word of God he say holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and in verse two said and be not conform to this world don't just try to be like you like like the world because somebody else being blessed because somebody else look and they sound a particular way no no no no no at the end of the day you have to stand by faith knowing that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God may God richly bless you oh can we all stand this evening oh Hallelujah let's just
