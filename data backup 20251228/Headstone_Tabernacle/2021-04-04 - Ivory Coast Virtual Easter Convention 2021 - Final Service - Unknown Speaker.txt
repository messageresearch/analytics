convention amen so god bless you as he comes amen we appreciate his words and receiving in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you amen so i created a convention in abidjan in ivory coast easter convention and around the world and it's an easter convention we know we're just before islam but i want to say a happy easter hallelujah amen let is to be every day in your life hallelujah in my life hallelujah so i say happy easter praise the lord and easter amen praise the lord easter is a time of resurrection hallelujah easter is a time of dynamic and easter is a time of the proof of the holy spirit and of life hallelujah a vindication of the promise hallelujah praise the lord and so we are in another easter amen praise the lord that jesus christ is so present tense hallelujah and jesus becomes present tense in our lives hallelujah amen a time of proof a time in power and in the ministry of christ amen and it hit me and it's so powerful the ministry of christ the bride is gonna have the same ministry as christ had it the same ministry it's about a ministry hallelujah that is allotted to us and it comes by the way of a promise hallelujah so i want to create amen brother paul honor checker i greet you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ i appreciate you hallelujah and redeem it a blessing to know you and to know the church and to know all gathered down there in your place hallelujah and i want to create all the ministers praise the lord may god use you also trinidad for thank you for putting it together brother obi brother isaac and all other ministers god bless you mightily in this time and season we are looking forward for a manifestation of resurrection power we're coming with some ministry in our personal lives hallelujah that's what i'm looking for amen praise the lord and i want to read from you may stand up first corinthians 1 and verse 4 i thank my lord always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ that in everything you are enriched by him in all utterances and in all knowledge even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ and that is what are we awaiting in our personal life we are waiting for the coming of the lord jesus christ in ours amen praise the lord and in a german translation in the amplified it is written not a coming of the lord but a revelation of jesus christ that he reveals himself to us that the whales are broken up and we see jesus christ amen and his ministry again in our lives amen verse 8 who after he has revealed and manifested himself to you who shall also confirm you to the end and now we are waiting for the revelation and the coming of the lord jesus christ amen personally reveal to us christ coming out of the pages of the book coming out in our lives by a harmony of the words and it struck me so much when christ is coming christ is not coming alone he's coming with a ministry when christ comes there's always a ministry connected to it and at the end time another ministry is connected and this ministry when jesus comes is going to be the same ministry as it was when jesus christ was on the earth and the same ministry that adams should have had and should have shown as a manifestation but it was vindicated in jesus christ and a wave chief with the prophet and again in the pride hallelujah brother branham in the statue of a perfect man hallelujah praise the lord you you may be seated if you want amen hallelujah he says so watch this here's the key he says so face take the little hinges of the scriptures and unlocks the glories and the good of god hallelujah so face takes that little hinges face gets a grip into the little hinges hallelujah and it unlocks the prophet says the glories and the good of the lord out to his people so its face holds the key that unlocks christ to the people and i said christ doesn't come alone but christ comes with a ministry so face unlocks that hallelujah face unlocks heaven hallelujah and the goodness of the lord jesus christ amen what happened in the garden of adam adam had a ministry adam had a key but he doubted and he lost the ministry that's what adam lost he still believed in god he still believed in the promise but he lost the ministry of it but christ came back two thousand years ago and restored it back and he got the key out of hell he got on easter he got a key and he came back victorious and so now the pride has the key and he's gonna have to make same ministry the key unlocks the ministry of jesus christ amen what it takes what does it take it takes the same condition that jesus had and jesus was in brother brahm says the word of god look at jesus he says the word of god flowed through him so freely before he said through a sinless nature that even he could speak a word and it would create so you see that showed who he was who can create but god see god is the only creator there and he was so in perfect harmony that's one i want to emphasize jesus himself was in a perfect harmony hallelujah him and the word was so perfectly together until he created hallelujah he and he and the word began being won hallelujah so the harmony with the word the harmony with the promise and a face into it the harmony in the face hallelujah it will unlock the heaven and you will start to create hallelujah it takes a perfect harmony as jesus was he said not my will i can nothing do except i see the father doing hallelujah jesus when he healed the sick he was in perfect harmony with the world when he raised the dead when he broke the bread he was in perfect harmony with the word hallelujah when they spit on him he still was in perfect harmony when he was on the cross jesus was still in the same perfect harmony and he was so much in the heart in in the in harmony with the world that when his body was laying there in the grave the body itself was had to be in the harmony with the world and it was raised up on the third day because even the body had to obey and be in harmony with the world and so shall we be in harmony with the world that one day our body is going to change because we are in harmony back in the world amenity brother abraham speaks about that and we heard it on friday in a message shalom and brother branham speaks about it he speaks about the great symphony let me just strike it that and brother branham said the director and the composer must be in the same spirit and it's so he says master musicians be in the same spirit to act it all out it must be a perfect harmony like the little wheel in the watch a perfect harmony hallelujah and he says brother prince says you must begin in the music like he did so let's like he did i can do nothing except i see the father doing it final quote in a message the spoken word is the original seat paragraph 420 says notice what harmony it starts with harmony jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first a harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 and then he says so will the pride hallelujah we will be in the same harmony as jesus christ was hallelujah praise the lord so will the pride and he shows her the word of life he shows her and she receives it hallelujah that can start a revival and start a harmony she never doubts it and then he says here's the secret he says the word is in the pride hallelujah praise the lord it's ready for harmony time it's ready easter harmony time the word is in the pride and the mind of christ to know what's to be done to the word we what he wants to done with the word and what does he want done with the word he wants harmony for the ministry of christ to come forward in your life that's what he wants and she does it in his name and she has thus as the lord hallelujah they only will do his will perfect harmony lord i can do nothing except i see you show it me in your word perfect harmony satan has no entrance in this harmony no entrance in this symphony it's playing perfect and we are joining into it we're getting into the rhythm of it it's a perfect harmony and no one can persuade them differently they have dust as the lord or they keep still that's the perfect harmony and then they will do the works of god for it's himself in them continuing his word to fulfill and he did complete in his days so it's him fulfilling it the ministry of christ in your life it's him fulfilling the promise in your life a ministry of christ again was like it was in edom but this time hallelujah the this pride the prophet said it shall not fail and let me say these words i really thought about it how can i express it in a few words faith in his word brings you in full harmony with the word to unlock the heavens and to reveal christ in you the hope of glory for a vindication of the ministry of christ there's gonna be a vindication of the ministry of christ in you in every pride member around the world there's gonna be this vindication hallelujah and the prophet says when the last promise is vindicated then there will come an eternal peace upon the earth an eternal shalom and i say happy easter shalom to the pride we are back to the harmony for a reason for a vindication of the ministry of christ god bless you as the convention continues god be with you and let that harmony join in that harmony joining that rhythm halloween get in that step hallelujah and we're gonna see us on the other side god bless you praise the lord amen amen amen amen and amen hallelujah let's just stand glory to god we

your love was bigger than our sin your love was bigger than our guilt your love is bigger than any situation and we come to you lord knowing that in this easter season lord in this virtual convention lord you have already blessed in so many ways and you are continuing to bless and deliver your people now lord as we come to this service lord may you take complete control and lord may you take me completely out of the way lord and may you speak to your people lord we are totally dependent upon you lord if there's someone lord who doesn't know you may they come to know you by revelation and by

father lord may you get glory and may you get honor may you get praise and worship to your holy name lord we commit the service into your hands we commit lord your people into your hands father use me as just a microphone and may you speak lip to hear to your children we are completely waiting on you in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen so before i do my greetings i do want to get to this scripture if you have your bibles would you turn with me to one portion of scripture and we're going to be in the book of romans romans 8 and uh in romans this is a part of the scripture of the inspiration of this meeting so we're going to read from romans 8 and reading from verse 19. romans 8 and verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation grown it and travail it in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body and in this same romans 8 i'd like us to go down to verse 31 just a little later down in the same chapter what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it who is he that condemn it it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come no height no depth no any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning this evening whenever you'd be connecting to this service and everybody feeling fine what a season we're living in what a time and what a virtual convention i certainly want to salute our precious brother paul owner jacob his wife his family and the golden age tabernacle cote d'ivoire ivory coast for the vision and the burden to have this virtual uh easter convention and i know that no matter what point you're you're connecting in it's a blessing it will be a blessing and it is a blessing you believe that this morning amen and i certainly want to greet all the ministers that would minister uh speak in the convention and all the ministers that would bring greetings and for all of the specials the song leaders the musicians the technicians the production teams in the various churches and all the ministers and churches who would connect life as well as experience the convention at some point and for all of the helps and governments in churches near and far that have supported this convention for the honor and glory of god and for all the believers that would be connected and amen you could put your hands together [Applause] and i want to salute the local church hatsune aminaki here for their prayers support feet and the atmosphere of worship because it's the atmosphere that brings the results hallelujah [Applause] that anointing of worship that atmosphere of despite what's going on in your life you recognize that he is worthy of the praise he is worthy of the worship worship has nothing to do with how you feel it has all to do with who god is worship has nothing to do with what happened yesterday it has all to do with that he is our king he is our lord he is our redeemer he is our master he is our king not just king but king of kings he is not just lord but he is lord of lords he is mighty in battle and in this easter season when we come together to remember and every time every day is a memory a reminder that he is risen but in this meeting we come to to calibrate back who we are in god and and remind ourselves that he is not dead he is alive and because he lives we can live all soap because he is raised from the dead we also raise with him hallelujah and that's our position as believers you believe that this morning amen and brother paul uh was led with a really really powerful a big mountain of inspiration for these meetings uh the theme of the convention is the manifestation of the sons of god as they were in the garden of eden i'll say that one more time the manifestation of the sons of god as they were in the garden of eden with an inspiration the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ are the same ministry what a statement to know that the ministry of christ and the ministry of the bride is the same thing a continuation of the book of acts it was not acts of the apostles but it was the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles and what we are continuation of that book of acts we are an extension of what god's plan was that's unfolding in this hour and in this season and nothing is going to stop it the pandemic cannot stop it lockdown cannot stop it what the government does cannot stop it what the economy does cannot stop it because this manifestation of the sons of god must come to pass amen so you know in these virtual conventions uh you know you you you are not able to hear what everybody preaches and so you're moving by inspiration and i don't know if what will be said in this service would have been said already but if it is said before and it is said again today it is it is just because god wants to bring emphasis on something so we want to stay in the spirit and stand a great expectation for god to do something special for us because we are looking at the same target we are focused on the same vision we are looking at this this sun's coming back into position and and and we're all around this same mountain of power this mountain of adoption this mountain of suns coming back to take back from the devil what was stolen from us sons coming back hallelujah father's back in position mothers back in position housewives adopted ministers adopted believers in their place hallelujah glory to god amen so oh my so i do have a title this evening or this morning and uh whenever the lord will have this this message to be part of the meeting and uh i do believe that the law give me something here and i trust that it comes from a different angle and it'll be a blessing to you so for a title this evening the sons of god will have the final answer the sons of god will have the final answer and a subject what shall we then say to these things that's a subject it's a question what shall we then say to these things and an inspiration we have the devil's answer can the church say man so just to lay a background i'm a simple preacher i know the the they are there are some some some really strong preachers who i don't consider myself one of them i'm a simple preacher i'm a bible student i'm a i'm a bible preacher and i i'm comfortable in that element there so i want a little background before i get to the thought this morning and it's that life is full of questions there are many questions you go to live life is full of questions who am i what is my purpose what must i do where should i go when should i do it what career i'm supposed to have what church should i go to all these are questions some simple some are complex but every day we are faced with questions what should i wear what scripture should i read questions and more questions and these are some of the questions we ask ourselves but then there are questions that we are asked that other people ask us where are you what were you doing what time did you arrive what is your plan what do you want what do you need then there are questions that we could ask of other people how can i help you how are you doing when asked you ask somebody how are you doing not not as a formality but because you're really interested in how are you doing questions such as how can i help and there's this thing about questions and i want you i'm building a background we're going somewhere questions can be used to investigate questions can be used to research questions can be used to test so to validate if you know something you have an exam and the examination comes in the form of questions questions can be used to challenge hallelujah and and we'll see it in scripture are you for us or are you against us that's a question that's used as a challenge questions can be used to embarrass could anything good come out of nazareth anybody with me this morning questions can be used to confirm are you a christian questions can be used to teach questions can be used to convict is your heart right with god are you living the right way questions can be used to make you think questions can be used to cause you to reflect unanswered questions can lead to fear you don't know if you're doing the right thing so you're asking questions is this the right place to work is this the right church to be in is it all these are questions and when the questions are not answered they can lead to fear they can lead to concern they could lead to uncertainty they could lead to being misinformed when questions are answered you get clarity you get direction you get purpose and you can get insight anybody with me this morning we're going somewhere i'm kind of teaching a little bible study a little preaching but i want to encourage you a little bit they are different types of questions they are open questions open questions give you room to run to answer the question so how would you approach this particular situation it's an open question you could answer it how you feel led so how you feel about the law that's a that's an open question you could you could take it anywhere you want so i feel that he's my king he's my god he's my waymaker it's a it's an open question you can take it however you want to take it they are closed questions close questions focus your answer on yes or no are you a disciple that's what peter was asked a close question there was there was no room for him to maneuver to answer some other kind of way there was no halfway answer in the closed question anybody with me this morning then there are loaded questions a loaded question is to try to trap you like many times they ask jesus presence to try to trap jesus so a loaded question is like did you take two pieces of chicken or three pieces of chicken no matter how you answer the question you are admitting to taking the chicken i'm giving you an option did you take two pieces or three pieces but the motive for asking the question could be really to ascertain if you were the one who took the chicken in the first place so that's a loaded question then we have rhetorical questions rhetorical questions uh young people say you're asking answers so are we in church today that's a that's a question but it's it's a rhetorical question we know we're here anybody with me there are leading questions are you sure you want to go tomorrow it's a question but there's a there's an element of the question that could motivate your decision to do or not do are you sure depending on how i ask the question it could place doubt in your hand are you sure you really want to do that so it's a leading question and depending on the motive of the person asking the question it could take you somewhere you have a problem with brother so and so don't you that's a leading question it's to carry you to a certain place even if you didn't have a problem and brother so and so all of a sudden you better think of all the possible problems that you might have had with brother so and so but he didn't shake my hand last week i do have a problem with brother sue and so i didn't realize it until you made me aware of the problem i didn't know i had that's a leading question and i'm not going to go on and on because i'm showing you there are different types of questions they are probing questions they are funnel questions they are recall questions when were you saved when when did the lord call you anybody with me so i'm saying all of this because we are talking about going back to sons of god back in edom and i want to bring to your attention that before or outside of god having a direct communication with adam in eden outside of the communication between god and adam the first question recorded in scripture is what did god say the beginning of the fall of man started with a question before this question what did god say there were no questions i'll say it one more time outside check it in your bible outside of god speaking directly to adam there was no reason for adam to ask god a question there was no reason for god to ask adam a question there was full transparency adam was in his position of authority he was in his position of supreme control what he needed to know he knew god gave him everything he needed to be king ruler god of this earth and what if branham said he wasn't wondering what he was about he wasn't perplexed or mortified or concerned or questioning why am i here he knew why he was there he knew that every place he put his foot was his [Applause] he had no questions so when we're going back to eden we're going back to where there's no doubt there's no question there's no confusion there's no wandering anybody with me [Applause] we're building so that first question what did god say because a question can be used depending on the motive and the agenda the question what did god say was not for satan to get clarity it was not for satan to get understanding on knowledge it was to try to exploit weakness so his question was asked what a motive so when people ask you questions you have to know where they're coming from what are they trying to achieve what are they trying to do because the fall of man started with it seemed an innocent question even now if i ask that question it'll be considered positive what did god say about healing what did god say about revival what did god say about perfection in isolation the question is not the problem but the motive behind the question was the issue back there in genesis anybody with me this morning just a little teaching to encourage you a little bit right how this question was handled is connected to everything that follows because eve had a choice with how to respond to that question and we have choices with how we respond to the questions that come our way i want you to remember my title is the sons of god will have the final answer and you only answer to a question right and my subject what shall we then say to these things this was a question that paul asks to the romans and i have an inspiration we have the devil's answer which is taken directly from what the prophet said can we can we keep going today i trust it will be an encouragement to you so how this question even was answered is connected to everything that followed eve could have said i'm not answering this question wait till adam come home there was a choice and she chose to answer the question not expecting or suspecting that there was an ulterior motive we studied in the study of joseph when the father asked the sons jacob after something why did you tell them about your family they said he he asked questions about us we didn't how were we to know that he was going to try to lock up our brother we had no way the questions came across innocently anybody with me so we have to appreciate the fact that satan had been kicked out out of heaven he had lost access to many things and his question is what you call a probing question he was he was probing what did what did god say here hallelujah so that first question asked in genesis was what did god say and the second question is adam adam the first question now created a context and a situation for a follow-up question or or a second question or a needed question because the way the first question was addressed and answered created a situation that required god to ask where are you adam and that's not a question to acquire information because it's not as if god didn't know where he was i want us to appreciate the kind of question this is it was not adam what is your location it was adam what is your condition i know where you're at you're you're it's only eaten there's only garden here we have other i'm not searching for you or not but but where are you standing because you're not where i left you anybody with me so as scriptures were written some questions were answered and we realized that as we got deeper understanding of the mysteries of god new questions would continue to emerge because as adam and eve were reluctantly pushed out of eden they would have had the question how do we get back how do we get back can we get back is there a way to get back because adam knew what it felt like before the fall and it's difficult to have experienced that and to feel the loss now and not wonder how do i come back to my first love how can i get back and our scriptures would unfold can we begin to warm up now the background is over i'm done with the background as it begins to unfold we see true scripture questions being asked and being answered and built up over the ages hallelujah we find abraham who is asking a question there has to be a better place than i'm living in and he begins to ask questions is there a city somewhere that i can go to that's not this and he began to look because he had a question about a city whose maker and builder is god anybody with me this morning oh hallelujah and as we go on we see job job in fact job's situation started with a question because we said it before question to be used to encourage to challenge to invite him to inquire so god says to the devil have you considered my servant job god challenged him he started battle with a question oh come on now somebody helped me this morning he started a confrontation with a question he said have you considered myself on job the devil responds to other questions you know please protect how wyatting job is so it's because of you he's so and the questions are continuing and god is getting ready for the answers come on now somebody preach back to me oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated oh this is easter now let's build in the message show us the father and it will suffice us it'll satisfy us but the man is speaking about job he said job in his condition job begin to ask other questions he began to say who is god where is god could i see god so we have a situation that building of abraham had a question that took his day when he died it wasn't answered it was an unanswered question he was seeking a city and builder and who maker was god he never met the city he met the god but it wasn't time yet for the answer to his question oh come on now i hope you get to me this morning hallelujah job in his sheep in his situation in his persecution a question had opened up what he was going through but out of that question and that confrontation there were no new questions joe began to look at his existence he said who is god where is god could i see god i'm reading from the prophet it's been the cry through the ages even job the most perfect man in his day he wanted to know wanted to don't meet he had a question if he could find where he was he wanted to meet god he knew there had to be a way maybe to go up to his door knock at the door if he could only see him or anybody with me this morning what's the question on your heart this morning oh what's the desire in your soul this morning and but emanum goes on everyone who is born in this it that's got a soul order trying to look beyond the curtain to see where they come from what they are and where they are going these are questions we live with every day am i doing the right thing am i living the right way will i be healed will i be delivered will my son be delivered will my home be restored when will the revival begin i've been holding on for years but lord don't pass me by and you're living with these questions i've got news for you there's an answer to all these questions there's an answer to the creation groaning and travailing there's an answer oh come on now oh hallelujah brother branham said everyone who is born on this earth that's got a soul all they're trying to look beyond the curtain to see where they come from what they are where they are going he said there's been many great books written but there's only one book in the world that tells you where you come from what you are and where you're going that's god's word the bible and every little text in the bible will never perish because it's god's word you could hang your soul on any face of god's word or any scripture any verse or just one word and sometimes one word could change a man life oh come on now so abraham we left abraham thinking about his destiny thinking about that city and there we find job job had a big question in job 14 he said if a man die shall he live again that is what stood up job he sat there in his condition and he had this burning question he said there got to be something more than this can i just read what led up to him doing this thing here oh hallelujah may be seated job 14 verse 1 and this is job in the middle of his condition brother papua he is looking at his life he is looking at his experiences he is looking at what has happened and out of it he is coming to point of questions and reflections and analysis because something in him oh hallelujah that he didn't put himself he didn't put it himself and in the midst of his situation we know god asked him a question he said job where was thou when i used you getting it this morning he asked a question to job to judge memory that you are bigger than this situation that the trial the testing the pandemic what is present what is past what happened yesterday what will happen tomorrow you are above these things [Applause] you may be cheated so job is there oh hallelujah i don't know about you but me as an individual i think about death i think about life i think about the length of time when there's it it's reflective it makes you do things at a level of urgency it makes you wonder about wasting time and using time and here is job in job 14 saying man is born of a woman man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he come and fought like a flower and is cut down he flew it also as a shadow and continue with not so job is describing what he is seeing with his natural eyes he said and does thou open thine eyes upon such and one and brings me the judgment with v who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean so job is looking at it he said there's got to is there a way to move from being unclean to being clean is there a way to move from sinner to santa is there a way to move on being unwashed to be in wash oh hallelujah [Applause] job is going through his his questions hallelujah and he goes on seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee so why are you worried about life and death when your days are already numbered oh come on now somebody help me this morning though has appointed his bones that he cannot pass so job is seen i've realized that as much as i try to go beyond what i want to go a man tries to go beyond what he wants to go you can run around the savannah you can jog all you want to do if there's a line that god said you cannot pass you cannot pass because he's the one that determined you're going out you're coming in he's the one that woke you up this morning he's the one that has you being prepared for revival [Applause] turn from him that he may rest until he shall accomplish as an island his day and job is now bringing a context he said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it'll sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof was all in the earth and the stalk thereof died in the ground yet through the scent of water he said when this tree go down when the scent of water you ever smell water i don't know how fresh water to smell but but he said when these trees have to smell water it brings it's had to grow again he said there's a way for a tree to be restored this is the easter message now anybody with me verse 10 but man died and wasted away ye man give it up the ghost and where is he there has to be a place there it can't be that the trees can get restored and man can be restored a cavity tree could get his scent of water and he'd be refreshed and there's no way for man to be refreshed [Applause] hallelujah as the waters feel from the sea and the flood decayeth and dryeth up so man lie it down and rise it not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake no be raised out of their sleep oh that door would just hide me in the grave that would that dog would just keep me secret until thy wrath we pass that dog with us appoint me a set time and remember me and then verse 14 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait until my change comes can the church say amen i may know the testimony it'll be job that will scream out i know my redeemer lived hallelujah anybody feeling fine oh hallelujah so we leave abraham he's seeking a city and although job knew his redeemer lived job also didn't get the complete answer because he also went down into the ground hallelujah hallelujah he got a taste of the answer he got a revelation of the answer but the answer was still coming anybody with me can we take a little more we're talking about questions and answers here we have a situation now where with a branham and the message what here is thou elijah he's speaking about moses and i said lord one time moses wanted to know this is his question what you look like hallelujah oh to know what he looks like and you took him over to a cleft and a rock and you hit him and when you pass by moses said it looked like the back of a man but moses didn't get to walk with that man he didn't get to eat with that man so he also got a part answer to the question and the question remained unanswered in its fullness because something had to happen with the pop well to fully answer the questions that abraham had and that and that job had and that abraham had that and that moses had everybody with me moses isn't in his experience and he would ask his own question of god who shall i say send me i need an answer for that i can't just go and talk to them i want to i have a question is there a question in your heart that you want god to answer for you today in this convention in this meeting and god respond to moses that's what i'm saying some question god answered immediately and others he had to wait for the appointed time for the answer to the question everybody with me so when moses said who shall i say send me he said tell them i am that i am oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory and i want us to build a little bit to i'm crafting the unanswered questions so there came a point where we know the sacrifice and the way the sacrifice had to be performed had to be done a certain way you couldn't just pull any kind of animal to do sacrifice and not only for the approved animals the animals had to be in a certain condition it had to be alarmed without blemish so in order to bring a lamb without blemish with a punch you have to ask the question does it have a blemish the only way to know if it has a blemish or not is to ask the question and the question would be investigative because the priest has to check to make sure if there's a mark that disqualifies it so he could ask the question is it qualified does it have a blemish and the believer would want to know will my sacrifice be accepted i don't want to take chances with this am i doing the right thing am i am i coming the right way if there's an approach to god the question should be is this the right approach [Music] it's not good enough to know there is an approach the question should be what is the approach am i approaching it the right way will this sacrifice be accepted but that sacrifice we know of bulls and goats and these things was limited it was attempting to cover sin not remove sin so and it was a question but i asked me that would always have to be asked when is my next sacrifice do we have the right animal for the sacrifice is it with and this question would live for centuries are we ready for the sacrifice is the sacrifice ready to be accepted is this the right approach and these questions such as where is this city can a man live again is there a perfect sacrifice we'll live on and on and on and on questions about redemption questions about restoration questions about going back to the way adam was everybody with me we mentioned joshua asking a question as a challenge a closed question are you for us or are you against us he wasn't there's no in-betweener there was no room for i'm not sure and the captain of the whole says i'm the captain i've come to give instructions over and over we can see true scripture in the message of basis of fellowship but ibrahim said look at elijah the prophet hallelujah and and he goes on to to elijah we we did the bible study when he went down into the cave after the whole mount carmel experience and god fed him with some kicks and then he wondered in the wilderness he was fleeing from his life and god found him and pulled him back in the cave somewhere the mighty rin while rushing wind went by and god wasn't in the wind do you remember that the thunder went by and he was in the thunder but then he said what what does that hear elijah he had to ask elijah what is your condition you come from a great victory on carmel you let jezebel have you go into hiding after your great victory having a pity party you want god to kill you how many of us do in this pandemic put ourselves in our cave and hide may this message come to you to ask what do is though here what are you hiding for what are you afraid of all the victories you have been through you will let one situation come and put you back and and have you all depressed in lord take my life no come on now come on now rise up rise up sons of god rise up daughters of god [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so i'm dealing with questions and answers so god took elijah then out of the situation and that's how he was commissioned to raise up elijah because out of that cave and that situation is when god sent him to go and pull elisha up hallelujah moving on in second-handed robe this is elisha following elijah so you've got to alter yourself to meet god's holy spirit that's the prophet speaking you won't alter the spirit to meet your desire see you've got to alter yourself so elisha had several years of growing in to fit the robe he's speaking about his character development now so he thought it would put him fit him pretty well he was on his road up the hill and elijah turned around the only thing that he wanted to know was he could ever get the promise that's all he wanted and he said now i'm going to ask you tell me what my desire is he said i want a double portion of your spirit to come upon me what are you going to say and elijah the prophet turned around and said don't ask a heart thing but this will be given to you on one condition oh hallelujah if you see me go and but about him in that same quote said hallelujah the holy ghost is given to you on a condition as well come the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so we're going through the scriptures the tsunami woman we went through the study of it she didn't have a child she was very careful and very hospitable to god's prophet and they wanted to do something for her and she ended up with a child and the child died and she's racing you remember it racing to meet elijah everybody ask her the question what's going to say all is well all is well i must go find a man of god that's what's in our heart everything will be well oh hallelujah by the way said brother that that elijah said here comes the son of man go and meet her she seems like she's in a rush go meet her and say unto her ask her this question is all well with you it's all well with your husband it's all well with the boy and as his servant ran and meet her and she said all is well her baby was dead her husband frantic but ibraheem said but all is well she knew god was in his servant the prophet she knew she could hear from god and she wanted to know this is the other verse the prophet says you wanted to know why her son had been taken and she runs up close elijah and he said her heart is full of gloom and god has hid it from me oh hallelujah but everyone said you know there's a wonderful thing god don't tell his prophets everything he just tell them what he needs them to know or what he wants them to know can the church say man but we know that she got her answer when elijah went back to the house oh hallelujah so we see true scripture questions answered and the question that were not answered they are moving on moving on until the right time until the right season oh brother branham speaks about the queen of sheba she said listen she heard something she wanted to know if it was true do you realize what that woman had to do the questions in her heart led her through the desert but abandoned he was probably at least three months in the desert a woman not with an air conditioned room but sitting on a camel do you realize what a sacrifice and tonight we could hear of god's gift and won't walk across the street no wonder she'll raise up and condemn this generation but she wanted to know it was worth more than life to her now whenever she took riches and gifts to give it was so now this woman settled with all these riches spices and talents of gold and everything to give it to the cause of god if it was so she didn't know it was so she had just heard hallelujah so she goes to the meeting to find out she came with a question is this thing real is the wisdom of solomon real oh hallelujah oh hallelujah amber brandon builds it i'm gonna skip this but she came to solomon she didn't come just to stay one night she was going to see the thing through that's the way to do it stay with it she was going to test it she was going to examine it so it finally come her turn and when she stood before solomon he revealed to her everything that was in her heart every question that she had in her heart she got the answers and and she didn't have to ask it it was revealed oh hallelujah he revealed to her everything that is in her heart how real god's gift up always works right solomon told her the things that were in her heart according to the bible told her every question that was in her heart god working through his gift and when the queen got ready to return what did she say when she gave all these gifts to solomon she said the things i heard about was right and even greater than i ever heard she said blessed be the god of solomon who has given all his wisdom and these things and jesus because she did that being a peasant and come and was reconciled to god by seeing the gift of god work perfectly became a believer in god jesus jesus said you bunch of educated church-going hypocrites he said she'll raise up in the day of judgment and condemn you because she come from the uttermost part of the known world at that time to see the wisdom of solomon and yet i say unto you that are greater than solomon is here and hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah come on you sons of god we are building we are going somewhere i'm not going to be too long with you but keep your mothers come in oh hallelujah hallelujah because god is not going to leave questions unanswered oh let me tell you right now the question about your healing that's going to be answered the question about your son that's going to be answered the question with resurrection that's going to be answered the question are you overcoming that's going to be answered hallelujah young people this is for you samson was asked a question samson samson what is your secret listen church you got to know what questions answer you know knowing the answer don't mean you have to give the answer there are some secrets you have to keep samson samson was his secret to your strength samson playing around he's playing around and some of us here were playing around playing around with the world samson knew better he knew the answer he knew what his secret was but he he was just slowly being broken down the question kept asking over and over what's his secret to your strength handsome he said he'd do this dude and it didn't work of course samson give me the truth you see samson was strong at first but the questions begin to increase and get more persuasive and samson you don't love me samson i told it to me okay why you wouldn't tell me the secret you want to make me cry until the strength that samson had was questions and answers and the wisdom to know the right question to understand the right answer and how to answer can the church say amen and we can go through scripture there's so much of this in the world there's so much in the message and then we meet someone like david and while david is walking towards the camp of the battle saul is also having his question in response to another question who will you send to fight me that's goliath's question soul question is who will i send david's question when he asked it was not about sending or going or coming his question was very simple who is uncircumcised philistine that dare defy the armies of the living god the focus of this question was in his name you know the who was tied to the uncircumcised philistine which meant according to the covenant our foot should be upon this [Music] [Applause] he wasn't asking this is like god asking adam where are you where where are those it's not your location it's not who i don't want his name i don't want his bird people i i'm not really interested in who he is as a name i know i don't know who is this uncircumcised philistine that dare defy the army of the living god come the church see amen and back sitting soul and backs it in israel they're curled up in the position and here it was david isn't asking about the strength and about the armor and about how long he's fighting and the experience that's not the important question you have to know what is the most important question the question was not about david's ability the question was not about about no it was who is the uncircumcised philistine because according to my bible hallelujah we are promised victory over every enemy we are promised victory over every philistine we are promised victory it didn't say large philistines small philistines it it didn't specify it says if they uncircumcised and if they are philistines they are moving target can the church say man anybody with me there were no conditions put on this thing there are no limitations put on this thing they didn't say these small philistines no no anybody who's a philistine uncircumcised too they are to be destroyed and we are more than able we are more than able can the church say amen [Music] saul was so not convinced he said well if you're if you really want to go i can't even say are you sure that's a kind of leading question are you sure you want to go have big strong men here who don't want to go in are you sure that you want to go and deal with this goliath the men who fighting for a long time they don't want to go are you sure you want to go he said well if you want to go take my armor take my sword take my shield take everything i have and when david look at it he look at it he said my victory can't be based on this armor my victory is not based on this my victory is based on the fact that this uncircumcised philistine is challenging the armies of the living god [Applause] our victory is not titan but your strength your victory is not tied to your ability the battle is the lord's hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he may be seated oh and so on so it unfolds questions and answers until we meet the new testament many questions in the old testament were answered but many were being transferred over into the new testament that were left unanswered that had to still be answered because we're going back to eden where there were no more questions but upon they had the questions have to get answered so we meet little mary oh go about her business and an angel intervenes hail mary that word highly favored and begins to prophesy over mary and mary like any spiritual one says how shall this be oh god she asks our own question and that question was immediately answered the holy ghost will overshadow you that question we can answer it right now come on now there are some questions we can answer right now hallelujah how will i have the victory the holy ghost how will i bring forth the christ the holy ghost how will we have a revival to holy ghost how will my son be restored to holy ghost we can answer it now we can answer it today we answer it in this meeting hallelujah somebody give god a shout oh hallelujah but isaac i lost my joy how will i get it back the holy ghost but isaac i lost my victory how i'm gonna get it back oh come on now somebody preached back to me i haven't worshiped in a long time i haven't felt the holy ghost in a long time how will it come back it's going to be the holy ghost give the lord a shout out praise [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh hallelujah you may be sitting for a minute mary's question was not if it was going to happen let me say it one more time her question was not if she gonna have the child you know it was how i want you to get it it was not if you're gonna have a revival if you're gonna get the holy ghost if your son gonna be restored the quest there's no question about that that's a rhetorical question your son is gonna be delivered hallelujah are you going to be healed you shall be delivered [Applause] her question was not the possibility of it her question was the process [Applause] her question was not the possibility her question was to process tell me how tell me where i have to go tell me which service tell me which convention tell me the day tell me the time tell me the hour tell me the season [Applause] [Music] hallelujah when the disciples went to the upper room it wasn't if they're gonna get the holy ghost it was how he said terry wait until until you be endured with power [Applause] you shall receive power there's no question about that you shall be delivered there's no question about that you shall be adopted there's no question about that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey come on church the question with the george is not if you're going to get young again the question is how you're going to get young again oh the question brother nicole is that if you're here going to grow back it's always going to grow back the question is not if your limbs are going to be restored because the prophet said missing limbs will be restored the question is how the question is when oh come on now somebody help me [Applause] you may be seated could he take some more so when mary heard this prophecy who got this revelation and it opened up to her that she had been chosen and she found out by the asking the right question how will this be when she heard the holy ghost she didn't wander she didn't doubt she went straight to elizabeth who was six months or so pregnant and at that point john had not been kicking in the belly just yet and when she relayed the testimony of the conversation and about the question and about the answer and what his name would be called when john heard it john start to have a revival oh come on now somebody say man [Applause] can we go on a little bit somebody random goes on and convinced them concerned i couldn't craft it through everybody but we trying to bring it to our spot right so we know we now want john but everyone said but john and jesus johnny baptist at the age of nine years old went to the wilderness to be alone with god so he would not make a mistake i'm reading from the prophet he wanted to know this was his question he wanted to know what this messiah would be how he could find him what would he look like so that he could introduce him friends if there's a purpose for your life you must know the questions are tied to the purpose for your life you can't say i want to be an architect and don't ask the questions what does it take to be an architect you want to be a great accountant not just an accountant let me just make that clear to young people god doesn't accept just average in this kingdom so if you want to be anything you need to be a great one you give me the best but even i'm talking if you want to be a bum be the best bomb let them know look the best bum he said you finally filthy his garbage cans you're stuck and you're bringing all you got to come to your area let them respect your ability to show what a bomb is supposed to be like whatever you do you say listen you want to be a bum follow me i'll show you how to be a real bomb but if you want to be a great christian accountant lawyer architect secretary whatever it is then i'll show you to be a great christian one hallelujah so john wasn't trying to be average he wanted clarity he wanted questions answered so that when he meets the situation he could answer he could give an account he can respond so we find instead i'm reading from the prophet instead of going to take all of his degrees and come up as a priest as his father was and following the footsteps of his father he went as far away from the school as he could plumb out in the wilderness alone with god so that by the time john comes back out of the wilderness he's outcast he's an unknown nobody knows where he's been nobody knows his story nobody knows his experience backside of the desert time but when he comes out he's rebuking he's on fire he said there's one coming right now i baptized water but he will baptize with the holy ghost he had clarity when he saw jesus he said you should baptize me she said no no no no everything must be fulfilled but then we see john in prison john faithful disciples coming to him you say i hear a few things go go ask him i just have one more question go ask him are you the one or should we look for another and when they ask jesus the question jesus sent them back he said tell john give john this answer tell john that the sick are healed tell john that the blind received their sight tell john that the cripples are walking tell john that in 2021 the bride is in revival tell john hallelujah that they could be a pandemic but in the middle of the pandemic are greater than solomon is here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come he gives a lot of shout out praise [Applause] you may be seated i'm trying to build a place i'm not going to be too much longer with you but just kind of eating good so jesus himself had to deal with his own questions if thou be turn this stone into bread it was the question that the devil asked that led to his answer but look how a master answers manchester united lived by red alone he gave him a real answer you know he gave my answer i was not answer this question he said go to court and he said man but every word i proceeded out to the amount of god and if you question the devil so if you want to learn how to answer questions just check jesus without the holy ghost without power he just answered the question and his answers but abandoned had so much power in it it was like electric vault city devil he never went away for a season just based on the right answer to the question so when the devil come at you with a question you could give the right answer and senator will fly in reversing faster than he drove he come driving at 60 reversing at 120 because you gave her answer that you bought the ball your body sent you you return the ball you knock it straight out over you you hit it straight out can the church say amen oh hallelujah and jesus himself answered questions and he also asked questions the woman at the world bring me a drink go call your husband he's probing but random said it's an interesting kind of question he's probing and she says who are you talking to me because we saw marathons and we're not supposed to be talking he said if you knew who talking to you you'd ask me for a drink do you want to know who is he calling me say well you see i have not you say that's right because you you're you're you're you're you're you're with one and and and you had so many before and these things and what was it answered her question she'll have come see a man who told me all about me let's begin the whole and now i'm trying to bring this to a point matthew 16 two of the most critical scriptures questions who do men say that i am that's easier that's a a first level question because of the question that doesn't deal with you it's easy to speak about what other people say what do people believe well they believe they think they see and when jesus was satisfied with the answers and what he said he said who do you say i am he brought it personal to them and he realized that although they had been with him for a season didn't know who he was until god revealed to peter who he was and jesus could say flesh and blood and reveal this to you in other words the answer you have you didn't come up with that answer so it means that there could be ancestor situation that you didn't come up with anybody with me it's simple we know it so jesus was saying your answer to my question wasn't your answer you had some help hallelujah this was a son who gave an answer that he didn't know how to create the answer he had help he said flesh and blood and reveal this to you but my father give you the answer and that's the right answer and upon this rock of revelation of the ability of god to reveal to you how to respond to a situation i will build my church can the church say man and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it i'm almost finished there's a young man he's in jesus meetings he's in the conventions he's maybe connected at a virtual convention something would have touched him enough to ask his own question found jesus when maybe nobody else was around he said master what luck are yet i've listened to all the preaching i've listened to all the services i've discussed with my friends and i've i realize i'm missing something but i don't know what it is what lacquer yet it's a burning question coming to church i know the message but i know i'm missing something jesus says obey the commandments follow the law he said from my youth i've done all of this that's not the issue i've been in church i've been in bible study i've been in prayer meetings i've done the things that everybody else does but there's still something that's missing and i don't know what it is help me help me help me help me is anybody who feels that way today you know you're missing something and you want jesus to give you the answer because he is the answer he has the answer and the fact that he was genuine and he pushed for more clarity jesus now was invited to discern fully said well go sell all that you have and give to the poor friends the issue here was no longer question and answer the issue was now what do you do when you do get the answer if there was one person on this earth who we know got an answer from the lord was this rich young ruler oh for god to tell me today what i need to do how sweet and precious would it be to have the opportunity and that young man the bible said he left sorrowful he left with the answer but with the answer there was a sorrow because he was unable to do what needed to be done when he got the answer i pray that today the answers that you are looking for from the word will come to you with such clarity and that you will have the fortitude and the strength and the courage to do what you need to do with the answer maybe like that rich young ruler you're not rich with wealth but you're rich with pride or rich with envy or you're rich with something else and and you're being told today get rid of it i pray that you don't walk away sorrowful from this service the bible said jesus loved him that that love went out because jesus saw the pain he was in with not being willing to give up what was affecting his life you can't tell me you don't know what's affecting your life not now not in this season when everything is made clear to us through scripture and through this message of malachi 4 don't you leave sorrowful because you are unwilling to make the adjustments unwilling to make the changes unwilling to change your walk your talk your friends your network what what you do with your time and then you want to know why god is not helping you when god already told you what you need to do he did not like the answer so he walked away sorrowful jesus is tired he's wary but there's a need a situation we've preached about it on the other side the maniac of kadara the cries the questions in his life because although there were demonic influences on his life there was still a cry that reached god and touched jesus to intervene on his behalf and while jesus was on a mission to cross to the other side his disciples would have had questions no doubt because they were not allowed to go to the other side but jesus was maybe he was just too tired to ask or maybe they just were shy to even ask the question how could he go to the other side but while he is going the devil raises up a storm to attack and we know the story jesus wakes up rebukes the storm and goes back to sleep and the disciples asked their own question they had seen a lot but they now ask a new question what manner of man is this and we preach about it but at that point in time they didn't get the answer it was still unfolding to them because they didn't fully understand his mission his purpose his objective what he was there to achieve hallelujah and brother brahman says we would see jesus he said they said what manner of man is this wonderful amen wonderful don't you believe he was wonderful when that man himself listen to the prophet describe this when that man himself left the heavens when the entire solar system was his crown every billion stars that hung in the earth every star that millions of miles beyond when they looked through that glass out yonder at mount paloma and could see 120 million years of light space and all those billions and trillions of stars was in his crown and he left them to take a crown of thorns who would do it wonderful this is the easter eternal was his robe he was robbed with eternal life he never had a beginning he never started at bethlehem you know as people tried to think he did he had no beginning amen robed with eternal life and pushed it aside to take an old dirty robe of death for you and i heaven was his palace all heaven belonged to him that was his palace nothing could ever shine with him he came to the earth and even said the foxes have holes and the birds have nests but i don't even have a place to lay my head [Music] that's the jesus you must see that's the jesus that you must see not the jesus of the nomination they talk about not the jesus of creeds not the jesus of some sort of mythical christmas not the jesus of some bunny rabbit easter but the jesus of calvary the jesus who laid aside everything [Music] hallelujah hallelujah trying to bring her close to this we're almost done so we talked about questions throughout the old testament many answered some unanswered being carried forward as it were to now come together when jesus is on the earth and even when jesus is on the earth he would ask over 300 questions in matthew mark luke and john over 300 someone said about 239 or so questions i have to go try to check it but over 300 questions i'll just touch a few matthew 5 46 for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the public comes the same in other words you need to be better than this if you loving people who love you what what reward you get there's no reward for that matthew 5 47 if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others that's two out of over 300 questions jesus asked and remember you could ask a question to encourage inspired a guy to teach to matthew 6 27 which of you by taking thought can add one cubit under his statue matthew 7 3 we forget some of these questions and why be wholeness though the mote that is in thy brother's eye but consider us not the beam that is in thine own eye let us go back to the questions that jesus asked we wouldn't have time in this service to ask them all but make it your personal study to understand the kind of questions jesus would ask to bring his disciples into the soldiers he shaped them to be when they brought the man with palsy jesus the bible said in matthew 9 4 and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore thinking evil in your hearts i just heal the man but you're thinking evil i discern it why why why why would you think evil when good is being done why can't you be happy that god is blessing somebody why can't you be happy for somebody else [Music] jesus using questions to teach to rebuke the guy to mentor to shape the mold matthew 11 7 speaking about john as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went you out in the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind just to see something going on is that yeah you're attracted by fireworks what what went you out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothings are in king's houses but what went you out for to see a prophet yeah i see unto you and more than a prophet can you take a little more john 3 12. now this is not a preacher's questions this is jesus asking questions jesus said in john 3 12 if i have told you earthly things and he believed not how shall he believe if i tell you of heavenly things i'm almost done matthew 20 32 and jesus stood still and called him and said what will he that i shall do unto you speaking to the two blind men outside of similar to that man who was at the pool of bethesda will thou be made whole some of these questions friends are still open questions you're here today in this service will be made whole do you know your need god is answering questions this morning he's answering questions this evening [Music] say mark 8 36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul people sit in the message and forget these questions that jesus asked that he that he requires us to answer these are questions we must all answer what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul say in luke 6 46 and why call you me lord lord and do not the things which i see we all have to give an answer to these questions i'm almost finished and as we approach calvary and see jesus walk into calvary with every step that jesus took towards calvary questions that had remained unanswered for centuries were merely now hours away from being answered questions about the perfect sacrifice were hours away from being answered questions about redemption were hours away from being answered questions about the way back to eden were hours away from being answered question about being able to have a city who we could where we could go were hours away from being answered hallelujah paul would say in the book of hebrews and we know it hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but this man hallelujah this is hebrews 10 verse 12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice four sins sat down on the right hand of god oh hallelujah from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified in other words when jesus came and he died and he rose again in that one experience he was answering all unanswered questions about the sacrifice about sin about getting back to eden oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord i'll skip a few things hallelujah and when jesus died we know he went down to hell reading of the lost and questioned they had they in paradise but abraham preached it out the wheel in the middle of the wheel ezekiel wonder what that what that was and he said when he saw jesus say but wait a minute that's that's the answer that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel oh hallelujah oh this they were getting all of the answers that weren't answered throughout all the ages can the church say amen i'm almost finished and on the day of pentecost we're moving beyond now peter was speaking and peter speaking led to a question in acts 2 verse 37 says no when they heard this this is where peter was preaching and by actually he said when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter unto the rest of the apostles men and bridging what shall we do in other words the word being preached to you should bring a different question a new question because they were clear and there was a way out but they want to know what do i need to do what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and by the random goal he said paul paul being a teacher we just go in trump getting rid of the clothes coming on the road to damascus there was a great light shining out of heaven hallelujah and the voice spoke saul saul why persecutions down me hallelujah and saul said who who are you that i'm persecuting he said i'm jesus hallelujah and we go on and on and on and we see the romans where we read these rhetorical questions that paul by the time he's writing he is writing questions that he's also answering that we know the answer to he said what shall we then say to these things in other words we don't even need to answer you know because if god before us who could be against us he that spared not his own son but he livered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things so that's why i picked for and a subject what shall we say to these things all these things that are happening around us what shall we say this bride will have a voice the sons of god will have a voice the sons of god will speak and when they speak it'll flash like lightning when they speak they will push back to heaven when they speak they will push back diseases can the church say amen give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my mind oh my and from the message this is my last quotes here from the message christ is the mystery of god revealed hallelujah hallelujah then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand and now if i never see you again hallelujah we don't know if this is the last convention but if i never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium the taken up of the church and the destroying of the wicked and the world under the sixth seal to be purified by volcanic to take all the corruption and sin of the world and to mold her out again and bring forth a bright new millennium for the age that is succumbed when we see all these great threefold revelation listen here now god in christ christ in the church and the kingdom coming listen adam and eve redeem back to the garden of eden in the representation of christ and his bride then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise so in other words what is about to happen now had to really wait brother heathcliff until all these forces are in their place the world is in their place the world churches are in their place the economy is in their place sin is in its place and now when all these things are in their place the bride is coming into her place sons of god are getting into their place the whole creation groaning for the manifestation of these sons of god then the kingdom is going to be restored praise be to god now listen to this by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the personal vindicated word by his original headship not say well glory to god we shout hallelujah we sing that's that ain't it i'm a missionary i've been seven times practically over the world see i've seen heathens devils and everything else dance and shout i've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestation that's carnal so whatever said that's not what i'm talking about this is what i'm talking about he said but i'm talking about the headship of christ hallelujah notice being personally identified by the original hanship so he says when that happens in other words we have the answer to the devil's questions hallelujah we have the answer to the devil's question he christ is risen and has paid the price the devil can't stand it that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're coming into what they're doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his scheme has been uncovered by the risen resurrected christ in the headship over his body so in other words his scheme has been uncovered and the headship the headstone the head of the church the head of the body is united with the body hallelujah but it by himself you think i'm beside myself i'm not we have got the devil's answer hallelujah not me that live it but this easter the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer christ is risen this convention this easter christ is risen and has paid a price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come to life and the flesh be redeemed that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day hallelujah oh hallelujah i'm done almost finished then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub of bleach you will never find a stain of the ink no more hallelujah it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated sea that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated in this convention it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered no more memory no more sin your past finished your failures finished [Music] brother branham said god forgets it he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god now are we the sons of god not we will be he says that we will be now right now in your condition in your situation you are sleeping soldier you are an eagle now present tense are we the sons of god not we will be now are we redeemed hallelujah we have the devil's answer god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day oh my my my church mrs jesus christ you sons of corb when jesus walked the earth he was the answer to the questions that lingered from the beginning until he walked the earth and the questions that he left unanswered he left it for his bride he left it for his sons he left it for the manifestation of the sons of god to bring back a complete restoration of eden jesus left a portion of his ministry for his sons for his bride or for message jesus christ to give the devil the answer this is satan your time is up devil your time is up satan this uh this is our jurisdiction we read the quote this earth god is in charge of everything but this earth this is our jurisdiction this is our territory this is our jurisdiction jesus had to leave it for his sons to take back ownership the same way adam was god on the earth and adam was in charge he's waiting for some sons who would be counted worthy to be in charge once again sons who would know who they are sons with no doubt sons with no questions sons with no fear and every time the devil comes they can give the devil an answer satan you're finished cancer be gone humor be gone demon of backside and be gone demon of lust gone whatever the
