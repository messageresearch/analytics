[applause] It's a blessing to be back. And we're looking to see what the Lord will do in a special way &gt;&gt; today. And as we go forward in faith that God will bless and pour out his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; I bring you greetings from India, from Germany, from France, from Nigeria, from last church we were in is Lagos Nigeria. Bring your greetings from the breadth of India and they're looking forward for the time we're going to have next year, July. &gt;&gt; I know. Praise the Lord. Amen. [applause] I know last uh uh Sunday a message was preached on a summer of compassion and I trust the Lord that you were blessed with it. And um [applause] I think I preached on brotherly kindness some time ago in in New Jersey and we got feedback from different parts even around the world concerning this thing about forgiveness. But today I have a testimony from brother Isaac Opiev I'd like to read for you. But before that let's bow our heads for a prayer right where you are. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence and we thank you for your grace that has given us this opportunity to surrender our lives to you. Father God, a word came even Wednesday night about selling, giving, and following. Father, we come to follow you. We want to be led by you and directed by you. We all have our choices. We all have this power of decision. And we choose to come this morning, Lord, looking for one word from you. That's all it would take, Father, to transform up our hearts and our lives. So may you speak to us, each one here, those that are here present and those that are connected online. May your presence be with them in a special way. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. So this is from Pastor Isaac Oji. Dearly beloved uh pastor, greetings to you and your wife, family, and church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. On behalf of my family and our local church newi, I want to thank you so much for the blessings you were to us on the weekend of November 14th to 16th in a just concluded con convention. Testimonies are coming in from far and near and from believers who were not even physically present at the meetings. The Lord used you mightily and in a special way to break iron bars and captives were set free. The inspiration on brotherly love and forgiveness was very timely. And in season two, a brother sent me a message and shared his testimony of deliverance from the unforgiven spirit. He has an he he he of unforgiving spirit. He has had issues with other pastor and this problem for has lasted for years. He also regards one as an enemy, especially if you say otherwise from his own views. Different efforts from different brethren have been put in to resolve the problem, but to no avail. But your message came as if you already knew what had been going on. And as God would have it, this brother was in the meeting. And after hearing the messages without any mediation or persuasion he decided to let go in so much that he went to the brother and for the first time in many years they could greet each other and even shake hands. Your inspiration on Saturday night November 15th was coming into his presence and truly nobody can come into his presence and remain the same. Thank you, Beloved, for your sacrifice and sacrifices and labors of love for the bride over the years. Thank you for coming to Newi 2025. May the Lord bless and strengthen you over and over again for more blessings in the future if the Lord tries. Please send our love to your wife, brother Isaac, and the entire Headstone Tabernacle Trinidad. God bless you richly, Brother Isaac Opiday. Praise the Lord. [applause] So we thank God for that today that you know we have testimonies of this thing and I didn't realize that sometimes with different individuals it's hard to let go and to forgive but it's a choice that each one of us have to make &gt;&gt; if we intend to get God's healing and blessings and virtue &gt;&gt; and I believe in the message itself I spoke about uh people not letting go things something happened years ago and you don't want to keep harping it happen it happen You have to let it go. &gt;&gt; You have to let it go like how Christ let your your sins go. &gt;&gt; Like how Christ free you, you have to free others also. As God forgive you, you could forgive others. As God released you, go you could release others. If you don't want that release, then you just have to hold on. &gt;&gt; Hold on yours and grudge and so on. So saints, we have to get a breakthrough in a way that God could deliver us completely from this spirit of envy and jealousy and malice and strife. And if somebody want to take your place, nobody want to take your place. Nobody could take your place. Praise God. What God have for you is for you. Nobody could change that. Nobody could cancel that. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. But the things of God is the faith. &gt;&gt; That is the challenge. The things of God, not feelings. And there are too many people put their feelings and emotions over faith and revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is a stumbling. When you put your feelings over faith, &gt;&gt; God never put feelings over faith and emotions and you, you know, your thing and you're weary and you're tired. No, no, no. You must press on. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Press on to believe that God will speak to your heart and God will deliver you. So, you love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. So, I spoke on Friday about this city of refuge. &gt;&gt; And I believe it's something very important &gt;&gt; that God was trying to point to he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high. And God wants us in that position because in that place you at rest. In that place, nobody could trigger you when you're in the right place. Hallelujah. Because demons coming to trigger you, to get you upset, to get you out of tune. That is what that man, that maniac man coming to brother Brandham and say, "You snake in the grass. I'll beat you up." And everything else. He was trying to trigger brother Brandham out of the atmosphere. And brother Ram kept the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And in that atmosphere, the devil was defeated. So once you break into the atmosphere, you have to keep the atmosphere that the devil will trigger you out of the atmosphere. Sometime the devil could could use your children to trigger you, your wife to trigger you, your husband to trigger you, your neighbor, your boss, somebody to trigger you and you get upset and you just throw out the atmosphere and then you cannot pull it back together again. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. But God is good. Praise God. God going to give us a breakthrough. I believe with all my heart. Praise God. So it was wonderful to go and and hear the inspiration. I'll tell you more about Germany and France, but but for for for NWI, I didn't really know exactly what the inspiration was, but then when I heard about it, I know exactly that is what what the Lord wanted me to do and what the Lord wanted me to share. So I preached on a on a song of compassion and also on to a brotherly kindness charity because that is where we are ending up to go to charity. &gt;&gt; In Lagos, Nigeria, I preach on a message rooted and grounded. I didn't say in the love of God. It's part of it in the love of God. But I wanted to get rooted and grounded because some people rooted and grounded in foolishness, in false doctrine and false teaching. You can't get them out from it. But the bride will be rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; So we have an opportunity and I was sharing the difference between rooted and grounded is there two different Greek words and one the root the rooted part is where you draw your source from where you get your energy from, where the roots get the water from to grow and to mature and so on. And the grounded part speaks of foundation, speaks of a building that you have to be built like a rock. So I was telling them that the the lighthouse don't argue with the storm. The lighthouse don't argue with the wind and the darkness. The lighthouse just standing there. And standing is not passive. Hallelujah. Standing is not passive. That lighthouse just shed shine light to sailors and to other ships. And that's how God want you. Like a rock, like a lighthouse. Wherever God put you, you have to be anchored. You have to be rooted. Nothing can sway you to the left and sway you to the right. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. You're anchored in God. You're anchored in Jesus Christ. That is how God wanted you. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. And my inspiration was to hold the line. And the hold the line means don't get the devil an inch. And we talk about Shama. One of David's mighty men was in the middle of a lentil field and the enemy came to attack him. And all the people ran away from him. But he stood his ground. HE STOOD ONE man named Shama. He stood alone and he fight the enemy. They're not going to take his lentil field. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR FIELD. You have to stand and fight. If you don't fight if you run, in other words, standing means you're not running. &gt;&gt; You're not backing down. You're not giving up. You're not letting go. You can't win if you run. Oh, glory. You can't win if you back down. YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU GIVE UP. OH, glory to God. Having all stand. You have to stand. PRAISE GOD. AFTER THE ENEMY COME AND ATTACK, you have to stand. And when the ENEMY IS GREATER THAN YOU, WE HAVE TO HOLD THE LINE. PRAISE GOD. AND NOW HOLD STEADY. HOLD YOUR DEFENSIVE POSITION. GO. DON'T GIVE HIM MY INCH. BUT GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. NOT GOING TO GIVE him my inch. Praise God. CALL ME TO THIS MESSAGE. GOD CALL ME IN THIS HOUR. God call ME TO OVERCOME. GOD CALL ME TO STAND. GLORY. CALL ME TO BACKSLIDE AND GIVE UP AND LET GO AND GO BACK IN THE WORLD. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. GOD CALLED US FOR A PURPOSE AND THAT PURPOSE MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just tell them the enemy want to break you. That's the object of the enemy. To break your spirit, to break your will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the enemy does. That's his job to frustrate you, to depress you, to make sure. That's why people go to the devil because they find God taking too long &gt;&gt; because faith that can't be tested can't be trusted. When God released faith to you, he have to test it. He tested Abram for 25 years. He tested Noah for 120 years. He says he met people in the upper room for so many days. He once he give you faith, he have to test it. That's what he does. That's how he operates. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some shouts in the house. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We said before and he preached on it. He God didn't argue with the darkness. He didn't discuss NO DISCUSSION ON FELLOWSHIP WITH THE DARKNESS. HE WATCHED darkness and said let there be light. Oh glory to God. And when light come for darkness WILL PACK UP SHOP and go home. OH GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. WHEN LIGHT COMES DARKNESS HAVE TO PACK UP SHOP. AND LISTEN WHEN LIGHT COME TO YOUR HOME DARKNESS IN YOUR HOME HAVE TO PACK UP AND LEAVE. Oh give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we are striving to enter in. We are striving. We have to strive. &gt;&gt; We have to strive to enter in. Baram said before the horrible plague strike. &gt;&gt; America preparing for war for Venez Venezuela war. And just in 72 hours had five volcanoes that erupted. The earth is starting to shake. You know, &gt;&gt; the earth is starting to grown. You know, things are happening. You know, because we are about to be redeemed. Full redemption. Not just the soul, not just the Amen. the spirit but the body and all going to be changed and transformed. So we are looking to see what the Lord will do. Are you going a great expectation? &gt;&gt; People go to church just to get information but you come into church to get revelation. That's why you have to come into the spirit. Revelation is when he reveals himself to you and that's the rock that Jesus talked about. Upon this rock I'll build my church. That is when it's revealed to you. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh God is good this morning. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The man that build his house upon the sand, he doesn't know the storm is coming. He does the catering for the storm. As far as he concerning, he getting more bricks. He getting more paint. He preparing for Christmas. But the storm is coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He have his hallelujah. He have his um all the mobby and all the Amen. the sorrel and all the cake and everything else. But the storm is coming because he didn't build it upon a rock. Nobody but anybody else, you know, build your house upon a rock. That rock is revelation. Oh, glory to God. The trials is still yet ahead. And forget what you're going through right now. That is nothing compared to what is coming ahead. There's a great being, a strain that is coming. And you have to have what it takes to deal with what is coming. That's why I point you to what is coming. And not only trial coming and testing coming, but power coming also. Oh, give the Lord a shout. God will not leave you comfortless. God will not leave you defeated. God will not leave you without the uncction to function. God will not LEAVE YOU THE POWER TO WITNESS THAT HE'S THE SAME yesterday and ever. It has to have power over sickness, over disease, over cancer, over tumor, OVER ALL MANNER OF SICKNESSES AND DISEASES. OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. You cannot tell me the book is now on the earth, the open book. AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF REDEMPTION. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL. GOD IS SUPERNATURAL. WE ARE SUPERNATURAL. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. AND THE HOLY GHOST IS SUPERNATURAL. WHEREVER GOD IS, THERE IS A SUPERNATURAL RIGHT NOW. SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL IS TAKING PLACE. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You have to stand for your family. You have to stand for your loved ones. You have to stand when they don't believe, when they don't accept, when they don't want to follow. You have to see all of that and don't be and call that as nothing &gt;&gt; because you are believing God. You're not seeing the mini skirt, the hot pants. You're not seeing they're smoking marijuana or they're on drugs. You're not seeing that. You're seeing what God have said. Oh, glory to God. That God going to give you your family. That God going to deliver them. That God going to send the blood hung of the Holy Ghost after them. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. You have to believe that. Hallelujah. Because the devil standing in them defying you and YOU HAVE TO DEFY that devil right back. Oh, give the Lord some praises. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. I look how old you are. Oh, your prayer means something. Oh, glory Lord. Grandma prayer means something. You don't even know why you are here this morning. Some grandmother prayed for you. She must be dead and gone, BUT HER PRAYERS WENT UP TO GOD AND GOD HEARD HER PRAYER AND GOD HEARD HER CRY. DON'T JUST WATCH THEM GRAY HAIR LIKE GIVE THEM GRAY HAIR IS NOTHING. OKAY, THE LORD A SHOUT. DON'T JUST WATCH THAT BALD HEAD LIKE THAT BALL HEAD IS NOTHING. IT MEANS SOMETHING. OKAY, THE LORD A SHOUT. I TOLD HIM WE STOOD AS YOUNG MEN. WE STOOD AS MIDDLE-AGED MEN AND AS WE GETTING OLDER WE GOING TO STILL STAND. THE DEVIL HAVE TROUBLE ON HIS HAND. WE ARE STANDING ANYHOW. WE ARE STANDING UPON A [screaming] ROCK. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I had to fight. Hallelujah. Fight against spirit. Fight against church spirit. Praise the word. George me right there. Sister Kywell. Praise God. I sure he don't mind. I say what I saying at time I came to church had about four or five people and brother Josh said me why you stay home you come back and to preach I said when you repent go forgive you &gt;&gt; next call and repent cuz I wasn't going for five people I was going because God sent me to go &gt;&gt; I'm going because God let me go I don't care if it's two people five people doesn't matter &gt;&gt; numbers never bother me you know what I am concerned I'm consumed with is what God wants me to do &gt;&gt; and I want to be in the will of God, the mind of God. I am not a politician. I'm not into politics. So, you wouldn't catch me into church politics stuff, doing things because the people want it so and they want it so. I'm not into that. I have never been to the politics. I'm not going to be a political minister. Some of them should be in parliament. Some of them will be in my pulpit. They shouldn't be in the pulpit. They should be in parliament. They should be in them government offices and so, but I'm not called for that. Hallelujah. I called to preach the gospel and to see who have faith to take it. That's the purpose that we here for to preach the gospel and see who have faith to take it. Not to baby and pat and get Kentucky fi chicken and give you some free Bible. We not here for that. Hallelujah. This is not Amen. Praise God. This is a different thing all together. This is end time warriors. This is special forces that God put in the last days. THIS IS MEN WHO HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM, WHO THEY ARE, AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHAT THEY STANDING FOR AND THE MISSION. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. AMEN. BROTHER BLACK MAN. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR MISSION, THEN NOTHING GOING TO STOP YOU. NOT WIFE, NOT CHILDREN, NOT FAMILY, NOTHING PRESENT, NOTHING TO COME. YOU ANOINTED. YOU HAVE A COMMISSION TO STAND AS A SOLDIER IN THE LAST DAYS. IN THE LAST DAYS, GOD HAVE A BUNCH OF OVERCOMERS. OH, GLORY TO GOD. I BECOME A SICK SPIRIT. HOW MUCH FILTH, HOW MUCH WHATEVER THE DEVIL HAVE TO LOOSE ON THE EARTH. NOTHING GOING TO STOP THIS BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT GOD HAS CALLED. JOEL SAW IT. A MIGHTY ARMY. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. JOY CALL IT A MIGHTY ARMY. THE EZEKIEL, THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THEIR GOD SHALL BE STRONG. SO DANIEL said and do great exploits. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You think God didn't know have all that pornography and all them sex spirit and all the internet. You think God didn't know had all of that. And with ALL OF THAT, HE STILL PUSH YOU HERE. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; If if he knew you couldn't handle it, he could have put in horse on buggy edge. It had no internet. You had to take your horse and spend four, five, six hours coming to church. But God put you here because God KNOW HE GOING TO HAVE SOME WARRIORS, NOT WARRIORS. BARRIERS. BARRIERS OF THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And Job and Job prove it when his wife say, "Why the curse God and dead?" And that way the devil say and and the devil asked God um give him a crack at him and make him curse you. &gt;&gt; See that what the devil want to do? Strip you &gt;&gt; and God was saying not that man &gt;&gt; that man is a powerful man. That is that is my man on the earth. God had to call the angels to to identify who Job is and say that man that man different all together. Hallelujah. I'm going to bless that man. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that SOMETHING THIS MORNING? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And God came and do a powerful work upon Job's life. You see, he still had self there. He still had flesh there. And when we have self and flesh, God have to do something &gt;&gt; to get it out. Moses had a hot temper wife. There's a purpose behind that. We have situations around us. There's a purpose behind that. You can't come and curse God because this happened that happened. You have to ask yourself every situation have the mind of God &gt;&gt; and you want to catch God's mind for your particular situation. &gt;&gt; You don't know what God trying to work out because every trial to us is customized because what what will what would trigger you would not trigger somebody else and God know and the enemy knows the devil no fool. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you know you don't like cake you're bringing cake and temptation. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's right. He idling. He know you don't like sweets. The devil bringing nothing sweet to you. He know exactly what your taste buds like. And that is what he GOING TO BRING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] And power is demonstrated by not what we could do but when we could do and we don't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character is reflected by how we treat those who can't do nothing for us. A lot of people like to act and do things because somebody could do back for them. But when you could do and the person can't do anything. So that's why the message that was brought to mind that was so powerful. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Gideon brought it out about how Jesus told that young man, sell all that you have and give to the poor and follow me. &gt;&gt; It's not that Jesus wanted him poor. He wanted to get rid of that selfish demon that was upon him that disallowed him that wasn't allowing him to freely share what he had. He was rich. &gt;&gt; Bible said Jesus loved him and he walk away sad. And this is where you do have to be rich in money now. You can be rich in pride. &gt;&gt; There's some people very very proud. &gt;&gt; They you have a a bank of pride. You could be rich in lust. You could rich in your own desire and ambition. You could be rich in many many things. It doesn't have to be like money. You could be rich in a lot of other things, but you have to sell. &gt;&gt; You have to let go and you have to give up. And many people don't want to get in that mode of letting go and giving up because you see, you're asking yourself, should I give this up? But I'll close with this. The city of refuge, God set it up that way that if you kill somebody by accident, you could run. Because in those eye for eye, tooth for tooth. So if you kill somebody, their family could kill you &gt;&gt; and that's not a problem because in those days was eye for eye and tooth for tooth. Isn't that right? But God set up something called the city of refuge &gt;&gt; that if you you know you do something and the cut glass slip out your hand and cut your neighbor and kill your neighbor and whatnot and you know you didn't do it willfully, you could run &gt;&gt; run to the city and tell the LS I didn't do it. I really didn't mean to do it. And they will take you in &gt;&gt; and your pursuers couldn't come into the city &gt;&gt; and they will hear your case. So God put provisions for justice &gt;&gt; and for mercy and for understanding and for bring clarity upon the issues of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God himself set that up. &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; But as the prophet said, when you get into that city, you can't complain. &gt;&gt; You want air condition, you want ice cream, you want cake, you want pizza from Pizza Hut. You have to be study. You was dying. You was going to get killed. Stay put. &gt;&gt; Do what you have to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do what you have to do. That's what we here for. to serve God, to praise God, to worship, to contribute or to work of the Lord. You are part of this church. You're a part of this church. Find out what we need to get done and put your shoulder to the wheel. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be a spectator. You want to be a participator. &gt;&gt; Particip Participation is what is important. That is what make us as a church community. That make us as a as a group that God could come down and use &gt;&gt; for his honor and glory. There are no one man show here. Have no man with the S on his chest. Oh give the Lord a sh superman is that are here we all have a part to play just like your body have a part to play you have a nose you have eyes you have mouth you have chin your foot you have your entire body you want you know where your hand go away your head feel they turn the way eyes say he's tired being in front you want to go behind now &gt;&gt; the eyes going wild &gt;&gt; you don't want that you want everything in place and this is what we want how we want the church &gt;&gt; things to come into place &gt;&gt; so you are going to find a lot of changes begin to unfold as we try to close the gap &gt;&gt; on issues and challenges that we have inside of here. We have gaps. That's no that is no problem to and I am not ashame to confess that we have gaps. We have spaces but we're going to close them. &gt;&gt; So we're going to close the gaps. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHY? BECAUSE that church have to come into order. &gt;&gt; That's what you have to fight for. Not you coming as an individual and know you want to see a church set in order because the prophet said when the church is set in order not even sin could stay inside of it and no sickness could stay inside of there because the sick will be healed. The blind will see the deaf will hear. THE DUMB WILL SPEAK because we have a church set in order. The devil can't move. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT BECAUSE WE HAVE A CHURCH SET IN ORDER. NO ISMS, no schisms, no conflict in the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, you see, you're going to see a lot of changes. You're going to see some different operations because we cannot continue as we are. &gt;&gt; Only God could bless us in the condition we in much as if we set things in order and getting right. And God has blessed us tremendously above that we could even ask or think. And especially those of us who came from way back in Kyal to see where God has brought us to now. It is just amazing. It's just mindboggling and mind-blowing. There's no way in my wildest dreams I could have imagined that the blessings on the hand of God. And I tell my wife, I said, I just thank God to for giving me the opportunity to give my life to him at age 17. And I have absolutely no regret. And I want to encourage you to encourage the young people to come out next Sunday. It will be a very important service uh especially for the youth and we want even the youth talk to backsliders to come out. Come out and give support everybody. We want them you to be here special service next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're looking to see God bring a great deliverance and bring breakthrough. Bring your friends. Bring your family. Testify to somebody. &gt;&gt; Devil could get somebody but he can't get all. &gt;&gt; He can't get those names written on the Lamb's book of life. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Call Call your backs friends. Call people who used to be here and they're out now. Call them and invite them. Don't just invite them. Tell them how they're coming to service next Sunday. That's a good one. Don't just invite them. Tell how you're coming. &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, we don't know except we're coming to pick you up. We're coming to travel with you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stick them. &gt;&gt; Let me go further than that. Compel them. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. They got the invitation to turn it down, but some you compel THEM COME. THE BANQUET TABLE IS still full. PRAISE GOD. BRING THE HALT. BRING THE LAME. LET'S HAVE A PRAYER LINE. LET'S HAVE A HEALING SERVICE. BRING THE BRING THE AMEN. [screaming] COMPEL THEM TO COME. OH, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Thank you, lamb of God. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Just worship the Lord right now. Praise the God. I seem to be to play something [music] today. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Let's switch to the um message uh to brotherly love to let's have our seats here and we're going to switch brother Shane. We're going to switch to unto brotherly kindness charity from from Pomi. Let's switch to that one. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand. We're going to switch to the brotherly kindness. Praise God. Hallelujah. the officers, the helps and the governments. You know, it is it is impossible to do anything without the right support. So, we acknowledge the support and the hours and the labor that goes behind the scenes to make things possible. So I greet you this morning on behalf of my pastor but Theoid and the Headstone Tabernacle. We salute you. We are happy to be here and to see how God has been blessing and using you. And uh on behalf of the believers who are here with us by the grace of God, we are happy to be identified with you. So can we put our hands together one more time? [applause] you know, I saw brother Marcus try to put me in a whole different age bracket. So, I I forgive you, you know. So, I I try to be still on I'm I'm still young, you know. I still on the younger side and by the grace of God, um the only thing I've said in the past and I heard brother George used it recently, I preach to my height. You know, I'm standing behind this desk and I'm not too much of a tall preacher and I'm not a long preacher, but by the grace of God, we believe that this message is a powerful message. And we believe we are coming into a season for a quick short message that'll shake the whole nation. This message is powerful. There's power in this message to break chains, to break shackles, to send demons running. There's power in this message to bring back your children to church. There's power in this message to open your understanding to the word. There's power in this message to take the sinner and get them to come to know Jesus in the power of his resurrection. There's power in this message. It's a powerful message. And you know, many many have walked away. But God will always have a representative. God will always have a witness. It doesn't matter who walks away. It doesn't matter who criticizes. It doesn't matter who doesn't believe. If your name is on the book, there's no devil in hell. There's no devil on the earth that could stop you from coming into your inheritance. [applause] Can the church say amen? So, I'm excited this morning to see what God is going to do. So, if you have your Bibles, would you turn with me? We're going to read from uh one portion of scripture for now. Uh second Peter 1, reading from verse one, a very familiar scripture. And by the grace of God, we are looking for God to s to do something tremendous in our midst. So, second Peter 1 and reading from verse one. Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ. To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. According as his divine power hath given us given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue. &gt;&gt; Amen. whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you and abound, it's not just be in you, it must abound. They make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But he that lackth these things is blind, and cannot see a far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore, though rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, ye shall never fall. So there's a place where you could never fall. That's a powerful statement. But the Brandham said, a man could live such a life that the devil don't even know what to do with you. &gt;&gt; He push you this way, you still stand. He push you this way, you still stand. And that's what we talking about. Reaching a point that you could never fall until the devil say, you know what? I'm not coming by your house anymore. &gt;&gt; The last time I come, you're still standing. &gt;&gt; I mess up your house situation, you're still standing. If you do these things, you will NEVER FALL. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER I TRIED TO DO TO YOU, YOU'RE STILL STANDING. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE HAD YOU 10 YEARS AGO, AND HERE YOU ARE THIS MORNING. HE THOUGHT HE HAD YOU 5 YEARS AGO, BUT HERE YOU ARE THIS MORNING, AND YOU'RE STILL STANDING. And nothing is going to stop that. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Verse 11, for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things. So I want you to note that he say I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth. Yay, I think it meat or I think it fit as long as I am in this tabernacle or in this body to stir you up by putting you in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ had showed me. Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. Shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer? Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, for your presence, for your word, Lord, that is real and alive to us, Father. Any man could, Lord, read the sacred scriptures, but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life upon it and to make it a present tense reality. Father, we thank you for your word. We thank you for this message. We thank you for this church. We thank you for this fellowship. We thank you for the pastor of this house, Lord, his wife, his family, and the officers and the helps and the governments. And Lord, for the few minutes, Lord, of encouraging and having a conversation around your word, may you take me out of the way. And may you speak lip to ear to your children. May we fellowship around the feast that you have prepared for us, Father. Lord, in this great inspiration of the breaking of the bread, Father. May you have the preeminence in the service. May you take me out of the way, Lord. May my words, Lord, and my thoughts, Lord, Lord, fall apart. And may only what you once said be said. Only what you want done be done. and we commit this service into your hands. May you bless the reading of the word, bless the hearing of it. We ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. And it's certainly wonderful. And uh for a title this morning, remembering the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remembering the Lord, that's the title this morning. And we saw here in the scripture we read there were three times here that there was mention about remembering. I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things. So he was seeing here Peter that it is my business to remind you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say though you know them &gt;&gt; but to be established in the present truth. &gt;&gt; So I'm just here this morning to remind us. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's just a service of reminding you about remembering the Lord because it's sometime it's easy to forget. &gt;&gt; It's easy to forget where we come from. It's easy to forget the grace of God in our lives. Sometimes the cares of life you go back to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago and some people talk about the harder days and the tougher days and now we in the days of microwave and convenience and all these things and it seems as if the life could for some is a bit easier. you have money to go by the doctor. But when you go back in the old days when you had no money for the doctor, you had to depend on the grace of God. And through scripture, we see over and over that God HAD TO REMIND THEM THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK YOU OUT. I WAS THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU. I AM THE ONE WHO SENT THE PROPHET TO YOU. I'M THE ONE WHO DELIVERED YOU. YOU COULD PRAY, BUT IF GOD DOESN'T ANSWER THE PRAYER, YOU WILL STAY PRAYING. BUT HE'S THE ONE TO ANSWER. &gt;&gt; He's the one to restore. &gt;&gt; He's the ONE TO POUR OUT THE HOLY GHOST. HE IS THE ONE TO BREAK THE CHAINS. &gt;&gt; He's the one. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to build a foundation to get to a point to connect to brother Waldron's inspiration of breaking of the bread in Exodus 13 verse 13 verse uh 13:3 rather. And Moses said unto the people, remember this day in which you came out from Egypt out of the hand, out of the house of bondage, and for strength of hand, the Lord brought you out from this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses was constantly reminding the people, I don't want you to forget it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to forget what God did. &gt;&gt; Because you COULD GET SO COMFORTABLE THAT YOU FORGET WHY YOU'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE PEOPLE who come to church and they forget the Lord &gt;&gt; because they see as the church and they don't see the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; MARY AND JOSEPH WENT TO CHURCH &gt;&gt; and they left the service AND THEY DIDN'T REALIZE JESUS WAS NOT WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SO CAUGHT UP IN THE TRADITION AND IN THE CEREMONY THAT THEY WENT FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL SOMEBODY SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE. WHERE IS JESUS?" &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WHEN JESUS WENT MISSING. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE CAR WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS NOT IN THE HOME WITH THEM. AND THEN THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO FIND WHERE HE WAS WHEN THEY REMEMBERED HIM. AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM, HE WAS THERE AMONG THE PRIESTS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS HAVING FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BREAKING BREAD WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? DON'T YOU KNOW I MUST BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS?" &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE HERE THIS MORNING ON OUR FATHER'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE GO TO WORK. WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE IN THE MAXI. WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE IN THE TAXI. WE WANT TO REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN WE'RE IN THE MOUNTAIN TOP AND WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN WE'RE IN THE VALLEY. WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN WE FEEL GOOD AND WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN WE DON'T FEEL GOOD. WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN GOD ANSWERS PRAYER BUT WE WANT TO REMEMBER HIM WHEN GOD HOLDS UP THE ANSWER BECAUSE HE IS TESTING YOU AND HE IS trying you and he is proving you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. OVER AND OVER. WHY IS THIS? &gt;&gt; And we're going to get to it. &gt;&gt; Because the whole teaching on communion was do this in remembrance of me. &gt;&gt; There would be no REASON TO DO THINGS IN REMEMBRANCE IF YOU REMEMBERED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE, IT'S EASY TO FORGET. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU PICK UP THE PHONE AND YOU CALL YOUR NEIGHBOR, YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND, AND GOD SAY, "WHAT ABOUT ME?" &gt;&gt; BUT THE MESSAGE THIS MORNING IS REMEMBER THE LORD. REMEMBER HIM IN YOUR CRISIS. REMEMBER HIM IN THE MOMENT WHEN IT LOOKS AS IF YOUR WORLD IS FALLING APART. REMEMBER HIM WHEN PEOPLE WALK AWAY. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; In numbers 15 and verse 37. Just building a foundation and testing the temperature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like to test the temperature &gt;&gt; because we come to the house of God to worship. &gt;&gt; We come to the house to receive. We come to THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO PUSH INTO A NEW WEEK. And you CAN'T GET ANYTHING IF YOU'RE CAUGHT UP IN A HUMANISTIC REALM. I'm not bringing anything you haven't HEARD BEFORE. EVERYTHING WE ARE SAYING THIS MORNING IS IN THE BIBLE AND IN THE PROPHET'S MESSAGE. BUT IT'S UP TO YOU TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE LORD ON YOUR DINNER TABLE, ON YOUR LUNCH TABLE, ON YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE. GO HAVE HIM IN YOUR GOING OUT, HAVE HIM IN YOUR COMING IN. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord spake unto Moses in Numbers 15, &gt;&gt; saying, "Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringes of the borders a ribbon of blue, and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS WASN'T A RANDOM THING. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A VERY DELIBERATE, INTENTIONAL THING SO THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES, YOU REMEMBER THE LORD. &gt;&gt; ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE THIS MORNING? SO YOUNG PEOPLE, GOD PUT THIS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES, YOU REMEMBER YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF THE KING. &gt;&gt; YOU REMEMBER YOU'RE A SON OF THE KING. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? &gt;&gt; And remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to go whoring. So here it is. God is saying to Moses, "GO TELL THE PEOPLE." FROM THE WAY YOU DRESS, SHOULD BE A REMINDER TO YOU OF WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE EVER IN A SITUATION, YOU LOOK DOWN AND YOU SEE THE FRINGE, IT SHOULD REMIND YOU, I'M THE GOD THAT WOKE YOU UP THIS MORNING. I'M THE GOD WHO DELIVER YOU. I'M THE GOD WHO PROMISED TO GIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST. I AM YOUR PROTECTOR. GREATER IS HE THAT'S in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? This is why as a believer, brother and a sister, the way YOU CARRY YOURSELF SHOULD BE A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; When people should see you AND YOU SEE YOURSELF, IT SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT YOUR NAME IS ON THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; It should remind you that you are royalty. &gt;&gt; It should REMIND YOU YOU ARE PART OF A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP THIS MORNING. NO. GOD CALLED YOU HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD. YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN AND IT CANNOT BE ERASED BECAUSE GOD LOVED YOU SO MUCH AND HE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD TO THEM THAT LOVE GOD AND TO THEM WHO ARE THE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; In Deuter in Deuteronomy 5:15, I'm still building a foundation. And remember, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that thou was a servant, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; in the land of Egypt, &gt;&gt; and the Lord thy God brought thee out then through a mighty hand, and by a stretch out hand. Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8:2, "And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these 40 years in the wilderness." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to remember it. Why? TO HUMBLE YOU. &gt;&gt; AND to prove thee. TO PROVE ME, TO TEST THEE, &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? To know what WAS IN THINE HEART. &gt;&gt; WHETHER THOU WOULD KEEP HIS COMMANDMENT OR NO. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU SHARING THIS WITH ISAAC? BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR US TO TALK ABOUT ARGUMENT AND WHO BELIEVE THIS. IT'S TO PRODUCE A LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE LIFE IS A REMINDER THAT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BLOOD, YOU WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, WE COULDN'T BE HERE THIS MORNING. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MERCY OF GOD, YOU COULD NOT STAND ONE DAY. IF THE LORD MOVES HIS HAND, YOU FALL TO THE GROUND. [cheering] LISTEN, CHURCH, YOU ARE NOT KEEPING YOURSELF. BUT IT'S THE LORD. &gt;&gt; He's the one keeping you. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I shared with our church recently, &gt;&gt; you could never, you parents in here, you could never love your children more than God loves them. Can I say that one more time? &gt;&gt; You could never love your children MORE THAN GOD LOVES THEM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM ONTO THE EARTH. YOU ARE JUST A TRUSTEE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I GUARANTEE ONCE THEIR NAME IS ON THE BOOK, THEY ARE GOING TO COME. I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY ARE NOW. I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY WERE LAST NIGHT. IF GOD HAS A HAND ON THEM, THEY ARE GOING TO BE DELIVERED. YOU SERVE [screaming] GOD AND WATCH GOD WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU SERVE GOD AND WATCH GOD DO HIS THING. BECAUSE GOD IS A MIRACLE WORKING GOD. GOD DOESN'T NEED YOUR HELP. HE WANTS YOUR WORSHIP. BUT HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER YOUR CHILDREN. HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO HEAL CANCER. HE IS BIG ENOUGH TO HEAL FEMALE CONDITION. OH, somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; He is big enough &gt;&gt; to make the cripples walk. &gt;&gt; He's big enough to GIVE YOU A REVIVAL IN YOUR SOUL. YOU LOST YOUR JOY. HE COMES TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR JOY. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOOD IS IT TO BE A CHRISTIAN AND YOU HAVE NO JOY? WHEN THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH, SO YOU HAVE NO JOY, YOU HAVE NO STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING A DEEP MESSAGE THIS MORNING. I AM PREACHING A MESSAGE OF REMEMBERING THE LORD. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER HIM IN THE MORNING. REMEMBER HIM IN THE NOON TIME. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU WAKE UP. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU GO TO BED. REMEMBER HIM WHEN YOU'RE IN FRONT OF YOUR BOSS. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH WITH YOUR COWORKER. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET UPSET. REMEMBER THE LORD WHEN YOUR WORLD IS FALLING APART. REMEMBER THE LORD [cheering] &gt;&gt; Situations are supposed to come. &gt;&gt; Problems are supposed to come. THAT IS PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF A WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; What army are you in if you don't HAVE A BATTLE? &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BATTLE THIS MORNING, I WANT TO BREAK IT TO YOU. You you have to check yourself &gt;&gt; because if YOU'RE IN THE ARMY OF THE LORD, YOU HAVE BATTLES COMING IN THE MORNING, IN THE NOON TIME TO TRY TO THROW YOU OFF, TO TAKE YOU OUT IN THE SPIRIT. BUT WHEN YOUR WORLD BEGINS TO ROCK, YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE LORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S THE LORD'S DOING. &gt;&gt; HE IS PROVING. He is testing. HE IS MAKING SURE THAT HE CAN GIVE YOU POWER BECAUSE POWER IS COMING TO YOU. BUT POWER WITHOUT CHARACTER IS SATANIC. &gt;&gt; But brother Isaac, you don't even know HOW TOUGH MY HUSBAND IS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE LORD GIVE IT A HUSBAND TO TRY YOU. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TOUGH MY CHILDREN ARE. IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM RIGHT NOW TALKING TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING TO YOUR HUSBAND. I'M TALKING TO YOU. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOUR CHILDREN. I'M TALKING TO YOU. YOU REMEMBER THE LORD. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AROUND YOU. YOU REMEMBER THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Hand the church say amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you say this, brother Isaac? Because there are a lot of Sunday churchgoers and Wednesday church goers and Friday churchgoers. And in Trinidad, I I I say it all the time, the Oscars is the award for acting. &gt;&gt; Amen. If that award was to go to a country, it will come here. You know, &gt;&gt; because we ARE VERY GOOD AT PUTTING ON A good show, &gt;&gt; how you do it? All is well. And behind there, your whole car, your flat tire, your tire went this way, this way. I'm not saying don't speak positive. &gt;&gt; But under pressure, most people break under pressure. &gt;&gt; Most people do the wrong things under pressure. AND IF YOU PUT SOMETHING in the code or the programming code TO REMEMBER THE LORD BEFORE YOU RESPOND, your response will be different. &gt;&gt; IF AS YOU APPROACH THE HOUSE OF GOD, YOU REMEMBER THE LORD BEFORE YOU STEP INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD, IT'LL MAKE YOU WALK in a certain way BECAUSE THIS IS NOT BROTHER WALDRON'S CHURCH. THIS IS GOD'S HOUSE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER WALDRON HAS SHEPHERD AUTHORITY, BUT THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND IF YOU REMEMBER THE LORD, THEN YOU WILL HONOR THE PASTOR. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL HONOR THE OFFICERS BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER IS THE LORD. [applause] &gt;&gt; If if Ananas and Safara had understood the Lord, &gt;&gt; they thought they were talking to brother Peter. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PETER, BUT THE LORD WAS IN THE PICTURE. &gt;&gt; AND PETER SAID, "YOU HAVEN'T LIED TO ME. YOU LIED TO THE HOLY GHOST." AND BECAUSE HE LIED TO THE HOLY GHOST, I CAN'T GET INVOLVED IN THIS THING. &gt;&gt; I wonder what would happen because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. &gt;&gt; What happens to our young people &gt;&gt; because they don't know the fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when you get the fear of the Lord and you begin to remember the Lord, when you go to school, IT IS NO LONGER A PRESSURE. WELL, I NEED TO dress this way and do this. No, you remember the Lord. You remember he's watching. &gt;&gt; You remember he's next to you. Yeah. Do I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I'LL FEAR NO EVIL. YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF THE Lord &gt;&gt; and all of social media and family and the news and the politics. IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION. IT'S TO DISTRACT YOU. &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE LORD IN ALL OF IT? WE HAVE TO remember the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8:1. I'm just showing you how much time this thing repeats and we bring it into context shortly. Beware that thou forget not the LORD THY GOD. WHY IS IT GOD has to keep repeating this thing? &gt;&gt; All through the Old Testament, ALL THROUGH THE NEW TESTAMENT, DON'T FORGET. REMEMBER, DON'T FORGET verse 11. Brother Waldron told me I could take my time. Just so you know, &gt;&gt; so I'm taking my time. All right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, &gt;&gt; in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, lest, listen, when thou hast eaten and art full, AND HAST BUILT GOODLY HOUSES, AND DWELT THEREIN, and when thy herds and thy flock multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiply, and all that thou HAST IS MULTIPLIED, &gt;&gt; THEN THY HEART BE LIFTED UP, &gt;&gt; AND THOU FORGET THE LORD THY GOD, WHICH BROUGHT THEE FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, FROM THE house of bondage, who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought, WHERE THERE WAS NO WATER, WHO BROUGHT THEE FORTH WATER OUT OF THE ROCK OF FLINT, WHO FED THEE IN THE WILDERNESS WITH MANA, WHICH THY FATHERS KNEW NOT, THAT HE MIGHT HUMBLE THEE, AND THAT HE MIGHT prove thee to DO THEE GOOD AT THY LATTER END. AND THOU SAY IN THINE HEART, MY power and the might of mine hand got me this wealth. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God. Again, it repeated, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may ESTABLISH HIS COVENANT, WHICH HE swear unto thy fathers, as it is this day. And it shall be, if thou do at all, forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish. &gt;&gt; So God was showing THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO GET BLESSED. &gt;&gt; But in getting blessed, don't forget ME &gt;&gt; IN MULTIPLYING YOUR BREAD BASKET, DON'T FORGET ME. YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND THEY PRAY for a job? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, pastor, pray for me. I need to get a job. and the moment they get a job after a few months they can't see them anywhere &gt;&gt; or they was coming to church and they was traveling AND THEY SAY LORD BLESS me with that car bless with THAT CAR AND THE MOMENT THEY GET THE CAR THEY on Moracas Beach on Sunday morning &gt;&gt; because what they're really looking for is a God of convenience &gt;&gt; they want A GOD WHO CAN JUST HELP THEM WITH THEIR AGENDA AND THE OBJECTIVE BUT THROUGH SCRIPTURE AND this is God putting it there over and over. Don't forget me &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE BLESSED STAY HUMBLE. WHEN GOD OPEN UP YOUR BREAD BASKET, STAY HUMBLE. WHEN GOD GIVE YOU FOOD ON YOUR TABLE, STAY HUMBLE. AND HE'S SAYING MANY OF US WHEN IT'S MY HARD WORK, WHAT HARD WORK YOU DO THAT BLESSED YOU. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THE LORD DON'T GIVE YOU INCREASE, YOU'LL GET NOTHING. IT HAVE PEOPLE WORKING HARD WITH NO INCREASE. BUT IT'S THE LORD WHO HAS BLESSED YOU. THE LORD WHO HAS KEPT YOU. [cheering and applause] Can the church say amen? And he promised to do it. NOT JUST IN THE NATURAL, but in the spiritual. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Remembering the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why is this important? We're building into something in the message oneness. Brother Brandham said that's God's purpose. And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, his earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them. We read that same scripture. It says that ye are supposed to be partakers of his divine nature by these precious promises. &gt;&gt; So that what so that made them with God's data in them then with each other and God they become all one. Isn't that a beautiful picture? God in his family. Father over all supreme. No death, no sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing. Just joy unspeakable. Never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God. What a picture. Because the very nature of God was in these people. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for. You know, not you operating a certain way, BUT THE VERY NATURE OF GOD, THE LORD HIMSELF IN THESE PEOPLE. And therefore, WHAT THAT DID, THEY FOLLOWED JUST in line with God. and God with them made them one. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; The nature of God. That's the reason it wasn't the apostles in the message perseverant. Jesus chose them all. Practically every one of them without even enough education to sign their name. He didn't choose priests. He didn't choose theologians. He chose fishermen and herdsmen, the ignorant and the unlearned. So he could take that in his hand and take nothing and MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT. THAT'S HIS NATURE. LISTEN, IF GOD DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE MESSAGE WILL FIND ITSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE PREDESTINATED. YOU NEVER FOUND THE MESSAGE, THE MESSAGE FOUND YOU. THE YOU WERE BORN, THE MESSAGE STARTED TO LOOK FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THE MESSAGE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND THE MESSAGE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH AND THE MESSAGE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. AND ONE DAY THE MESSAGE FOUND YOU AND THE SEED IN YOUR SOUL WAS QUICKENED. YOU COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. &gt;&gt; YOU COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. BUT THEN SOMETHING GOT A HOLD OF YOU. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU CHANGED. BUT THIS BROTHER DIFFERENT. THIS SISTER DIFFERENT. IS THE SEED IN YOU? BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT EVEN THE BELIEVER. BUT THE SEED IN YOU, THAT'S THE BELIEVER. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And that seed in you is what responds to the word. &gt;&gt; When the word goes forth, THAT SEED SAYS AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT SEED IS BIGGER THAN YOUR PROBLEM. THAT SEED OF PREDESTINATION AND THAT SEED OF PURPOSE IS BIGGER THAN YOUR SICKNESS. YOUR SICKNESS HAS TO GIVE WAY TO THE SEED IN YOU. GREATER IS HE THAT'S IN YOU THAN HE THAT'S IN THE WORLD. GREATER IS HE THAN YOU THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S COMING TO GET YOU. CAN THE church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But something has to push us. Something has to bring us to a spot when we recognize that it's not just our effort, but we have to make the Lord the focus of our lives. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the Brandon taught us in every church has three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; We know these things. &gt;&gt; And it took me a a while to understand that there are people who are in church who are unbelievers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Think about it. It's it's a paradox, you know, &gt;&gt; because you see in every church in three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; So there are people in the church who actually don't believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then there are those who are the make believers in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BELIEVE, BUT THEY REALLY DON'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So there's THE FIRST GROUP. THEY ARE THERE. THEY'RE SINGING. THEY'RE CLAPPING. THEY COME IN THE CHURCH ALL THE TIME, BUT THEY REALLY DON'T BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT they are they don't believe anything at all. No, no. But there are few things that they can't JUST GRASP. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT God could veil completely in them. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD DROP ARTS AND GRUDGES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEIR CHILDREN COULD BE RESTORED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WRITE them off already. &gt;&gt; When the Bible SAY THE PROMISES UNTO YOU AND TO YOUR CHILDREN, IT DON'T matter where YOUR CHILDREN ARE. IF THAT'S PART OF YOUR HERITAGE, IT MUST COME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to and I want to raise that if there were people around Jesus who didn't believe around Jesus &gt;&gt; and we're going to get to it in a bit. &gt;&gt; What about the message? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS HAD IT. &gt;&gt; IF JESUS OWN MINISTRY HAD PEOPLE AROUND HIM THAT DID NOT BELIEVE &gt;&gt; EVEN ONE WAS A DEVIL IN THE INNER CIRCLE. &gt;&gt; What about IN THIS MESSAGE? SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU GET YOUR FOOD FROM. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHO YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU'RE DOING. &gt;&gt; AND IN ALL OF THIS, REMEMBER THE LORD BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU. &gt;&gt; No church CALL YOU. NO MAN CALL YOU. AND JESUS SAID, "ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN ME MUST COME." &gt;&gt; So we SHOULD BE SO REJOICING THAT OUR NAMES ARE ON THE BOOK BECAUSE ONCE YOUR NAME IS THERE, YOU ARE GOING TO COME FORTH. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? So let's build a bit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to go to John chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Spend a little time in that scripture if that's okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John chapter 6 and verse one. after these things. Now, this is tying now into brother Walter's inspiration, but also leads into Jesus own declaration because we spend a lot of time in the Old Testament seeing God's mercy to them by trying to remind them, don't forget me. Don't forget me. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the Lord trying to say, "Don't forget me." &gt;&gt; That the Lord feels forgotten. &gt;&gt; John 6 verse one. After these things, Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberius, and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. So, this here is almost a type of firstp person ministry, diseases being healed. So, there's an attraction that's going on there. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. Verse four, and the Passover of feast of the Jews was nigh. So we see in here a context. We seen here a season and a moment IN TIME THAT THE PASSOVER WAS ABOUT TO take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THIS PASSAGE OF CHAPTER 6 INTO CHAPTER 7 is found between the feast of Passover and the feast of tabernacles in chapter 7. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THE PASSOVER HIMSELF IS ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; And the feast of Passover is about to take place. AND JESUS LIKES TO UNFOLD THINGS to people. He doesn't tell us all at once what he's going TO DO. MANY TIMES IN SCRIPTURE AND THE PROPHET SAID IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU CAN SEE WHAT IN FACT TOOK PLACE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK YOU WASN'T MAKING PROGRESS WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU REALIZE I'M NOT WHAT I USED TO BE. I'M NOT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BUT I NOW LOOK BACK AND SEE IT'S THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAS KEPT ME ALL THESE YEARS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse five. And when Jesus had lifted up his eyes, SO HE'S FELLOWSHIPPING WITH WITH THE DISCIPLES. HE'S IN THIS STATE WHERE people are being healed and people are being attracted to the ministry AND DISEASES. AND YOU COULD IMAGINE WHEN THE MIRACLES STRIKE AND PEOPLE ARE HEALED. EVERYBODY STARTS TO COME TOGETHER. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him. And he said unto brother Phillip, when shall we buy bread that these may eat? &gt;&gt; So within this chapter, we start to talk about this bread thing. NOW, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHERE SHALL WE BUY BREAD THAT THESE MAY EAT? NOW THAT is a loaded QUESTION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE GOES on and says, "And this he said to prove him, to test him." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO JESUS WAS ASKING SOMEWHAT ON THE ONE HAND A RHETORICAL QUESTION BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO PLACE HE COULD GO AND BUY THIS BREAD. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To prove him FOR HE HIMSELF KNEW what he would do. And Philillip answered him. 200 PENNY WORTH OF BREAD is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little. Now 200 penny worth is like 200 dinari. IS LIKE 200 days worth of money that you could earn. SO HE'S SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. &gt;&gt; YES. YES. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ONLY THAT, YOU KNOW THE BAKERIES HERE in in Trinidad, you could walk to a bakery and say I need bread for 5,000. &gt;&gt; Nobody have that inventory. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; NO BAKERY YOU COULD WALK TO RIGHT NOW, YOU COULD WALK IN today after this and say, "Listen, we need enough bread for 5,000." And it's NOT JUST 5,000. IT'S 5,000 MEN. That didn't include the women and the children. SO 10,000 LO THE BREAD NOW BECAUSE we have people waiting to eat. THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS service by brother Walton for a while. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And Philillip inspired say, "Brother, but but but Jesus, we the money we have not enough. But even still, I mean, where we going to get all this bread?" &gt;&gt; Philip answered me in verse 7, 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little. ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES, ANDREW, SIMON PETER'S BROTHER, saith unto him, "There's a lad here, WHICH HAD FIVE BARLEY LOAVES." I know barley is first fruit, right? Barley loaves and two small fishes. But some of you will say, "This is the Trinidad spirit right here. You're bringing it, but you're asking, but what are they among so many?" It's better you just say what you have, but here we putting in a little word. I have this here, but what is this among so many? I like Jesus's next response because this here shows that God is a God of order. &gt;&gt; And it's only when you slow down and you look at it, they recognize HOW GOD OPERATES. HIS FIRST INSTRUCTION WAS, and Jesus said, "Make the men sit down." &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Written in red. I'm a Bible believer. Anytime something is written, it's important. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "MAKE THE MEN SIT DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THIS THING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, LET'S GET SOME ORDER IN here &gt;&gt; because God is about to do something. AND GOD IS A GOD of order. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO MISS WHAT'S ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. SO, I WANT EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN. &gt;&gt; But in church long time, I just normally stand up in church. Well, you go &gt;&gt; because Jesus say make is not just tell them. He said make them sit down or no. &gt;&gt; It may seem small, but I WANT US TO UNDERSTAND GOD IS A GOD OF ORDER. YOU CANNOT COME INTO THE KINGDOM AND DO WHAT YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND OPERATE ANYWHERE YOU WANT. &gt;&gt; JUST SAY MAKE EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN. I DON'T WANT NOBODY STANDING UP. I DON'T WANT NOBODY WALKING AROUND THE PLACE. THERE'S A ORDER TO WHAT GOD IS ABOUT TO DO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So when you don't understand and you come to church and you don't understand something, respect the order &gt;&gt; because God works through order. &gt;&gt; The usher put you somewhere. The deacon PUT YOU SOMEWHERE. SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING. YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BLESSING TIED TO THE OBEDIENCE. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE, YOU THROW OFF YOUR WHOLE BLESSING BECAUSE YOU FIND THE brother shouldn't do this and this one shouldn't do this. God is a God of order. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible goes on, "Now there was much grass in the place." &gt;&gt; SO THE MEN SAT down in number about 5,000. Verse 11. And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that WERE SET DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, this saying this set down thing. Brother Clarence, if when somebody was standing up there again, anything? &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE GOES ON TO SAY IT went to those WHO WERE SET DOWN. IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU'RE OBEDIENT, IF YOU COULD TAKE CHURCH ORDER, IF YOU COULD CONDUCT YOURSELF RIGHT, IF YOU COULD TAKE THE SMALL THINGS BECAUSE THAT SMALL THING, THE BIBLE REPEATS THE POINT ONLY THOSE WHO WERE SET DOWN GOT THE FOOD. &gt;&gt; SO EVEN IN THE WAY GOD IS DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE OF BREAD, HE IS BRINGING CHURCH ORDER, CONDUCT ORDER, DOCTRINE TIED TO IT SO THAT YOU COULD RECEIVE THE WORD A CERTAIN WAY, NOT BY YOUR IMAGINATION OR HOW YOU FEEL. WELL, I FEELING LED TO STAND UP NOW. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IN THE DAYS OF JOSHUA TO SHOUT SHOUT &gt;&gt; AND MAN SAY I I FEEL to shout right now or know brother take deacons take him outside &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S AN ORDER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT TO DO IT. IF GOD SAID DO IT WHATEVER GOD SAYS DO IT IN THAT WAY &gt;&gt; AND WATCH GOD BLESS YOU. &gt;&gt; But I don't understand. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAY SIT DOWN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I LIKE TO SHOUT. I LIKE TO SHOUT WHY JOSHUA SAY WHEN WHEN I BEGIN IT TO SHOUT. I FEEL TO SHOUT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TIME, PLACE, ORDER, CONTEXT. THIS IS GOD'S OPERATION. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAYS IT A CERTAIN WAY, HE SAY SHOW YOURSELF IN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PRESENT YOUR BODY A LIVING SACRIFICE. WELL, HOW AND WHY AND WHEN? YOU HAVE ALL KIND OF QUESTIONS. &gt;&gt; Could somebody give me a reason why he wanted us to sit down? Brother, just sit down. &gt;&gt; You're holding up production right now. &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this is the simple things. MANY TIMES WE SIT DOWN IN THE MESS WITH ALL KIND OF COMPLEX MYSTERIES. BUT THE simple thing, greet your brother, SHAKE BROTHER, DROP YOUR ODDS, FORGIVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT he do and nobody ask you that &gt;&gt; obey in the LITTLE THINGS AND WATCH GOD BLESS YOU IN THE BIG THINGS. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I end up there but just SAYING THIS IS GOD'S ORDER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S JESUS trying to make the men to sit down. &gt;&gt; MANY TIME WE RUSH AHEAD AND DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO. &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS STILL THE PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS STILL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO DO WONDERS AMONG THEM. &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE THAT I'M THE ONE DOING IT. &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE THAT THERE'S NO TEAM BEHIND THIS. THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING AND IT'S MARVELOUS IN HIS EYES. &gt;&gt; MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES. &gt;&gt; WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? BECAUSE WE THE ARMY OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE FIGHTING a war, you running here, YOU RUNNING THERE. WELL, BROTHER, I FIGHTING HERE WRONG WAY, BROTHER. DO WE GOING THIS WAY? &gt;&gt; There's nothing worse than an army that's disorganized, you know. &gt;&gt; AND LET ME REMIND US, it's one Lord. &gt;&gt; It's one faith. &gt;&gt; IT'S ONE BAPTISM. It's one army AND THERE'S ONE FIVE-STAR GENERAL. HIS NAME IS J E SUS. &gt;&gt; AND THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY ARE HIS COMMANDING OFFICERS. THAT'S THE PROPHET'S WORDS. EACH ONE BACKING ONE ANOTHER UP. &gt;&gt; MOVING THE ARMY IN STEP. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? [applause] &gt;&gt; SO THE LESSON HERE IS NOT EVERYBODY SIT DOWN OR NO. THE LESSON HERE IS WHATEVER GOD SAYS DO, do it. Because there'll BE A TIME THE PROPHET WILL SAY STAND UP TO YOUR FEET AND CLAIM YOUR HEALING &gt;&gt; by feeling to sit down. &gt;&gt; You miss your whole blessing. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET STOOD THERE SAY RISE TO YOUR FEET RECEIVE A HEALING. BROTHER, IF THE LORD SAY THAT BY JUMPING STRAIGHT TO MY FEET SO FAST. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD LOOKING FOR? A RESPONSE TO THE WORD THAT IS SO QUICK, SO RESPONSE THAT GOD SAY, "I COULD TRUST YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I CAN TRUST YOU BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE POWER GOD WANTS TO GIVE. POWER WITHOUT CHARACTER IS SATANIC. THE POWER THAT'S COMING TO YOU, GOD HAS TO TRUST YOU WITH IT. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS TO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME HE GIVES YOU AN INSTRUCTION, YOU WILL FOLLOW HIS WORD ONLY &gt;&gt; without wondering, well, Lord, why? HOW? NO, NO, NO. GOD SAYS DO THIS. GO TO THAT HOUSE. YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THAT PERSON. BUT LORD, THIS MAN HURT ME TWO YEARS AGO. I DIDN'T ASK YOU ALL THAT. PRAY FOR THE MAN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S JESUS MINISTRY. IT'S NOT YOUR MINISTRY. IT'S NOT MY MINISTRY. IT'S JESUS MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; AND OUR FLESH HAS [screaming] TO DIE TO GIVE WAY FOR GOD TO TAKE US PLACES WE DON'T WANT TO GO. TAKE US TO DO THINGS WE DON'T WANT TO DO BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE IN CHARGE. &gt;&gt; BUT I DON'T FELLOWSHIP WITH that brother. I ask you that. Sit down. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; He don't like me. I ask YOU THAT YOU CAN LIKE HIM AND HE DON'T LIKE YOU. THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. OBEY THE GOD. SHAKE HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND YOU RESPOND BECAUSE THE LORD SAID TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS GOSPEL IS BIGGER THAN YOUR FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; IT'S BIGGER THAN YOUR PERSONALITY. IT'S BIGGER THAN WHO LIKE WHO AND WHO DON'T LIKE WHO. AND MY BLOOD CAN'T TAKE HIM. GOD NOT IS IS ONE BLOOD. THE BLOOD WAS SHED ON CALVARY. THAT SPEAKS BETTER FOR EVERY ONE OF US. CAN THE CHURCH say amen? THAT THROUGH THAT BLOOD WE COULD HAVE ACCESS TO his presence AND HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOLY GHOST THAT THE INNER MAN COULD CHANGE AND BE TRANSFORMED TO BE one with the Lord. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's go. And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fish as much as they would. This as much as they would mean they could have eaten as much as they wanted. &gt;&gt; You you know somebody go to a buffet line and they say it's only one piece of chicken. No, I'm not knocking anybody but a line &gt;&gt; or it's like one piece of fish. &gt;&gt; I understand you have to plan. You have to cater different things, right? But here Jesus say they could eat as much as they want. &gt;&gt; As much fish as they wanted, they could eat. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Popwell, when they sat there and they were sitting out eating &gt;&gt; every place in order. I want you to SEE THE PICTURE. 5,000 men and children and women and everybody eating. And as they pass out food and say, "Can I have another piece of fish?" Sure, brother. Can I have ANOTHER PIECE OF BREAD? SURE, BROTHER. CAN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE? SURE, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS LET THE OPERATION GO UNTIL THEY EAT WHAT THEY WANT. UNTIL people couldn't eat no more. &gt;&gt; They were eating and not even realizing a miracle is happening. &gt;&gt; They were breaking BREAD AND IT'S UNFOLDING TO THEM AS A MYSTERY THAT THEY NOT EVEN REALIZING THE MYSTERY UNTIL JESUS SAID, "I don't want no scraps anywhere. gather all the pieces of bread. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus and when they were filled, verse 12, he said unto his disciple, "Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost." That's powerful. &gt;&gt; So he's saying, "This bread is multiplied, is valuable. I don't want anything scattered around this. This is all breaking of the bread. This is all THIS WORD HERE. GATHER IT ALL UP BECAUSE NOT ONE WILL be lost. Not one word that is spoken by the prophet will FALL TO THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; NOT ONE SCRIPTURE THAT IS SPOKEN WILL FALL TO THE GROUND. EVERY SCRIPTURE MUST COME TO PASS. EVERY PROMISE MUST COME TO PASS AS GOD UNFOLD THINGS INTO YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. And those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into THE WORLD. WHEN JESUS THEREFORE PERCEIVED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE OF BREAKING THIS BREAD TO them that THEY WOULD COME AND TAKE HIM BY FORCE TO make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea. And we know that with the encounter with the waves and Jesus walking on the water, etc., etc. I want to go down to verse 24. And when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there because of the whole thing with the boat etc. Neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to Capernium seeking for Jesus. So they hunted for Jesus now. And when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither? How you reach here? Jesus answered them and said and this is where IT GETS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE MINISTRY SHIFTED. THIS CHAPTER STARTED WITH PEOPLE WERE AFTER JESUS BECAUSE they were being healed of diseases. &gt;&gt; That's how it started. BUT NOW LOOK AT THE SHIFT in the people attitude what they came for. VERILY, VERILY, I SAY unto you, you seek me NOT BECAUSE YOU SAW THE MIRACLES. But because YOU DID EAT OF THE LOAVES AND WERE FILLED. SO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SERVICE TO FIND JESUS had moved from a crowd that was looking for a spiritual intervention to they want to move with the living bakery. &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED THEM OUT TO IT. HE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HEALING." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE DISEASED AND YOU WANT ME TO INTERVENE. YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU EAT FOOD AND YOU'RE BELLY FULL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I didn't say no. This is written in red. SO JESUS NOW BECAUSE IT'S A TRANSITION, HE WANTS TO PRESENT SOMETHING TO THEM. HE IS THE ONE WHO ASKS HOW WE FEED THEM BREAD. HE IS THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED this bread teaching in St. John 6. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 27. Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you, for him hath God the Father sealed. THEN THEY SAID UNTO HIM, WHAT SHALL WE DO THAT WE MIGHT WORK the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he had sent." And they said therefore unto him, "What sign?" So they're still looking for a sign. "What sign showest thou then, that we may see and believe thee?" What do thou work? And they pull some quotes. Our fathers &gt;&gt; did eat mana IN THE DESERT AS IT IS WRITTEN. SO THEY PULL THE QUOTE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN TO EAT. THEN JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, "VERILY, VERILY, I SAY unto you, MOSES GAVE YOU NOT THAT BREAD FROM HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; BUT MY FATHER GIVETH YOU THE TRUE BREAD FROM HEAVEN." &gt;&gt; SO HERE IT SHIFTED FROM A CONVERSATION AROUND NATURAL BREAD, &gt;&gt; TO NOW THIS SPIRITUAL BREAD TYPE. &gt;&gt; Verse 33, FOR THE BREAD OF GOD IS HE WHICH COMETH DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND GIVETH LIFE UNTO the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then said they unto him, Lord, ever more give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am &gt;&gt; the bread of life. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me shall never thirst. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT I said unto you that ye that ye also have seen me AND BELIEVE NOT. &gt;&gt; SO AFTER HE PRESENTS THIS TO THEM, HE SAY I'M ALL SEE ME. I'M TELLING YOU MY IDENTITY &gt;&gt; BUT YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE ME WITH YOU BUT YOU STILL DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; HE IS PRESENTING TO THEM HIS IDENTITY. HE SAYS I AM [screaming] &gt;&gt; PRESENT TENSE SINGULAR. NOBODY ELSE. I am &gt;&gt; the BREAD OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE YOU THE BREAD AND I AM THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He that cometh to me shall never hunger. &gt;&gt; And he that believeth on me shall never taste. &gt;&gt; But I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not. &gt;&gt; Jesus goes on, all that the Father giveth me shall come to me. &gt;&gt; And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that SENT ME. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE FATHER'S WILL which had sent me, THAT OF ALL WHICH HE HAD GIVEN ME, I should lose nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; But should raise it up again at the last day. &gt;&gt; And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone which seeth the son and believeth in him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Verse 41. And the Jews then murb at him BECAUSE HE SAID, SO ALL OF THIS, THEY SAW THE BREAKING OF THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THE MIRACLES. HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF SAYING, "I AM THE BREAD." &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM THE DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T MOSES WHO PROVIDED BREAD FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I AM THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; AND AFTER ALL OF THAT, &gt;&gt; the Jews then murmured at him because he said, "I am the bread which came down FROM HEAVEN." SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY QUESTIONING NOW HIS IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; You don't understand that you living your life in this message. You are an oddball that when you say you go into heaven, people question you. &gt;&gt; When you say you're going to be adopted, perfected, filled with the Holy Ghost, sealed, all these things, YOU ARE MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; HERE WAS THE MYSTERY ON THE EARTH HIMSELF, PRESENTING EVIDENCE, FACTS, TESTIMONY. AND HERE THEY are murmuring, I don't believe that, you know. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that you know. &gt;&gt; Verse 42. And they go back, they say, but is not this Jesus the son of Joseph? You see what they're doing there? They say what village he come from? &gt;&gt; Who was his father? &gt;&gt; What church he belong to? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How he could speak this way. &gt;&gt; Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? &gt;&gt; You see the problem here? Because people say I know but I know him from small small. How we talking? So &gt;&gt; I see him grow up. &gt;&gt; I KNOW HIS FAMILY. HOW WE MOVING SO HOW WE MOVE WITH SUCH FAITH? &gt;&gt; HOW WE STANDING WHEN ALL ELSE FALLING APART? BUT I KNOW HIM. &gt;&gt; HOW WE TALKING SO? ALL OF A SUDDEN, I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS IN THE BAR. &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS DOING THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU ARE NOW. THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE NOW. &gt;&gt; THEY WILL ALWAYS QUESTION YOUR IDENTITY. AND THE PERFECT LAMB, THE PASSOVER HIMSELF IS ON THE EARTH AND THEY'RE questioning but not Joseph's son. &gt;&gt; SO, THINK NOT STRANGE WHEN PEOPLE WONDER WHY ARE YOU STILL IN THE MESSAGE? WHY are you STILL HOLDING ON? WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING? IT SHOULDN'T BE STRANGE TO YOU BECAUSE MESSIAH WAS ON THE EARTH AND THEY'RE saying Dina Joseph's son &gt;&gt; who in other words who does he feel he is &gt;&gt; saying he's the bread of life &gt;&gt; and who do you feel you are saying you are in the bride &gt;&gt; BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU SAY YOU ARE IN THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; BY WHAT AUTHORITY DOES JESUS SAY WHAT HE SAYS BY WHAT AUTHORITY DID A PROPHET A STAR IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD SPEAK ABOUT THE things he did &gt;&gt; can the church say amen &gt;&gt; you don't know who I AM CHURCH. THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WHERE WAS THOU WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH? And the morning star sang together. &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR REAL IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; Verse 42. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he said, I come down from heaven?" &gt;&gt; And you know, WE PREACH IT. WE COME FROM GOD AND WE GO BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HOW COULD WE SAY THESE THINGS? BECAUSE IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS. BUT I KNOW I COME FROM GOD &gt;&gt; AND I GO BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH. NOW YOU SEE ME THEN YOU DON'T BECAUSE WE ARE GOING INTO THE RAPTURE. WE ARE LEAVING THIS PLACE. ONE OF THIS ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORLD WILL NOT HOLD ME ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THESE DAYS GRAVITY WILL LOSE ITS POWER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. That's why the prophet said, "When you lift your hands, &gt;&gt; you defy the laws of gravity. &gt;&gt; You testify that you are a creature of eternity. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A CREATURE OF TIME." &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU LIFT YOUR HANDS, YOU SIGNAL IT, I AM LEAVING THIS PLACE. &gt;&gt; This world is NOT MY HOME. &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH say amen? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 43. Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, "Murmur not among yourselves." Could you imagine? &gt;&gt; And we can't take criticism. Jesus had to stand there and watch them talking about him. Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; Somebody say you this, you're that, and you that there, you get in a whole fight. You get in a whole fight. &gt;&gt; Get used to people talking about you. &gt;&gt; GET COMFORTABLE PEOPLE NOT LIKING YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I said to the parents in our church, you have to prepare your children for disappointment. &gt;&gt; You have to prepare your children for failure. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LIFE IS FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENT. &gt;&gt; LIFE IS FULL OF FAILURE. IF YOU PRESENT A PICTURE TO THEM of roses their whole life, the moment they run into embarrassment, they will capitulate. &gt;&gt; But you have to LET THEM KNOW LIFE IS UP AND DOWN. &gt;&gt; THE MOMENT SOMEBODY TALK ABOUT YOU, YOU YOU can't come to church for two weeks. Somebody talk to you about your dress, your this, your that, and you there, you you stumbled here. JESUS HAD TO STAND THERE, GOD HIMSELF, and people murmuring about him. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if he went and cry in the corner and say, "I can't take it. &gt;&gt; I feeling so bad. I went to church and and I really didn't make the cut." Whatever it is, &gt;&gt; and you there in a in a py party by yourself, &gt;&gt; we have examples in scripture to know to stand. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have to stand BY REVELATION. IT'S NOT NO group thing. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR. YOU HAVE TO KNOW GOD CALLED YOU. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOU ARE PREDESTINATED. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR NAME IS UNDER THE SEVENTH SEAL. &gt;&gt; NOBODY COULD REMOVE THAT IDENTITY. YOUR IDENTITY IS IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; YOUR IDENTITY IS NOT YOUR FATHER, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR CHURCH, YOUR PASTOR. IT'S IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, murmur not among yourselves, no man. So he had let down, he had tone down the message. You know, he start to increase the stakes of what he was saying. [laughter] Hallelujah. HE SAID, NO MAN CAN COME TO ME EXCEPT THE FATHER WHICH HAD SENT ME DRAW HIM. IN OTHER WORDS, I'M NOT TURNING DOWN THE MESSAGE, AND I WILL RAISE HIM UP AT THE LAST DAY. &gt;&gt; IT IS WRITTEN IN THE PROPHETS, AND THEY SHALL BE ALL TAUGHT OF GOD. EVERY MAN THEREFORE that had heard and had learned of the Father, cometh unto me. &gt;&gt; Not any man had seen the Father, save he which is of God, and had seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life. And he REPEATS THE MESSAGE, I AM THAT BREAD OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE REPEATS IT FOR EMPHASIS. I AM THAT BREAD OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID. YOUR FATHERS DID EAT MANA IN THE WILDERNESS AND THEY ARE DEAD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE BREAD &gt;&gt; WHICH COMETH down from heaven. &gt;&gt; And a man may eat thereof AND NOT DIE. I AM &gt;&gt; THE LIVING bread &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven. &gt;&gt; If any MAN EAT OF THIS BREAD, &gt;&gt; HE SHALL LIVE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] ANYBODY WANT TO EAT OF THAT BREAD THIS MORNING? BECAUSE IF YOU EAT OF THAT BREAD, &gt;&gt; YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; And the bread that I will give is my flesh. &gt;&gt; Which I will give for the life of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus therefore strove. Stro is like to contend among and the Jews therefore sorry strove or contend among saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat. Then Jesus said unto them, verily verily I say unto you. Now he goes in for the punch &gt;&gt; because what God is trying to do, you see, we could have the very best of intentions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm making very plain. The rapture is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The rapture IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE in the message mean you're going to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SO GOD HERE IS THINNING DOWN THE CROWD. G &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE 5,000 PLUS THE CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY ELSE &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T HEAR THIS TEACHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S GOING IN FOR THE KILL BECAUSE GOD IS NOT PLAYING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He not playing with our emotions, our feeling, our history. Well, I a message long time. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; If you have no life or testimony, where you going? Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS TAKEN. &gt;&gt; HIS TESTIMONY wasn't I was in a mess FOR 20 YEARS. &gt;&gt; HIS TESTIMONY WAS HE PLEASED GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT HE PLEASE HIS BROTHERS, HIS SISTERS. BECAUSE PLEASING GOD WILL PUT YOU IN ALIGNMENT with your brothers and YOUR SISTERS. &gt;&gt; THE GOAL IS TO PLEASE GOD. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is going FOR THE JUGULAR. HE SAID, "I AM THAT BREAD. [screaming] I'M THE LIVING BREAD." &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE GOES DEEPER. GLORY. &gt;&gt; He said, "Verily, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, EXCEPT YOU EAT THE FLESH OF THE Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." &gt;&gt; Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drinked. He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me and I in him. AS THE LIVING FATHER HATH SENT ME, AND I LIVE BY THE FATHER, SO HE THAT eateth me, even he shall live by me. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE BREAD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THAT BREAD WHICH CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; NOT AS YOUR FATHERS DID EAT MANA. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT WAS JUST A SHADOW OF WHAT WAS COMING. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TO GIVE YOU A CONCEPT OF WHAT WAS COMING. NOW WHAT WAS [screaming] NOW CONCEPT IS NOW REALITY &gt;&gt; IN FRONT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THAT BREAD WHICH came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat man and are dead. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever. These things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernium. MANY THEREFORE OF HIS DISCIPLES when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it? &gt;&gt; He said the PREACHER PREACHING TOO HARD BOY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GAL. &gt;&gt; When Jesus knew IN HIMSELF THAT HIS DISCIPLE MURMURED at it, I'm sure there's a service or two you went to. When the service done, you murmured it. It's part of your nature trying to reconcile. But was he talking about me or there are people who here say, "But you you're really getting at me today, boy. You ready?" Even the prophet had his experiences. You remember one time the prophet preached. He say he blasted everything &gt;&gt; and this wonderful sister say you didn't touch me tonight. &gt;&gt; And what was she? She was the official church gossiper. &gt;&gt; And that was the one service the prophet didn't preach about gossip. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO PEOPLE HAVE A WAY TO SAY WHEN YOU PREACH YOU PREACH ABOUT ME BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE THE PREACHER KNOW WHAT GOING ON IN MY HOUSE. &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES THE MINISTER SPEAKS AND IT'S LIKE BUT WHO TELL THE PASTOR WHAT GOING ON? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S the wisdom of God dropping out to deal with the situations. &gt;&gt; SO PEOPLE LEFT THE SERVICE SAYING THERE'S A HARD SAYING BOY WHO COULD HEAR this thing boy. I don't know what what brother present today boy. I don't know what the minister presented today boy. THIS THING COULD I LIVE THIS THING? COULD I MANIFEST THIS THING? COULD I REFLECT THIS THING? HE PREACHING ABOUT HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS and purity and sacredness and virtue AND AND HONESTY AND FAITH CHARITY AND ALL THESE ARE HARD SAINTS. BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST THE VERY nature &gt;&gt; this NATURE OF THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; BUT IF THERE'S A SEED IN THERE, THE SEED KNOWS, BUT WAIT A MINUTE. &gt;&gt; This is me. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE DESCRIBING ME. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; I SHALL BE PERFECT. I SHALL BE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; When Jesus knew in himself, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THAT HIS DISCIPLES MURMURED AT IT. HE SAID unto them, "Do this offend you?" &gt;&gt; You see why? You see Jesus Jesus say, "You know what? Let me make it easier for you." You know, &gt;&gt; let me make it simpler. Let me make it convenient for you. Say, "Does this offend you? Does this bother you?" Because I'm not taking back what I said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I'm presenting the truth. Because if something offend you, you have to check yourself. &gt;&gt; If you're not living RIGHT WITH YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT OFFENDS YOU, you you you can't check the preacher. &gt;&gt; You going places you're not supposed to go. &gt;&gt; And I CALL IT OUT. THE MINISTER CALL IT OUT. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOING THERE. &gt;&gt; DOES that offend you? &gt;&gt; Because if it offend you, IT'S NOT THE PREACHER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD IS COMING TO FIND YOU &gt;&gt; AND ADDRESS YOUR ISSUES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And Jesus goes on, what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before. &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that quicken it. &gt;&gt; The flesh profiteth nothing. The words. So Jesus is going to say now he is signing everything you just said. The words, HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, THEY ARE spirit &gt;&gt; and they are life. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE SOME OF YOU THAT BELIEVE NOT. THIS IS AMONG HIS DISCIPLES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I WANT US TO APPRECIATE, CHURCH. IT WASN'T UNBELIEVERS. HE WASN'T TALKING IN FRONT OF A BAR. &gt;&gt; These were believers &gt;&gt; WHO HAD SEEN MIRACLES, WHO HAD HEARD PREACHING, WHO HAD SAT IN CONVENTIONS. AND WHEN JESUS PRESENTED TO THEM THE STANDARD OF THE WORD, &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I KNOW THERE are those among you who already believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him. Could you imagine from the very beginning &gt;&gt; Jesus see people coming and he could see pe people who believe and who don't believe. You've heard it said about a prophet many times. He couldn't tell his enemies from his friend. &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things with the prophet was seeing people and knowing who they really were. &gt;&gt; That they sincere. They in church and he's seeing that person is against me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't show it. &gt;&gt; God help because some of us if we see that forget it. God have to hide it from us. &gt;&gt; We we not ready yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you can't discern the thoughts on the 10. If you could discern thought in the 10 people, you say, "Watch now." And I said, "No, by that person don't put they want to wash this person feet." No, I wash that person feet now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you know what in there? &gt;&gt; JESUS KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING &gt;&gt; WHO WAS A believer and who had betray him. &gt;&gt; AND JUDAS WAS WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME AND NOBODY KNEW. That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus put brother Judas was the was the trustee. &gt;&gt; The treasurer &gt;&gt; and Jesus let him treasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE ESCAN BECAUSE HIS TIME WAS NOT YET &gt;&gt; TOLD. BUT THE GRACIOUSNESS of God &gt;&gt; GOD DID WASN'T EVEN EMBARRASS HIM BECAUSE WHEN YOU look at the at the last supper, he never even embarrassed Judas. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said whatever you do do quickly. &gt;&gt; They thought he going and deposit the money or do some transaction or buy bread or something. You know &gt;&gt; because God is OPERATE AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN OUR humanistic realm &gt;&gt; we want TO WALK AROUND JUDGING THIS ONE. THIS ONE FALSE. THIS ONE DEAD. THIS ONE CUT OFF. THIS ONE IS SHOCK. THIS ONE IS THIS. THIS ONE IS THAT. &gt;&gt; Jesus present the word. He say it offend you. I know some of you do believe &gt;&gt; is an opportunity still then to say Lord help me to help MY UNBELIEF &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SINCERE AND GOD CALLS OUT I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS THING THEN you say well Lord help my unbelief NOW &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE PROPHET TAUGHT THAT WHEN A PIG FALL INTO THE mud I always talk about this thing because many of us the nature change so you you you bring inside the house and you lock the house and they put some perfume and a bow tie and put a jacket ON THE PIG ONCE THE PIG INSIDE THE HOUSE HE BEH YES. YES. YES. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ONCE A PIG IN CHURCH AND HE LOCK THE DOORS, HE CAN'T GO OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT PIG ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ONCE THE DOOR STAY CLOSED BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING HIM NO ROOM TO GO OUTSIDE. THAT IS WHY LEGALISM NEVER WORKS. BECAUSE YOU LOCK THE PIG INSIDE THE HOUSE. HE BEHAVE. HE NEVER DO ANYTHING WRONG. BUT THE DAY THE DEACON FORGET the door open &gt;&gt; THAT PIG HEAD OUTSIDE &gt;&gt; WITH ONE OBJECTIVE LOOKING FOR THE NEAREST MUD PIT &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE FIND THAT MUD PIT HE START TO roll &gt;&gt; because it's his nature &gt;&gt; BUT IF THAT PIG GET AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD &gt;&gt; AND THE NATURE CHANGE &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHO IS BECAUSE HIS NATURE &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; And the REASON I'M SAYING THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN A LAMB FALL IN THE MUD, &gt;&gt; THE LAMB BLEEDS, but brother BRIAN SAID THE LAMB CRIES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE PIG GET THERE, &gt;&gt; HE TAKE HIS MONEY'S WORTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE WANT TO ENJOY THE MONTH BECAUSE THAT'S HIS NATURE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO IF YOU STRUGGLE AND YOU RECOGNIZE I'M STRUGGLING TO BELIEVE, A SLAM WOULD SAY, "LORD, HELP MY UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; MAYBE I'M NOT GETTING IT, BUT HELP ME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS SERVICE NOT SURE IF I GO INTO THE RAPTURE. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS SERVICE NOT SURE IF [screaming] I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST." &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen?" &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse 64. But there are some of you that believe not. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who would betray him. All right. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Therefore said I unto you, that no man COULD COME UNTO ME except it were given unto him OF MY FATHER." THIS IS WHY YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU COULD TELL YOUR FRIEND IN SCHOOL ABOUT this thing. AND UNLESS GOD put a seed in them, they will NEVER RESPOND. &gt;&gt; DON'T FEEL BAD WHEN THEY DON'T. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU STOP TESTIFYING. BUT EVERY SEED OF GOD WILL RESPOND BECAUSE ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS GIVEN MUST COME. CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN? SO STAND WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THIS MESSAGE IS REAL. &gt;&gt; That this message is powerful AND THIS MESSAGE WILL TAKE YOU FROM FAITH TO CHARITY AND ALL THE WAY TO THE RAPTURE, ALL THE WAY TO YOUR BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could it take a few minutes more? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And he said, therefore, verse 65 said, therefore said I unto you that no man could come unto me except they were given unto him of my father. And verse 66, here it is. AND FROM THAT TIME many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. You see this friends? This is not walk away from eagles gathering. This is not walk away from a pastor. This is walk away from Jesus. You know &gt;&gt; I want you to PICTURE THIS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THAT WAS IN GOD. HE POURED IT TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT CHRIST, THAT LORD, Jehovah of the old, JESUS OF THE NEW &gt;&gt; STANDING THERE BREAKING BREAD, bringing clarity, unfolding revelation to them. And in THE FACE OF THAT, THEY walk away from HIM &gt;&gt; HAVING SEEN MIRACLES, HAVING GOT TEACHINGS, AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM HIM. So why should it surprise you when people want to walk away FROM THE MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WALKED AWAY FROM HIM. YES. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm putting it to you. There has to be a falling away. Brother Brandham taught us that. &gt;&gt; Because this rapture is not for everybody as much as we'd like it to be for everybody. &gt;&gt; This rapture is for those who meet the conditions of rapturing condition. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU PRESSURIZED ENOUGH? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU AN ASTRONAUT? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. IF YOU NOT PRESSURIZED AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS RAPTURE THING, YOUR your cargo, &gt;&gt; IF IT ALREADY ABOARD THIS RAPTURE EXPRESS, YOU'RE STAYING HERE. &gt;&gt; BUT AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, &gt;&gt; WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT INTO THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FROM THAT TIME BREAKING OF THE BREAD, OPENING OF THE WORD, THE REVEALING OF THE MYSTERIES OF HIS IDENTITY, HIS PURPOSE, HIS PLAN, BECAUSE ALL OF THAT WAS COVERED UP TO THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; All that the father GIVE MUST COME. I AM THE LIVING BREAD. IF IT DON'T COME TO ME, YOU CAN'T GET NOTHING. ALL OF THIS WAS PRESENTED and they couldn't handle it because they wanted the gospel of convenience, the gospel of bread, natural food, the gospel of miracles. And for many people, if they give miracles and food, they will come to church forever. &gt;&gt; But now he was challenging them for their life &gt;&gt; because to eat this flesh, drink this blood. Now it's a deeper level of commitment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is a higher expectation from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From that time, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. Then Jesus said unto the 12, and I love this because many of us, you know, better said compassion is not feeling sorry for people. &gt;&gt; Compassion is doing the will of God. &gt;&gt; We they're trying to pull ram and goat and ox into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; We supposed to invite you now. But the reality is when a ox come into the church or a ram or a goat, they can't stay. is a hard SAYING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONLY LAMB COULD EAT THIS LAMB FOOD. &gt;&gt; Only eagles could GATHER AROUND WHERE THE CARCASS IS. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE DOVE COULD DROP DOWN UPON A LAMB AND HE COULD STAY. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS NOT PLAYING GAMES. HE WATCHED 70 WALK AWAY. &gt;&gt; AND LOOKED AT THE REMAINING TEAM &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "WILL you go also?" &gt;&gt; In other words, IF YOU WANT TO GO, GO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I know what I am. I KNOW WHO I am. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM. I'VE TOLD YOU WHO I AM. I'VE TOLD YOU WHO WILL COME. I WOULD TOLD YOU WHERE WE GOING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; 70 WALK AWAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING ALSO? &gt;&gt; CAN the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD NOT BEGGING ANYBODY TO WORSHIP HIM. GOD NOT BEGGING ANYBODY TO SERVE HIM. IT'S EITHER YOU HAVE A REVELATION OR YOU [screaming] DON'T HAVE A REVELATION. BUT IF YOU HAVE A REVELATION, THEN YOU COULD STAND. OH, GLORY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE A REVELATION, THEY DON'T PULL YOU. COME TO CHURCH. COME TO CHURCH. PRAISE GOD. WORSHIP. NO. YOUR REVELATION PUTS YOU IN A CERTAIN ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T WAIT TO COME TO CHURCH. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SERVE GOD. YOU CAN'T WAIT TO FORGIVE BECAUSE IT'S THE POWER [screaming] OF THE HOLY GHOST UPON YOUR REVELATION. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES REAL REVELATION TO STAND WHEN OTHERS DON'T WANT IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL AFFAIR. &gt;&gt; THOUGH 10,000 FALL ON THIS SIDE, A THOUSAND ON THIS SIDE, I SHALL NOT BE MOVED. THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD SAY TO ME TO MOVE ME AWAY FROM THIS GOSPEL. THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD PRESENT TO ME TO TAKE ME FROM THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; IF THIS IS WRONG, I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT. THIS IS THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS WHAT WOULD SET US FREE. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHO WALKS AWAY. IF THEY DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY PREACH BACK TO ME. IF THEY DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, HALLELUJAH. IF THEY DON'T WANT IT MORE FOR ME, I WILL TAKE THE ANOINTING. I WILL TAKE THE ATMOSPHERE. I WILL TAKE THE PROMISES. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT A DENOMINATIONAL GROUP. THIS IS THE ONLY TRUTH THAT EXISTS. THIS IS JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF MAN VEILED IN A SON OF MAN STOOD AS LIVING BREAD TO US PRESENT IN POWER. REVEALING &gt;&gt; THE THOUGHT AND INTENTS OF THE HEART, &gt;&gt; TYING UP THE LOOSE ENDS, &gt;&gt; CHURCH, YOU MAY BE SEATED. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM COULDN'T DO IT, &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS THE SON OF MAN &gt;&gt; VEILED IN A SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; HE CAME HIMSELF. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I AM THE LIVING BREAD. I AM THE ONE. IF YOU COME TO ME, YOU'LL GET THE HOLY [screaming] GHOST. IF YOU COME TO ME, YOU'LL GET BACK YOUR JOY. IF YOU COME TO ME, YOU'LL GET YOUR HEALING. YOU COME TO ME, YOU'LL GET THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THE QUESTION STILL STANDS THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; WILL YOU GO ALSO? WILL YOU GO BACK TO THE WORLD? WILL YOU GO BACK TO HOW IT WAS YEARS AGO? WILL YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OLD DOCTRINE, TO YOUR OLD BELIEF? OR WILL YOU GO TO THE RAPTURE? I SAY, "COME AND GO WITH ME TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE. COME AND GO WITH ME TO THE PROMISED LAND. IT'S FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. THERE'S HEALING IN THE LAND. THERE'S DELIVERANCE IN THE LAND. THERE'S MERCY IN THE LAND. [screaming] THERE'S POWER IN THE LAND. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF GOD IS GOD, SERVE HIM. IF GOD IS GOD, WORSHIP HIM. IF GOD IS GOD, PRAISE HIM. [cheering] YOU WANT TO GO, [screaming] YOU COULD GO. BUT WE ARE NOT LEAVING. WE ARE RESTING ON THIS. THIS IS US. THIS IS WHO WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE. [screaming] THIS IS WHAT WE STAND FOR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TASTE THE LIVING BREAD, &gt;&gt; QUAO CAN'T STOP IT. &gt;&gt; KISS BREAD HAVE NOTHING ON IT. YOUR BAKERY HAVE NOTHING ON IT. THIS IS NOT BREAD FROM NO OR THIS IS THE LIVING BREAD. WHEN YOU EAT OF THIS THING, WHEN YOU EAT OF THIS THING, IT PUTS FIRE IN YOUR BONES. [screaming] FIRE IN YOUR BONES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, &gt;&gt; it have food AND YOU'RE EATING FOOD. &gt;&gt; YOU move the front. You never had that. &gt;&gt; THEY SAID WHEN THEY GO BY THE FOOD, THEY eat the food. So you MOVE WITH THAT SMILE. &gt;&gt; THEY SAY, "WHY YOU SO HAPPY?" BOY, THAT FOOD GOOD BOY. That food good. That food good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I CAN TELL YOU YOUNG PERSON, YOU TASTE THIS LIVING BREAD. THIS FOOD GOOD. &gt;&gt; THIS FOOD REAL GOOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] IT'LL GIVE YOU JOY. &gt;&gt; WHY YOU COME TO CHURCH LOOKING SAD? THE LIVING BREAD WILL PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE LIVING BREAD. &gt;&gt; PAUL COULD SAY, "DEATH, WHERE'S YOUR STING? GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY?" BECAUSE THE BREAD I'M EATING. THIS LIVING BREAD IS BREAD FOR ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; I CAN LAY THIS BODY DOWN AND PICK IT UP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; Because of the diet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Atkins &gt;&gt; or keto diet. &gt;&gt; None of that kind of diet. &gt;&gt; You see this living bread diet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THIS LIVING BREAD DIET &gt;&gt; DOES TAKE CANCER AND BREAK IT. THIS LIVING BREAD DIET, LET'S TAKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND BREAK IT.
