just give the lord a shout of praise i hope you're not bored of me saying that give the lord a shout of praise or praise the lord or whatnot but that's what you'll be put on earth for to give god praises this what this what confused the devil because you're supposed to be depressed dumb and old flat out broken tired weary to give up but you come to church this morning and you say hallelujah glory praise god you know what you're saying devil forget about it get out of here i praise god for getting the thing that i passed i pressed towards them that's all what your praises is doing god you

to india i'll be back late next week so you pray for the meetings in india uh every wrong is a battle but we have been sent here to fight hallelujah that's what god put us on good for i have a word for you this morning you can't get victory without conflict you're not going to preach just yet we just want to see some things before we start to preach but you can't get victory without conflict brother branham preached a message called conflict between god and satan and conflict is a struggle for power for property conflict is strong disagreement between people groups the results in angry argument differences isn't that right competitive comparative opposing action antagonistic state or action mental struggle resulting from incompatible or opposing needs drives wishes external or internal demands conflict the opposition of persons or forces that give us rise to dramatic action or drama or fiction active disagreement between people with opposite opinions in fightings all this conflict to fight to contend to back up the fight to struggle prolong struggle and strife discord of action isn't that right and brother branson eden god knew his enemy and all the attacks of his enemy gordon god is infinite and the infinite god is the perfection of the perfections he knew all things before they ever was and therefore this infinite god could have looked forward and seen the end from the beginning so he could declare your end from the beginning so you could know that you're going to get the victory that's why you can shout right now you could know you're going to get the victory that's why you could get rejoice right now so the conflict and struggle and mind battle you're going through in your mind today and even now that's fine they don't want to say amen that's very fine oh yes you get upset and this that all is good because you're going to get the victory do you believe that all the pressure is good that's right up the mountain and then going in the valley all that is part of the package that give us life hallelujah doesn't make it like a stuffed toy we just like this yeah that's sophie and just stick here like that so we're not no stuffed toy we are real people you really walk on the water and you're really sink like peter you really say lord help me you're really crowded under god you really don't know where to turn you're back really against the wall and you look up and it seems like there's no help you look to the right and there seem to be no help you look to the left there you see they may no help you're really pressed god is silent but you know you have to be certain of god oh hallelujah you know your god is alive even though he is silent he is still god oh give the lord a shout in the house glory to god maybe long time you haven't felt his presence maybe a long time you haven't felt this power but he is still god not because you don't feel and he's not there not because you don't see a miracle he is not there he is there anyhow he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that damn is a liar this morning oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah we are dangerous people to that devil that's why he fights you the way he fights you he's got to fight you who else must he fight we are the only challenge left he's not fighting obama and putin and all these bunch of people outside of here is two hundred thousand thousand devils loose against the pride who else must this devil fight come on shame and somebody oh glory to god you're getting me excited now oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah maybe seated when god asked satan where you're going he said you won't throw up on you you're looking for mischief looking for bride looking for elect how he's going to unfold all over the earth you know wasting time with people you have in his grip he's that body with the people he have in his hands he's looking for you oh lord that means you are somebody you you are somebody you got something that's the devil trying to out trying to stop trying to interrupt glory glory hallelujah glory to god the prophet said if the devil see if you start with cigarette you'll go to marijuana then cocaine and you catch what you're doing he will keep you on cigarettes alone because you see where you're going because if you don't see where you're going you think from cigarette the marijuana the cocaine to be a junkie and to send you to hell but if you catch where he's going he'll keep it right there if you see your take from my man of the cooking and you'll catch that he will keep you on marijuana but when you recognize you don't have to be a marijuana cocaine cigarette you don't have to belong to him you can be loosed loosed yes yes he came to break the chains you don't have to walk around with a chain like in some labor camp and you're walking in some big big heavy load with you and everywhere you go you're walking with the chain oh you're here in a service that you can get those things broken you don't have to go back and do what you did before do you believe that there's still power in the name of jesus glory to god hallelujah we're going to start a revolution a revolution like the world i've never seen before we are not church members we are who daniel saw but people that know their god we are not church joiners no no no no it shall come to pass afterwards that i'll pour out my spirit hallelujah hallelujah we are the tabernacles we are the vessels [Applause] glory glory glory glory [Applause] hallelujah praise god so then he was the perfection of perfection amen he knew all things that before there ever was and therefore if this infinite god could have looked forward and dead and seen he end from the beginning and knew he would have churned on his earth his blessed children don't you believe that he would provide the best thing for him to them would you not deny to your children that was helpless little fellows who can't take care of themselves don't you struggle and work and do everything that you can to provide the best that you can for those children because you are father a parent and that's trueness the thought of earthly parent and parenthood originated in god because he was the first parent and don't you think that god seeing that's what satan would be what satan would do he gave his children and provided for them the best thing that could be valid for them knowing what the enemy attack would be god fortify his children we take the war the general goes out to meet another general and this general if he's a true citizen of this nation he surely would be to be a general the first thing he studies the enemy tactics and attacks he knows what he's going to do how he's going to work and he send and get spies to spy out and so forth god knew this great warfare was coming on he called it a great warfare not no picnic so shake that off this morning great warfare isn't that right what's coming between right and wrong he knew what the enemy was going to do he know how to equip his people so we noticed the very first thing that god did being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat satan anytime anywhere under any condition i'll give them something oh hallelujah something to defeat them anywhere any place anytime under any condition so when satan see a man walking like that satan says look trouble coming come on see him and somebody you see the devil coming in my look trouble but when the devil see a man on the word with tight and absolute the devil said look trouble coming oh hallelujah but we got the devil's answer this morning come on now hallelujah we gotta pose over him this morning oh

then the atomic weapon god at the beginning give his children the atomic bombing no musket and no string shot no god gave the atomic weapon up front [Applause] hallelujah you understand that god gave you heavy ammunition up front [Applause] and dangerous oh hallelujah that's what the pride gonna be god to be harming you oh glory to god hallelujah you're protected from tattoo from nakedness from

[Applause] uh [Applause] my god my god my lord let me see that glory glory glory you parents in here don't say when your children do this and when the children come nice and when your children come to church then you'll be happy and you're all sad and you give your whole joy and happiness unto your children amen when they do this and when to do that forget that take it back tell them you're not holding that telling whether the competitors are not you'll still be happy come on now [Applause] so many people only looking to see when they're going to reach yeah when i get the razor pay and i get a house when i get the cargo release of god all right when i get this always looking at the destination looking where they're going to get when they get there it's still not happy why not enjoy the

[Applause] listen what is for you is for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] when god wants to bless you nobody can unbless you nobody can take it off god called abraham to bless him he told lot you choose but that didn't stop the blessing what god bless no man can curse [Applause] now god i feel like having a revival before we start to preach [Applause] my lord [Music] my god i see inspired people inside of him you may be seated praise god hallelujah and this is what faith is all about it's a substance of things what you're hoping for it's the evidence of what you're not seeing so that's why god could go and declare your end from the very beginning that is why god could say jacob i love he so i hate because jacob he knew jacob was a scamp jacob was a skull that's why you can look at people and say she's so he's so they so cut that out because if he was looking at esau and jacob he was in a fine easter to be very impressive [Applause] his suit was just right he talked right he act right but jacob put right he wasn't acting right but he wanted to put it right he wanted holy ghost he wanted breakthrough he wanted to change life [Applause] so i want to encourage you don't fit anybody in a box that box would be only in your mind don't do that don't write this one off and write that one off amen let god write upon your life amen stop blaming your wife sublime in your husband stop complaining tell me yeah yeah i tell you flat out you're too complainish everything is a complaint it's a boy i am a human i wouldn't want to hear that not just for god you see when you're nagging god it's not complaints you know you're nagging god because you want god to answer your cry your need your harassing god lord avenge me your lord deliver me lord bless me hallelujah show me another emax for the right thing why am i here this morning glory to god some of you need joy [Music] joy you ever see a man drinking beer and wine looking sad depressed boy you ever see anybody drink like that when it comes to service to drink new wine [Applause] i listen i have never seen a depressed limer you may be seated somebody wrongly burned it just been laughing clinging glasses and laughing like everything is but that's all you have to be without the cleaning of the whiskey and wine and room that's all you want to be to see where you get that joy from this to come to church next sunday you're going to know what that choice could your choice of focus all you have that's a rum joy that's a wine joy that's a smoke joy but destroy i have that's the joy that only the gospel could give that's the joy only jesus could kill are you saved rejoice because jesus saved you and if he save you he can fill you with the holy ghost come on now glory to god hallelujah praise god amen david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go near it yet didn't reach yet just say let's go and he was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord in the presence of god pleasures forevermore my god i want to be in his presence i want to be surrounded by his love i want to be touched by the master when i walk the devil must run that's what we talking about when you walk when you enter the devil must exit that is what we talking about when you walk demons must tremble while you walk devils must cry out because you have support there are more for us than against us conflict is good because i feel the victory moving through the camp you got to understand this battle is not yours it's the lord the lord want to get glory in your situation the lord when i get glory amidst your conflict amidst your depression i miss you can't seem to keep out of it but you will because you were born to pip out you were born to get this breakthrough this is a special service this morning [Applause] i'm gonna be seated as long as the devil make you feel that you have to look for some man you guys cook because man does fail and man does fall but god is not a man that would lie god will keep his word and if god said you are going to be delivered i don't care what cage what shame what binding power is upon your life it's got to be broken jesus said the spirit is upon me for he has anointed me to bring good titans to set the captain free the spirit comes to release people from their condition from their situation that's what the spirit comes to do [Applause] hallelujah for glory glory to god glory to god glory glory give it up give up your own desires give it up come on now give it up give it over to god [Applause] because part of the conflict is what you want and what god want for you and because god will give you what you want yet you get anxious and you get stressed out because you have to know to wait upon the lord because they that wait upon the lord god promise to give you a strength you think god don't know you're falling into weakness he say even young men shall utterly fail and fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew not maybe not perhaps you could be struggling this morning but he said pay not upon a man upon the lord upon the lord not some man upon the lord shall renew their strength hallelujah hallelujah what about you young men struggle inside of here there's a word in the scripture for you he said i call you young man because you are strong oh hallelujah god have you at this season to be young you want to use your energy he wants to energize you with his energy oh he want to channel his energy through you come on shame and somebody god i promise you to be weak and insufficient he said let the weak say i am strong hallelujah let the poor say i am rich you got to speak it before it come to pass come on shame and somebody oh i want your faith live inside of here that miracles begin to happen miracles right here right now right in your life [Applause] hallelujah still trying to get to the scriptures oh hallelujah hallelujah 400 years from malachi to matthew 400 years they built systems traditions rights books they write and read of the old testament call it the tradition of the elders delivered by that after 400 years become law this is how it is done this is how we do it until john the bat is gone and john introduced by a repentance message hallelujah just the word that messiah is coming are they coming with fire to bond on things because if your mind don't change you are not changing your mind have to change first you got to believe it could be done that's why jesus believers don't guess always you've got to believe do you know believe all things are possible to damn that believe you have got to believe it come on see him and somebody oh glory to god hallelujah because amen elizabeth husband doubted god shut him up amen let him go kind speak because when god speak a word you better keep quiet it's got to come to pass so how do you know this is your breakthrough service you sit there like if you're waiting on this and you're looking and you're looking and you're looking stop looking it's not to act stop looking stop looking stop looking stop looking stuff look and start to act hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah glory to god when remember when joseph brothers sold him out and detroit in the pit let them egyptian men take him out to stem in the egypt you you think jesus that was easy it was a horrible experience that was a real conflict but god was in it god was sending joseph into his destiny it might be willingly but ordainedly predestinatedly he was predestined joseph to be dear in egypt no joseph don't want that but god know the end from the beginning he give him dreams to tell him his life have a special destiny he didn't know how it was going to unfold will your life have a special destiny you can't say how it's going to unfold god could use your child god could use your wife god could use your husband god could use your sister god could use your breath you don't know who god gonna use stop complaining stop worshiping start to bless god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god look at abraham hallelujah abraham believe god amen and god say abraham i'm your shield and exceeding great reward our neighbors had a chat down with god he said were you what are you talking about see now i have no child god said hold that stop talking abraham talk to call abraham abram in father of nations name change from abraham to abraham meaning father of nations he do you have a child yet go to hold that hallelujah take pressure off for that you have a name without a manifestation you have a promise without a manifestation yet just pull that part of nation when abraham pressed god god said come outside so the congress starts he said so shall i see me [Applause] you can't even count it that's the god we see when god had a blessed you can't even count it they don't have enough papers to write praises and testimonies of all what the lord has done he brought me on the merry christ he set my feet on a rock to stay he put a song in my soul he delivered me from this he pulled me out of that he made me walk on the water he snapped me over the hands of the enemy he brought me into a goodly place [Applause] listen to this you wanna be seated as i crawl this pattern it's hard to close this part here because you said you didn't need any ammunition here let me read the ammunition so god equipped children with what was freedom from the into the rapture what was it the word that is what defeat satan is the world it will defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we get the best thing there is it's the word we find jesus on earth to prove this was the best equipment when satan come in and come back with jesus like that you know the distant drone thing and fighting they like it they tend nothing this is hand to hand come back in the wilderness he never reached out to his power and tied his hands he just took the weapon god gave in the garden eden and say it is written it is written and you punch him out of the ring because the devil left jesus for a season so when jesus finished with him boom what is it written several side gone i'll take a break on that one that man is underweight hallelujah so man on the word a woman on the word is a dangerous woman a dangerous man because it means that she could get anything she asked for hallelujah because she is underweight do you understand what 10 john 15 really saying to us if ye abandon me and my word abiding you you can ask whatsoever you will and it shall be done [Applause] i don't think people get that nothing is withholding from you [Applause] it means you could walk into a hospital room on somebody that is on the dead bed that the that the doctors have no more to do for them and you could walk up and say rise up but if i don't walk into a room the woman was just bones there and he said rise up and bones run [Applause] and i am saying jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we say bones run oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you wanna be seated my jesus all right now it's not just for one or two in church it's for every one of us there's not a five-fold promise the premise says i fall five four five four five four all right now watch it's for every one of us every believer are you ready everybody is ready every believer has a right to take this word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him [Applause] from this day satan have to know don't encounter them don't let them see you keep all the sight because they got a word from the lord this morning to fight anywhere with the world and i got blows in with jesus in the wilderness and i cannot take no more licks like that again so so keep out the sight that's what we're talking about you have a right that's not a fightful ministry right that's not a minister's right that's a believer right the fight hallelujah anywhere you meet him get the word so i want to put you on the offensive not the defensive that's the problem with some of you you're only blocking and blocking and defending and docking and blocking stop blocking get the weapons out open up the windows load the ammunition and let it go [Applause] come on now [Applause] come on now you're defending what you have you're blocking what you have you're keeping quiet you may be seated you're keeping quiet because you don't want to conflict you don't want to travel with your children you don't want to talk about your husband with the boss with your neighbor but the devil in your children the devil in yours but the devil and your wife the devil is anointing this one anointing that one and you plain knife and fork and like get sweet bread that you were eating and that devil is sitting right there when you say how many come out devil in the name of jesus when you decide to do something about those philistines and hittites and jebusites when you begin to deal with something listen what you tolerate will not change you've got to get fed up you've got to get tired you've got to say enough is enough you've got to say no more come on same and somebody glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god that's what i'm talking about yes you can change [Music] [Applause] people can change but you must want change but people love themselves because the bible prophesied in the last days people shall be lovers than themselves and that's why they have all these phone taking all these selfies people taking their self all the time they love their self that's what the bible said but job [Applause] when you come to a place where you fed up you hate yourself you recognize you're wretched and you're hey man you're half crazy you don't even know why god called you but he did come on see him at somebody you are trouble all by yourself you don't need somebody to tell you that you are trouble you know that yourself but you are called you are elected come on now come on see him and somebody oh glory to god are we in church this morning are we in the church this morning glory to god hallelujah you're gonna be seated god i gotta fight with drunkards with prostitutes woman already well people got an adultery never get that fight is so good i couldn't believe it he never talked like that he said woman go and sin no more believe this who the solomon set free is free indeed that's the gospel we're talking about he was a living example of righteousness on the loose who glory to god righteousness and loose wherever you go the dead is being raised blind eye pop open people getting restored back stick being healed that's the gospel we're talking about glory to god not no binding kind of thing sit like this look like this have a hard face because of the serious all forget about it oh glory to god hallelujah he said go tell that fox i cast out devils tomorrow there's a time for work and there's a time for prayer oh glory to god time to rejoice and there's a time to shout and we are going to a certain time because we are coming into inheritance come on same as somebody we are coming into our inheritance [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i'll take out i want the anxiousness and all your you're worried about this take it out that way consider the lilies no spin and if solomon in all his glory was not already like one of these he said seek first the kingdom and all the things that don't worry about tomorrow let tomorrow see about itself don't worry about paying the rent don't worry about paying your bill don't worry about this have to shout and dance rejoice and say you are my lord you are my god you are my provider you are my way maker [Applause] i can go on and and on [Applause] but i'm saying you saw larry christian will just take thus says the lord walk right out there meet the enemy with the assurances that a toast may fall on your right ten thousand on your left it will not come nighty satan even when he first come to this attack to attack a person knowing the train of god was 45 with his word satan attacked the word he never attacked the being he attacked the word first you know god rascal he didn't attack you not a person he said what did god say give me the word and i will twist it if i don't know i can't twist what i don't know say it i quote it hallelujah and eve said god said we may eat of every tree in the garden but in the tree limits we shall not eat for the day you eat you shall surely die and say then say let me put my insult in the computer and sit not all you want is the word once you change it and you receive it you're done but what if the word restored what what if god could find at last a bunch of people that don't care what the devil say what the people say what anybody say all they care is god said so what what what if we get that kind of people your wife said this the children said that the grandmother said that the mother-in-law said that father-in-law said that don't in law say that it doesn't matter who am is what did god say and if god said you're going to be delivered i don't care what your father say what your mother say i became what you did last night you are still going to be delivered [Applause] you see here is the problem you are in the book are you living out past you remember what you're doing in the past you're looking to the future you're in the present but god is outside of that so your past is present to him your future is also present to him your presence is present to him so he knows the end from the beginning so when you're struggling look like jonah jonah run we know the story i close off with her jonah ran and got out of fish prepared before jonah was running this god would be a penny fish [Applause] god said jonah i want you to go to nineveh do i say uh-huh okay all right first boat out he gone i said he's not going there the people not his race not as kind the god damn he has all his opinion about it that time he people worship a fish god [Applause] [Music] so when god jonah take this boat right on the trim of the boat the fish take him up and bring him straight the fish know where to go the fish have built in gps this is a fish that is guided by god the fish can bring him to some other place the dpsa nineveh straighten the river so when the mouth open up and jonah step out there's a repeat because by now when jordan upwards male belly when you look down his real belly when you look along his wheelbarry he can't wait to get out so when you see he opened he said thank [Applause] he's so happy to say repent my god and when they see this man come on this fish the boy that had to be god everybody repent they let the dogs repent the horse repent the cats you name it everybody was repenting the whole city was repenting jonah mind was totally blown i tell you when god wants to do something nothing going to stop it let's give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] now open the bibles to matthew chapter 3 matthew chapter for the scripture reading this one do remember me in prayer this coming week for these meetings in india amen i'm looking forward to see what the lord will do among the bride there that portion of the bride in india matthew 3 want to read verse 16 and 17 match 24 on the refuse 21 to 28. the 16th of maturity and jesus when he was baptized went up straight away out of the heavens out of the water although the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lord voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased matthew 24 reading from verse 21 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no not ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then then if this any man shall say unto you no here is christ or there believe it not for they shall arise false christs false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they would deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not fought behold he is in the sacred chambers believe it not far as the lightning coming out of the east and shines upon the west so shall the coming of the son of man be for wherever the carcass is dear will the eagles be guarded together let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for the insight of your word that give us the passion to love and to serve you in this hour for us to our hearts this morning that we could be drawn closer to you and get connected to the intelligence of what you want done in this hour and season help us define our scriptures even as jesus found his and was able to do your will come among us in a special way and change our lives or walk and talk in jesus name i ask it may no one leave you the same way they came when we all leave here empowered by your spirit and enlightened by the love of god granted father in jesus name i ask it even before you have a seat just turn around and greet somebody in jesus name tell them thanks for coming [Music] i want to greet all those connected to us in the on the internet may god bless you and i trust them that this service would be a special blessing help and empowerment to you you may be seated advertised this morning dove leading eagle another inspiration the spirit of truth a context scripture which i want to read now from sin john you'd have to find it i'm going to read it for you uh which is from verse 12 jesus speaking i have many yet many things to say unto you but you can't debate him now how be it when he the spirit of judas come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you may god bless his word and we know brother branham says we have to receive a messenger and when we come down to the end the last message is supposed to straighten all up you're talking about the loose ends the reformers didn't live long enough alexander campbell so forth but the man the reformers didn't live long enough to get it all together so let a loose end were left and so forth and he said now when we come up to the end the last message is supposed to straighten that up and bring these things to one feet one lord one baptism he talking about that the capstone the church will come into such a minority and a ministry will be among those people till it will be exactly the same ministry that jesus did and that will bring jesus and cast the whole bride away and all those honest lutherans true lutherans presbyterians baptist methodists and whoever is born of the spirit of god will be caught away with jesus when he comes i believe that and i love how he plays that he didn't say uh uh message people he said all who are born of the spirit of god because the coming of the lord is that the coming of the magnet that will pick up all those who are magnetized to it so you have to have the characteristics that the magnet can pick you up now you know a magnet can't pick up wood or stone or paper it has to pick up metal that have the properties that could be magnetized there but the holy ghost have to be in you for the magnet of god to pick you up so this bring the raptor very simple connection to connection once the spirit is running through you and the magnet of the holy ghost comes you're gonna pick up all those so god will send this sweeping magnet to sleep across the world and pick up all across the world isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right do you believe that amen no i believe by the grace of god and my descriptive support because it didn't come in the first watch he could the seventh watch and when he come all those virgin arrows and trim the lamps presbyterian lutheran that's born of the spirit of god so all those brothers in the ages gone past they were born of the spirit of god for their time and season justification signification they had a word and spirit they had mechanics and dynamics for their season in their time but in this hour god requirement is perfection it's a little more than what they had because david and us are not made perfect isn't that right so watch in the last days what the spirit of god whosoever is born of the spirit of god shall go in that rapture i believe that the bride will be called out during that time i believe that there will be some in the last days won't have to taste debt but will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye isn't that right and the holy spirit is the divine love isn't that right tremendous victory in the love divine hallelujah so jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that's why the works was done do you believe that god the father which was the father of jesus christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in jesus christ which is the tabernacle of god made flesh representing the word jesus was the word and the word here we go was invisible until it was made flesh then the world becomes visible so people are looking for manifestation but god wants the word to become flesh that means the word come alive in you in your flesh then god could not be unveiled because you have not veiled god in your flesh not just word in the heart not just word in the mind not just word that you understand but the word become flesh a living moving monument an expression or extension of god almighty you become an attribute son of a spirit oh hallelujah wow hallelujah how many want to see the word visible then you're asking for the word to become flesh oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah there got to be something take place for that word to become flesh inside of you then it's no more you it's the word in you jesus is not me that dwight the world is my father because he dwelleth in me oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah oh glory to god this is gospel oh this is not a pentecostal another conflict thing this is gospel this is what we pressure not onto isn't that right don't listen to this untrue his sacrificial debt at calvary and his resurrection here we go positionally places church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible he said oh my i wish my church could get that if you could see friends the invisible god made visible hallelujah so the grace of lazarus jesus wept shortest words in the bible jesus wept he cried he felt their pain amen he said when he said enter into their sufferings when he finish where have you lead him oh hallelujah he cried like a man he was tired like a man he was hungry as a man but when he set that off and say where has you lead him he was more than a man it was god in a man don't get messed up this was god in the man and it's gonna be god inside of you oh glory to god so get don't get stumbled by your own humanity you're boring sin shape iniquity you're not an angel god grace come to you his blood come to cover you to forgive your sins rejoice for the blood thank god for the blood the blood later we foster fellowship this morning look at us rejoicing here this morning in his presence glory to god we are actually in the presence of god hallelujah this is not the poor princess this is the presence of god oh give the lord a shout hallelujah how would you feel to be among those disciples and jesus coming along in that donkey and they were screaming hosanna hosanna hosanna that's how you should be in church [Applause] oh hallelujah because jesus is here where the twos and trees are gathered together he promised to be in the midst of them and if jesus is among us he ought to be worshipped [Applause] oh he do i compared you to worship oh hallelujah [Music] glory to god amen hallelujah but the bran of my often wanted to come to the church how long to see it i guess i could walk in the back door front door wherever it was look across the audience see a perfect church all in order sin couldn't stay there the spirit would call it out it just couldn't stay like alas as a pharah you couldn't do it there'd be there'd be no sin in that group the spirit will quickly speak it out no matter what it was how little it would be done see woman sitting under the power of the holy spirit the spirit moving perfectly somebody done something wrong in the congregation they would quickly confess it before the spirit take a hold of it that's when the spirit moving in the coming people trimming they come to church they're making sure means right they can't even walk in the building like that spirit is dear that proven spirit that deserving spirit you can't hide you're naked before god oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah that's the church of the living god oh my old poor heart is getting old now i long to stand and see a church like that perfect works without sin oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah so there are many spirits going out to lead others to lead people to lead church to attempt to lead the bride many spirit has gone out into the world but the bible says believe not every spirit have a ton lord of them gone out christ is one singular spirit so first john four one says beloved believe in every spirit but try the spirits whether they be of god because many false prophets are gone into the world not a few not one here and one there satan just producing them a mass production of mad false prophets hallelujah crazy doctrine and we are commissioned to try the spirits by the word endless number of seducing spirits taking people off the world all kind of doctrines of devils private revelations and visions dreams of their own human spirit but in every age the spirit cried out he the heart hair to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches therefore the holy spirit can only speak the word come on now come on now come on now oh hallelujah so it's not just a preacher wearing a tie somebody behind a pulpit the holy spirit which is the spirit of truth can only speak the word oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah hallelujah so don't listen to any private revelation do any person in this church or oldest church because you can only defeat the enemy by the word oh hallelujah do you believe that hallelujah and the spirit of truth is here which is the word my word are spirit and they are life the word is spirit and spirit is word so the spirit of truth is here because the word is in the bride the word is amongst the bride god send the prophet to release the spirit of truth to follow this message do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah listen to the prophet many people have been deceived in receiving the holy ghost they've got doctrine like elijah garment manifested sons of god all kind of stuff people fall blindly on there and go through some kind of sensation raise back up with arrogant spirit here we go indifferent fussy high-tempered that's not the spirit of god amen they don't know how to behave themselves in the house of god no manners just no audacity at all no feeling towards god all i think about is my church it shows they receive a church spirit so the church spirit talk about the church my church our church that's true spirit holy ghost speaks the word [Applause] hallelujah so watch anything almost anything have characteristics just like many people are left-handed or right-handed they are characteristic of the way to handle themselves so then i drop a point here jesus in matthew 24 said the characteristics of the spirit would be somewhat alike in the last days so close it will deceive the very elected if possible now that's the way the spirits are in the last days they are somewhat alike here we go but they have a characteristic that identifies them one of them is right the other one is wrong and it can be identified by its characteristics the spirit of god can be identified by its characteristics amen isn't that right the spirit of god here we go and the spirit of the church there is a church spirit and a spirit of god that is absolutely not like the church spirit at all so but abraham is nailing it down there is a church spirit and there's a spirit of god hallelujah isn't that right there is a denominational spirit there's a national spirit there's a spirit of the nation every nation i go to have a different spirit i go to finland find people there's a famous spirit i go to germany there's a german spirit so every country has their own spirit and sometimes people live in that spirit they're not even christian they are in the spirit of the country going to church so to be a christian you have to die out of the spirit of your country because the country's spirit is not the spirit of god so the trinidad spirit is not the spirit of god god's spirit is the word god is not a trinidadian come on now sam and somebody god is the word hallelujah oh give the lord [Applause] so this challenges you to shake out the spirit that you're in you know homes are spirit yes amen churches and spirits sometimes people have this predatory person any pastor do you answer everybody talking really answer afterwards people who know about this know what this but we're not talking about didn't get the holy ghost you know getting man sprayed upon them got a man putting himself into the people and the spirit people covered by that spirit yeah but god wants us to be individuals have your unique way that's right your unique characteristics god love you as you are if god wants you taller he was gonna make you born any longer isn't that right god loves you as you are you are fearfully and wonderfully made so enjoy yourself [Applause] my god behind again for that enjoy who you are hallelujah you are wonderful in god hallelujah you are beautiful you are wonderful hallelujah god said jacob i love and if you only look jacob present you say woe is that god love but god wasn't seeing that god know the end god know jacob will become israel god know the world will become a butterfly you thank god seeing you where you are my god that's why god backing you up that's why when the satan want to accuse you god say what sin check the blood check the cross what you talking about what they did did you see that you had a record of that i wouldn't say don't try to play the tape you gotta say look i'm not seeing it if you raise because that passed through the blood come on say i meant somebody satan can't try that you're trying another thing you're trying something the accuser of the bridge and trying something but it is called that justified come on give the lord a shout and if god justify you who can condemn you oh give the lord a shout in the house it takes god to justify you oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah superman matthew 24 24 the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people and the bright spirit of the bright people will be so close together it will receive the very elective as possible so the church people have a church spirit but the bright people oh give the lord a shout the pride people have a bright spirit oh hallelujah so watch luther watch so god will reveal the bright spirit they come like the banks the bank don't train the tellers with false dollars did us train them with real money genuine dollars so they have a feel of it so when they come to the money something's feeling nothing right they take the pen and do so say nah boy there's a count defeat there's a copy of the original so god just take the original and train the bridge with the original word with original seed with original spoken word quotes books tapes words from malachi 4 the evening messenger the style the right hand of god because the prophet said what the bible said isn't that under five always say what the prophet said and the people say what the prophet said all say the same thing oh give the lord a shout the spirit the prophet and the bride say the same thing say what the tapes say because it's not me that's saying it oh hallelujah it's thursday at the lord oh hallelujah glory to god so the bright spirit is fit virtual knowledge temperance patience godliness bravely kindness charity and the other spirit is everything else oh give the lord some praises people oh glory lord god you talk about the thumbnail that shakes the devil that's why brother brown said he could talk to a person in five minutes and know if they're a christian how much were you gonna talk in five minutes how much mysteries you could talk in five minutes how much hidden ones it could be in five minutes it's not the mysteries make you a christian it's christ it's christ it's the holy ghost makes you a christian oh holy christ in you the hope of glory peter was ignorant peter was unlearned but he had christ in him oh hallelujah christ coming to you oh hallelujah that's the gospel oh hallelujah praise god this is nothing right so the bride have to connect to the bright spirit that's right you hear what i'm saying the pride have to connect to the bright spirit isn't that right and once the bride connects to her spirit which is the husband which is the lord which is elohim seven perfect spirits bright spirits once you connect to that then that church spirit pulls away because the church spirit is a shock isn't that right hallelujah and the seed shall not be heir with the shock god of a special promise of inheritance for the seed of the righteous hallelujah praise god you will not inherit with what the church members are your inheritance is different isn't that right brother branham received his inheritance he was a manifested adopted son he demonstrated it hallelujah god was with him god spoke to him nobody had to explain whether he's not there's an old chinese proverb i might say it word for word there's an old chinese that say this it goes something like this the person who says it cannot be done should not stop or hinder the man who is doing it the person who says it cannot be done should not stop or hinder the person that is doing it the manifestation will be the interpretation every [Applause] hallelujah glory to god where's the point of making boasts and god not backing up one of the votes god not backing up words isn't that right god not backing that up that's why elijah calling that challenge let the quarter answer by fire let that god be good let's that's not this talk thing now you have a quote i have a quote you have an alter other alter you put seven rounds i put seven rams okay but that didn't say nothing you have rams you have seven you're seven alter everybody see the same thing so what you know you said let me call the fire right now that is when the trouble starts hallelujah because god has indicated falsehood god not vindicating dishonesty so they're crying a whole day they're crying out elijah tease them i call that god one all that sleep all are gone oh my god going on a long journey you say well what did i sleep one weekend only finished now they cut themselves for the ball they tired now no fire all these sacrifices in the altar nothing moving all right first thing elijah do we build back the altar let me take the trend and say pour water he said he said wet it don't wet it down we want to make sure this fire come from under we want to make sure nobody else said we have some magic fire under the deer pour water and sacrifice let the water flow and fire come from heaven and consume every single thing to know is god so you take that god that come and manifest fire upon that elijah wouldn't come to vindicate his sons and his daughter in the last days the devil mocking you and laughing at you the devil don't believe who you are who you say you are god will come and syndicate this is my beloved son come on now hallelujah glory to god oh hallelujah no watch here we go here we go watch watch watch there's got to be something that cannot be denominated because all them luther wesley bitten holiness left his baptist pentecostal jewish all them come to determination and when you denominate you'll die right there you continue on as a church out of history and testimony and long history church but you die because you cannot confine god in a box of denomination the life moves on from luther to wesley to pentecost keep moving on there got to be something here we go that cannot be denominated do you know what it is the entirety of the life you cannot denominate life you put concrete on the ground the branch the tree will push yourself and pull back up concrete can't stop life hallelujah the life will go and break and crack up and comfort you put concrete anywhere to break out and that's what the pride is they can't stop us it's like a whole lot corner praise god that can't stop [Applause] hallelujah the devil take your stone and bury you i don't know your seed nice trouble you don't trouble you don't bury a seed thanks trouble bet your holy seed in your hand if that's the direction i leave you alone we try to call you up and bury you that's trouble you're looking for trouble there because once you go on the ground once you are seen that is buried once it takes you all covered up with depression and frustration and you can't get a breakthrough but there's a deep fall into a deep there is a sky inside your soul i want you to start to break out oh my god you're gonna be seated i'm getting excited now i'm not getting excited it comes like a little chick in an egg that chicken egg is the egg confined and the chicken growing slowly slowly saturday and after a while the chickens had a knock god they call it pippin that's nature to get itself out such a pimp something's telling pip get out and get out afterwards the exhale too small feet no he wants some more room it's a time up and it picks his way out when the chicken picks me up you can put him back inside that's what the devil don't want you to see once you could pip your way out there is no way you could fit back in to what you come out here come on press your way pressuring come on break i'll break or break out come on pick your way i'll pick your way out oh give the lord a shout that's what the devil don't want you to see [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god man my god my god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god devil i want you to break out hallelujah is like a jailbreak then you're in prison david don't want your boss out there's some people actually got dismissed from prison the time was up and they break back into the prison i forget what they call those kind of time the prison life so contain them that's right they get so i went to the nomination i forget they tell them they're useful they're missing the prison partners sometimes they do crying to get back into

roll call and discipline call and shut down and lock down and everything else that is what they're in they get domesticated into prison life so tell them break out break where i want to be here that's how some people live they enjoy the prison they enjoy the pressure they enjoy not the pressure because you see deliverance have a cost amen amen freedom have a price because when freedom carries responsibility in prison you're not responsible they serve your food they tell you when they get up they tell you when to match up you don't not responsible for you when you're free you have to find a work you have to get a job yes yes yes you have to you got to do something with your oh same as somebody freedom have a praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah jesus didn't tell a woman you

going to kill you that was going to defeat you that was going to out your life that was when you finished you passed it in 10 years and he said you're out of the kingdom but that you prove the devil this morning that he's a liar he can't stop you from breaking out how you're supposed to break out come on same as somebody you're gonna get to revive her yes yes you're gonna get that breakthrough [Applause] but you've got to shake it off [Applause] shake it off [Applause] oh hallelujah glory who praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god so the only thing that cannot be denominated is the life systems are built around the life denominations are bringing around the life people are even checking out spirits and trying spirits but we are commissioned to do it i have a right to do that this man claimed this fine bring him come on then bring an angel and come bring you bring your angel bring all the voice bring your dream bring everything come on oh yes this could be different oh hallelujah people that know their god [Music] these men of god like elijah and of all and whatnot they were fearless you know imagine he walked out he said not even you are really faulty like confirmed he's a shot of heaven [Applause] a man walked on as i shut heaven up not even two or three will fall till i call for it you want to fight me i shut heaven up i lock up the heavens no real no anointing no blessing send for [Applause] and peter had to unlock the holy ghost and release it to the gentiles oh come on i'll say a mission what about our bride the heaven locked up and we have the key and the key is fate and your justice have the key you have to have a hand to hold the key the key doesn't unlock the door by itself you got to have the hand of faith to hold the key to the door hallelujah i'm behind that door of every blessing behind here and seven thunders they fade to turn to push and turn that key come on see him and somebody oh my god i'm holding myself a revival oh i'm quick and i'm alive i thank god for the word and the vision oh i'm being made plain being made real you are going to make it sister don't let the devil lie to you yes you're gonna get that great you woman oh hallelujah your husband can't keep you back not now not now we can't keep you back now near your wife nobody gonna keep back you keep you back hallelujah glory glory notice here we go there is no more carrier mother churches denomination after this carry a shock there is no other church where they connect to no mother carrier all these things that connect to this group or that group would connect to this one and that one is foolishness that had to be connected to heaven hallelujah it cannot be a dogmatic thing you have to connect to this and have to connect to that if we're not connected to the holy spirit what are we connected to it must be connected to the gospel it must be connected to the holy ghost and if we connect to the holy ghost that's different hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you believe that amen amen praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord so remember the grain when and the grain began to ripen you find before the grain can ripen this talk has to be dead can't you see where we are standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went on in the ground the same jesus in bright form same power same church oh it's coming to head for the rapture notice the churches of canada it feeds itself on on worldly carry on death things of the world like a vulture did you ever see eager compromise there is no compromising in him amen neither is a genuine christian he ends off he'll hunt till he finds it if he finds his meat he wants fresh fresh manna he will get down and dig till yeah man he will fly higher and higher if there is none in this valley he would raise a little hallelujah the higher you go all right the more you can see it is time for the eagles to get flying higher amen and dig into god's promises hallelujah i'm not living some point of view so you're waiting for somebody under beat him and feed you and fault your food but the eagles yeah wait [Music] hunt for their food oh glory to god but where the carcass is the eagles going to be carried together and we have the carcass this morning of the full body word ripped by malachi 4 ripped by all seven seas open oh come on eagles seven thunders going to gather eagles together the seven thunders is the carcass of the world together the eagles together oh hallelujah glory to god are you with me oh hell you may be seated but at branham for margin of earth now that the seeds are open amen the spirit of truth directs us to the word that explains why all the mixes have been made down to the ages because the seas was not open it was not revealed so the spirit of truth come to guide us so the dove came upon jesus to lead him amen into the wilderness that dove is coming again to lead the eagles it will be dove leading the eagles oh hallelujah are you with me so there are two systems at work isn't that right esau and jacob isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so what do you think the shock was for but abandoned said when the pentecostal first come out it was so close it was very likely possible what was it to do support the grain that's right so you're not vexed with your support you happy and value and treasure those that give you the support but as you grow as you spread and mature and they pull back they're giving you room to receive your inheritance so you're not upset when people pull away from you when people forsake you and leave you and abandon you and they don't have one nothing do it you they're giving you more room to grow don't weep for them they don't belong to what where you are going you are going to inherit god have a purpose for that for the shock to pull back is it not right whenever the messenger coming the messenger comes to bring birth pains and if a genuine fight for ministry come forward is to produce birth pains because the message world in lethargy the comfort zone everybody's settled now it's over 50 plus years since the prophet left and everybody's settled now i went to chile some people would tell me the tribulation some people are actually waiting they're waiting for the coming of the lord so they say did not consider what being prepared they just waiting for they come i was scared of that when i first came to this message i was scared to be like the pentecostal waiting for the rapture but they're living anyhow waiting for the rapture and doing anything i know they can't wait for the rapture there has to be a preparation god gave twenty year message that it will rain with the same sermon he just flavored this way this sunday next sunday add some more to it but at the end of it all the core was it was revealed it couldn't be challenged because we never felt before but noah stood with a message let me build the ark then he said come in and go and all your house into the act come into the act what's the message come into the holy ghost god even give noah a kind of queer thing given by somewhat ability act people had to laugh at him because they knew they would show off it poured us it absorbed but god had given all the revelation yet he given it in stages the revelation was it has to pitch the act and seal it to inside and outside to make it waterproof so god give that absorbent wood so it could receive a seal [Applause] and god has to break your spirit to make you absorbent because god wants to give you a seal a seal on the inside and a ceiling outside so going after bread [Applause] that's what i'm saying weakness weakness is not weak because you might be seized some people feel brokenness is defeat it's not really you're in tears you're the cross in the altar that doesn't mean jesus was in the garden of gethsemane and he was praying father his possibilities could pass and when that was interpreted by the prophet he said that is where the lion of the tribe of judah was prevailing tears hallelujah travailing disciples sleeping and he did travailing and that's the land of the tribe of judah conquering oh hallelujah humility you're conquering simplicity you're not conquering a lot of noise no no no the plant growing in the morning you don't have quick crack creek you don't hear leaf and flower blossoming no cool look at me you're something i plan to close up in the morning your seat open flower sometimes even close back up nighttime the flower and whatever it is what different kind of type of plant not no sudden noise and they're beautiful that's all your life had to be amen clothes then all of a sudden it's flower [Applause] sweetness weakness humility and god has to set the situation to bring it out set the conflict there's a word we're going to use more often to bring it out so you can't want peace and safety and quiet when you're looking

this is where i get the inspiration from brother branham he was talking about an experience on the ring of a snow white dove he said the third day i went back i was climbing up high many of you know the vision about the indian chief riding with the wall to the west something attracted me off the big rock about noon time i said lay your hands against it and pray god in heaven knows that is true i laid my hands against the rock look up towards him and started praying i heard a voice coming out of the top of the rock said what are you leaning against over your heart and i raced back like this bare shoulders naked from my waist up hot i looked back and there was root in quartz in the stone white eagle just exactly listen what the vision said the next message would come forth by next message i was so excited i ran home got a camera come back next day took a picture of it and it is still there wrote in rock white eagle dove ladies and eager that's the interpretation of that white eagle root nunneral that the prophecy is the dove would come to lead the eagles you are god eagles the dove is the spirit of truth going to lead you by the word which is truth into all things and show you things to come it will show you your victory it will show you your breakthrough it will show you you don't have to lean on some man or some church or some group you are lean on the everlasting now oh hallelujah that's why the bible said they that wait upon the lord showering you their strength they shall monkey will bring their eagles the revolution is this the eagles are birds fly as individuals but they gather at the carcass whenever you have freshly killed carcass you can get eagle landing and eagle taken off oh hallelujah i understand that ego when it's catch a snake you just take him up and take him to the end he gave him a good shaking up there and then dropping back down you don't battle with the snake on this ground on his level he just take him up into his atmosphere into his level that's the eagle snatch him up and shake him up here the snake don't know what that atmosphere up there that's around the hawk and the eagles have to fly and hawks say yes first rungs second rounds eagle flying higher third rungs after a while we blocked it i had it right i can't go no further you can see i'm still sawing stood wrong fought wrong fifth round and the eagles are strange but the higher it goes the more he could see come on you can't see down on the ground you're not a chicken come on shame and somebody you got a sword come on hallelujah that's why when john heard the voice and said come up either i will show the things that must be thereafter come on say me somebody you may be seated i'm almost done hallelujah you can't sit in your flesh and expect god just come down to you and come up to your head and come down and you'll pour me and struggle with me and whatnot that can't do one thing hallelujah when you start to get militant and say wait a minute whose son
