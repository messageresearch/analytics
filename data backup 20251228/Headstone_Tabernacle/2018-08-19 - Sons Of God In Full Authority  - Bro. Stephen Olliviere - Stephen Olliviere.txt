to the Most High God amen hallelujah amen so let's zoom you know of all the galaxies and the worlds and the planets that God created he had a special interest in one particular planet called Earth amen and on that planet he please plant life animal life and finally human life amen praise God but man was particularly important to him he had a special job for man to do he wanted mine to reflect him in every way he wanted mine to be a small version of himself he wanted mine to be a little Gordo via team and this morning praise God a man hallelujah thank you Jesus so he made man in his own image and likeness a man praise God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord from the message the Messiah the man that God made what is he he's got a hand like God eyes like God it's like God got a body like God he was fashioned after God and he was given an earth and a Dominion a man God who is God of the entire universe made man God over the earth to rule here he was a lesser God God rules the universe everything but man was given the earth to rule over can we say man can we say man how do we uh so Adams body was an image of God and his spirit his nature was in the likeness of God designed for a special purpose hallelujah the purpose that God put man on this edge which he created was to rule over the earth amen Papa bought rule the entire universe but man was made a lesser God in the image and likeness of God and place here for divine purpose which was to have dominion over the entire earth can we say man glory Adam was made an armature God he was a son of God he was an air of God he was former like God to rule and to have dominion over the earth a man hallelujah but notice in order to rule he must have the authority to do so three-man authorities either given to you by a higher power or it is stolen and self-appointed amen praise God but God gave Adam the authority he placed it at him it was built in because of who he was and whose father was a man glory hallelujah Adam had the genes of God Adam had the ability to manage the affairs of the earth and he had the authority to handle any situation on the earth praise God Amen hallelujah every creature was subject to his authority hallelujah praise God a man papa God created the world's by the spoken word and Adam being a son of God Alessa got the gene of God when he spoke every creature on earth was subject to his authority hallelujah hallelujah even the elements of nature was subject to his authority glory to God a man there's something about the words spoken by a son in a party can we say man and we say man praise God hallelujah brother Adam rule the creation well he named the animals the organizer he trusts the Garden of Eden beautifully Papa God was pleased with how he kept the godly man hallelujah and when God looked at man God was seeing himself being reflected in man look we can rule earth well I give him the authority of all yet but he did not abuse it he did not misuse the authority but he managed the Garden of Eden so well God was pleased hallelujah hallelujah amen his father was proud of his son praise God look how he reflects me well he's a chip off the old block hallelujah amen and what Adam did was exactly what God wanted don't praise God amen hallelujah he had the mind of God amen glory to God my but not only was God pleased the earth was also pleased by a man the earth was comfortable with his master the animals existed in peace and harmony even nature itself was at peace can we say man a man and God was proud of his son God is no longer el him he is no longer self existent a man he is now Jehovah God exists in his family a man father God and his little ones Oh glory to God a man or what a beautiful family a man a perfect oneness a unity between God and man hallelujah can we say man is falling glory but you know the story since stepped in and God's perfect family this broken sin brings a separation sin brings death amen see the devil is the one who comes to destroyed and break up the family amen praise God from God hiding in simplicity when man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed a great chasm and put himself in death on this side there was no way to get back across notice he said on one side of the chasm he's a son of God and offspring of God and earlier he can control nature he can speak things into existence he is a creator but on the other side he is separated from his sonship he's a sinner by Nature and he is under the Dominion of Satan my sorry man it's like when a country conquers and captures another country and they honk off the king and bringing back bound in chains to their country he is still a king as it were but he is powerless his words no longer have any effect he is now the slave of the ruling king amen and young people Satan wants to tempt you so that he can make you fall in sin then overpower you and take you captive where he can be your master and ruler and you will be his slave to sin my god prisoners bound in chains my hallelujah amen what did sin do since separated father God from his son sin brings condemnation so Adam is now running away from God and hiding in the garden my god sin brings death the wages of sin is death my sin causes Adam to lose his inheritance as a son my god a man in other words he lost his sonship he lost his courtship he lost his authority over the earth because he was cut off from Papa Gori man hallelujah hallelujah my god he is no longer in the likeness of God still a son but now has a different nature a sinful nature of carnal human spirit fallen man nature which no longer qualifies him as fit to rule and so the authority is taken away from him my Amen it was right there that man whose purpose was to rule and to have dominion over here it was right there when he sinned that he lost the title a score of beer and Satan became known as the god of this world amen he stole a title he stole the authority he was self-appointed a man amen his authority was not given from God Amen hallelujah a man in other words Satan does not have the title deed to the earth he is just a squatter posing as the owner of the earth praise God amen hallelujah many many men might come on now praise God but God was not going to leave his son to die man had sinned and there was a big gap between God and man but God threw out a bloodline that man can hold on to or chlorine a godly man hallelujah don't give up this morning hold on hold on hold on how to do you praise God a man a man can hold on to the bloodline and make his way back to corrigan hallelujah praise God amen amen as a songwriter said through the blood we cannot come into his presence God has made a way that man can come back into his present through the blood give the Lord a shout praise God a man [Applause] Amen I don't care how low you stooped in sin I don't care what you have done this morning the blood is here for you hallelujah come back to God come back to God through the blood there's power in the blood hallelujah hold on to the bloodline stay on the bloodline Satan can't cross the bloodline give him a shout give him a shout praise God Amen glory under the Old Testament God took our sacrifice I can make all of the blood of goats bows and goats and covered sin it did not divorce sin the sin was still there what about him said if I have a red spot on my hand and I cover it with white paint the red spot is still there but it's just covered can we say amen amen he says then God sent down a bridge for sin hallelujah it was the plot of his only beloved son hallelujah he said when we confess our sins it drops into God's bleach he said you try to find it again he said it's not there hallelujah praise God Amen praise God give him a shout hallelujah hallelujah totally disintegrated you cannot find it even if you tried God Himself cannot even find it praise God once it's in the blood a man Loreena God Amen hallelujah hallelujah well when did when did a single when it is single he said the coloring of sin goes back through the mediator down through time until it hits the accuser Satan and it lays on him until the day of judgment Oh Cory look got a man what is God hallelujah - all amen hallelujah there's your bloodline is spawning a man hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen Oh glory of God amen amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah now the son comes into perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him whatsoever hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no more no more there's no more stain of sin it can be seen anywhere the Sun is free hallelujah or chlorine of God who the Son of man sets free is free indeed you are free this morning give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah amen again he says when a man or woman has been dipped into a blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms of sin every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and is laid on him till the day of judgment and now the chasm is bridge - hallelujah and the man stands justified as a son of God and the sin cannot be remembered no more give the Lord a shock [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Laurita God a man so through the blood God and man can fellowship again man is justified the price of sin has been paid for Jesus died but when Adam's sin in the garden he no longer had God's divine nature or character so he was no longer fit to rule earth so the authority as god of the earth was taken away from him remember Satan is posing us rule of this world but he has no character so he's ripping havoc on yet hallelujah no wonder power with all corrupted satanic Amen it will cause chaos and trouble praise God a man caught him Adam the authority to rule yet because he was given the nature of God he was created in the image or likeness of God and Adam fell into sin glory so even if God removed the sin through the blood the sinful nature itself is still there so man is still not in a position to rule the earth just yet my man British God remember if you if you never send in your life you are still condemned to hell because your sinful nature condemns you say man from adoption man losses gotcha his sonship his domain and Satan took it over but brother come on now we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again who is he talking about this morning he's talking about you I can't hear you he's talking about you a man give him a shout you are gonna be the manifested sons of calling man hallelujah hallelujah amen this is now waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every power that Satan has away from him yes they belongs to the sons of God hallelujah I'm talking about you this morning give the Lord a shout [Music] hallelujah amen glory to God a man once I'm talking about you you praise it if I'm talking about anybody else you can stay quiet but once I'm talking about you shout Amen hallelujah so when the sons of God who's at it this morning give the Lord a shout amen when the sons of God come into manifestation they will have the full authority to take over the earth again take back what a devil stole from you amen hallelujah praise God when the sons of God become full sons of God I love that full sons of God almost your sons of God in and then we will have the authority to take every power that Satan has away from him praise party man hey man right now we are sons of God but one of these days we will grow into full sons of God watch out devil watch out ever amen fooling around with my children have my son smoking and drinking have my daughter fooling around in the world messing with my health diabetes blood pressure greatest cancer whatever it is trying to break up my family you filthy devil get out of my home spoken word authorities coming back to the hole sons of God amen the permit is moving to the top hallelujah hallelujah give him a shot hallelujah glory to God a man notice how brother branham connected the adoption of sons to the pyramid amen the virtues amen glory but this morning I want you to poop us within yourself that you will only speak positive words because death our life are in the power of the talk can we say man begin to say I shall be healed I shall be delivered I shall be adopted I shall be filled with the Holy Ghost say it say it Amen hallelujah praise God a man one time the Prophet said I'll never have a negative testimony in my life again another place he said I will never speak one more negative word again hallelujah if that's all you take from this service take that I will only speak positive words from this day onwards give the Lord a shout hallelujah why do you think the message was called is spoken word but abandoned for a message called testimony if you are a Christian no matter how solid you are in faith if something tells you that you're not a Christian and you start to testify or speaking I'm not a Christian or more he says as soon as you testify that you're not a Christian right there you're not a Christian anymore my right there you've dropped from grace he says your own speech tells what you are can we say man so from today begin to speak only positive words practice at a man only positive testimonies nothing negative a man can we say man you say I'm feeling depressed no no Lord lift me up where I belong amen you say I am weak and struggling no let the weak say I am strong praise God a man you say I'm poor and suffering no no let the poor say I am rich hallelujah you say I have diabetes no no by His stripes I am he gives a lot of shout this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah exercise your faith in the word speak the word and the word is always positive the word is never negative the word is always positive hallelujah you are a son of God this morning you come from God and you're going right back to God amen that's why you came from a man hallelujah praise Paulina a man God spoke the world into beer you are going right back to full spoken authority just like your father just like Adam had before the fall say man glory to God that's positive amen hallelujah amen okay so we established that when the blood price was paid the steen at man's sin was wiped off he was justified before God but he still had a sinful nature he was forgiven justified but a fallen nature was still resident in him therefore he did not qualify to access the authority that was given to him by his father no more can we say man Adam could not speak to the lion he better run for his life because he lacked the dominion over the beasts of the field over the house of the air over nature over the elements Adam was driven out of the garden as a sign of the disconnect with his father as a sign that he had lost as an innocent inheritance as a son my a man glory and in the temporary absence of the master of the earth Satan begins to squat earlier and poses a score of this worldly man he established all his satanic systems religion religion is of the devil it's a satanic coverin core is not interested in religion God is interested in the hearts of man but Satan loves religion I got a man hallelujah the government's every government of this world is ruled by Satan I don't care which country is a man culture and fashions and styles and the world music all of it are influenced from hell praise God a man can be say man a man every country is now ruled by the devil he has seized the opportunity to destroy the earth and families and lives and churches my his purpose is to destroy the sons of God by making sure listen that it would never come to know who they are so he inflicts them with spiritual amnesia well you forget who you are you forget what your name is who your father is you forget your purpose why Anya you forget what belongs to you he brainwashes
