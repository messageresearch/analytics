aren't you glad for these words charity never fails you will fail ministers will fail but charity won't fail so 1 Corinthians 13 8. charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they will fail my whether they be tongues they will cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away amen 1 Thessalonians 4 17. then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord to Timothy 4 8. henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to all them that love television Netflix Hollywood immorality no that love is appearing is the Lord Hebrews here's my title Hebrews 11 39 and 40. and all these all having obtained a good report through faith received my not the promise okay God having provided some better thing for us that they without us title should not be made perfect amen amen is amen amen

worthy they wandered in desert and in mountains and caves did they receive the promise no no and that's our title today they to realize what's going on and why the enemy is attacking you so much let's talk over here we go over to Hebrews chapter one I mean that that uh that the Blessed book of Hebrews brother Ben says the Hebrews book is a yellowish green the color of the pillar of fire and it's a great book Hebrews 11. I've often wondered this he said in the last chapter it's the last part of the 11th chapter when it talks about Abraham the great faith chapter that's what I precious brother preached here amen Faith by faith he said he says he says the at the end he said indeed they wandered in ships and in goatskins and they were made destitute destitute my God they wandered about it no place to go hate it

the spirit that he tore out of that body right back down upon the church and that church is at LCA will have to have absolutely The Same Spirit that was in that body it won't dovetail in the resurrection those two pieces brother Branham like the wings of an Eagle One Wing is the living Saints is the sleeping Saints when they come together fly off in the resurrection both Wings must be together she said those two pieces must come perfectly together and if this church this isn't perfect just exactly exactly the same spirit miss me that was in Christ amen if Christ had patience if Christ had virtues if Christ forgave and her brotherly kindness you have to have brothers it's got to be the same spirit that was in that body not just tongues not just gifts although we reverence

lips finish Tiffany now there's nothing left I'm following the message for to but for himself he'll remember to step into that there's something wrong because that's the last one because he did his part yeah please ask me where to find the quote he introduced amen Christine he introduced it this is introducing he said the next is intelligence amen we have no intelligence of our own the new man is his feet the lips and then the eyes just the intelligence Jesus did nothing except the father showed it the intelligence is the intelligence and we have no intelligence it's his intelligence we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee he can't do that it's God himself it's coming a place he's governed the body all the way through all the way through all the way through then the complete body of Christ it is the intelligence Christ that's the next step he says what is it God walking on two feet footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord amen amen amen I'm walking because the intelligence is telling my feet my intelligence go back to the puppets the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen the righteous are ordered they are
