excited to be in the house of God today he man there's no better place to be on Easter Sunday morning so I greet you on behalf of the pastor on behalf of the ministry as well and today we do have a note a praise I would like to give God a high note of praise for keeping me all these sixty-seven years today is my birthday and I would like to thank him for the mountains and the valleys for the good and bad and all the trials he and his wisdom has sent my way I would like to thank you for my personal revival as I await my healing god bless you but a Tarrance of it god bless you brother Terry happy birthday and in this season this Easter season is reliable season may you receive your healing this morning so what can we say about the weekend thus far Good Friday Gore reproduces himself with Antony minister such a tremendous blessing and the praise and worship service last night and here we are this morning under expectation for God to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or thing this morning and I encourage you today you get what you expect you get what you expect and you will get out of it what you put into it and this church is not a movie this church is not entertainment it's a participatory experience so you're not here to sit back to just enjoy it but you're here to create something because men around them torches that the minister can never bring the revival but when the people come under expectation and come with their knees and come to put something into the service then something happens can the church same so I'd like to get straight to the word this morning reading from st. mark 16 reading from verse 1 reading from Romans 8 and reading from revelation 1 this morning like to welcome all the visitors and our gates this morning so readings in mark 16 and reading from verse 1 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome II had brought had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sifaka at a rising of the Sun and the said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering the sea Falcor they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted and he said unto them be not afraid said he seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee where shall you see him as he said unto you reading Romans 8 and reading from verse 11 Romans 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you and reading revelation 1 and reading from verse 12 revelation 1 and reading from verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that speak with me and being tuned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and good about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as a sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sunshine it in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated him so I have a title this morning there will be an Easter for the bride a subject who will roll away the stone and an inspiration if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you but before I go any further I want to read one more scripture for context this morning and it's the same script everywhere the last night in Hebrews 2 and verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself had suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted can the church say Amen so just to place this in context yesterday we spoke on the secret mission of Jesus and how when we go back to back to the beginning and God created the heavens and the earth and he created the animal he created animal life he created plant life he created the fishes he created all of nature and any policeman in the Garden of Eden and in the Garden of Eden God would come down in the cool of the evening to fellowship with Adam he would come down in the cool of the evening to converse with Adam that's what the Bible teaches us and it's interesting to note that even though God would come down in the cool of the evening to fellowship with Adam and his wife that when the devil came and spoke to Eve the interaction that no doubt you would have had when God come down in the cool of the evening did not seem to be enough to have kept her from falling for what the devil had to offer God had spoken to Adam and given Adam an instruction and given him dominion over the earth and dominion over everything Adam had the power to create he had the power to move things around he was like God on the earth he was made in the image of God he had attributes like God and his responsibility was to let Eve know what God had said to him and God in His grace and mercy would come down in the cool of the evening here in the Garden of Eden to minister to them out of how was your day Eve how was your day and and I could imagine I want to know what your experience would be like if every evening you had the opportunity for court to walk into your house and and talk to you and find out how your deal was and it's very hard for court to have spoken to you yesterday evening and for the devil to come today and you make a mistake you fall and the devil is able after you would have met God yesterday evening and the devil would come and see something to you to throw you off at that time it was a relationship that man had an obligation to not touch that tree and when man did not touch that tree he was keeping his part of the Covenant with God but when man fell God said you know what I am never making that kind of covenant with man again because man in his best condition could never keep the word that I have so I'm gonna make a covenant with myself I'm not gonna make a covenant with man anymore because man even in his condition fail man in his authority he fell from his authority man with his jurisdiction he fell from his jurisdiction so God made a covenant to bring back things a different condition that physical please call Edom was not enough to have kept them so God envision a different place that man could live in where he would fall no more he couldn't make mistakes no more you don't hear me this morning so from all the way back there God planned out everything that would take place he planned every trial he planned every situation he planned for every prophet to come when they came he plan for the children of Israel to end up in Egypt he he wanted it that way because he had something to prove he was on a mission he had an objective he had a purpose the Bible tells us there is no accident with God there is no mistake with car there's no I didn't know how it happened with God with God it's all about purpose it's all about objective so when Moses was born there was a purpose for Moses being born when David was born there was a purpose for DVP and Paul when Joshua was born there was a purpose but Joshua to be born when Pharaoh was born there was a purpose for Pharaoh when Nebuchadnezzar was born there was a purpose for Nebuchadnezzar when Judas was born also had a purpose to everything yes a season is a time there's a purpose and you don't think God has a purpose for you you don't think God has a purpose for you being here this morning you don't think God has a purpose and a plan for your life that the devil cannot take away your body pains cannot take away sickness cannot take away your mistakes cannot take away your failures cannot take away your problems cannot take away your past cannot take away oh [Applause] I'm gonna say a few things this morning but I just want to connect to yesterday before I talk about today so God had a secret mission and for this secret mission called under soda oh that there are three realms as a heavenly realm there's the earthly realm and there's that realm of Hell and Hades and I know all of that way the devil operates and the Bible tells us there was war in heaven so all the trials and the struggles we feasted he did not originate on earth it originates in according to scripture in heaven so the devil raised a rebellion in heaven but that rebellion was destroyed because Michael and his angels fought and the devil was kicked out of heaven he could no longer dwell in heavenly places he could no longer walk in heavenly places and he was kicked out of heaven and thrown onto the earth but the earth was not his jurisdiction the earth was not his realm so he ended up under it because when God please man in the earth he said let man have two minions over it let man have two million in this realm let man have authority in this realm let man of authority over the animals that man have authority over the elements let man have authority over every creeping thing every walking thing every situation every obstacle had authority he had Dominion he had power Hugh ceylon in order for God to give man dominion it meant God had to have it to give it you cannot give what you do not have so when God gave man Dominion it was his power that he was sharing with man he did not give man power in heaven he gave man power on the earth and he caused signs every check like he said to Peter whatever you bind on earth mine in heaven because if two shall agree touching anything it's a law of the contract of god but god realizes in your fallen condition you cannot do it all by yourself so he put a feel safe that was not based on your condition the feel safe was not based on your mistakes it just said if you shall see the disillusion and don't talk in your heart just see it I'll take care of the rest of it because it's a contract unconditional covenant [Applause] he may be seated so God in his realm in the realm of the heavenlies with angels in the realm of the heavenlies with the seraphim's in the realm of the heavenlies with the cherubims in the realm of the heavenlies his god is our angel says angels and he's looking over everything but there banham said nothing happens in the earth that is not something simultaneously happening in heaven so we are meeting this morning here on earth and simultaneously there's a meeting going on in heaven it's a hidden meeting we can't see it what it's happening you don't have to feel it what it's happening one air whenever there's a meeting of sons of God on the earth there's a meeting going on in heaven because the angels of the Lord are dispatched they are watching what's going on there's a secret mission going on because whenever you speak because of who you are angels are dispatch to make it happen hallelujah I'm just laying a background I'm laying a foundation put on your spiritual hats this morning we didn't come to church just to have a meeting we didn't come to church because we want to be here for Easter Sunday it's got to be more than that we have to understand the true meaning of Easter we have to understand what happened when Jesus broke the barriers of data you may be seated [Music] [Applause] I'm by the man I'm types 87 the three Hebrew boys were in the fiery furnace that the Angels they were obligated the fact compelled to help the situation and that's what happens whenever you get in trouble [Applause] the moment the three Hebrew boys cut in the fire but the Brenham said the angel Gabriel around to the throne room and pull his sword out he said somebody's in trouble I don't know if you got the memo but somebody's in trouble and quartern together let's see I've got this handle don't worry about it whenever you get in trouble angels start to draw their swords because you are royalty they are obligated to respond whenever there's a distress signal you may be seated for a minute a few days ago I call a government office Oh Sarang eat 18 in the morning between eat 18 to eat 21 in the morning and I got a voice message the office opens at 8:30 and my wife said to me don't expect that phone to get answered one minute before you today and I thought about that for a while and I realize you know that's right when you want to get certain things done you have to wait on earth for the time that you're supposed to get it done you want to go and do business with the bank you have to wait until the bank opens you could be desperate you could bang down the bank doors you can do whatever you want that door not open it until the time comes but you know what's the difference with the kingdom of God it never closes it has no time off there's no opening hours they are not closing hours there's no moment the phone is not answered once there's a need you can call heaven anytime and angels in the realm of the heavenlies a dispatch to the sons and daughters of God that have a need can we preach a little bit this morning I don't know what's gonna do but I noticed one of you is tough for the bride you who are dead in here this morning yes resurrection power to raise you raise you from your sin raise you from your depression you may be seated I don't know how the system works because my jurisdiction and realm is here in it but in heaven the Hebrew boy is in trouble and Gabriel he gets the alert I don't know it's a picture I don't know some people I don't know if it's a text message I don't know what technological system in the realm they use but he knew something was up and God said Gabriel and know you can handle it but the Branham said Gabriel I know you've done everything I asked you to do but I'm asking you this time don't worry about this one stand down but the random said when Kira was finished pleading his case because he injured wanted to come to help the angel wormwood who was the one who was responsible for the flood but the Branham said he was the one who was in charge of the water he said can I go and draw water on the fiery furnace and God said no no no no I don't want to go this fire one more you did a fantastic job with it in the days of Noah but I don't need an angel to do this I want to go myself to swap out this situation you may be seated and brother branham said I know he said this yesterday but some people missed it so we want to make sure we all in the same and the same train because we are going somewhere there are certain prerequisites before you could go to the next level and the church hey man so by the Branum said that God stood and he summoned the east wind he summoned the north wind he's summoned the south when he's summoned the west wind and he jumped upon her from the head and he had straight down into the fiery furnace and he was the fourth man in the fire it wasn't an angel it was the fourth man in the fire but the bottom said it needed a man to come now to redeem them it needed a man to come out to save them an Almighty God in all of glory he could not come in his glory to redeem man but he had to take on sixteen elements he had to take on flesh you may be seated hallelujah he had to feel what you feel he had to go through what you go through he went through every temptation there's no temptation that you ever have to face that he didn't face there's no tiredness that you face that he didn't face oh come on now somebody preached back to me [Applause] I want to read it one more time Hebrews 2 verse 17 wherefore in all things he didn't see some things with a gangly in all things it behooves him to be me and like unto his brethren so Jesus wanted to be made like unto you and I that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people in other words he wanted to understand what we go through so when he makes reconciliation he is speaking from a position of truly experiencing what we experienced so it's not God above who doesn't know what you're going through but as Jesus he went through the trials he went through the tests he went through the heartache he went through frustration he went through depression he went through hunger the Bible said he was tempted in every way that we attempted but he sinned not but upon his shoulders was placed all of our sins upon his shoulders was placed all of our mistakes upon his shoulder was placed every mistake you ever did everything you're doing wrong now every mistake you were ever do he took it upon his shoulders only his shoulders could've carried our sins only his shoulders could have carried our mistakes up because we weren't strong enough to handle it so it took our kinsman redeemer it took somebody like us it took a brother [Applause] hallelujah don't you know Jesus is your brother but he's also your father he's also your God he's also your King he's also your Savior he's also your Redeemer he is also your restorer he's also Yahweh makeup hallelujah hallelujah oh you may be seated so Jesus had a secret mission so he had to leave glory he couldn't come as spirit yet into the earthly realm because he had to deal with the situation as a man so God so loved the world that he and move he himself transformed himself he had to come as flesh and blood not a spirit not yet that time will come but not yet God had to come because he had to win a battle on the earth so Almighty God left heaven and drop down on the earth of 16 elements born in a manger warned of a virgin what did God do god slipped a secret weapon onto the earth that the devil didn't even recognize what was happening the greatest nuclear weapon the world ever saw was lying in a manger in Bethlehem hallelujah the devil had come into Eden and upset God's kingdom [Applause] [Music] but God did not want the devil to know how he was gonna fix the problem so whenever God starts something he always that small in for him to have the element of surprise he has to start small so he started as a baby and in your life for him to have the element of surprise he's gotta start small some small changes some small movement some small deliverances some small signs some small wonders some small miracles or you don't hear me this morning you may be seated for a minute one time or the Branum pray for somebody the hand was crippled up a little own feet and when the parent said here's what the person said my little fingers start to move he said if your little fingers are to move that's all you need because that small movement is a sign that little movement is coming give me another example that little boy that Elijah said go and see if the rain is coming he went the first time he went the second time he went the third time you see oh gosh I see nothing but after the seventh time he come back tired I don't know if he was working out or not but he came back tired he said Elijah I don't know what this means but I see a cloud it's a tiny cloud it's like a man's hand Eli just hit run one would run you know what the Bible says Elijah was not a young man returns but the Bible said when Elijah heard that he ran faster than horses don't tell me that is Holy Ghost thing doesn't make you do superhuman thing Oh [Applause] radio Bible the Bible says that Elijah got to where he had to go before the horses got there it's you know one of two things and horses was doing this but Elijah was running so fast that the horses couldn't catch him and I'm seeing the horses of hello after you if you see the sign is warning it could be a small time but the devil cannot catch you cannot move you cannot change your mind you may be seated [Applause] I don't know how long you're gonna speak this morning but it's early it's early this morning so get comfortable put on your seat belt this morning we're going for a journey we're going back to 2000 years ago so a little baby is born in Bethlehem hello baby baby crying baby wants milk and that baby no miracles yet no preaching yet but in that baby is the potential to turn over it in that baby is the potential to restore all that man lost in that baby is the potential what Abraham couldn't finish and Moses couldn't finish David couldn't finish Joshua couldn't finish a elisha couldn't finish in that baby that baby possessed all that he was was in that baby because all that God was he bought it's a christ in that baby [Applause] you may be seated growing up in the temple growing up in the church he's on a secret mission but I love God because some of you here today you think you're here because somebody invited you when the Bible says no man could come unless the father draws you first you you trying to be you try to be all gangster up in the church you trying to be resistant you have power to resist you know the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you why this is your jurisdiction you may not have the power yet but this is still yours because the Bible says we shall reign on the earth you may be seated recently a new president was elected before the installation ceremony before the swearing-in ceremony that person who is about to become president is called a president-elect [Applause] they have not been placed in office yet but it is understood it is established that they are about to step into power [Applause] president elect you get automatic security you're not there yet but you are gonna be here you get automatic respect because you are about to take a position and that's why you have such hard trials because the devil knows that you are bribed elect [Applause] oh that's only 50% don't you know you are bribed elect that 60% don't you know you are pride elect you may be seated [Applause] what does bride elect means it means you're engaged you're not girlfriend no more it means you have a ring on your finger it means it's only a matter of time but the wedding is about to happen your party didn't change your party investigation he already decided you are the one he wants to be with oh god help me this morning he already made up his mind that this lady is going to be flesh of my flesh blown up oh you know here minute anybody knows what I'm talking about this [Applause] you may be seated ever see when somebody get engaged decide to take pictures of your ring and they post it on Instagram because they want people to know I'm engaged I'm spoken for I'm with somebody I don't know what you were I'm with somebody under the Branham said that before the foundation of the world he put an engagement ring this unprotected nation is unsworn knowledge he elected you and said one day I'm gonna marry you you may be seated with the random taught us through every age they were elected that were predestinated so God had to wait a long time for this particular portion of that lady imposed a that was riding Martin's day there was bribe in our day this bride also to complete this whole image of God can the church say man everybody feeling fine so Jesus had a secret mission a secret ministry so everything he did was deliberate because you wanted to establish not himself but he wanted to establish man back in his position he was never the one out of position he made a choice to come down to earth to restore things or you don't hear me this morning it was man who lost his position Adam Adam where though it was not that God couldn't see where Adam was but Adam had lost his position he had fell from his authority he had fell from his place and God purpose to restore it so Jesus is growing up in the temple growing up in the church and I preached it before and he's growing up just like a young person in the church nobody know he is that's Joseph's boy that's a carpenter's boy a fine young man is a nice lad you see that little table he made and they don't even know they're playing with nuclear weapon [Applause] you know whenever you're transporting a nuclear weapon dick they put some sang on it warning signs God took the warning sign over this one because he didn't want the table to understand that it was a nuclear weapon yet slipped in until the time came for what God had planned note to begin to be unfolded the Bible says he's the author and the finisher of our faith so it means that this Bible what is written in here was actually planned out before it was even put into words form because it existed in God's mind so the Bible said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so if God is writing a diary before it happens in that diary he was right at the right time I'm gonna change form and come as a baby and I'm gonna be dropping her home and I'm gonna pick her young lady named Mary and she gonna be in kids a choice if they want to think something wrong with him so I'm gonna comfort him and send the angel to tell em it's gonna be all right he's taken care of everything [Applause] and in the plan is okay plan is seen one let Jesus begin to display who he is so on that day this is happening in the heavenlies but under that normal service and the elders allowed a young man to come read the scripture they say young Jesus won't you come and Jesus quietly nobody knows who he is where the candy comes up he finds where it is written in the scripture I said to read the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the gospel and I was reading and this is not something strange the young men they have this nice opportunity to to bless us but when Jesus finished and he closed the book he said this the scripture is fulfilled and I can imagine in the church he elders was like what in fact the Bible said they said to raise the question is not this Joseph's son quizzes this is not this is not Elisha son this is not it's not a it's not just Joseph's son but unbeknownst to the enemy I could you imagine what the devil is saying about you is this not George Sunnis that's not Jenny son is this not how come you talking about this D descriptives well how come you're talking them are you gonna get the Holy Ghost and you gonna be deliver you wanna be charged the devil's biggest mistake is the thing that your past and your family determines your future because the devil in understand the genetic code that Jesus had that he was not even from this earth the seeming devil looks at you didn't realize you not from it we are strangers we are just passing through one of these days I'm gonna be missing one of the disease I'm gonna be gone if you want to stay here that's you but goodbye world good morning glory can the church shame [Applause] so on a drive this home this morning so Jesus of the secret mission everything in his public ministry is for the public so when he goes his first miracle that wedding in Cana when he ran out of wine Mary comes to Jesus that Jesus hears what he runs a wine she's like what I have to do with me but Mary had a reveler to say she tell you brothers whatever this man see they do do it and Jessa get some water and bring some water and when in first of the pour water the water turned to wine with Antony not just wine you know but they say this wine so good because the custom was you serve your best thing first so that means they were not the best thing first of all they were the finish the best thing then the next best thing then he laughs he drags whatever is there was there everything finished really drink everything out but when Jesus lady water but the Branham said eventually that water would have met grapes eventually those grapes would have fermented eventually there would have been age over time but Jesus bypass the whole process and put time on it so when they tasted it is a witness who seems the best wine for last [Applause] but listen Jesus mission was not to turn water into wine they brought the blind they brought the whole they brought the lame that was public ministry he could have done it so he did and he would still qualify what he did by saying I do nothing except the Father show me first he goes to the Pool of Bethesda and they are hundreds of people sick and he finds one man and we said yesterday when he healed up man all of he'll get upset but that's what Jesus wanted because he wanted the devil to come after him because you wanted to overcome on the earth in this earthly realm he wanted to conquer in this earthly realm but Jesus also understood that the devil had the keys to death and hell and in order for Jesus to get the keys the death and hell he couldn't get it while he was in the earthly realm so when he shed his glory and came in flesh he also had to shed flesh and leave his flesh on the cross and leave his flesh moving around but while he was in flesh on the cross and moving around he already left that body he had to be in a different condition to step into hell to walk straight up to the devil and say give me that keys give me the keys to death give me the keys to hell or you don't hear me this morning another random said Jesus left hell with the keys on his waist the keys to death and hell so it's a Sunday morning nobody knew that this was going on when the disciples met Jesus they didn't know that he had went down and taking the keys he knew he said he was going to be raised up and even T didn't even believe it Thomas who see Jesus walk on water Thomas who saw all the miracles say I'm not gonna believe until I touched a near prisoners hand because what Jesus did nobody ever done before he said I have power to lay my life down and pick it back up again [Applause] so he already had power over death but he wanted to release his people who are in fear of that he was at a release Abraham and Ezekiel and Daniel and everyone who are tied who the devil had locked him up somebody back to me and he wanted to let you know that death is nothing to fear because I live you live also but more than that I took the keys I took the keys of debt I took the keys of hell I took the keys of the grave Oh hallelujah you may be seated Halloween so said yesterday it's like having a house your house is your realm and your keys is your jurisdiction because you have keys to your house you can open your house and you could walk in anytime you want because you have keys so your house and when you go to your house you can lock the door and when you lock the door you keep elements outside and you keep yourself safe on the inside so the devil is in RL as we seen to that RL monkey pants because he has a house but he has no keys he can't lock anybody in and he can stop anybody from getting out he have to watch people go in and out a door because you have no keys to control nothing because Jesus took the keys [Applause] so whatever situation you are in this morning there's no devil can hold you back because it never can lock you up Jesus already unlocked it and he has the keys you're healing already paid for your deliverance already paid for the Holy Ghost already paid for your baptism already paid for your adoption already in motion and no demon or devil those spirit that stop you somebody's amen [Applause] Oh glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the same way God had a secret mission that the world didn't see didn't understand couldn't relate to he has a secret mission going on in your life right now that the devil doesn't understand he can't figure it out because he was supposed to be dead you are supposed to be defeated you are supposed to be a statistic but here you are this morning giving God praise giving God thanks and the word is coming to you in a real way to remind you that you come from God and you go back to God those are not just words but you come from God and you're going back to God hallelujah somebody say man this morning we celebrate the resurrection of the Living King Confucius is dead Muhammad is dead Buddha is dead every other God is dead but Jesus Christ is alive an Easter it means our freedom it means our restoration it means our attention is a means Pentecost Easter means a super Church in some beans another Ephesians Easter also means that God once again change form he was spirit he became flesh he changed form again went down into hell change form again in a glorified body transform himself as Holy Spirit he may be seated [Applause] man was in the Garden of Eden and he was pushed out I eaten then the whole of the Old Testament was speaking about a natural land so it was always being in a in a location in a position so in Eden in the land but when Jesus came he changed a whole geographical thing for you and he gives you a new land of promise call the lamb the Holy Ghost he also called a lampion in Christ so he said if any man be in Christ he's a new creature there's therefore now no condemnation to them that I in Christ Jesus you don't hear me this morning but listen when he was father you couldn't be in him in that kind of a way when he walked in the earth you couldn't be in him because he was flesh but now that he is spirit and he represents the land the promise now you could step into that land no wonder he can say the same works I do you shall do also and I thought do you wanna know I'm in the father he and me are you you Oh somebody help me this mornin [Applause] hallelujah so Easter meant all that Adam lost could now be restored Eastern now meant that there was a higher law that is to prove that there was a higher law because the law said it because you fell in sin that you are finished the law says because you made a mistake you can stand the law found a woman caught in the act of adultery and when Jesus walked past you see Lord this woman was caught in the very act and everybody happier stones and 1/4 the law if she is caught she should be stood Jesus didn't refute the law he does say listen whoever don't have sinned by one means cast the first stone and so that Jesus don't embarrass anybody he turned his back and when you look back around he's a woman where are your accusers everybody suddenly realized had something more important to do than stone this is turning anointed left them stolen inspiration yes yes well you know what I don't feel inspired as soon anymore because he addressed the sin issue he see when man fell he fell into sin into sickness into death and he lost his inheritance so when Jesus came he had to come to restore everything so he came to turn sin over because for all of the time since man fell they offered bulls and goats as a sacrifice because God is merciful so he said if you sin let the lamb take your place but that was only temporary because that lamb blood was only covering the sin but Jesus came to dissolve sit altogether not to cover the sin anymore but by his blood he brought Redemption by his blood he brought cleansing by his bloody paw transformation by his blood so what the devil didn't realize is that when Jesus came it wasn't just a healer because the children official they had testimonies they knew what Moses did didn't you about Elijah in knew about miracles it wasn't like miracles was foreign to them but when Jesus came it is what he did in combination that upset the kingdom of Hell forever because he paid the price for sin permanently no more you need gold on cheapen plus he broke the veil from top to bottom brought the power of the priesthood say no you were priests you have direct access to God so he dealt with the sin situation he tells me the access situation he does with the sickness situation because the blood also came to take care of your sicknesses and then he changed our spirit to deal with your nature and then he took the keys of death and hell to let you know that you're not gonna die that death can't hold you the grave can't keep you so at a time Paul gets there he said death where is your sting grave where is your victory you've already been broken oh come on now so this morning we live by a higher law we don't live by the law of nature we don't live by the law of the world we live by the law of God we live by the law of the FT we live by the law of resurrection power we live by the Lord to defy gravity we live by the law not to defy depth and defy sickness and define somebody give God a shout of praise you belong to call this morning Oh hallelujah and because we belong to him he will do whatever it takes to get you back he's not gonna leave you he's not gonna leave your family he's not gonna leave you in the house of the enemy you belong to God you bet you don't belong to Satan this morning oh I don't care if you're backslidden I don't have you feel defeated I don't care if you feel depressed I don't care if you feel that like Lazarus this morning there's a Easter for the bride son of man can these bones live I say yes they can you always belong to God [Applause] you may be seated this service this morning is not to make you belong to God you know you always belong to God this service this morning is to remind you that you belong to him that's what the service is about is to remind you that you are son of the king it's a reminder that you have access this morning to every redemptive right has been paid for [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna giving you the receipt it's beautiful but the appellant said in Christ is like going to a grocery it's like going into a grocery but everything paid for could imagine it have nobody like the shop here as I go into a mall anybody anybody like with any mall there's nobody no no no we insured you have to be honest nobody likes agos anymore anybody ever wants any more than you wanted to get this you wanted to get that you wanted to get this and any real idea was on a budget you couldn't get everything you wanted you wanna get a new fool and it's checking on different foods and then you say well you know what I could only buy the foo and I kept any kids yet I come back next month and get a kiss and then I'm gonna get the air P so maybe over three months I get me a piece too or maybe I take a cheaper phone because I wanna budget so they got a cheaper phone with the kids and this earpiece where anyone and in your mind you're going through this whole budget in constraint but imagine it goes anymore but only more the whole printed receipt for everything you could possibly buy and you can just walk and pick up what you want and when you reach the checkout let's show them look it's paid for it's already paid for if I want five phones I can take five phones if I 182 foreign kisses 365 foreign kisses have a different kids every day imagine the close with performies imagine my earpiece with my glasses whatever I want I could get it and better than that if I forgot something I wanted I could go back and get it you because it's already paid for so when Jesus died on the cross he gives you a whole receipt for everything you could ever want if you want healing take it off the shelf you want deliverance listen not just spiritual things you know he said am Jehovah Jireh so I'm gonna provide for you you want finances it's on the shelves you want your family it's on you want a new house if you shall say and don't doubt you need to speak bigger you need to tick on the ticket enough this morning I'm taking everything I'm taking everything so why you want to walk around sad why you want to walk around depressed you may be seated I saw a poor sometime when face but when you want to get encouraged do some retail therapy and anyway knows what what is this retail therapy they say when you shop you see better so I'm inviting you to go shop the grocery of the Lord this morning and feel better this is the only grocery that has joined [Applause] I don't think you heard me this is the only place I can find peace this is the only place you can find happiness in normal grocery to sell alcohol they sell cigarette butts right think of your temporary high but in this grocery where you take joy you get a permanent high joy unspeakable full of glory when you take this joy pill and this gospel and this happiness pill you can lose your job and still have joy the devil confuse you may be seated I don't care how bad things get listen friends no matter how tough things got in your life you still eat something isn't that right because the Bible said I've never seen my seatback bread God will work things out for you to eat every day he promised to supply all your need and what you need in this world is temporary because we are leaving this earth to go to a place way at all have to eat no more good have to cry no more don't have to feel pain no more that's what Jesus died for and when he rose again he proved that that couldn't hold him [Applause] hallelujah Oh glory glory glory so when Jesus rose again he opened the door into the land of the Holy Ghost by pouring out his spirit up to when Jesus died Peter and they still struggled the disciples still had hard times when Jesus died he went back fishing because they need to have not yet been changed you can go all the church services in the world and I wouldn't change your nature they can change your behavior temporarily but once you're out of that atmosphere you go back to how you used to be but God wanted a place of permanent solution not a temporary solution the blood of bulls and goats was a temporary solution but when Jesus died he brought a permanent solution committed Church is a temporary solution but one of these days he says you're gonna be in Christ not in church but in Christ and in Christ you are a new creature not temporary not one day I'm up not one day I'm down not I fighting my way back there's no fighting no we're back when you are in Christ you are in Christ when you are in Christ diamond or you're in Christ when your implies the devil is afraid of you [Applause] you maybe see that I'm not gonna be too much longer listen the devil still hasn't recovered you know to devastate a recovery you know but the random Twitter that when Jesus was in the wilderness being tested and he said it is written it is also written his written it is written is also written it was like electric volts in the devil he said the devil with an avocation I don't know who he left in charge but the other way through first season and that wasn't even power it was just a word you don't hear me this morning so the devil may have just been recuperating from his vacation when he went to get therapy for what Jesus did in the wilderness when he concocted a plan to crucify Jesus and the devil taught that this was his sweet revenge but he finally was able to get Jesus to die because he had got me around today and you got to give it to time and every tiny yellow celebration the devil's not the plan is celebration by the toil because he had to get Jesus if he could just kill Jesus it was all his trouble vanish and he would prepare for his next target he was used to it in centuries you doing this he knew David he knew era ham he know Joshua you know Elijah every man will come he will battle with them and every time is your gosh whose shoes and then the next one will come and he was used to it he was accustomed to it and when Jesus died the devil thought it was just like Iran I'm just like David so could you imagine where it is the Sunday morning [Applause] when until they realized this one is different [Applause] this one was dead but yes Dan dead [Applause] listen you may be seated the problems done anytime that's 120 devil tone was supposed to happen the problems to get back up you imagine the confusion and when you kill him the Calculon again and then Jesus as with an antenna priests on Friday night start to open up the data pottery plan he wanted to reproduce himself you may be seated you have to understand it's not good starter this is it that was added it but we will finish it I [Music] have a sailor I are looking for trouble but if trouble come we'll deal with it and when the devil came in cause Eden God see fine take it good I would owe it because I'm eternity the devil was created so he belongs to time so time doesn't move God he's from eternity he steps in and out of time to eternity for his purpose so when Jesus came and rose again no TVs two of the plans had to unfold here comes Peter here comes James here comes John they afraid for their lives but they rejoicing in their heart because they could read recall how Easter made them feel but Jesus left them didn't really understand why he left the understanding was open but he knew something was gonna happen didn't even know what it meant and the devil when Jesus left he said well wash he died he rose again heal and is he left could imagine the devil went through a really an emotional time in and put a billy policy a poor devil did everyone emotion he had to deal with all these do miracles the healings and deliverances and Jesus died he got temporary relief and Jesus rose again he gets a cardiac arrest and then and then Jesus left if you level that's about himself I'm gonna Brandon said like this he said when they were in the upper room the devil wasn't bothered he used to people making noise entering he was there when they were shouting Hosanna that didn't bother him but he said when pizza walked out of the upper room and went by here caught beautiful and saw the man who he knew because he was lame for a long time and pizza who made mistakes Peter who denied Christ Pete oh who chopped off the man is only a short while ago it wasn't like Peter was a long-standing believer just a short while ago Jesus just died and rose again Peter just got delivered but all of a sudden he the consist silver and gold I don't have but such as I have he wasn't praying for it he said such as I have I give it all to you brother branham said Red Alert started to happen in Hill wha-wha-wha Malone I told Jesus bed they said it looked like he multiplied himself he talked looking like Jesus James looking like Jesus John looking like Jesus [Applause] Oh somebody help me this morning and listen listen this never even happened with Jesus but Peter is walking and the Bible says people were being healed in the shadow the greatest weapon the world had ever seen was slipped as a baby right under the devil eyes and then the devil thought he had Peter listen you ever see this when Peter went back fishing when Jesus died you'd ever see look at them they couldn't even look Chee and a half years look at him gone right back this always the devil didn't even understand that there was a secret mission going on beyond the veil beyond the eyes there was a transformation there was a sea that was planted in Peters soul that the devil couldn't pull out and all of Peters mistakes and failures couldn't take that seed out of his soul he took a backslide even in Matthew 16 Jesus turned to Peter and say get behind me Satan and that didn't even touch the seed that was in Peter soul the seeding with the soul was destined for the upper room and the seed in your soul is destined for your upper room experience [Applause] come on was finished Oh hallelujah how is this possible Peter was always a part of God just like Jesus he was pleased there for a purpose just like Jesus he was there for a purpose a part of the mystery that God was unfolding he didn't know it Peter growing up as a fisherman had no idea that there was a higher purpose for his life the same way every one of us in here have a revelation that is a higher purpose for our lives and no devil no depression no demon could stop that purpose from being accomplished and we are in fishing balls this morning swimming around life thinking we are in control and gold I just waitin waitin waitin until like soil he could drop you from offer your horse and give you a burning bush experience give you an experience of a transformed your soul that you who are free to testify will suddenly be able to testify that it is all over me and it's keeping me alive you need to testify on your job testify in your home testify in your school how you made it testify that you have your own resurrection experience that you have your own restoration experience you had your own deliverance experience that you are just a man but behind us can feel is a seed of God that has a destination at his glory we shall not all sleep but it's gonna be a rapture there's gonna be a deliverance there's gonna be a wedding supper glory to God kinda Chertsey man Oh hallelujah hallelujah my my my I'm almost finished the musician to get ready so let's just touch this here when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had brought sweet spices that am i come to anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sifaka and friends didn't come expecting to see Jesus not there they came to unknowing the body they came out of reverence and respect and brother branham type that he said the devil I tried to bind the wood Jesus the word they put a stone you know where they put the stone there they put the stone because they were afraid because they heard a rumor going around that children are raised from the dead so they put a stone in a very big stone not only they put a stone but they put God's because therefore afraid by the irony that the disciples will come and take the body and say you see he rose from the dead so they put a stone and they put guards to make sure that a true man doesn't come to pass but how you could put a stone if God pulled Lazarus od grave if he walked on do you know sometimes one Davie the other thinking you know if somebody has power to say peace be still if he has power to take five loaves and two fishes and feed 5000 if he has power to raise Jairus daughter if he has per hope a stone and a few men clearly didn't think it true but it was a good effort and the devil has made a good effort to try to put a stone in front of your life and try to put glads to stop your resurrection [Applause] [Music] but the my Bible tells me I don't know about yours but my Bible tell me if that seems spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you and dwells in me it should represent type of reaction like when Jesus was here so if you put Jesus and put a stone and put men and if you put put a Jerome behind stone and men and the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus is in him what stone what man what nature what situation what sickness [Music] [Applause] he may be seated that stone brother Jerome was the very first witness of the resurrection [Applause] so whatever stone if it's a stone of sickness this morning that sickness will be the first witness of your resurrection if it's a problem in your marriage that stone will be the first witness of your resurrection if it's what's going on any with your children with your family that stone will be the first witness that you are not dead [Applause] [Music] but the random said it ladies if Christ the wood has been placed in your heart and the devil tries to block that life in you from being lived out so he would please stones to try to block that life from coming out but this morning we asks a question like this who will roll away the stone because those sisters came to unknowing Jesus and they themselves couldn't move the stone but the angel of the Lord he came to move the stone from their lives and the angel of the Lord is here this morning to move the stone from our lives so that you can walk out victorious walk out as an overcomer walk out as a conqueror because he is the Conqueror we are also now more than conquerors so it's time that we begin to act like more than conquerors and the very action of moving like conquerors starts to get the devil so afraid that he has to let you go because he doesn't know how much like him you really are I'm to protect himself he has to stand far away lest he get the same kind of response that Jesus gave him because the devil didn't even know who Jesus was and if he couldn't even figure out who Jesus was how will you know who you even to the devlins being cautious this morning he is trying to see if he could pin you down but like the Bible says if you resist him he has to flee because this is your jurisdiction this is your realm this belongs to you and it's just a matter of time before the resurrection power which is the dynamics strikes the mechanics words seen in your soul that has been preached for all these years by a vindicated prophet that a message of deliverance to speak and Easter for the bride because the bride hasn't had a revival yet she hasn't had a resurrection yet but it's coming that scene has been in the ground for a long time and the devil thinks you are over the devil think you are finished but you are gonna make it on any day now it could be today you can break out of that stone break out of your grave break out of your tube and take your position in the body of Christ take your position in the kingdom of God take your position in the Holy Ghost can the church give the Lord a shout of praise [Music] Oh hallelujah hallelujah let's all stand our feet so this morning the brine there will be an Easter for the bride the bride will prove
