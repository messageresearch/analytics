Prevail they're going to try and say no it didn't but they will not Prevail brother there may be teachers there may be isms rise there may be great programs rise there may be things that look like that would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of God to see that it will not Prevail so the devil and all hell will come against you but then it's God's purpose to see that

invitation to be here and Dr hman contacted me to ask me if I you know would like to come down I never thought I'd be in South Africa but I consider it a privilege to be here so we I know Brothers already spoke and the feel of fire already in the place and we just want to put our shoulder to the wheel to as it was what we can do for the furtherance of the Gospel amen so tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to St John 14 and 1 John 5 for scripture reading [Music] tonight I want to greet all the ministers who took time off with the congregations and so they come out may God bless you and may God give you a further portion of his Spirit to take the bride onto Perfection hallelujah praise His wonderful name so reading from St John chapter 14 reading from verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works that than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but he see me and because I live he shall live also and at that day he shall know that I'm in my father ye in me and I in you from 1 John chapter 5 we want to read from verse 4 thank [Music] you for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are tree that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and there are tree that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one may God a blessing to reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah if our title the brides come down to Victory and an inspiration Pioneers to achieve oh then said the brid come to defeat but the Bride come down to Victory because the bride will have victory do you believe that for message faces of Victory but was saying and anyone and he read this scripture and he said anyone of you know that in Olympics or any other athleticals is no matter if you arrive first in the race but if you haven't played the game according to the rules you are disqualified so you have to play the rule right praise God it say not who have the biggest church who have the biggest Ministry or who have the biggest gift who have the biggest this who have biggest whatever that's not the point we got to play it according to the rules oh do you believe that you may be seated so if you haven't played the game ACC the rules you're disqualified you have to play the rule right and that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect to win you have got to play it according to God's word and the purpose that you were brought here for now there are so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we now live in praise God he said let me say this that there ought to be higher Ambitions in the human life and Christians should set the affection on higher Ambitions so as a Christian we have to have ambition we have to have purpose we have to have a sense of Destiny as brother Blair was talking about this morning we have to feel that we going somewhere we have to feel that we going to achieve something do you believe that amen praise God Amen you may be seated so the Christians should set their affections and high Ambitions and I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place andever who is kind enough to bring us here we ought to consider it and ask him what he would have us to do the purpose of Us coming to fulfill what he has purpose for us but we seem to just wanted to keep up with the world so the Bible said that we could overcome the world [Applause] no he didn't say your feelings tell you that he said the Bible [Applause] [Music] said and the Bible is the word and if the Bible said we can overcome the world we can overcome it Hallelujah my I feel the countown is on praise God you know you're going to get the victory Hallelujah glory to God Amen amen hallelujah you may be seated so how do we do it not by keeping with the Fashions of the world but the Bible said that faith is the victory oh Hallelujah that overcomes the world and you know what give Fai seven [Applause] Thunders praise God praise God in other words the kind of faith that the seventh tunder is given it is going to be defeated it's Unstoppable oh Hallelujah do you believe that oh blessed be the name of the Lord you may be seated he's talking about like a drift for people just Drifters and floats just joining Church a Driftwood just hangs up in any kind of trash you just find yourself in group or that group or BNS up somewhere trash up in some that's a Driftwood don't be a Driftwood a drift would have no purpose a drift would only floating on the sea of time but we have a purpose we a drifted nowhere we are going to be shaped we are going to be changed oh Hallelujah because we are elected we are called we are anointed and we are being [Applause] bled Hallelujah be seated said dffw just hangs up in any kind of trash that's just about the way the floaters does in the church you take on a stream like the stream of life and plenty of Driftwood hanging up in every trash pile and yet the boat comes along made of wood too but if you notice the wood is made and shaped out by a master who has spilled the boat not only is it shaped out but it is Guided by a master and it is pushed by a power Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah my Jesus you may be seated oh my Hallelujah my God my God I say my God hallelujah praise be to Jesus thank you Lord oh my you may be seated my God say it have wood and word it have drift word and shaped word the drift word just drifts the shape word is guided and powered oh so everybody have the same OPP Unity my God all heard Moses word hallelujah all came out to the Red Sea all have the same Prophet all heard the same promise but Joshua and Caleb said we are more than [Applause] able oh Hallelujah you may be seated so this boat is shaped out and guided by a master and it is pushed by a power and we are all listen we are all made out of the same stuff it just depends on how your Ambitions run my God you see like when you are in a race and you know it's a final home stretch my God the adrenaline begin to pump you know you're got to make it my God you may be third you may be fourth but you got to bust that tape then you put something extra and I believe we on the home stretch of the coming of the Lord it is time to push something extra oh Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah glory to God you may be seated question are you willing to let the master Craftsman make out of you that which he could use and that which he could control and that which he could power if this certain little craft that has been made different and been craft out by the Master's Hand should ever stick into some weeds along in Shallow Waters there's a power behind it a little boat that the master can turn on and push it into deep Waters again God wants to mle and make us what he wants us to be but how can we do that or how can God do that when we won't even stand still for him to do it we want to be our own Master we want to think our own way of thinking and many people come into the church and join the church and put their name on the book and doesn't even consider what the Church believes and check up with that church how they preach the word of God whether they stand for Full Gospel or not they just pick out a portion at a Creed floating drifting never among to anything huj oh hallelujah hallelujah but let me tell you something tonight you on the in and outside of this building you're going to wind up at the destination one of these days that's going to be in the Valley of the Shadows of death I would advise you this hour to prepare to meet the god that will have to meet you at that hour you'll either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece of Driftwood to your final destination so don't you just drift along and Float around just for a better job or better dress or better television or a new car oh Hallelujah Don't Drift around for that when you join Church you should first seek out find out what that church stand for my God if it bringing Discord get out if it's sowing see the Discord get out because this is a message of Brotherly kindness this is a message of the love of God [Applause] hallelujah so is it just a Mia place that people go to fellowship or is it the place that preaches the word of God that stands for every principle that Jesus died for you should do that just don't float in and go with the tide because straight is the gate and narrow is the way that lead to eternal life oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so don't be a d word be shaped you know when somebody's accustom with defeat it's hard to think about Victory you may be seated it come like you never taste victory before you see like a box in a ring let's say never taste victory before every time he go in that ring he keep studying the the last fight he had he was defeated so the next time he go in the ring 50% in his mind saying I might lose this next one I will give him a best shot but that's not good enough you take that same boxer and give him a new trainer that could blow the negatives out his [Applause] mind he start to talk different I'll knock him out in the seventh round Hallelujah I will knock him out he become positive Hallelujah his own attitude changes oh praise God Amen Hallelujah and I believe that's what God want to do knock the negatives out that you could call the shots you could call the wrong you could call the C down you can say in the seventh age hallelujah hallelujah praise God you can talk about when God call you Hallelujah that God call you for purpose to destroy the works of the enemy because Jesus said the same works I do shall you do my God to come down is on we are going to do the same thing he did oh do you believe that oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah oh Hallelujah so I don't care if you have never overcome you never taste victory let me tell you today that you will [Applause] overcome [Applause] Hallelujah you may be seated now that may just hit your conscious mind that you will overcome it got to go down deeper subconscious mind you mean I have to overcome I can I will I do believe because the Bible said to him and overcome it and before the Bible could say that God must predestinate God must elect somebody to overcome in other words God knew every condition here in South Africa he know just the family you will come true he know just where you'll be broken know who your husband going to be who your wife is going to be and he put you still and tell the devil look at them they are going to come to Victory Hallelujah don't you know he put half an hour silence to let the devil do all that he can do but when that silence is broken The Works of the devil is finished a jubilee trumpet is sound [Music] it oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus so when all those negatives go out then you could say I know I'm going to get the Holy Ghost I know I'm going to be healed I know I'm going to be delivered I know I'm going to get a Revival I know I'm going to get a breakthrough praise God Amen and amen and amen oh you may be seated praise God Daniel when he was going down into Babylon he was going away from his home he was going to have to be a slave to another nation of people but Daniel purpose in his heart no matter what they did to him he wasn't going to defile himself with the Babylonian sin and if we had more Gallant men like that that with purpose in your heart if I'm a Christian I'm going to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me and claim it listen to this if the Bible teaches that I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm going to stay on my knees till God gives me the Holy Spirit and just not dri oh do you believe that he said the Bible teaches I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm going to stay on my knees I'm going to stay on my knees oh Hallelujah because God's promise it oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that you may be seated I was reading all Uncle Buddy Robinson life story some time ago he was such a great man and loving man a man of faith and he got to hungering for the holy spirit because the Bible taught it and it says that one day he was plowing corn and he stopped his old mule ell and got down in the corner he said God if you don't give me the baptism of the Holy Spirit when you come back to earth you will find my bones laying right here that's purposing in your heart that is really getting into business and when you get that kind of a purpose in your heart God is going to open the windows of Heaven something has to take place but you have got to get to business with God and have a purpose [Applause] hallelujah oh my you may be seated when Daniel had purpose in his heart and the devil made him prove it oh my so once you have a purpose the devil say Okay a purpose now I'm going to make you prove it do you really want the Holy Ghost do you really want that Revival do you really want that breakthrough or you only saying so because others saying so oh Hallelujah Hallelujah my God hallelujah but once that purpose is there then you are going to get that breakthrough you are going to get the Holy Ghost not just a emotion not just a sensation but the deity of God veil in [Applause] you so when Daniel had purpose oh yes and you find out that it stood good in the face of the hungry land and a man that ever come to God and ready down in his heart finds a settle fate it will stand good in the mouth of death or in the mou of sickness in the mouth of Sorrow will stand good for faith is the victory you have overcome by your faith and Abraham just a man with no certain purpose in life with his father and friends and so forth and Abraham praying no doubt he prayed through till he struck the hand of God how did he do it perhaps he thought like this if there's a God who made the ark and let Noah flow through he still lives today somewhere in the land of the heathens where he was sojourning he touched the hand of God and in there God gave him a revelation that there was a city and maker whose build and maker was God so Abraham wasn't just a Drifter looking for he don't know what he looking for he had a revelation that there's a city whose maker and Piller is God hallelujah oh and when you have that Revelation you could walk by faith my God you got married you keep on pressing on you pick up two three children you keep on pressing on but you're seeking a city oh hallelujah amen you may be seated and we read all Abraham's life he was a pilgrim and a stranger to the world for his one ambition was to find that City whose build and maker was God he struck something he caught God and a faith in that God and he fora the New Jerusalem and he put his back on his on his back and became a wonderer not just floating about without any purpose he had faith that there was a city he had a purpose in life to find a place and may I say here that one day when the battle was over he met the king of that City and he gave him communion bread and wine MDC and you can't listen you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding a reality to it he said you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality and if there's a deep deep calling him there's got to be a deep to respond Hallelujah because God is a reality oh my you may be seated so if your Soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustration and there's something down in you that's telling you that there's somewhere you can overcome that why do you float around from church to church from place to place just kneel down till you strike heaven [Applause] Hallelujah just kneel down till you strike Heaven as I said last night go beyond the song barriers and then you have a purpose in life you have a purpose in belonging to the church you have a purpose in being baptized you have a purpose in what you are seeking [Applause] for oh my Hallelujah so God is Not setting up a bride to be ashamed of her he not set up a bride to be embarrassed by that bride no you may be seated Hallelujah the serent deceive Eve in the Garden of Eden but the prophet said this bride amen will prove who the devil not to that preacher and that preacher you know to the devil that she is not like [Applause] Eve [Applause] hallelujah oh praise be to God so what itude we ought to have you may be seated you know it come like exams coming up my God and instead of uh getting all nervous you you getting prepared so you can't wait to go in the exam room to pass the exam you're not going in the exam to fail you're going to pass because you're prepared for it the Bible says wife had made herself ready by taking on the clothes of the word isn't that right amen now he said from Eagle St his nest a chicken is a bird too a chicken isn't a fowl just as an eagle but there's a difference the chicken knows nothing about the heavenlies it was never up [Applause] there it cannot sore where the eagle sore the chicken cannot go where the eagle go oh Hallelujah my God hallelujah as we said before you may have lost some feeds but you are not a chicken you may be wounded today but you are not a chicken brother oh Hallelujah you may be struggling struggling struggling but don't give up keep on struggling one day you're going to break the song [Applause] barrier oh Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah don't stop now don't give up [Applause] now oh Hallelujah my God I hear the come the come Harvest Time Is Here the K is on for a real Jubilee for a real Revival for real Holy Ghost outpouring to count on the victory [Applause] the chickens cannot shout the chickens cannot praise God the chicken cannot Rejoice but the eagle knows that he knows that he [Applause] knows [Applause] oh my oh man you know what the Bible said rejoicing is in the Tabernacle of the righteous brother Hallelujah the stone that the builders refused that stone has become The Headstone has become the Capstone the C oh Hallelujah this is the pr Revival this is a seven tunder [Applause] Revival you are going to be filed you are going to be sealed you are going to be baptized with the Holy Ghost you are going to be [Applause] delivered want to [Applause] [Applause] be glory to God oh my you may be [Applause] seated you know what my inspiration is Pioneers to achieve to go where no other man went before to go no other people went before to go where no other bride went before days you are going to [Applause] go whenever before now was it promised for the manifestation of the sons of God they going to break time barrier song barrier that going to conquer death itself death stop Noah death Stop Moses death stop Joshua but death the B going to push it aside a crossover there is going to be a rapture [Applause] oh you may be seated praise God the give me some more cord here loose him and let him [Applause] go Hallelujah you may be seated so this Hallelujah the chickens have never been there so therefore it's easy for them to criticize the Eagles because they have never been there why you flying so high what you doing up there there's no boundaries to your faith there's no limit to what you can believe we can believe all things we can hope all things we can D enjoy all things put us anywhere anytime any place under any condition we going to stand oh you know what I said anywhere anytime any place you are going to stand [Applause] brother [Applause] you may be seated they say the chickens there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost how can he say it in a chicken's Nest he's not an eagle to begin with he don't know nothing about it he never saw where the eagle has sword he never put God to a test he's never been healed by the power of almighty God therefore he doesn't know nothing about what he's talking about he don't know the Cry of the [Applause] eagle oh hallelujah oh my oh my you may be seated so God liken his Eagles his Heritage of eagles let's take the eagle what the eagle does he builds his nest way high I've watch them when they get to the highest point that they can get to build their nest that's lightened unto the Church of the Living God it makes it stand for the highest Ambitions the highest thoughts the holiest things away from the earth Mountain that is where the church takes her stand on the highest Pinnacle that she can stand oh my so there's a big difference between the eagle and the chicken both are birds but one is Earth M and the other one is [Applause] heavenbound so listen if the chicken can't get his feet off the ground don't worry he was a chicken to begin with he will never get up there and know what an eagle knows you may be seated so I watched this fellow as he was sitting there with his great big gray looking eyes watching me and I thought well there's one thing I admire about him he's not afraid and I hate a coward and God does [Applause] too Hallelujah so don't be scared Hallelujah he says now I hate a coward God us too so a man that's afraid after he's been healed to testify about it a man that God has saved and then he's ashamed to tell somebody that he's Sav and fill with the Holy Ghost I haven't got much confidence in his salvation so when you are really listen listen so when you really get it you want to tell everybody you just can't keep [Applause] [Music] still what the church needs is some more Holy Spirit the church don't need more [Applause] ministers the church don't need more explanations more deep deep deep deep deep [Applause] Revelation you may be seated Minister preach so deep you don't even know what he's talking about just wonder if he know what he talking about it's so deep you don't even understand it too deep but it needs more Holy Spirit and fire to make it move that's why the churches today are dead because there is no fire and the Holy Spirit brings [Applause] fire look it right here he say it takes fire to move the church not explanation not deep Revelation it takes the Holy Ghost and [Applause] Fire oh my Hallelujah you may be seated oh my from returning Jubilee said yes sir they give them chicken feed the nomination Creed and they lived on that that's all they know they Earth Mound they don't know how to raise their feet and rise up in the presence of God and claim victory they don't know how to shout the Praises of God they don't know how to accept Divine Healing you can talk to them and they bre like a mule because they know nothing about it but when you know what to Eagle nose you could rise in the presence of God I claim victory I claim my healing I claim my sealing I claim my refilling I claim my [Applause] Deliverance oh [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah you may be seated you know he is the high priest of your confession he could only intercede based upon what you confess so if you have no confession he cannot do anything with what you're saying hallelujah so if when the angel come to look for claims your claim form and see it blank he shift it aside to see who else claiming hallu when you make your claims process dispatch in Angels this person just camea to heal him Hallelujah this person just claimed their [Applause] ceiling oh my you may be seated [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] now you may be seated now friends this is what the Seven Seals was about the book was sealed with our Redemptive rights and our inheritance is was sealed in here so you cannot claim what you don't know your [Applause] own because once the deed is sealed you cannot make no claims but once the deed is released then every Redemptive blessing belongs to [Applause] you and the devil didn't want the people to see that so the ministers try to set themselves up as God between the people and the book but the seventh T of Revelation BST you all of that and bring Faith and bring a Revival and gather the bright together that we can have one Lord One Faith one baptism [Applause] so these ministers kingdoms are over there is going to be one Kingdom and Jesus he's going to be king of King we going to crown him we going to Crown Him king of King Lord of [Applause] Lord oh Hallelujah my God I feel like David M CL head [Applause] car you may be seated oh my no Baptist Methodist jeah witness Pentecostal Pilgrim Holiness whoever they cannot make any claims because the book is sealed to them nice bible message is not the message because the book is sealed it took a prophet to open on all Seven [Applause] Seals you may be seated now according to Malachi for Elijah is to turn the hearts of the TR back to the faith of the fathers it's not right now we know Elias is already [Applause] come Hallelujah Elias is already come [Applause] so it wasn't Elijah in person William brandham is the message because the messenger is not here but the days of the voice the voice is here on books and [Applause] tips now the spirit of Prophecy is the testimony of Jesus so the prophet left back the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy so he know there will come Faithful Men that will pick up the spirit of Prophecy and prophesy the same thing that was already said in the [Applause] word you may be seated Hallelujah you me mean the testimony of Jesus has been left on the earth and that was the spirit of Prophecy to prophesy what was already prophesied by the prophet to bring back all those promises give me a scripture preacher Revelation 10:8 I heard another voice said go to the angel and take the book and eat the book for thou must prophesy Hallelujah so the seven Thunders has been the testimony of Jesus because we say it gives faith it CS The Pride it show about how to be it's the pr Revival [Applause] prophesy Hallelujah [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah from the breach he said God's La required a kill a redeemer yes sir and the lamb come out boldly I am the Kinsman who he's talking [Music] about talking about you and [Applause] [Music] I I am the Kinsman I am their redeemer I now have made intercession for them and now have come to claim their rights for [Applause] them you may be seated in that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall have paid the price hallah so he woke up and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon and claim his rights I have died for them I am the kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become man and I did this in order to get that church back again the one that I fora before the foundation of the world Listen friends we KN from right here you not from here before there was a moon there's where you come from before the foundation of the world he saw Sons and Daughters of [Applause] God oh Hallelujah glory be to Jesus Hallelujah Glory you may be seated now he has a title lead of redemption he has it in his hand Med mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been hand of God all the time time now is the hand of the lamb now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he come to claim it back for the human race not claim it back to Angels claim it back to the human which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again and bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation don't that make you feel good [Applause] he said I thought I was tired but I'm not now you see sometime I think I'm getting too old to preach but then I go to see something like that and I think I'm a young man it does something to you someone is waiting for me someone paid a price that I couldn't pay he did it for me Charlie he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights claim it for who not for himself for us he is one of us he is our Kings folk he is my brother he is my savior he is my God he is my kinsman redeemer he is all for what I oh my God what can I do without him do you love [Applause] him oh my you may be seated thank you Jesus oh my so you see how deep this thing is with claims the lamb himself had to step forward to make claims to claim our Redemptive right because we couldn't claim it ourselves because nobody was found worthy so even though the book belongs to us and our name was seal inside it we couldn't take it because we none of us was worthy so somebody who was worthy had to step forward to take it on our behalf so Jesus didn't keep it to himself keep it to his Prophet his Prophet give it to us here we are come on South [Applause] Africa every mystery has been unfolded M you heard what I [Applause] said you may be seated so the lamb talk the book and Revelation 10 I saw another Mighty Angel come down but I LIF the book open your name was in that [Applause] book under with seal I with te oh my when the L begin to pick the seal the K was on first
