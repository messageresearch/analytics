to see plainly before us the promised land of the Holy Ghost and adoption and Perfection that we could realize that time is short and we are leaving this place help us dear God to take our ranks help us to take our places help us to become strong and courageous as you challenge Joshua to be strong and courageous be very strong and very courageous if they ever was a time for us to be strong and courageous is now if there ever was a time for us to square our shoulders and draw swords and take up our positions it's now so father may you speak to your people may you bless your church may you bless the labors the effort the sacrifice the commitment the dedication the Zeal the labor Lord the love the sighing and the crying Lord it is not in vain Lord we thank you that you have placed a burden in our hearts for such a time as this Lord we pay a special blessing this morning on our pastor in a special way that he was touching from the crown of his head the soles of his feet Lord his wife Lord and Lord of ministry the elders the deacons the trustees the ushers the musicians the technicians the helps in the government against those that are here those that are connected on the internet Lord even those that are already on their way and traveling and preparing to travel Lord for the convention this week Lord Lord will you bless the convention Lord made this island Shake as never before Lord not under the power of man but under the power of the Holy Ghost under the power of the resurrected Christ Lord the same way the grave couldn't hold Jesus up and that stone had to be rolled away and their ground shook father Lord they may there be a great shaking Lord may this island never be the same May the bride be set free made a crippled walk made a dumb talk may backsliders be delivered Lord me healing and Revival and the Holy Ghost and restoration and Redemption pour out over this week in the mighty name of Jesus Christ Lord as we approach your Sacred Scriptures may you walk out the pages of the Bible may you speak to our hearts may you take me out of the way may you use me just as a microphone that you could speak directly to your sons and your daughters to hear only what you need them to hear Lord we give this service over to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen I'd like to welcome one and all this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles I'd like to tune to just one portion of scripture reading from The Book of Joshua reading Joshua reading chapter 24 and reading verses 15 and 16. reading Joshua 24 reading verse 15. read it in verse 14 rather now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve he the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord may the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated as we all know why we are in convention weekend on the great expectation for God to do something really powerful in omits and we are taught through scripture and reinforced by the prophet that you get what you expect you have a little expectation you get a little blessing but you have a great expectation you get a great blessing you have a great expectation you get a great reward you dig a valley and there's just one ditch you're not so much water you could hold but you dig a value full of ditches then you could leave with everything that you came to receive and that's not just the convention but that's every service that's everything that you do in life it is an alignment with your expectation with your hope with your level of focus and your attitude is what brings the results can the Church Say Amen so for a title this morning just to share something with the church before the convention and my burden here is to help you along the way knowing that God is going to bless his people over this weekend and I know in my heart that brother random taught us you have to do something for something to happen so we could only do all the best that we could do and then we depend on God to do the rest we can do all the effort all the sacrifice the praying the contribution the fixing up and all these things and it's just up to God to do the rest it's not that we sit along doing nothing hoping for something to happen but we are doing everything we can do looking for God to do the rest and to use his servants that will be ministering to us in a mighty way both who will be greeting and ministering both local and abroad so for a title this morning choose you this day whom you will serve and a subject put away the strange gods and an inspiration as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and I actually preached this message when I was in Ghana last month and I felt led to bring it back to the church directly now we read from the book of Joshua and we know Joshua is a parallel to the book of Ephesians it's a book of possession it's a book of inheritance and we know that this theme of this convention is contending for the Fate so it's about fighting for the Fate fighting for your promise fighting for your inheritance and with the Branham just to lay a foundation and I'm not going to be too long with you because we have a number of things to do after service but ride with me for the time that we have together are you with me this morning from the message question and answers but the Branham said the promised land is to live in this land of Holy Spirit that's what this is all about is to live in the land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world so we are not just here to have church but we want to enter into another world Hallelujah that's what I'm looking for this weekend in the convention to be in another world I want to be transported to another place I want to be caught up in higher places I don't want to be in the humanistic realm I don't want to be coming looking for flesh I don't want to be bringing my problems and my struggles and no no no no no no no take me higher come and go higher with me come and fly where the Eagles Fly Fly Above your bills Fly Above your challenges fly into the land of the Holy Ghost stuff presence of the Angel of the Lord where all things are possible to them not believe can the Church Say Amen said here you have to come out of the condition that you've been in to come out to live in this promised land so you have to come out of what you're in come out of the hill backbiting come out of the all the canality come out of the up and the town and come out of the yo-yo lifestyle one day you're up one day you're down you don't know where you're standing because you are called to live in this land called Holy Spirit it's a good land it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's a land full of blessing in that land has access to your children in that land has access to your healing in that land has access to your deliverance in that land has access to adoption in that land has access to the seven ton of manifestation wait till those seven Thunders utter their voices to that group is connected to that land of the Holy Spirit not a land of word word only but word and spirit together mechanics and Dynamics together [Applause] Hallelujah come under the conditions you've been in and maybe for the last year you've been in a condition maybe for the last month you've been in a condition maybe for the last week you've been in a condition maybe the last 10 years you've been in a condition this is the call this morning to come up to your condition Hallelujah when you said to move out of your condition you'll pull your family with you you'll pull your connected ones with you oh yes yes yes yes you gotta make the move you gotta start to move and don't stay in the position you're in you gotta start to move out of your condition Hallelujah in other words pick up your bed and walk oh Hallelujah I know you've been crippled for a long time but the word this morning is saying pick up your bed and walk can the Church Say Amen remember the promise you shall receive power from an eye after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and that's the great promise and I believe this weekend even today somebody could get the Holy Ghost somebody could break free somebody could break past the sun barrier the sun barrier of your life the sound barrier of your depression the song Barry off your situation somebody who has been struggling with female condition could break past the sound barrier of that condition because you cannot enter the land of the Holy Ghost and stay the same way once you move into that place some Something's Gonna Change it'll change your cells it'll change your muscles it'll change your molecules it'll change your thinking it'll change your walk it'll change your talk and the church say Amen oh Hallelujah somebody give God a shout of praise [Applause] oh Hallelujah and Peter said at the promise I'm still reading I'm laying a foundation to the text the promise was made all down through the testament old and new you can find promising on up on up to that day of the Pentecost and they entered into the promise in the message Redemption my power but Abraham said and that's what God has did today he gives every one of you that wants it the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you got to go in and possess it that's all fight all the differences you see we're contending for the faith comes in fight out the differences Tear Down the Walls and get started in there and get it so there's a tearing down of walls that's part of our responsibility tearing on the walls of division tearing down the walls of Separation tearing down the Walls a problem not building up walls but tearing down walls not building up division but tearing omnivision not saying this group and that group but say in his group or you don't hear me this morning not this group that group it's his group it's one body it's one Lord It's one Faith it's one baptism it's one Holy Ghost it's one promise it's one Prophet it's one Highway to Heaven it's one Heaven it's one Earth and we shall reign on this Earth and there'll be no separation there'll be no walls there'll be no division it won't be those in this inspiration over here and those in that Doctrine over here we shall reign on the Earth can the Church Say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord possess it fight out the differences Tear Down the Walls and get

you know ever time to get your wife is now ever time to get an order it's now every time they clean up your life is no whoa whoa demons on the run you know demons trembling you know Hallelujah some say they wish they didn't come this morning to the service or no because they thought it was just an ordinary service Hallelujah them demons spirits and powers that sometimes attach themselves to you and they survive all these years but this morning we're turning up the heat we making the place seven times hotter we're not bothered by the fire we want it hotter because only Under Pressure only what is of God will last in no pressure oh you don't hear me this morning thanks again friends it's not difficult to manage things when things are easy and normal Hallmark of a great leader of a great manager of a great mother of her great father is when you're under pressure when you're on the Fire when you're under stress because that's the only time the real you to show up when they have money in the bank account they can buy what you want that you really you are showing up you know you see any money run out then you reel you will make himself known when I get caught in a mistake or situation and they didn't expect to get caught but now you're caught in a back against your wall and you have to answer and and the real you Solomon lie and say well it wasn't me I didn't if the pressure wasn't created he wouldn't expose what's there so life is designing a way to increase the pressure because what is transferable is only a character the measure of who you are not this just 16 elements but the real you has to be tried in the fire walk through the test walk through the trial and say though you see me yet still I trust him daughter skin worms destroyed his body I'm not gonna change for anybody I have no food on my table no but my testimony I'm not gonna compromise my testimony for anybody not for family not for friends not even for popularity not just to be a icon or class or to be different but I understand where I come from and where I'm going and that could only come when you have a true revelation of who you are and who call you because that speaks up a vertical relationship between you and God not you and the church not you and your husband wife children anybody else but you answering to God lord here I am send me because God wants to say unto you as my father sent me sauce and I you and that character in you must look like Jesus anybody in the house this morning I'm almost getting to my text could you take some more how are we doing this morning that was a rhetorical question if you could take some more remember when I was very very young grandmother give me some food and you say you want some more and it was not like they kind of want more like you could have an option he had to eat it she is sit down there and finish eating food no it's now young children and people have choice I know it was eat it because you will know how that reach here you ain't know the work and the struggle and there are no choices well I have feelings no no no you're ready for more take take some more because the sacrifice that went into putting it there they want to hear well I really like it so you know but no people do spoil they don't understand the sacrifice I saw a video recently somebody he actually he has his son in his kid go and look outside and look at the tree and see if you see money growing on it because you don't seem to understand the effort and he sacrifice to provide for the house that you feel you have a right to say a certain things and do certain things it's a balance but but he children today different from 10 15 20 30 40 years ago it's a level of ungratefulness and entitlement I saw a video some time ago of a young lady who I try to understand if it's real or not because they're trying to because to me it sounds so mental and she said she wants to sue her parents better punch for bringing her into the world because she never asked to be here so I tried to you know they always say the match that Madison I tend to understand at what point was the parents supposed to consult her about conceiving her and what where was this supposed So when you say when heavy prophecy the world is becoming totally insane you don't have to look too far to see that you know when children want to sue their parents for disciplining them and when you dig deeper the discipline is to bring you into subjection and into character and to avoid mistakes and failure but Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft locked up in the heart of man you know that everybody is a sinner witchcraft rebelling against parents rebelling against order rebelling against but this is how I am and the devil has Twisted minds and you see it through technology through all these things to zap you to distract you from God because they have smaller Gods lower class G's and we'll get to it in the scripture we choose you to stay whom you will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord not in my house not in my house not in my house not in my house not in my house Hallelujah we need Christians who will take a stand you realize how much people are taking a stand for all kind of things now people taking stand for what they believe they can stand for their conviction this is always supposed to be and we want our rights and we want this in them show me some Christians who fighting for their conviction fighting for the right to be holy the right to be pure the right to say I'm a Christian I don't need to dress like the world I don't need to conform like the world I don't need to drink like I don't need to smoke like I don't need to put on makeup like the world I don't need to be worldly because I know who I am and whose I am can the Church Say Amen in the same message Redemption my power but he didn't say no I'll go in and sweep it all out and build you up some nice cities and set you down on Easy Street he doesn't do it that way so the prophet is saying God will come and make up your bed in the morning you know you wake up in the morning Lord when I get the bloody where's the wash no it doesn't work like that he said he doesn't go and sweep it all out and build you up some nice seat and set you down in this easy street he doesn't do it that way he gives it to you and you got something to do so fathers you have something to do mothers you have something to do young people you have something to do unless you have something to do deacons you have something to do and everybody soldiers you have something to do it's a duty it's a responsibility it's a responsibility and it's a duty you're not a solar today well tomorrow I'm not really reporting it no you're Soldier all the time even when you're not in uniform it's still on duty you're just undercover is either in uniform or you're on the cover but you're still a soldier you're still on the orders you're still on the training can the Church Say Amen oh he's good enough to give you land and he's and he'd help you and be with you but go take it and if you are sick tonight crippled blind deaf dumb whatever you are go take it God said it was yours it's your possession God give it to you Hallelujah Blessed Be the name of the Lord I'll skip some of this because this is familiar territory to you and I really want to get to something to make sure it's in before we close out today's service and when you read Joshua 1 we read it send me this get it here quickly now after the death of Moses the silver of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all his people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river you fit is all the lands of the Hittites are not to the great sea toward the going on the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not feel thee nor forsake thee be strong enough for good courage for under this people shall thou divide for an inheritance a land which I swear under their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that domains observe to do according to all the law which Moses like servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that dominance Prosper with whatsoever thou goest Hallelujah hallelujah oh and that's the same scripture that applies us you know this law this message just promise that we have we are not supposed to depart from it from the left or to the right and we are supposed to have courage to stand to possess it and every place you put your foot that land is going to be your land can the Church Say Amen so let me get to my text we read from Joshua 24. and I just want to read the two verses again and then get back to the background for context so Joshua is speaking now now chapter 24 of Joshua is the last chapter of the Book of Joshua this is Joshua's going away message this is after many battles and victories many struggles much pain I'll rewind I'll just go to Joshua 24 and verse 1. if you have your Bibles you could just run through it with me as you build up to those verses that we're ready to start Joshua 21 verse 1 and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to shechem and called for the Elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for the officers and they presented themselves before God and I preached on part of this some time ago and I have some notes written here that when you look at bible characters in history many of them have different attributes but in the case of Joshua we never picked your Joshua as the man to stand up on a Sunday and give a sermon we knew Joshua as what a warrior a fighter are you for also against us they are not much opportunities of speeches you will see through scriptures with Joshua he was more of a boots on the ground type A Soldier a leader who knew how to run an operation he's a tactical Commander he was a general whose War Stories were told and retold but as his life started to wind down This Man of Action turned into a sort of spiritual guide maybe it was his understanding of the people always on easy hunch about what could happen when he was no longer around to lead them because he knew he was about to go or the simple fact that those he had shared in the Glory Days of the Canaanite Camp were feeling away just like he was now Joshua was an older man he must have known that as he and his comrades left this world the memories of God's wonders May slowly fade replaced by the everyday noise of life and the influence of the Canaanites around them and the easy pull of the world young people would star them down a slippery slope away from God and there Joshua stood calling for the people on the edge looking back I could imagine on a life well lived his purpose fulfilled God had given him a job to do and he did it when Moses passed on Joshua had picked up the torch bravely stepping up to God's challenge the Book of Joshua his life's Testament was proof of his faithfulness as he faced his own mortality he was Secure in the knowledge that he had made the right choice to serve the Lord his journey was over but his legacy would live on his only wish his only desire his only prayer was for the people to stay true to the path that he had set out on together and he wanted to remind them to encourage them to push them to keep on going and that's what I'm doing this morning trying to remind you to encourage you to push you to keep going the last three chapters of Joshua gives us a glimpse of his role in chapter 22 it was a farewell speech to the tribes of Reuben God and manager as they were about to set off across Jordan he brought up the past and urged them to stick to the rules set by Moses in chapter 23 it's a call to action to the Future Leaders and you can read it the people who would take over after he was gone it echoed the sentiments of his earlier sermon but with extra wisdom for those who would take up the mantle of leadership and finally in this chapter 24 Joshua would give one last sermon one last encouragement one last message to the entire assembly at shechem not long before he would Breathe his last breath Joshua the soldier turned preacher still leading his people right to the very end he stood and he brought the people to shechem and shechem is interesting it's more than a dot in a map it's a place of decision a place of Destiny it was a place that held special meaning and the backdrop of one of the most important some of the most important events in Scripture like a crossroad in a novel where characters come to find their purpose Joshua brought the people to a special place if we go back in Genesis shechem was the place when Abraham would become Abraham God shows up and made a promise and Abraham Builds an altar so shechem the promise was laid from Abraham to Abraham when Joseph was sold into slavery it was a chicken and the amazing thing is that even though Joseph ends up in prison and he told them to when you're going back you remember you say carry my bones with you Joseph was buried at shechem so Joshua had gathered the people at this place of great spiritual significance and I come full circle to begin to give his last address can the church see amen Joshua 24 and verse 2 and Joshua said unto all the people thus say the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flooding all time even Terror the father of Abraham and the father of Naco and they served other gods and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of Canaan and multiply this seed and gave him Isaac and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Isa Mount zero to possess it but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt and I sent Moses also an Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to that which I did among them and after what I brought you out in other words God is speaking to Joshua to show them what I've taken you through in other words you have a reason to be happy you have a reason to Rejoice because I've been taking you through some stuff for your whole life and verse 16 I brought your fathers out of Egypt and he came unto the Sea and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers were chariots and Horsepen unto the Red Sea and when they Cried unto the Lord he put Darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought to Sea upon them and cover them and your eyes have seen what have done in Egypt and he dwelt in the wilderness a long season and I brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that he might possess their land and I destroyed them from before you arose and Ward against Israel and sent and called Balaam the son of beer to curse you you see how much stuff they went through but I would not hearken unto bailam therefore he blessed you still so I delivered you out of his hand and you went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of Jericho fought against you the amorites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the gurga sites the heavy and the jebicides and I delivered them into your hand and I send a hornet before you with drape them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword it wasn't your strength it wasn't your ability nor would I bow can I get some money monitors please and I gave you get I have given you a land for which he did not labor and cities which he built not and he dwell in them and of The Vineyards and Olivier Alias which he planted not do you eat now after all of that Josh what challenges the people know therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and servedo Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of yamorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house he will serve the Lord now I want this to look at this closely friends this choice being presented to the people was not a choice between serve God or serve the devil I want to look at his choice a little closely he said choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the New Gods of the amorites in other words Joshua was challenging the people to see if they really want God and the challenge is to the church under the young people do you really want God in other words you could go back to your backs in ways in sin if you want that or you can even save the new gods which is having a form of godliness so people have given up the all gods they're not smoking they're not drinking they're not any word but they're in church serving New Gods Joshua was testing them and this is a challenge I'm presenting to you Church you're scared long you're not saving the old God but in your heart there's a new God so you have a choice this morning Joshua chew it out he wants to know who really serious let me read it one more time he said no therefore hear the Lord because that's a problem people don't have fear for the Lord because fear brings respects the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so he said fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth if you know better do better if you know better live better if you know better act better serving in sincerity and in truth and put away the Gods put away these styles put away Fashions put away these cigarettes put a very lion put a very fornication but the very adultery but already pornography but already felt 11 put a very well in music put it away he said put away the gods with your father served on the other side of the flood Egypt in other words in Egypt it were bats living in Egypt but a George he said your father served Gods when they were in Egypt and the others had to be flood put them away and serve the Lord and he said to them now in verse 15 I want you to dial it in nowhere because this is the problem in the message and if it seem evil unto you have a problem with serving the lord fools you this day whom he will serve whether the gods your father who were just just tell all these new gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell these gods of social media these gods of Christian music are not really Christian these gods of associations that is not that they were an airing and makeup and pants but it is in their heart they're really going to hell still it's a new form of God but it's still not the true God and Joshua declares publicly but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord so what Josh what did he presented three options the gods of your past so when people backslide they already backside into the gods of the past all these new gods that take a bit of time because watching a set of movies on Netflix watching us as a TV well and not any world I'm not drinking and not smoking and not fornicating but this is a new God of the land and who you dwell but you're still not giving the attention to God so where you really want to be at this morning you want to go back from where you came in the world you want to play games in church or you want to leave it all behind and serve the Lord it's a thought-provoking situation you know because many will miss it not because they were living in the world no they left that but these new gods are the new problem the gods that take up your time to your car pray you know you're supposed to pray you left you always didn't pray but now you're in church and you're supposed to be praying but you're not praying because you're serving New Gods anybody with me on the outside you'll know you're not looking like the world but on the inside is worldly music Willie desires will the affections will the operation that's why the Bible say having a form of godliness but denying the power I hope this helps somebody you know because God is not going to help you and bless you if you don't make a choice God is not choosing for you so Joshua is saying it's your choice choose you today who you will serve you love the world to come any message but you still have the world in you and the reality is by the Clarence Satan is smart he know he can present a cigarette to you he know he can present alcohol to you but he will find New Gods unlimited New Gods but upon you present this this this distraction this thing and and all it do is taking away your focus we will serve the Lord where are you standing this morning in the message choosing of a bride but Abraham said in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose our way that we want to live and in the product of your life is a choice and you can't blame anybody about it education is a choice I always say people go to school for five years and leave it nothing who's the blame and for everybody who have an excuse I could show you somebody who had it worse who because they chose to do it did it so I can accept excuses somebody wrote a book the book of excuses you know and they have almost every possible excuse in that book but you know God has no excuses accept no excuses when Moses stood and said talk I can't write a car email he said when it done let me know when you finish because you're still going because for everything you say a car do and a car doing a car do when you finish write it all down burn it afterwards because you're still going you still have to live like a Christian after all is said and done it's a choice you have to choose to be a Christian you have to choose a dress like a Christian live like a Christian act like a Christian forgiveness is a choice love is a choice worship is a choice prayer is a choice December Branham we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated that's a choice we have that's a prophet's words right and wrong is a choice every man every woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try to live right or not live right it's a choice goes on your Eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight today some of you will make that choice of where you'll spend eternity before the service Ends Tonight there'll be one time and if you turn God down many times there'll be one time you'll turn him down the last time there's a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman boy or girl to step across that line for there's no return when you step across that deadline so today tonight it may be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity friends it's a choice you can choose to save or you can choose suspend it's your choice you can choose the lead or you can choose to follow you could choose to teach or you can choose to learn you could choose to create or you could choose to consume you could choose to give or you could just choose to receive you could choose to forgive or you could choose to hold a grudge it's your choice no matter service you have to ever drop your odds drop your oils drop your people choose to renew it the renewing odds and grudges that they can't remember why they have the alternate they can't remember why they can't talk to somebody but it's a choice you could choose to take risks or to stay safe you could choose to embrace change or to remain static you could choose to listen or to ignore you could choose to be proactive or reactive you could choose to ask for help or you could choose a struggle alone you can choose a share or you could choose to keep things to yourself yourselves to work or you can choose to stay home and be lazy it's a choice you could choose to accept responsibility or deny responsibility you could choose a trust or doubt you can choose to compliment or criticize but Abraham say if you have nothing good to say stay quiet now say something nice say something kind but no some people they can't do that and they make a choice to say whatever comes to their mind you could choose to be optimistic or you could choose to be pessimistic listen nobody has these switch to control that in you you know it's your choice so you cannot say it's because so and so happen it's why I saw this morning it is still your choice it is still your choice you could choose to admit mistakes and say I was wrong I'm sorry or you could deny them or Justify them which is what most of us do we don't want to admit be wrong we have a reason well I hear Indian or but the reason why I did it so is because I saw and yet you're not willing to because you can't grow and change if you're not willing to admit that I made a messed up I consider myself an epic failure and I'm not negative or pessimistic about it but feel as a part of life every day I feel and every day I'm making mistake but God's grace keep picking me up his grace keep picking me up his grace keep picking me up and if you approach life because in this human journey is a life full of stumbling when a child for a long trying to learn to walk he don't get I really depressed yes I fall long for two days here try to walk again curl up on the bed because he fall along no he just get back up and fallen again get back up for a long game until after already get his balance better and then walk start to turn to thing and then he can't even catch them you they're trying to keep up with them because they know when from that to walking to run into running away but they have dealt with failure and we sing the song We Fall Down but we get up so how hard is it to say you know what I made a mistake and I want to repent I want to make things right I don't want to go back into that mistake again that's what brother Brandon said when uh a pig fall in the mud he said wait no it's a long time I feel this mud boy I forget I forget all this what is a feeling though but when I when alarm fall in the mud he's gonna cry because you don't want to be in that condition so the issue's not falling down to people fall along and when they feel the monster they say oh boy but if you fall in the mud and you recognize this is not for me then your heart saying pray for me encouragement somebody promise somebody hold me are fighting back I try my I don't want to say that that's a choice you could choose to take responsibilities and many many fathers have to take responsibilities take responsibility many mothers have to accept responsibility children have to take responsibility because if you can't admit you could do better something wrong with you because we could all do better could we do more for the Lord could we do more for each other if the answer is yes then what's holding us back it's a choice it's because we choose to do other things that don't create value in the economy of God can the Church Say Amen you could choose to be unkind or unkind but Madam taught us this you could choose to fight or flee you could choose to be patient or impatient you could choose to encourage or discourage you could choose to heal you know you could give word to somebody that will create healing or you could choose to hurt somebody you could choose to build up or you could choose to tear down you could choose to live for today or plan for tomorrow what did the prophet teach us live as if God is coming now but plan for 20 years you could choose a sure gratitude or ingratitude half of the people who complain and they didn't even thank God for waking them up this morning and the Bible says in everything give him thanks that's a choice to be grateful Lord I Thank you is just a hundred dollars I have but thank you for giving me the hundred dollars I'm so thankful now guys man how to use it your whole perspective on life changes it's a choice because the moment you complain about this complaining we can see faith I know there's nothing you cannot for Joy thing but you know why I'm teaching this because this weekend is a choice you get what you expect onto this weekend and your choice but the effort the prayer the sacrifice and you make towards this convention a choice to be honest or dishonest do you really want to serve God do you really want to have a testimony do you really believe this message you really believe your scripture do you really believe that you're supposed to come here me do you believe sister they're not supposed to cut you here do you believe in us because we listen to worldly music are you being honest with yourself are you being real with yourself because it's a choice and if your behavior is something else and it means you're already not being honest it's your choice to love or to eat it's your choice to be present in the house of the Lord or to be absent it's your choice people do what they want to do it's your choice to be mentored to take advice or take encouragement or to do your own thing it is your choice to persevere or to quit it is your choice to be selfish or selfless and as we heard by the all who preach months ago it is your choice to live and again or live in the gap it is your choice to live in negativity or to say you know what I'm going to be positive can the Church Say Amen Abraham chose to obey God's command to leave his homeland and to travel to an unknown Place Noah chose to build an ark in obedience to God's instructions despite the mocking of everybody around him Moses chose identified with the Hebrews rather than enjoy the Comforts of Pharaoh's Palace Joshua made a decision to serve God stating us for me and my house we will serve the Lord Caleb trusted in God's promise and encouraged the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan despite the Giants root she made a choice to stay with her mother-in-law Naomi after her husband died even when it would have been easier to return to her own people David decided to spare King Saul's life twice even though Saul was trying to kill him David could have killed so but he spear him that once twice and he knew he was out to get him that was David's choice Jonathan chose to befriend David and protected him from Saul despite the risk on his own life Solomon made a choice to choose wisdom when God said take whatever you want whatever they want to give it to you and what was Solomon's Choice he chose wisdom and God blessed him with Wealth Beyond his measure what do you choose this morning Elijah chose to confront the prophets of Val alone trusting God to answer my fire it was his choice Elisha chose to follow Elijah and serve him leaving his life behind him it was a choice Nehemiah chose to return to Jerusalem to lead the rebuilding of the city walls despite being in a comfortable position in Persia the Hebrew boys their jaws to walk into the fiery furnace because they didn't want a bow Town whom do you want to choose this morning Esther risk it all and chose the risk of life and say if I perish I perish but I'm going to see the King Daniel he made a choice to not defile himself with the King's food and wine choosing to honor God's laws that was his choice oh hallelujah hallelujah Mary she made a choice she said be it unto me according to Thy word when the angel Gabriel came to her that was her choice what is your choice Peter chose to follow Jesus when he was called leaving his fishing nets and his fishing business behind him that was his choice what is your choice that's a marathon woman she chose to believe Jesus and then she chose to tell everybody come see a man can the church say Amen Paul decided to follow Jesus after encountering him on the road to Damascus can the church say Amen young people what is your choice Church what is your choice choose you this day whom you will serve and not all choices in scripture are good choices Cain made a choice to kill his brother Lot's wife we are preaching us many times it was a choice she wasn't forced nobody put a gun to her head and say look back she chose to look back when she was instructed to whatever you do don't look back but she made a choice oh God help us choice to hide in his heart econ after the Battle of Jericho we preached about that before he made a choice Joshua do not touch anything leave the worldly Styles leave the worldly Goods leave the worldly dresses leave the world in make up leave it all behind call it your cursed things he couldn't made a choice to bring gold from Jericho into his tent and cause lives as they lost a battle against I it was a choice Samson was told to not talk about your strength he made a choice and he lost his eyes Saul was taught to kill all your malachites but he chose the spare King IGA and the best of the livestock can the Church Say Amen Ahab made a choice to marry Jezebel and worshiper and Lead Israel into idolatry through scripture by the George's choices you know you could choose to be healthy or you could choose to be unhealthy you could choose to be sad you could choose to be happy you could choose to be a warrior or you could choose to be a warrior it's your choice Judas Iscariot made a choice brother Clarence to betray Jesus nobody forced him I want to get this none of the character you read who did positive or negative anybody forced them it was their choice ananias and Sapphira you know they volunteered nobody tell them go and do what they don't know they offered to do it it was their choice and then they chose to lie in front of Peter it was their choice didn't have to lie pilot had a choice he could have given into the Crow's demand give us Barabbas give us Jesus give us and he made a choice the Rich Young Ruler he made a choice you know what it is to be able to meet Jesus and talk to Jesus and have a conversation with Jesus the musician could begin to get ready I'm not going to be too much longer and the Rich Young Ruler about a black man had the opportunity to walk up to Jesus and have a conversation with Jesus and he asked the question good Master what what must I do to get it in what what what what luck I yet I followed all the Commandments I've done everything to my youth and he had reason and his great fantastic his and Jesus looked past his words past his face past what he was wearing looked into his heart and he gave him a choice he didn't give him a gift he give him a choice he said go sell all you have and give it away and that young man left sad and Jesus looked at him sorrowful and he gave him a choice and he was unable to make the right choice Esau gave up his Birthright for a plate of food that was his choice in a message by faith Moses but Madam said when I see a woman coming down the street with a long skirt and her hair done up neatly and a decent looking dress on and I see another young lady maybe the same age with a little pair of shorts on she may be in looks twice as pretty as a woman with a long hair according to the looking of the world but I'll take my side with a girl that's just like a Christian though they would be laughing at her and calling her fanatic yet I'll take my side she may not be as pretty as the other girl featurely but she sees something by faith she sees him who is invisible who is guiding her life when I see a man on the job being called Deacon or preacher or fanatic because he refuses to smoke and to drink beer and to go to the dances like the rest of them and he's called a fanatic my heart goes out for him he is my brother down in this Egypt soil that makes our heart long to embrace and say Brothers we are pilgrims and strangers of this land and I long to fellowship with you Moses had to make a choice Choosing by faith how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter how many young men would have jumped at the opportunity that Moses had to enjoy all the pleasures and the glamor of the world to become the king of Egypt to have the whole world at his feet what a foolish thing that a young man of his day must have taught when Moses chose to take his place with The Afflicted and the suffering people of God why did he do it by faith when he lifted up his eyes he looked beyond the glamor of this world he looked beyond the pleasure of sin and the Bible said he endured us seeing him who was Invisible by feet he made a choice to serve that God regardless of what took place says it has not changed many of us could go to what we would call a better building we could enjoy maybe the fellowship and pleasure of sitting in a better Pew we might be more popular to drink and to smoke and to dress and to act like the world but what's the matter you have lifted up your eyes and by faith you see him who is invisible and you took your stand with the rejected and so-called Holy Rollers of the day for by faith we see him who is invisible choosing to suffer the persecutions and The Afflicted I wouldn't say to people like this should choose to be afflicted I don't say that you should choose suffering it would not be the human thing to do but if suffering lays in the path of Duty then let's take it as it comes I don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you I wouldn't want you to say different things I belong to a church that doesn't believe and so and so and think that I won't say for you to get out here and Carry On and do something that was Radical I wouldn't want you to do that so that somebody would say that you are fanatic you bring it on yourself but if it lays in the path of your duty towards God let the world see what they want to see you live on you make a choice every man and woman has to make this what if Pharaoh could have saw what Moses saw he saw the sufferings of the people he knew what the price was to pay but by faith he chose it rather than to have the pleasures of sin there's maybe a little young lady sitting here as glamorous young woman the world would like to say to you do thus and thus you are beautiful your body is pretty shape you should show that but my sister raise up your eyes and look beyond that to him and set it an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man if the men are the people in your community if the woman that you associate with said cut that long hair off it would be cooler I'm reading the prophet's words it would be this that or the other or it would be better don't you listen to that you lift up your eyes and by faith saw him that said the woman's hairs are glory and she shall not cut it if they say it'll be popular you will stand in better with your job or with your boss if you take a sociable drink or if you would smoke cigarettes like the rest of the woman or you would stand in more social in your neighborhood but if it raise your eyes look to him who said defiled his body and I will destroy it by faith we believe those things it's nothing that you've seen it's something you believe by faith and in this Faith walk there comes a time when there has to be a choice everybody's still with me I'm almost finished I want to drive this home friends because if you want to get the Holy Ghost and you want your breakthrough it is very much I read the quote your Eternal destination is a choice choose you today Young Brother young sister who you will serve let me that sad mistake that we make a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose things that would be better and I'm preachers before because a lot the Bible said righteous lot was vaccine in spirit in the book of Peter with the Abomination and lots he was strong enough to withstand the environment but his wife wasn't strong enough his children were not strong enough and the decision the choice he made was not just impacting his own life it destroyed his family so the choice you make is not just about you friends there are others who are depending on you making the right choice and that's why I challenge your fathers challenge the mothers challenge the leaders they are second order consequences of the choices you make that's why Joshua could stand and say as for me and my house I am taking responsibility not just for me but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord in the message choosing of a bride and many time men and women hear God's truth and see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it in other words they don't really want to hate there's some other reason there's some of the choosing that they have than to face up the truth and facts therefore The Heirs can be close to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you this is a 1965 my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then Elijah gave them a choice you remember just before the fire came he said why Stan you hold why hold you between two decisions your one foot in church your other foot in the world you're one foot in the old gods the other foot in the new gods and then don't have a firm conviction that I want to serve the Lord and it's embarrassing when parents can't take a stand because the children take the lead off of that either right or is wrong [Music] if God is God serve him with all your heart with all your mind without your soul with all that in you and God will honor that he will bless that he will reward you for it [Music] Elijah gave them a choice choose you this day whom you will serve if God be God serve him but if God be God serve him if the airing on your makeup and the costume money pornography and the sex and the alcohol and the music and this thing if you want I will go but if you want God if you want Redemption if you want Deliverance if you want eternal life if you want to oh come on now somebody help him if you want the peace that's a passive understanding Jesus my peace I give to you my love is for you my reward is for you my kingdom is for you verse 16 of Acts of Joshua 24. and the people answered him so Joshua presented a choice to them to see all you really want this message you really want this gospel you really want to be a Christian choose you this day the all God's choose where you come from the Baptist Church he did whatever it was you want to go back there or you want to live in this I'm a right world and adapt to their foolishness so in verse 16 the people respond and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God here it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and praise and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people whom through we passed and the Lord drave out from before since the people talking even the Amorite was dwelled in the land therefore will we also serve the Lord for he is our God so Joshua listens to that response because the response sounded good it's a nice answer but Joshua wasn't buying it words or they're talking nice well you're talking some quotes and scriptures and it's the Lord who took me through but I really want to get along into your heart so verse 19 Joshua probes God gave us the probe of the Holy Ghost today to see what really in your heart because you are who you are when you are alone you are you you are when the Allah Minister because they never answer because they were in the presence of Joshua they were in the presence of church so they were given a nice answer so he wants to go deeper and Joshua said to the people now I want you to remember their response let me read it one more time they choose you they respond by saying God forbid that we should forsake the Lord and serve other gods and they go to this whole thing it was the Lord who took us and Josh was in the verse 13 he cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if he forsake the Lord and serve strange gods strange gods Gods we can't identify everybody have a strange God in the house sometimes your job is our God your car is a God the internet is a God and movies are God a movie star people following on social media rappers and R B singers strange gods who inspires me who inspires you strange gods where you get it from you're following this one you're following this one that one is a hero new trends strange Gods he said if you forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he had done you good so Joshua's problem with the Clarence if you already really want to have a time this convention if all you really want to break up the fallow ground if you really want the windows of Heaven to open he said If my people will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then they will hear from Heaven if that's the kind of people that you are and the people said unto Joshua verse 21 knee but we will serve the Lord so they come with another testimony by the currents after the hearing that they're saying we are more committed is anybody committed to serving the lord anybody in the house committed they said well no because that means a lot that that means a lot if you're really serious if you're not serious I can't force you to be serious but if you're already serious about serving the law is anybody really serious about serving the lord because that is where the question that he was challenging on if you're really serious about this thing he said because if you're not serious God will kill you he will judge you he will strike you down that's what Josh was saying to the people if you forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods knowing what he has done for you he will turn unto you hood and consume you after that he had done you good hasn't he done you good hasn't he taken yours in a married clay hasn't he put your foot on a rock to stay let's Cast Away the strange gods I'll ask the question again is there anybody serious about serving the lord because as for me and my house we will serve the Lord [Music] don't make that statement lightly now don't just say it because it's a thing to say in this service because God will hold you to this we're going to get it to the next verse God will hold you to this thing now it's a contract it's a contract so if you don't really mean it check yourself check your heart check your life check your declaration do you really want to serve the Lord do you really want to be a Christian do you really want to give it all up and surrender do you really want the Holy Ghost do you really want Holiness and Purity and Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness broadly kindness do you really want this and the benefits that come with this like your family being set free if that is what you want then let him know let him know that's what you want Jesus is on the main line you could tell him what you want Joshua wasn't as trying for them to come to an understanding of it he wanted them to make a declaration you have to say it I won this thing he said you really want to serve the Lord he said we will serve the Lord verse 21 and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord if you are serious this morning I want you to lift your hand and say I will serve the Lord I want you to say it one more time I will serve the Lord only the serious if you're not serious you don't need to participate in this thing if you're not serious you could go downstairs if you're not serious you could leave but if you're if you're really really serious I want you to make this statement again I will serve the Lord I want to say it one more time I will serve the Lord verse 22 and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves in other words you are saying it in the presence of yourselves you are now holding each other accountable to that statement you just made that I will serve the Lord oh God [Music] don't say it if you don't mean it but it is say that they really mean and I will serve the Lord he said you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses so do we have any Witnesses in the house this is a different kind of service now so I'm singing I I'm gonna serve the Lord and I'm a witness do we have any Witnesses in the house you're witnessing for your brother in other words I see but the answer me making a statement I'm his witness is my witness I'm your witness we are witnesses to each other that we are going to serve the Lord we are witnesses to each other that we are making a choice to turn back the strange Gods to throw away the filthy garments to throw away the ways of the flesh to put under our feet every unclean Spirit every doubt every unbelief in the mighty name of Jesus Christ [Music] we are contending for the faith we are fighting for every inch of ground we are taken back this is the first wave of the attack we will serve the Lord [Applause] [Applause] I'm almost done for this 22. you can replace something very Softly and Josh was sending to the people and Joshua that type of the Holy Ghost ye are witnesses against yourself in other words by the judge I'm counting on me to help hold me accountable and I'm Gonna Keep you accountable we Are Witnesses against ourselves iron sharpening iron because we have to make this thing together I'm not leaving nobody behind I'm not leaving nobody behind we're taking everybody with us as to me and my house we will serve the Lord your family has got to come I'm gonna help you but you got to help me you got to help your brother next to you you got to have your sister next to you but we will serve the Lord and I'm your witness and you are my witness so I'll pray for you but I need you to pray for me and I need to pray for your sister I don't need to pray for your brother [Applause] [Music] thank you verse 22. and Joshua said unto the people hear Witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses and I can declare this morning I am a witness now therefore in verse 23 put away said he the strange gods which are among you [Music] and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel I want you to catch this here it's a big point in a small verse they made a declaration he said you are witnesses but he knew that their statement was the first step of the way that there were still issues in their lives that had to be addressed so after the statement and after the fact that they agreed and after the fact that they had an understanding he said no therefore let's fix the issues he said put away the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve and his voice will we obey [Music] verse 25 so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem in that place in that place where Abraham became Abraham in that place where Joseph was sold to slavery in that place where his bones were buried Josh was stood on that sacred proud and made a covenant with his people [Music] thank you and Joshua wrote these words in the book of The Law of God and took a great Stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and Joshua said unto all the people behold this Stone shall be a witness unto us for it have heard all the words of the Lord which he speak unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your God [Music] so Joshua was putting a claws inside the claws he said you declared it we witnessed it but he said the stone here also heard it these benches also heard it this altar also heard it oh God you don't hear me this morning this building heard it and if if we don't praise God then the rocks will cry out if we don't praise God the benches will cry out [Music] [Applause] so not only are your brothers and sisters Witnesses but the benches the stones this ground this Tabernacle is a witness of your declaration that you will serve the Lord it will stand as a rebuke to you if you walk away but to you who are hungry it will stand as a reminder of the Covenant that we made this day [Music] so Joshua let the people depart every man under his inheritance and church I'm finished it's time for me to depart it's time for you to depart under your individual inheritance you know the land we studied at the beginning is a land of holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost Land that's your inheritance so I want to invite you for a few minutes you want to rededicate your heart you want to conjugate your life we are going into the convention you have made a declaration you have made a choice talk to your God for a few minutes and pray pray for your family pray for the church pray for the pastor pray for the ministers pray for the backsliders who will come to the convention pray
