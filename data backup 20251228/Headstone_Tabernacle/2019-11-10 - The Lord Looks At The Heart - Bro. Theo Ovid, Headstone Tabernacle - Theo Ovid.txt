welcome this morning that has some time now god bless each and every one of you so good to be here we have some guests among us we announce them right after the service but this time we want to go straight to the scriptures you want to look at First Samuel chapter 16 one read from verse 1 to 13 I wanna read one verse in Proverbs 23 wanna read verse 7 and Acts chapter 13 wanna read verse 21 to 22 the title of the message this morning is that the Lord looks at the heart there's a title this morning the Lord looks at the heart this is for Samuel 16 God speaking to his prophet Samuel and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will go mourned for soil Sina rejected him from reigning over Israel fiddling horn with oil and go I will send me to Jesse the better might fire provided me a king among his sons Samuel said can I go it's all here he will kill me and the Lord said take a heifer D&C I am come to sacrifice to the Lord and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will surely what dole shall do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I shall name on dizzy and Samuel did that which the Lord speak and came to Bethlehem and the ends of the tongue tremble at his comin and said come is all peaceably and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called him that a sacrifice to give the pass when they were come he looked on Ilya and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him and the Lord said of this Samuel look not on his countenance no on the height of his stature because I refused him for the Lord see it not as man see it for man look at at the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and then Jesse called a banana and made him pass before Samuel and the loss and he said neither had the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shamah to pass by he said neither the Lord chosen this again Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had not chosen these Samuel 7 - Jesse idea I hear all alike he said there is room in it yet the youngest and be holy keep at the Sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse 7 fetch him for we will not sit down Jerry Camilla and he sent and brought him and he was a ruddy and with a beautiful countenance and good little look at and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama on a little proverbs chapter 23 verse 7 safe as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink said he to thee but with his heart is not with thee last scripture reading from Acts chapter 13 verse 21 and afterwards talked about Israel there is I had a king and God given to them so listen of cysts a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them Diglett to be their king to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which I'll fulfill all my will let's pray father we thank you for your written word and only you could bring the context and the inspiration behind this tonight this morning and I pray just speak to us and and keep me behind a cross and hiding be on Calvary's cross and speak the air tell people this morning in Jesus name I ask at a man you will be seated it's such a blessing to be here to be alive to be in health to be in good strength that you could raise your hand and worship the Lord you didn't come here to me to see me to come here in the presence if you come in the presidency when I commit respects you want to commit honor you want to come with tons given you want to come with gratefulness in your heart for the privilege to be here how much people who have gone to hell home be pabulum lose on that chance right now this morning would have wish to take up your seat this morning they don't even stand a chance some people out in hospital the kaity talk the chance has gone they missed the turn and they don't have a chance to reboot and come back to say I'm sorry forgive me I want to serve you no chance they come on and we are a responsibility that they are witness of Jesus Christ we have a be responsibility to testify about the Lord because ready or not you have to meet him let me say it again ready or not you have to meet him the voice of God will call all the dead not just Christensen or every band that dare have to be called talk comforted in this body Oh hallelujah better find out why they oughta why your makeup put you on this earth it's a reason why I call you there's a reason why you're here this morning okay so the title is the Lord looks on the heart and I want to share some things with you that a feel or want you with the church to know by the grace of God there's a pressure on the people today and that pressure has no limitation or any denominational lines it has no age line it has no respect of persons it son young it's on all it's on good it's on bad it's on everybody PR e dashes you re no limitations we are live in an erotic age nervous tension everybody's recent here going here going nowhere it's just the kind of age and I see people speed and overtake man boom boom boom and then Here Come in traffic and the speed I wish to overtake your sweater Gordon they reach and come back already and you see them two cars ahead right there you see what is the first and I know this church would be plagued with it as everywhere is big with it the tabernacle is plagued with it the whole world it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry get up and wait nervous tension the wife says something on the contrary you want to fly off Tempah husband sees something you put your foot and tell him think it'll get in you know husband I don't want always with you go out there wife I'm so nervous what's the matter it's a tension element it will make the poor that way and together this tension and the results of it results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place that's what pressure make people do pressure this pressure she's the atmosphere such spirit does the atmosphere is something that prescient people make the husband fly loose may the White Fang loosen and act the wrong way and see the wrong thing let's continue praise the Lord that's right know it will make the poor out that way it will make the middle class side that way is they'll make the rich act that way it will make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good art gallery it make the good act that way because it's a tense is a steam built up and it got to blowed somewhere see a bloody boiler up you have to let off the steam now everybody is guilty of it I am guilty you all are guilty we all do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there's an excess of pressure built up today isn't that right and I believe he said is the enemy coming down I believe it's the devil so it's the devil job to put pressure on you that you're acting wrongly because you don't want you at the right way and think the right thoughts and speak the right words he doesn't want that he wants you to be constantly under pressure so when you're thinking this come true and something else and it's something else and you're frustrated and when you when you see it frustrates you so he loves that he smile whenever it that will come on come on I'm so frustrated they were getting a pat on your shoulder on rubble here down he said come on no you knew you know you were first treated and you're not even my little depressed you that's the next thing to know because when you depressed off you fall in a hole you don't want to see nobody you're gonna talk to nobody you're gonna get off your bed because I depressed I sit on you know all that is Lucy firing on loose on the earth or Lucifer people expose him this morning you fed up you're frustrated and no no no don't say that no he gets in a word this morning or chlorine Oh God what if the woman oh where was fed up she didn't even know what telling her she had or glory to God a life was messed up she had four men the one she living it was reserves but God saw something inside that woman because and Jesus after her that Jesus could wait and her because God doesn't look as man look goddess look at the heart he does a completely different so don't come with your own think in this morning or give the Lord a shout or give the Lord some praise in this morning I don't care what your neighbor say about you I don't care what your wife say about you I don't care what your husband say about you it is what God say about you Nick the devil would go aboard like a Roman lion and last days he would get you under pressure hurrying over something and you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you're sat down and think it over how much marriages were a whole today if people think over the choice of their wife and pray about it how much relationships would have been so different if they had sought the Lord and get that I answer from God but depression school they have this peer pressure got this one our money like a time of school and tell me say I want to be a drug lord see that's the plenty money and Oscar is dead there is that build up nice and core from you know there is very young to it you watch me I missing someone again making decisions that you would make if you sit down and think it over but God has the answer and that is what we want to take the answer now in the Old Testament there was a time when a man could build pressure up there and there was a time when he done something wrong under pressure and if he shed innocent blood and he was on the run as soon as that man was killed him wrong he did the man he did wrong to some of the people would hunt him and if they found him they would kill him because in those days was good for tute either life or life and there was the place where the man couldn't stop here to run if he done something accidentally of course people wouldn't believe it I was deer I knew something in one felony knife and nobody believed something accidentally the relatives or this man or woman whoever it was was that continent I fight for - that's a bit II lived and he couldn't stop nowhere he was the fugitive he didn't know what to do he was on the run and the very type of the day I seen that's calling so much pressure we are on the run that's the matter with the world knowing the Commons alone is at hand the pressure is building up they're on the run rural house gambling luxury sin immoral decay they give vent listen to the television dirty jokes they invent the only run they I want the face of the world in a parameter and affliction and some comedian cracking jokes and you laughing laughing after one UK laugh you laughing as long as the comedian given talk you laugh and after that you still in trouble Alleluia they know something is fittin to take place the world speaks of it something is fixing to take place so in the Old Testament God seen in some of this trouble was accidentally done so if you're innocent and not guilty God makes a way for you if a man killed a man just deliberately and premeditated he was lost he could not come into this place but if he did accidentally he didn't mean to do it there was a City of Refuge God Himself set that up a City of Refuge that you could run and be safe could we get a lot of shout hallelujah and one of those place was Rama Gillian four places just replace the cities of refuge now the people could come into the city of refuge if they accidentally did something wrong he didn't mean to he would come to the city of refuge go to the gate the keyboard asking why you come in that was his idea of coming and then his case was pleaded and his case was pleaded at the kid and a man found to be innocent he did not willfully and the man was taken to the city as a place of refuge then the enemy could not get him and when God said have a place you could hide no enemy could get you I'm not talking about your thoughts I'm not talking about your ideas I'm talking about what God set up he has set up a way of escape he has set up a place of refuge where you could find shelter or glory dog or dam and we believe that if he done something wrong and was guilty his enemy have a right to come and they say if he was hold on to the horns of the altar is an email a privilege and I write that dragons on an altar and kill him because he was guilty premeditated course he said and then when once he cut in the city he could let off the pressure he was safe he was all right course there was a provided place for him God provided way for an innocent man not to be slain but to be exempted from this Lane because he accidentally did it he didn't mean to do it now if he meant to do it that's different now there are two classes in the world today there are men and women of the world today that really don't want to do the things they're doing and Jude identify some of that he say enough some have compassion making a difference now people who are in weakness weaken the flesh we can this be killed that and they struggling and the delegator my heart and they are different from people who are just babies I don't care so Jude said kind of some have compassion so let's continue now many women today who really don't don't want to do what they're doing they don't want to sin I feel sorry for them they don't want to do anything wrong but they do it they are drove to it no days are please for that person that wants to do right let me say that again there's a place for that person that wants to do right hallelujah there's a place the left of the pressure but there are some that doesn't even care that's different they don't care what they do did okay who see who know they don't care we're not talking about them we're talking about you who want to do right and Jude Ibaka Jude Jude and unbuttered you share this would mean that the four groups Iran is that they grew see talking about you talk about those that are sanctified and preserving Jesus Christ he said I believe it I give diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints in other words your loss if you don't have it fight for it the ones had it it was once I wrong that's why you could say how could somebody be adopted and there's no apostolate Church identified we have to go back to the Apostolic Church in all ways we have to go back to a church but the faith restored Febreeze a shout on that the Bible prophesied this faith gonna be here not talk say it not preach fit the real said what they had in ours there's gonna be an Apostolic Church but Jesus Christ walking in it the shout of the King will be in the camp or Chloe that God we believe that how many believe that glory to God so Jude was telling them fight for the faith contend for the faith then he said there there there for there certain men crept in unawares the sneakin who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord Jesus I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not the same God that bring them out is the same God punished them this is going to be talking about this is a pasta dish and Prejudice and elder this and Deaconess and I say this notice not that they're not trusting that this is God Almighty but because a lot of show so take off your shirt shoes and let's come into the world or give the Lord some praises Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the angels which kept not their first estate but left the old habitation he had reserved for everlasting chains under darkness under judgment of the great day when God made the engine a very happy everybody cool they worship and God and make what God because God is object of worship Lucifer all the music will eat him but he was controlling his own service controlling me music hi cherubim or was suddenly a design has had to be like the Most High all of a sudden all of a sudden this thing coming Lucifer had to be like the Most High hallelujah I will ascend to the Mount and that's not a whisper in some of the names of ears and some of them believe him hallelujah and start a war in heaven if they study yet you know this war started in heaven what you going through under pressure you ain't us stop here you know we'll give the Lord a shout in the house if there's not yeah you know this Papa you iron today this started in heaven when he fell from his estate he become the devil but he was a mighty angel singing cherub be dead everybody Hill them

that's some that's the God we have as our King our Lord mighty in Parkton he gonna fight your battles for God don't give you a victory let's continue even a southern Gomorrah the cities about them in like manner giving them sort of fornication going after strange flesh are set forth an example suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire so hope sodomites going to heaven yeah that's a good at the own torch and main Oh sodomites making it when God judge Sodom ain't and what's he selling me judging it and God will not repent if he didn't repent then he repented no fire go bun fire coming again and the bride will not be judged because he will judge when Jesus was such a Calvary when the judgement struck Jesus and he died on the cross you died in him Oh glory the corpsman Jesus that you died when he arose you are all there's a lot of shout hallelujah said by one spirit we are baptized into the body or either God a man given a son and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves of fornication good after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire like why these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise Dominion and speak evil

she started to do with it that letter they begin to smoke cigarettes she tortured smoked cigarettes she continued playing there was nothing said too much about it around the church now remember keep telling you reason that a lot is Karen and message because they haven't seen judgment yet I've got the scripture for that and as decrease decreases eat listen to this because sentence against an evil book is not executed speedily therefore the heart of this son sermon is fully setting them to do evil you see God have a time to do things he said the cup of the amorous is not full the cup of iniquity when it's full then God sent judgment when it build up he just said run so people do the own thing when the children of Israel came out two million people enter rejoicing oh good we out of fear Oh God saw all them perishing accept Joshua and Caleb God knew they would feel but he pulled them all but in them had another generation as a seed in a German in them had another generation that was going to be born that was going to go into the Promised Land because God has to keep his word he has to pull him I bring them into the land and this land that we have is the land of Ephesians that the church must cross over into and the seven thunders is prophesied to bring us into that land where there is a perfect church where you are predestination there are interruption in that Ephesians husband loved their wives and Ephesians children obey their parents and Ephesians is a - ministry in Ephesians has one Lord one faith one baptism and it features we are no longer strangers but we are fellow citizens of the household of God or glory of god in Ephesians Christ the head of the church Oh glory to God the mystery will connect the body together heading about that all as in Ephesians that's the land we have to go in through not four inches not Galatians Ephesians that's the place that the faith is restored back to that's another Ephesus that's the Alpha bride or glory to God as we do mega have to go back to and pick up what they had or glory before going to the rapture we have to pick up what they had these are not prefer to mass back to the faith of the fathers but back to church back to the faith let me say it again not back to church back to the fleet or glory to God hallelujah diddly that do you see or have been turned back to the faith I want you to see your heart being turned back back to the faith of the fathers when Peter was in prison under billions of prayin the doors open up angel of God came and open and locked it and release Peter from that that is back to the feet or person got holy or back to the feet you have to come out and look you can't see in the prison of sickness come on now you can't stay in the prison of sickness back to the faith new coming out the sickness coming out the blindness come being restored that's what we're talking about back to the faith [Music] Laurey they were joined church today we have any kind of life or anything but I tell you one thing you can't be born again and live any kind of a life you would live for Jesus Christ when you are born again you would act like a man you will conduct yourself as a real Christian if you're born again of the Spirit of God so this continued is a purpose I'm reading this I want you to stick with me right with me so this woman finally she fell in love with a man and liba run off marry this man continue playing peon in the church after while she left him and marry another one she taught her children all right finally she end up with a common-law wife what was it a soul to all her in the beginning don't do that but she reasoned now if the rest of the one can do this why can't I do it but don't you know soul was a spirits that don't do that keep away from that that's not right she fought against that cast that aside when two reasonin watch don't reason just believe God's will don't try to reason out just what God said is the truth and believe that to be the truth and don't go to your reasoning go to your experience to Christ in the heart and compared with God's Word so she went on and after a while she was called or the past over church was called to her bedside to prefer she was laying there smoking cigarettes everything living in the house a common-law wife he said sister is everything all right with your soul to die she said everything is at peace now she believed it she had went she had went so long with her intellect until she had grieve the Holy Spirit from her it was it no more spoke to her she didn't know what was right she had reasoned it out she had a mental conception that if she went to church and did what was right she would go to heaven then when on down to the very of debt oh this is the part when I get to when her reason power on the Prophet break-in you know when you die your brain breaks up of course when the spirit leaves you and then what's left he has your soul that you neglected back dear which comes to you then when you're dying and this mental reasoning breaks up you don't reason no more it's your soul that has been in your heart that you grieve the way and it caught up with her and when she did you scream my god I am lost let me say this way to you so you are trying being you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul that human spirit is given to you inside a deer is where you get reasoning memory conscience imagination so when somebody dies the human spirit breaks up in that human spirit is where you have your CXC UGC the degree a big house a big car your CEO your doctor your lawyer your pilot the engineer your aeronaut astronaut whatever it is all that position of power your president your Prime Minister all that is existent at the spirit level driving our Mosley's Benz driving a Rolls Royce whatever is all that isn't that space bill what people think they are how high they are how powerfully oh great they are oh mighty hope all for the families that's dear but in debt that spread bricks up and your soul comes up and the soul is who you really are [Music] so this woman intellectually she believes she's right when it breaks up her soul comes up she's out my god I'm lost is to let them to let them the soul that has been grieved away don't let that be your state you mind God be born of the Spirit of God with reasoning things and believe what God said to be the truth be filled with God's Spirit and then God would lead you and the Holy Spirit would lead you in the path of righteousness or glory no thought so you already want to be led by your the spirit not just coming to church for a blessing because you'll find yourself lost people going to hell you know hell is the preaching this message but people go to hell for a bomb says yeah someone come to Elysee but about him do you think is wrong did was it anything I said why do you question about if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't do it at all then you know you're right should I do this should I do that should I do this once a question and forget it kill it then don't do it on your right no I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed that means this little group are you here tonight this could be one of the most powerful church that ever existed if we could catch the soul tinkin attitude perfect in the sight of God [Music] he's a reason that a lie detector because man wasn't meat a life science developed this thing that he could put what kind of stuff on you and ask a questions and he could see it nice I did not steal the Apple and if I stole the Apple all the machinery so you know where Zack suffers truthful questions your name is so and so and so yes so it registers in correct you live at such as a house yes and then the athlete trick question oh did you booyah no and you shouldn't do so because it picking up something it detected something at the subconscious level the eyes wider people who could read what they call body language somebody talk enough of Oh a sudden the closer answer that mean to shut you down sometimes they have a little Quivers and these are uncontrolled reactions talking somebody in I won't make a flicks no day in the Murray I'm a big afflict unaware something exported and then they do like is not their mother it was regular smile you saw random you know that rise by saying is me that's why they could read those things because we are we are make up a certain way and we are reacting unconsciously and Fiat is the same thing when you have a genuine reaction of faith it is unconscious when they give the report about Jesus that the woman come my daughter is sick then somebody come and say mister your daughter dead he said oh by the way that I go wake her Jesus had no doubt whatsoever he was going on with her he had also get people out of the room but he was going to wake her unconscious waiting riding a bicycle for the first time good consciously adapting and hold on and fall and thinking after a while you don't even think twice to ride a bicycle you didn't think twice to drive a car you're tumbling on this drive you remember when your first was driving and he Lunas and your blinkin plenty of blue soup and he must say stop here and he pass me a stuff and money foods and you bounce the ball you can remember that no but you do all of that when I was learning but afterwards it become unconscious it becomes automatic but that's how the Christian life has to become it becomes automatic it comes from the subconscious level it's not you trying attendant to try and to be holier you trying to be right you're trying to be nice you're miserable inside but you're really trying your best your best sir okay try nothing but when you're born again of the Spirit it's something inside of you your wife will see it your husband will see it your children will see it somebody ought to see it this thing is is out this thing does LICO or glory no God hallelujah can't keep that to yourself the woman always said come see a man who told me all that I did is not this the Christ let's go so Lyon is a deceitful and a hard thing so oh it's an evil thing I rather have a drunkard would be a denier so you know liar lying at the bottom that was Bobby said no liars anything nah man say if you're lying stop the line get priyad forget is with a line over you alright but no matter how sinful you are you are still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person I see today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you made up you are made in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate try to make a lie see me right they got a scientific instrument that proves it still register negative because there's a subconscious dung in a human being and that's some conscious news what's the truth no matter what you were saying out here the subconscious no it's a lie and it registers of the subconscious therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so line up with God on till the channel of the Holy Spirit would be so perfectly one with God what would take place if a man and woman could ever get lined up with the freedom from their heart with faith from the innermost faith from where the innermost Bible say I desire truth from the inward parts so the core don't wanna say God bless you and you don't mean it

dad in your soul your God in your heart you're fighting for your life understand this the devil want to cut you off prematurely you know because he see the potentials inside of you he see super Church super ray seen all these promises and you don't even know what locked up inside of you or glory to God hallelujah praise God when caught when Abraham offered Isaac and Ana stop a parameter and because you have done this thing in blessing I will bless thee and thy seed shall possess the devil that possess the gates of the enemy the devil can identify disease of Abraham but here we are the last is we are stepping forward as royalties of Abraham to possess the case of the enemy to possess sickness the process whatever the tech the kids are we when the confession see is intellectual feet or let's go noona butter brown this is in the chip report I know first is a thought he spoke a word and when Jesus came out the hill he said no man either from this book a word he went on and then watch God's mind that mind that in the beginning was what was the thought before it was expressed on as a word but and every word in the Bible is God's thoughts leniency form and I said again every word in the Bible is God's thoughts lien in seed form every word that means God could interpret any scripture in your life let me say it again this is important listen you could go to give you a scripture and interpret that script in your life personally to you that have nothing doing anybody else [Applause] [Music] God forgive you i am the lord i got a seal at the ieu that is your word and you run with it and you heal all together just by your word from the Lord God give you that scripture and your he'll give you comfort this and give you a comfort in your heart and your spirit and your comforted by the Word of God let's continue every word in the Bible is God's thoughts linseed form and if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible it brings the things to pass you see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this man that was in Christ being you allow it to be in you let it work through you claim it asks for it you once said you don't want your mind you want his mind and the Barbican of a be sure to have it by the Bible says let this mind I was in Christ Oh Chloe look god I expect more image than that it's in and let this mind ours and Christ be in you you're a writer have the mind of Christ nothing wrong for that nothing wrong in asking for that I want your mind in this matter I want your mind in the situation I want your mind as a mounting kit as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so your thoughts become expression your thinking so you're thinking literally have to do with the environment of your life and as a gardener tells a garden and kill your weeds and and war reason it's so you have to hold the weeds in your mind if you don't tend that garden the devil put seeds you'll get all kind of crop inside your mind and you'll read the harvest of what's in your mind and your spirit you're gonna speak it ain't gonna materialize you'll get a food of it but as a man taking his hearts always here or glory of God if you have evil thoughts evil thing in your mind and then take an old stuff you know I read a harvest of that because your mind like a garden not being clean not being cleanse not being challenged that's why the Bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind Oh glory to God that you might prove what is that good and acceptable will of God your mind has to be renewed if you could get a changed mind you could get a change life if you could get a changed mind you could get a change walk they're gonna change Monica get a change talk but some people don't want to change their mind because they love all they think they love what they say they love what they do they can't be taught it can't be spoken to hallelujah praise hallelujah Jesus a half-eaten God for verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved cast into the sea though doubt in your heart in your heart don't doubt that they don't don't don't wear nothing ahead in your heart you can have what you see is that right not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church no here we go I know this one is that'll teaching is a special service this morning I know it but I come to bring it now you can express this by mental conception by speaking the word and seeing it as anus but mental but if currently it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happens what about him describe Abram come into the fullness of believin so after 25 years of testifying I'm a son Elohim came known to tell Abram I will return unto thee according to the time of life it was your 25 years of testing is run out I come to give some encouragement I have come to give the man a reason right now I come to tell you every time is upon you it's a time of life so Abram was comforted just like when Jesus opened the understanding to his disciples open the words of disciples and comforted him with the word and said receiving the Holy Ghost and then tells Ellen sorry in the city of Jerusalem and till you bein to report from and high as just as Jesus released that to them they went up a joy the same Jesus was taken up but they were happy they were not sad no because their thoughts have been cleared up their revelation has been sealed in their heart they know what they was going to receive so they had no doubts in the upper room they were expecting the power from on high not a man shaking their hands power from on high they were under tremendous expectation or glory to God I went the day of Pentecost was fully come there in one man didn't want to caught you in one channel everybody on the same position or caught set so God said so the incursian one another but what the Lord said or give the Lord some praises fire came upon every one of them everyone received a portion I don't want every one of you today to receive your portion or glory of God hallelujah hallelujah so watch if it becomes a real revelation then you see it before it happened an express it in Word form that word takes a whole army in because material etat Express and when your heart listen and your mind is too filled with God's Spirit till your thoughts become his thoughts

to do God's will whatever God tell you to do you want to do it you're interested into it you want you out of the way assai that you like that God I never grew up before that's you that's the God what you want is his will as soon as Samuel anointed David the Bible said the Spirit of God came upon him he was anointed in the presence of his brethren all are my witnesses of the oil upon Stephen and David went back to a sheep anointed with God anointed with this all glory of God he wasn't in yet but he was anointed to be king and the Bible said God has made us kings and priests and we shall reign on earth and you wanna tell me I can't preach I got choked up just this morning when I know that he has made us dust it is his will it is his purpose it is his mine we be kings and priests all the potentials lock open sorry oh my god [Applause] prophecy a free to check where we G I believe it's on its Road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw away from themselves that they don't see themselves but the see of God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful Church will go forward power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by by by the holy spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind and the prophets that the ministry has reached its perfection when Christ is revealed again among human beings in the natural in other words the word has to become flesh again and when the word becomes fresh the invisible becomes visible god help me this morning let me say it again God was invisible until the wood becomes flesh and when the word become flesh the invasion will be considerable God becomes material so God want to get get man he want to get man out of the way Oh glory to God and quad remove all flesh resource out the kingdom you were to bomb them off knock them off he's gonna take them off and you're gonna raise up some David this is too much today when you come so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all then your entire makeup is of the Spirit of the Lord Jesus he has full control that's when your torch will be clean your torch will be pure your heart some people say well religion comes from the heart he said there is no mental faculties called heart you can't think with your heart Bobby's a semantics in his heart and he said Jesus wasn't speaking of the physical being he was speaking of the supernatural being we are three for being soul but his spirit we know that this what his flesh is we realized is here we know what the spirit it is the spirit control the flesh but what is the soul he said the soul is the nature of the Spirit so born again means you'll need to change a new life Oh hallelujah if you notice here we go the subconscious is where you live not at the conscious level your real you is subconscious that's why you live that's the reason because it is hard for them to have faith yes I got faith but don't yet it seemed not for you well this fellow said I believe God heals and subconsciously but it's not for you you see are you sure you're not going anywhere you're undercut got a mind saying something but this spirit seen something else the nine saying I believe but the heart seen I'm effective on next week so there's a problem going on you notice is right but this is AB Dementor here they worried how did GC on his exe and adopt the degrees everything ideas Oh Daniel yeah you know God put something inside of here that is for God some people replace that too is for God but woman with money with popularity with basketball football cricket with love for this enough of that they love animals they put it to use for God that love to climb the climb in Mount Everest climb in here some some politics of God for parachuting the jumping from the sky all about together my Trillo something like sufen so they've only seen this ofin some people have you see the calibrated anyone is see is easy they fill it with fish or something but the nothing church but Sunday morning their body see the devil twister my God put that too since I died here I must continue you say watch they don't think of something they're thinking about healing it's not yet intellect here working it is subconscious working your subconscious is your soul so the subconscious is the real you so watch when it lines up like I see a make a reference you and your wife having a quarrel inside and you know it not going very nice and somebody knock on the door or ring the doorbell and you go bid on your smile let's know what going on here now is diagnolly wielding an ax dice a piece of acting going on that's the Hollywood there's a there's a movie going on right now movie not real nobody Bay in case you don't know movie not really I remember a fire in hotel in Africa a man run to the class well I I found no he steps and so on get bruised organizing my chair was seen he wasn't watch too much of movies at least occurred as take action break the glass will roll into the glass that only happen in picked ISM that is not real so when the quarreling going on instead of getting that right and correct and everything else we go chat and see like all is good but all not really well the motion all is well but he had say I just get on the inside and a boy and I when you smile here's not you going back to the battery they're right back to where you left off and sometimes it take to talk or not sometimes or is a mistake to if one hot and tempura was carrying on at least keep quiet long enough and it cool down memory story husband and wife and she went to get constant whatnot I say here what you do when he said I talk eat eat this or either than either and she keep eatin and she come asleep or demand change so much every time he touches it just eat that eat that eat that man transform transform she's really secretly she said was get can you shut your mouth I know any kitchen so you can talk so somebody has to do they're not talking part the quiet part that things could get a flow because when he told to tongues cashing caramel and stuff but it subconscious is your soul hallelujah must get there [Music] the soul attracts what it secretly harbours that is why what a man says what you fear happen I want to believe happen see if the soul have the fear it attracts that life by fuchs of them if the soul have the faith it just push away everything else from the soul from your subconscious level the mind have to change your thinking have to change you have to want to get out a Moxie mode boo mode and the excuse mode you have to want to come out of that and stop looking at you do have the resources you don't have this stop look at what you don't have question what do you have five thousand people to feed five those two fishes what do you have Jesus took the five loaves to fishers bless it share it stop looking at what you don't have say lord give me fresh eyes to view what's around me what I have think differently we shouldn't go please I want to kind of so what your fate happens what you believe happens every thought soul that goes into the mind will have a route would have a fruit I will like can I do believe do you know believe you have to believe is not right glory to God so therefore truly circumstances doesn't make the man it shoes what the man is people have so much excuses about life this is why I saw my grandfather my grandmother the neighbor teachers in like middle school that way I didn't know that excuse you didn't want to learn I didn't have this I didn't have that there are people who pass exams under candlelight they study without electricity and tremendously successful because I had a passion to learn so somebody want to learn to pass their subjects on exam they have a passion a desire I believed that I could succeed I could make it even though the circumstance around me is very trying they never allow the things that stop them there was somebody at him born without hands and they qualified to be a lawyer write them with their feet because they are the intelligence to do it so the mountain right by the tools put the pen between the two and write and do the exams and so on and they wanted to go for exams yeah people over 80 has all finally got a degree because I always wanted to get a degree and they fulfilled that before they died they want to get a degree is what you want you could want to be a Christian more than everything else you can want to be on fire more than everything else you could want to be genuine more than everything else what is your passion this is a weak man with training could become strong with discipline could exercise and getting muscles and everything else just so a weak man cut between to become strong the birds may rest on your head and bring parts but don't lean and L&S fear don't be so weak for them to build up build nests in your head but I set the negative thoughts that you can't override angry that's why Hollywood is so dangerous even for the children they're to be careful with Hollywood because what can I say tonics and all kind of people write the movies but Hollywood is that channel to get tossed into my mind and so other songs and people have these things to company as there's new songs all day and they have messages in the songs as I've seen so into the songs the devil using any means necessary when you come to churches a little or two hours what time is that when you leave it at every problem your night and a 24/7 getting this all the time you know that's why I have the resources on the internet to going

in my and that's what I hear that and say the Prophet told me to steal right here and I am moving I'll stay here for the last 50 years because that prophet told me to stay here both hear the same word the Bible said Israel's there the word but the word wasn't mixed with fate so everybody can be hearing it but it's those who are fatal mix that word to bring it on hallelujah the world has been transformed by visionaries I like that word visionary a visionary is somebody who caught a vision they may not have the money to fulfill it but they have it when Colonel Sanders got his recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken it wasn't known to be that at the time coherent instead I show people who God is the real thing self it would be finger lickin good that was not that I didn't believe him kick

gone quickly is where the fate lies that's subconsciously where your feet very nice what must I do for my family say Parabellum I want to receive the Holy Ghost I want to know what to do I am burdened for my family to be saved she's a sign a name are you burdened he said what must I do for my family use the same feet that you use it for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord and believe it with all your heart that you are going to be saved don't let it come down from your natural thinking here let it drop from inside that's subconscious then they are yours so when you fear for your family dropped from your subconscious then they're yours God give them to you when you cut it down here oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that no watch my lord could you take a little more I want to ask permission to take a little more because I feel and the middle of something here and I can hardly drop off you know on my way watch watch the biggest part of our faith is mental feat by hearing the word it produced a mental recognition of God but if it ever strikes from by the Holy Spirit it becomes a spiritual faith hallelujah we believe that glory to God in the beginning was the world was really so watch when the Holy Spirit comes down then the word itself is pouring into a faith our mental feet become the spirit of Revelation and that become the rock see not coming to church because your father coming on your mother comment because you have a revelation oh that's why you come in your worship and because you have a revelation you know look and see who is in the hand who is in her or she raised her a charisma hand to know you raise your hand because you want to raise your hand you stand up because you want to stand up it has nothing to do with the person in front of you at the side of you you have your revelation or glory to God hallelujah we believe that so it's the Holy Spirit made at Ephesus church put the smyrna church the Holy Spirit gives the pokémons change all is the Holy Spirit it's been the Holy Spirit in his age and watch from your faith and then when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit ceases together so watch number one no more one coming from your mental fit tongue comes the Holy Spirit into your mental faith and mix it a spiritual fate hallelujah then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word hallelujah do believe that praise the name of the Lord the spiritual field only recognizes the world praise God and what something here to share with you Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God Hebrews 10:26 says if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin now the part I want to get here is the knowledge of the truth so the knowledge of the truth is not the truth yet until you get this spirit of the truth I want to get at in today you have to get the knowledge of the truth seven-season knowledge 700 knowledge mystery knowledge knowledge of the Bible it's none of the truth but when the spirit of truth comes that is the to knowledge because the knowledge could just opt to be all intellectual but when the spirit of truth um you have a revelation you have an experience not just truth but the Spirit of Truth and go7 he the Spirit is come he will lead you and guide you into all truth which is a continuation of the knowledge of truth or get the Lord us give the Lord a shout hallelujah because no you are empowered by the Spirit of Truth to get you into all truth no longer intellectual thing it's a personal revelation of God Oh hallelujah praise God thank you lord thank you lord Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things belong I did a lot of Oh God but those thing that I reveal belonging to us and to our children forever that we might do all the works of the Lord or glory to God literally that hallelujah so from your faith up to the Holy Spirit look at here fit up to the Holy Spirit that sees you in with Christ then you become one what then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God then they are vindicated and place when that time comes they become vindicated sons and daughters of God right now your sons and daughters but when that time comes you be kind of indicated son vindicate the daughter of God the same devil that was busted back there he got busted again this time because no one else has her son is I've indicated son vindicate the daughter of God Oh Gloria body no stopping us now or Chloe no copy contacting Ethan hallelujah hallelujah praise God Oh [Music] almost done David was the poorest excuse there was he said stupid shoulder piece that sheepskin rock are wrong and he didn't not one of these big intellectual degrees well trained Saul was the best he could have had high hair a shoulders above dressy army for was a tall guy and today we know we need a revival we know we need us to LaMotta people it will not take a doctor with divinity it will take weaklings it will take it will take a weak person never take the Word of God

nothing much to look at but will come them with the power of God God is nothing big words God isn't on his hats say I am the higher and lofty one that were with him of our humble heart and of a contrite spirit it takes a humble heart dedicated a God to bring Jesus Christ in the present tense oh god I'm finished [Music] hallelujah God looks at the heart people tend to judge you by your car by your house by your children by your degrees by what education is not right by a dress by a unique ability and gifts but God has the ability to see inside the person's heart so when Elliot came in front of Samuel the Prophet and he said surely that is God's anointed God said no no no not so fast don't look at the outward appearance because I look in at the heart that gives Samuel a bit of discernment to see for the quick name power to give witness of the men that was passing me for him and brought her after brother pass until Samuel say isn't there anymore hallelujah God don't look at how tall he who MA he said I don't see us he doesn't see us human see or David was God's choice hallelujah and David develop a hat after God he says the hot pant after the WaterBrook so my soul tastes

before y2k where parents I used to be preaching in secondary school and telling my class means that the end is here the end is no we're not even going to get to write full levels because time is short and to see how God on fools time and yet still time is short but God allow us to get tested and tried and he gave us more time to see who were ready who learn and who will really give up because some of us years ago he came then we was there you know but as he give us time we get caught up in different things so God allows time to see 20/20 I remember writing an essay for he levels on what will happen with why Tookie only remember that anybody and I remember that but in the year 2000 everything was switched off a rota SI for general paper that the zoo would get unlocked because they wouldn't be able to keep all the other ones inside and all the trains will crash and you know because you have no idea because you will come in that era to see how it's it's your spirit of age the Lord Allah is coming you know so people taking it all easy but as you look at 2020 I recognize that the rabbits are less squad cut they work short you know he wouldn't be able to preserve the elect so it's for the elect see that he would have to cut to work short but it makes you wonder as you approach 2020 and all these years after the prophets left that you have to cherish the moments you have because we wouldn't have these opportunities all the time but a random taught us one day it'll be the last service it'll be the last song it'll be the last service preached you know because he's seasoned with cheese and we wouldn't be able to gather this way anymore so we thank God for the opportunities when we can gather to come together in his presence and fellowship and be able to smile and an Amber dear madam as we're over the speaker man in his introduction he term with the pressure but ambition a message letting off the pressure you know I mean this is the place to let off the pressure you can tell me a coma - I mean stressed indigenous - just not a place to be stress you come to church to let off the pressure so that when you leave here but I ran a picture I said why are we so tossed about so when you come here you come to get anchored do you come to get relaxed you come to bask in your presence knowing that your brother next to you these sister next to you might be going through similar trials and I never go to more trials and you just keep in your face straight so you don't see how much tragedy going through but some two great travel all through the blood and we are happy for the trials and for the testings because it's to really shape our character so we could we could leave this place so put on a big smile if you didn't smile for you hole they put on a big smile and turn to the brother system next to you and say keep on fighting a big smile a a big smile and a small smile tell them keep on fighting greet somewhere and tell em keep on fightin hallelujah if Samira
