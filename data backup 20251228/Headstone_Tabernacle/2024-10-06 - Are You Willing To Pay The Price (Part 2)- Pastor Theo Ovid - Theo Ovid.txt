frustrated that a prayer i max out up to here no more no more no more no more no more I done that a prayer I done prayer God never said I heard the frustrations of my people I heard how depressed they are a grandmother weeping and lamenting oh God God didn't see that I have heard the cries of my people watch crying for deliverance breakthrough Ezekiel 9 sign for those that cry and sigh against the Abomination because you want to live in reality the devil has infiltrated the churches oh the Lord I shout did you hear what I said the devil have in infiltrated the churches he want to make it powerless he want to make it defeated he want to make it bloodless without the blood of Jesus he want to make it without the atmosphere and we are fighting for that we are fighting them demons we are fighting those Devils [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah brother Braham he knew that his present backing condition would never meet the challenge of the hour yet he was just as much man as he was his muscles his frame was as big as it ever was he was just a big muscle that ever could raise up his arm at any time probably larger we got better churches better buildings where is our strength spiritually speaking he said I'm talking about the presence of God being recognized Among Us that is what we ought to live for not my group get bigger than your group and who are the biggest group the biggest group is it the deest group is not Si's group is if we could hold presence sometime ago Hallelujah God are cursing you you cursing Yourself by how you act God responding to it did you get that if you repent quickly God could minister to that because repentance is not the law of man repentance is the law of God I don't want anyone to perish but that all will come to repentance that is what God recognizes that you are sorry for your sin that you are sorry for your attitude you are sorry for your way and you want to get the way out you want him to make a way for you you glory to God you want God to stay the pestilence stay whatever is affecting and affecting home family he knew that his backd condition could not be the challenge of that hour all the time while they were all standing there and these thoughts was going through their mind I hope it sends through yours they never notice Samson his thoughts went through his mind this is somethings thinking brother saying there is a possibility that God will hear me this is a man who defeated Philistines this is a man that everybody was afraid of this is a man that people around respected no more respects now he's a mockery They're laughing at that man and Samson saw a possibility that God will hear me there is a possibility and while he thought the Philistine had not noticed him while this little boy had untied his hands and walked back he said lay my hands against the post CU Samson couldn't see so you had to trust the little boy will listen to him there's a possibility I wish the church could see that listen there's a possibility of a real Revival could I hear a bigger shout than that the prophet said I wish the church could see that there is a possibility of a real Revival let me say it good in Trinidad there is a possibility we got to re right here do you see that possibility then make way make yourself ready Revival is on its way are you willing to pay the price for Revival [Music] Lord what did he do he raised up his sockets he had no eyes towards God then never noticed the moving of his lips and he was sincerely confessing we don't need a little Lord forgive me Jim Jones and all of us no we need a sincere cleaning up from the pulpit to the janitor they never noticed the tears running down from them sockets where once had eyes they never noticed the moving of his lips his eyes griny tears streaming down from the sockets he wanted God to make his word once more Vindicated Hallelujah he wanted God to prove his word once more I say to this Delilah today or this Samson rather Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever once more he thought it would happen not a new denomination not a new sectarian but a Vindicated word from you God I know you are still God I am blind I got off track I'm not worthy to live let me die with this enemy You Raised Me Up to destroy it I have failed you Lord but there is a possibility you would hear me once more once more in deadness he prayed he knowed what was coming oh give the Lord a shout we have to have a sense of what is coming we have to be caught up in the spirit enough to know destruction is coming but a power and a glory is coming to that bride a Revival is coming a 7 t Revival once more the world will hear direct from God God will speak from Heaven Oh Glory to God God will speak present [Applause] [Music] [Applause] tense deep sincerity of confession that's what the church needs confess you're wrong don't care what Dr Jones say what anybody else say if if you're out of the word of God confess it and you're wrong cry out once more Lord once more give me strength Lord to shake this denominational world give me strength Lord to shake this lethargic entitled message World M will sit entitlement they feel God owe them the Rapture they feel God owe them the Millennium they feel God owe them Heaven God they owe us nothing glory to God let every man work out his own salvation with fear and trembling praise God this Oh Glory to God hallelujah he knew what was going to happen if his prayer was answered he knew deadness once more while he was praying and making his honest confession every fiber in his body begin to vibrate he said oh God if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again oh Glory so there is a literal baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't care what the minister say but there's a literal baptism of the Holy Ghost that can make your body vibrate that can make your members vibrate that can make the bride

Lord a shout the same all you baptized the same all you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anointed that was Victory because he was willing to confess that every enemy first that he was brought up to Destroyah he say oh Pentecost repent and cry aloud Lord once more he said you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroy you this week here Israel killed the head of Hamas pronounce a man

things and hit it down there kill everybody down there they say when Israel say they go and do something they go and do it you know I want to be like that and I am asking myself how passionate are we to go after the enemy he said kill the enemy before the enemy kill you you know Israel know there's a big Target there because that's the leader that is the head you cut the head off but he going to die oh give the Lord a shout glory to God if you're not praying for your pastor something wrong with you you better pray for your pastor Oh Glory Glory to God if this church fail is not you it's me Oh

hallelujah hallelujah God want us to press our way God want us to be fervent not complacent God want us to be passionate you see how Andrew say he is passionate about this because a lot of people walking blind blind blind like if God God want to return investment you are his investment he invested in you on the earth oh glory to God you don't want to say God you give me me and I bringing back

before enemy destroy you bring back the old fashioned preting real God of repentance all night altar service my Hallelujah he said Pentecost hear me leave oh leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you leave it turn with your whole heart back to the word of God turn back to the power of the Holy Ghost we had the word we had the word got the Mysteries and he sees open and see where the power of the Holy Ghost is that the word too or what that different word you women just like women you men act like men like Sons and Daughters of God turn from this Jezebel system that's choking you and blinding you Jezebel is a spirit in know it's not a woman is a spirit some people say I just can't keep from smoking I can't keep from drinking the reason you do this is because you refuse the toxin against it you take a deep pull and you pull in get your high but then the word here you could you could you could take a deep pull of this word and this word will give you a better high if it take a deeper oo Hallelujah I want you confirm that word by saying Amen to it you can get a high off this word you know because he's only he's the L the valley you could smoke that oh give the Lord a shout Give the Lord a shout you could pull on that Hallelujah you could pull on this word and it will give you the toxins and it will give you the repellent power against whatever the devil have to offer oh let me preach a little to you a little bit when God call man God called man to have dominion over everything upon the Earth God call you to be a conqueror to be Overcomer to be in charge of to take ter territory to have dominion oh give the Lord a shout that's what God call us for not to be under but to be on top not to be the tail but to be the head oh don't get me started this [Music] morning glory glory glory to [Applause] godall the reason we got so much different interational churches they know it's scripture we try to bypass it many of the Great Holiness churches is falling into the same rot trying to bypass it go up and Shake hand with the minister and say I believe Jes Christ to be the Son of God the devil does the same thing the reason to do that is to try to bypass the new birth how the purpose of that so they like certain pastors and so because the pastors don't hit them a certain way one time was preaching and say he blast everything he could have blast I said so wait from him outside he say brother you had touch me tonight the only thing he didn't talk about was gossiping and she was the Numero Uno gossiper of the church that's the only thing in touch and she's so proud she say you touch me that a bold spirit that want to actually announce hey like you catch me tonight boy and my attitude is this listen good you bold I'll be bolder you bad a bad you play Pig I'll play butcher yes you play Goliath I'll be the David coming for you so you choose how you want to play it or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah the reason to do that is to try to bypass the new birth any kind of bir is a mess if it's a birt is in a Bard a cal is a mess because you grow up in a certain Channel or up right somebody say I'm quiet I'm shy that's you that to do with God when God take you and Shake Your Soul shin come out you you understand what I'm saying well my mother was so my grandmother was so and my great grandmother was just so that is true I agree with you you just like the whole REM of them but you see when the whole get on you that has nothing to do with your mother your grandmother or your great grandmother it has nothing to do with them it has to do with God on you when fire break upon you that's something completely okay the Lord I shout Moses mother tell him everything and all he could do is kill a man and run but when that fire hit him so he went down to pharaoh and said Let My People Go Oh Glory to God with Moses we know you kill a man long time and we have a cour case you think M time that no fight whatsoever let my people go oh give the Lord a shout his plages you want is plagues you get plague after plague after plague after Them Crooked witch doctors do the similar kind of thing he said let us go hire now different realm all together what about this brigh of Jesus Christ them Pentecostal run out all have his gift and adultery and fornication and wickedness but there's a bride of Jesus Christ that have the word of God that will produce God that going to reproduce God that going to reproduce the original grain of God oh give the Lord a shout this world I see nothing yet we going and fly high oh give the Lord a shout wait glory to God till them seven tunders all their voices to that group that could take the word and handed deal Hallelujah when slic and cut they could shut the heavens they could do whatever they want to [Applause] [Music] do when that fire hit you so all that I call it grave like makeup you have on your face you see when some box box powder thing it's all extra powder all break up in this new bird is nothing less a mess you get her from the altar crying and booing and carrying on it makes a sty Church think you don't have to do that but through that new birth brings new life everybody want to get it in class you know yeah but God have a new birth we talk about in the old time under Wesley anointing the deacons used to have buckets of water in there because the people were so under Holiness it used to attract the Holy Ghost and they go hit them so and they P out so before they get the Holy Ghost they throw water and then wake them up that bucket of water keep them from receiving the Holy Ghost but he say are you willing to pay the price and lay there until you are dead to the things of the world and reborn Again by the Holy Spirit I was so impressed how brother Kelly went through his own life and look at his own desires and could compare you know what I'm not the same man I was for five years ago something God did something in me it's not I stopped doing this and sto doing that the desire is no longer dear Oh Glory the conscience of sin is no longer dear is a operation of God oh give the Lord a shout everybody have to receive that a operation of God it's not you trying something it's not you trying to be a good person and to be a better Christian and to be a better church it's not you trying nothing it's something happening within you you got to want that you got to desire that oh give the Lord a shout God will give the Holy Ghost to those that ask him oh give the Lord a shout but if you don't know there is a holy ghost you wouldn't ask when Paul ask them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said we even know about the Holy Ghost he said unto what will you baptize there is something called the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord a shout when Paul finished with them they will receive the Holy Ghost there is a holy ghost to be believed there's a holy ghost to be received oh give the Lord I shout this Holy Ghost brings Revival this Holy Ghost bring quicking power this Holy Ghost give you power to pray power to overcome power to say I am wrong power to say I'm sorry power to say please forgive me oh it's the Holy Ghost on Fire it's keeping me alive oh give the Lord a praise in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah let's go we take our ministers and make great doctors of divinity out of them instead of giving them the new birth many of our seminaries take the man and try to educate him education is a wonderful thing but education will never substitute salvation or the New Birth it cannot do it God has a program we must measure up to that program we try to teach our ministers knowledge we ought to teach them the baptism of the Holy Spirit we ought to teach them Christ but we're trying to get a better class of people among us there's no better class of people than Born Again [Music] Christians that's why you can't watch a church member and said that represent the church suppose that way that person is a church member suppos they not born again and then you want to follow that person and I said well she just do that and he just do that and he who you following Paul say follow me as I follow Christ amen let's continue they are not willing to pay the price Samson prayed right what did he pray Lord let me die with the Enemy that's the trouble they don't want to pay pay the price of dying if you want to succeed in your exam you have to study all your friends ly in they laughing they carrying on and whatnot and they call you a bookor they call you a nerd they call you whatever they want but you making a sacrifice because you know school is not permanent after got the subject you people go ask about the subject you have your subjects and you go forward whether further exams or get a job but when you make your sacrifice and you study and you pass your ex s who could be against you for that you made a sacrifice you made a sacrifice a Le a skill well you learn to sew whe you learn to do cake or whatever it is food or whatever it is you learn but it costs something it cost you your time and there something else like I like to see people in Mastery a master tailor a Master Mechanic a master counselor Master when people in the Mastery they are in their element it's like what they were raised up for a master teacher there's some people teach just for the money they put in the board they don't care if the students learn learn anything you know one time I was in school move and a boy don't like teacher I said boy teach getting pay every month you know I said even if they don't like you learn from them then I think he kind of listen a bit but he upset when I was a student I didn't like the teacher at all wasn't Spanish she's Terri ter and that affect me from learning Spanish but you see nobody tell me get out of that attitude because if I was getting the right counseling I would have adjusted and I could learn Spanish I regretted that and there's a man now who came and taught lit and man he he make me get to love literature until I see literature should be compulsory but that is how life is one time I remember Isaac and him come home and talk about this man they going to lessons brother Steven and say this man he go so excited because them children get with mathematics and you know the man do he draw a TV on the board and do the match inside the TV and everybody excited just take a different approach he draw a TV with Nubs and like that and do the M TV and wo boy if you see that they're watching TV and he teaching M and all these things tell you the heart of a teacher is to get the teaching to the in other words when the children are successful the teachers feel great about it the teacher the teacher like I was doing Advanced Cam and the teacher used to be writing on the board like that and so you write first line you rub it off he writing like that rub it off and iidea totally lost but he I am not a university grad maybe they could write so fast and he and he rubbing it off and said afterward I Dr the glass I couldn't keep up the point about it is this God want to get his word to his people that's why he sent prophets Messengers ministers exalters singers because he want to get it to his people the object is not he just want to talk he wanted to respond he want you to apply he want you to act he want you to obey he want you to fall in line that's the burden of God my people my people my people if my people is called by my name shall humble themselves my people my people he's not talking about anybody else oh give the Lord some Praises Glory God is working for us God sent for you behold I sent you Elijah God get this message to look how God find you to give you this message now what are we going to do with it what did your God tell John take it and eat it and prophesy oh give the Lord a shout in the house not watch it eat it digest it let it have an effect upon you come on preach back to me [Applause] somebody you got to surrender yourself you got a price to pay continue you got a cleaning up to do and I tell you the whole church world needs a cleaning all the way from the pulpit to the jesis room they're not willing to pay you must be ready to die to the enemy that God his victory over you you must be willing to surrender your own ideas Samson but the was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again you see if people if if people feel they got it and they don't know they got it to get they will stay with what they have and they're not asking God for what promised they say they got it with no power no signs SK heer to take nothing but they got it whatever that it is but we see we got it to get because when they were in the upper room and the power hit them and start to speak in Tong and Stag and the demons went and tell Satan but dramatized it look they're having a good time up there Satan said don't worry about them they just getting excited in an atmosphere but when Peter saw the man and say Sil go Have I None such as I have I give rise up and walk in name of Jesus Christ he said the devil got up and say you see that that's a different thing that's a serious thing that saying they Clos down we have books and tapes believe around much Cults and Fanatics have all over the world I I could go 14 Jesus is people who say that the Messiah that Messiah here they just arrest one somewhere in the east in eastern thing there is a messiah all he sign for blocking for police and like that the man is a crook the man is all kind of thing they hold Jesus they hold they hold the Messiah that because they claiming to be Son of God they claiming all kind of thing so what I'm saying then nothing would happen until this word begin to be fulfilled among the bride he said by and true the bride will be fulfilled all oh give the Lord a shout not sitting down in church not coming for service but by and through the bride something has to happen right now God is raising the temperature on floods on earthquakes on Wars he's raising the temperature he's got to raise the temperature in the church something have to break you can't come here with the same mindset that's why we hit in mindset hit in Attitude oh give the Lord some Praises but Braham Samson he knew it was going to cost him something it's going to cost you something that why they love the pastor think too bad you know that my pastor what they really want is a priest that what they really want by George they want us to be priests Catholic priests just do a little things so and you're good to go so you can't blame yourself you blame the priest you got tell God I trust him that's why I say to or and Tre Mary I trust him because the priest say so but God cut that prood off and say look the word is here what you talking about you can't read well you could listen if you can't read you could still hear you're hearing what God say what he requires what he expects of you what excuse you're making as Andrew brought out people making excuses you get invited but to make I have to do this I have to do that and thing and I have a party to go to I have this to go to and this will invite me you C say no I'm mouth you have a yes mouth alone you go when you saying yes the devil saying yes yes devil devil agree with you you know yes come to the bodyy and the friend who you think is friend is a demon behind there yeah putting your hand around say come come come say they lead you they can't bring you back you know I talk about many times I had friends and like that they leave me going th in mango tree young boy and the lady stay back home from work to see who even mango I didn't see when she open the window I I didn't see my friends jump off I see when they jump off and I they continue picking normal normal and get caught normal normal after that I purpose nobody must Del lead me in unrighteousness I will choose where I go because the friends say let we go let us go and I went and I paid the price for that right after that that's it finished I wasn't even a Christian yet but I make a determination I have to to make my actions I have to choose my actions Oh Glory that's why I could take a stand you know in Trinidad anywhere else you know I choose my action friend or no friend oh give the Lord a shout I want to be a Christian I want to live a Christian life I want to be a servant a true servant Hallelujah I want to manifest Jesus Christ without flaw oh that's my purpose that's what I want to be that's how I want to be praise God whatever the other Ms think about us is irrelevant to me I don't hear them I have nothing to do with what anybody think out there I try to do what I feel fulfilled in what I'm doing if I jop down dead in the morning I feel fulfilled in doing what God called me to do God put this Vision in my heart oh give the Lord some Praises [Music] Hallelujah don't say it openly already I ain't comeing here with no CL stick I walk in here b b b i nothing to that I just trying to figure out when I'm going to retire there's no re success without a successor am we had to put things in place I was a young man preaching this gospel I thought I was going and go go up go go go to the Raptor Oh Glory afterwards 21 turn to 42 and 42 look going to flip again you think I was looking for that none of us all the gr people I see in here they was looking for that they thought they was running down to the Rapture but here we are amen hallelujah praise God we want to be used to the point where we are useful to God and to his people and you better be that when you have the strength and the youth and the energy to be useful to God oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah he know it was going to cost something it's going to cost you something is going to cost me something your social prestige your place and position and nomination Lord let me die then I see your purpose Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again he was willing to do it are you first you had to count the cost then you had to be willing to pay because you can keep your money in your pocket you know pay that talking about dying and dying you going still die that's the weird thing I Man Steve Jobs remember what age he died was 42 whatever it is powerful at that time cancer take him and nothing on all the Mone he was a billionaire nothing couldn't save him nothing not one cent could have saved him all his money all his wealth nothing couldn't save him what are you going after what are you fighting for fighting to live and then you're living to die what are you fighting for for what do you want do you are you going to put God first brother there are no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the Brazen serpent you die these are some powerful words here you actually die he so God why can't I see it right you die literally die to yourself die to the things of the world and are born a new and the world is dead there are no shortcuts not he that starts it is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race no shortcut except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of God you are lost that's all there are no shortcuts there's only one way and the way Christ is that way and Christ is the word that lives in you that verifies everything that he promised in its season did you get that oh my Hallelujah see we could hit the home stretch here Romans 51 said therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God what is it restored Fellowship Fellowship restored again peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ do you have peace are you tossed tormented and turned around in a city nearby me few years ago a old man lived down by the river they thought he was a bum he passed out religious tracks he lost his family life seemed very cruel to him he lost his little family and he was crossing the street and a teenager come and hit the old man knock him across the street broke his bones all up umblance pick him up they took him to the city hospital they examined the old fellow his arms was broke his rib was broke his leg was broke he was laying there with his mouth open seemingly all gone unconscious after the doctors had put him on the xtray and they said is it worth our time to patch up the old fellow up he's nothing but a bum doctors talking that talk it will take us hours it will take us all this when others are waiting and the old fellow old he was a bum he heard there be no money in it for us is not worthwhile he broke up too much to even take a chance with it they were holding the council the old man happened not to be dead as they thought he was and when they walk back and started to put the sheet over him and take him back again he said just a minute old man is talking I heard what you said he said I am not worth something I am worth something too I am worth as much that God sent his own son to die for me I am worth so much that God gave His only begotten son to die for me 50 years or more I accepted that blessed thing I entered into fellowship with him that's just as sweet as no as it is I am worth something I am worth enough that God give his son for me oh give the Lord some Praises oh if people could only realize what human life is worth and I want to read this what let's look what a cross and what a Coss it was in closing let me say this but let's take ourselves to Jerusalem 00 years ago and compared with the Garden of Eden I sat along this morning about 7:00 I hear the howling mob I go to the window I rais a sash and throw the shutters back what's the matter I see a figure dipped there pulling across of the street and they whipping him and the mockery spit of the soldiers is hanging on his face from drunk all night long stinking I see a crown of thorns pulled down across his brow Blood and Tears mixed I see a robe across his body without seam in it a great red dots all over the coat and Roman soldiers whipping him as he goes up the hill he drags along what a sight old cross rubbing the hide off his shoulders he goes up the streets and they're making fun hollering hail King of the Jews I notice those little red spots they begin to get bigger and bigger and bigger and after a while they run into one great big bloody garment as he goes to beating his legs as he moves up the hill he's going close now to the top of the hill I could see a bee a well-known bee among the human race that begins stinging in the Garden of Eden it's called The Bee of dead and here he come he buzzes around him three or four times his de with his big stinger out you know what I thought when I tempted him up there he overcome the Temptation he's nothing but a man couldn't be God that ain't God that come down the Garden of Eden he said say something so you know the devil never did believe he was divine he always thought he was a man he said but oh Lamb of God there he goes the devil sent his sting out there and he comes around buzzing I'll anchor My Sting in him and knock him away and finish him now tell us if you're a prophet and so on he said watch that devil tonight if this is Divine Healing and so on here come that be de the last great enemy of man humming around him I suck my Stinger in him and end it but brother when he suck his stinger in that flesh that was more than a man if a bee ever suck a stinger if any insect sticks his deep enough when he pulls away he hasn't got any more Stinger it take the stinger out and when that bee of death stocked into the Stinger into the Flesh of God at Calvary it pulled the stinger out of him no wonder Paul could stand and say oh de where is your sting when he was fixing to have his head cut off he said debt where is your stinger grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who give us the victory to our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said I come to you not with words enchanting words of the wisdom of men but I come to you in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit he can Buzz around a Christian he can make all kind of fun and say I got you now you got cancer you got tumor you got this you got that I got you now but let me tell you brother he hasn't got any Stinger he's got a buzz but he hasn't got any Stinger oh de wear is your sting oh grave there's a victory oh give the Lord some Praises I say this one thing and closing there's a great big black door set before every one of us it's called debt and every time our heart beats We Are One Beat closer to that door and I know mine is beating up there too and one day it's going to make its last beat and I'm going in and when we go in I don't want to be like a coward I want to wrap myself in the Robes of his righteousness knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection and when he calls I'll come out Hallelujah from among the dead that day Oh Glory nothing in my arms I bring simply to the cross I cling I have nothing I could offer God I'm just asking for divine mercy to Grace through the blood of Jesus Christ I humbly accept my pardon that Jesus died in my place he went before me and I recognized the blood and making a way for you and I to approach I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation oh give the
