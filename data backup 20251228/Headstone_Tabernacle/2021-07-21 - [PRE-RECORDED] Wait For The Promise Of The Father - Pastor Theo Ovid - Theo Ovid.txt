these bridal promises father oh god speak to us tonight as peter labor to bring the word and said by these precious promises we become a partake of your divine nature and with the restoration of your nature and your image and your likeness comes the restoration of power and we need power and this our father we want the channel of your word that the the conductor of the spirit can that could come down among us in such a wee father that will heal the sick and it will confirm your word with signs ones and miracles lord you know the needs of your people tonight everywhere father come and minister and meet to the needs of your people granted lord in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you thank you for coming if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn tonight to three portion of scripture we want to read uh eclipses chapter 11 verse 4 acts 1 1-8 and revelation chapter 22 10 to 17. reading from verse acts uh uh chapter 11 verse 4 he that observed the wind shall not sow and he that regarded the clouds shall not reap acts 1 the former treaties have i made or theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom he also assured himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of god i've been assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father with said he you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they would therefore come together they ask of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel he said unto them it is not for you to know the times all the seasons which the father put in his own power but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea and in samaria under the uttermost part of the earth i'm going to go to revelation chapter 20 22 reading verse 10. and he said unto me see not the saints of the prophecy of this book why for the time is at hand he doesn't just literally been just still he never is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous i will be righteous still he that is holy let them be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to do what to give every man according and his work shall be i'm alpha omega the beginning of the end the first and the last blessed day that do his commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter into the gates into the city for without a dogs and sorcerers and hormones and murderers idolaters whosoever love it and make it a lie and i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bright say come let him that heareth say come let him there is that taste come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may god bless this world you may be seated oh praise god it's such a blessing to be here tonight and together around the wood of god and that is what we gather wrong here we're not gathering around newspaper clippings or talk chats or talk radios talk shows we come here to hear the word of god the news is the same as the different people crooks bandits steals information just different people happening too but this word is eternal this word have deliverance in it this would have power and this would have the encouragement and strength and grace what you need amen praise god amen so tonight title have is wait for the promise of the father the promise of the father not some minister not some pope not some bishop wait for the promise because god came and gave you a promise it's the promise of the father god gave you a promise he said behold i will send you elijah the prophet he sent elijah to the entire world that's that means this message belonged to all of us and he that is that elijah shall turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the fathers and when he say he mean his message so we don't even have our own message we preach another man's message oh praise the name of the lord so this promise of the father is from act from luke 24 this is jesus he said behold i send the promise of my father so all this thing about turning the hearts back to the faith of the fathers you have to know what the father has had you have to know what was promised to the father and you have to know what you're going back to hallelujah you're not going back to school you're going back to the father the faith of the fathers because these guys they had the original fate hallelujah they had the power of god among them is not right so when jesus these are guys without the holy ghost now these are guys that following son of man ministry these are guys that once was preaching had signs one of the miracles but there was not they didn't have permanent power they were anointed with temporary power to have a ministry to work with jesus they were under training under jesus they were under teachings under jesus but they had not yet received that resident personal power that is promised to make sons of god manifest because jesus by the word he said in the beginning of the word the word was with god and the word was god that's good but the word became flesh that's even better and the purpose the word become flesh is that he could connect to us to bring us back into position and the word became flesh and dwelt among us he came unto his own one his although receive him his own reject him but have whoever received him to them give me power not just more words but power to become the sons of god so all this jesus coming word made flesh is to bring an atmosphere a channel that we could become sons of god now when god talking about become sons of god we are sons of god but the sons of god he's talking about his attribute sons of the spirit that's a different thing that's not attribute in you and taught in you and germany that's not that's what we're talking about we're talking about coming in to be a manifested son a confirmed son a vindicated son if the issue is not about the sons you know is if you're coming into a manifestation oh glory to god so talk over and when talk over you have to see the results behold i come quickly my reward is with me so god gave us space the time to see what these sons these last days sons what they will do oh give the lord a shout we have the same subject the prophetic vision of the end time and our inspiration is the same as sunday let us hold fast to the professional of faith without wavering because he's faithful that promise he is faithful that promise oh glory to god if the past is a crook it doesn't matter he is faithful that promise he gave a promise and he can't lie god will change man god will change bishops god will change whoever have the change shake up this and shake up that blood but he's not going to change his promise to be with you oh glory to god he said by myself have i sworn and when god swear it got to happen oh do you believe that so this year what jesus said behold i send the promise of my father upon you by tiring the city of jerusalem until until they have a clear understanding no that is what they had before jesus spent hours with them open up their understanding open up the word open the seas of the old testament to reveal to them what must be released hallelujah so after they understand and open up with the kangaroo after the word open up they have something to receive they have not understanding to obama say i have an understanding no no no no it's understanding of what you're going to receive shout out receive you have to receive something you have to get something when you come to church you come to get something oh glory to god and what you come to get is beyond the letter of the word you come to receive power oh glory to god not when the press come down that's not the promise when the press come down want you to pull them that is the press coming on that is that but this is this so i'm not looking for press i don't get very bright honda look at the haunted somebody haunted me hunting me i'm looking for power this is the promise of the father i will deal with that when that comes but i've taken this here now did you hear what i'm saying i will deal with the press i will deal with haunted persecuted i will leave it all over in that time come but you see no this is the promise and this nobody can change that nobody can remove that from cyber there and nobody could stop you from accessing that because when jesus died at calvary he bust away from the top to the bottom and kill all the old testament high priest stuff that you could have direct access no mary no secretary nobody oh give the lord a shot i want you to see that tonight you know [Applause] you have to see that you know because the nicolaitan spirit come because they put all their anointing and power over on i hate that because he's a god of the audience i want to be among my people i want gonna walk among them i'm gonna talk among them i'm gonna live among them oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory so jesus purpose of coming in the earth wasn't the parade himself i said i'm the messiah i am god i'm the son of god no no no it wasn't that no no he came up specifically to pay the price to release his spirit to get to produce other sons where adam failed jesus couldn't fail so adam was supposed to reproduce sons sons of god adam fell he couldn't do it fell into sex and the flesh and whatever it is but when jesus come he come to release the word because you have to be born by the word you must be born again by the word and spirit so jesus came to bring the word to bring us back to the garden of eden before the fall let us make man in our image and like this that was spoken word man that was man to be born by the word and spirit so when he sent a prophet to gather all this scattered word to tie back in the word to bring down the holy ghost was to bring back the image of god back on the earth again so we are not normal sons praise that's why paul said i didn't come among you with words of enticing man's words but i came to preach that power that your faith may rest not in man but in the power of god your faith can rest on a man or give the lord a shout i will say it again your faith your faith cannot rest on a man you have to rest in the power of god behold i send the promise of my father upon you that is a whole message myself behold let everybody else would be a lie don't listen to nobody else jesus talking behold i who talking i send the promise of the father upon you hallelujah i sent it to an ex-man i attended through some bishop i settled upon you hallelujah but tarry in the seat of jerusalem until you be endured poor from on high not powerful i'm shaking the pasta hand not perfume section or some taking hand power from where that power coming from that power not come from the earth that power comes on high and he led them as fast to bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass now they saw him jesus they was crying about and they had one woman jesus jesus god he was dead and they're crying and they're sad and everything else you know this time he was saying he blessed them i bless you he says ascend the power promise of the father upon you wait for the promise of the father oh glory to god the breath of god is upon them the word is open up to them the faith is in their soul nothing could stop them they are afraid to shut the doors because them romans looking for them looking for these disciples looking for these type of jesus they close it off but they're waiting they're waiting until but they're waiting in a certain atmosphere they're waiting idling their way to frustrated are fed up how long are we saying no and all these 40 years no they're not talking that kind of talk they're not waiting in that spirit they know god is faithful they know god can't lie they know they could hold in the promise they know they can have confidence in what god said oh glory to god so they are waiting they're waiting on something people laughing at them but they're still waiting people claim to have this and claim to have that but they're still awaiting oh glory to god because man didn't make the promise and man can't keep the promise and god is big enough to promise if he's big enough to promise he is big enough to bring his promise to path or give the lord a shout tonight i will say it again if god big enough to make a promise he is big enough to bring that promise to pass i don't care what the circumstances look like [Applause] now we're getting excited glory to god that is why i read the scripture he that observed the wind shall not sow what does that mean it means you don't regard the circumstance you don't regard what your eyes see you don't regard what the heirs here that is nothing to you you're not regarding not what anybody else is saying you only oh glory to god when everybody watching you are sowing when you don't want to reap you are reaping you will do exactly opposite to what all the sense and humanistic realm is acting up hallelujah praise god [Applause] so we're not observing the wind we're not observing anything external focus on the promise the promise of the father and when you what we got he that observer the wind shall not sow correct i can't show but look at the condition everybody waiting for the right condition to act the right atmos right everything will be nice and and all with the eyes had to see and the heirs here they conde and just and the bride is completely opposite to that because when a man look at sarah if abraham take on sarah looks abraham you sure are you sure but because of what was revealed to abraham it was just looks and condition and wrinkle and age was irrelevant the baby said he called the things and not as though they were he flipped the script on the devil when the devil expect him to depress he was joyful when they expect devil expected to be sad he was happy when the devil expected to be sitting down he was standing up oh glory to god and god and god say that is faith and i have proven that and counting counting that kind of faith as righteousness do i hear a shout in the house do you see god working with this human instagram thing [Applause] [Music] so unless you come to this spot to demonstrate active faith you just in the flesh natural believer hallelujah that's why he said ultimate group of the true see the word god would present the beloved bride because in that group of the true seed of the word you have natural and spiritual and the spiritual could be called out because the spiritual is the seed of abraham oh glory to god do you believe that still trying to come to reception he came in the past he blessed them he passed from them tied up in the heaven and they worshipped him and they returned to jerusalem with with smiles no it didn't say that here you know smiles and joys are the same thing you know yeah yeah yeah smile and joy joy let's enjoy this bubble up joy people before i even say anything people know it up on you already great joy somebody said great joy great joy hallelujah the message short of that people just going through the motion but they had great joy and that great joy now they were continually in the temple continually in the temple it wasn't staying home continually temple praising and blessing god has some big shots staying home and just watching services and i'm channel moving from church to church the channel moving you're so thin and they were continuing the temple praising and blessing god so they were in an atmosphere of worship they were worshiping a revelation they was worshipping with expectation they was worshiping another anointing of a promise of the father every time they go to home go to work go everywhere they know the promise of the father is upon them do you know the promise is upon you the promise of the father is actually upon you god can lie that anointing is upon you wherever you quote the promise going oh glory to god hallelujah be like them five virgins in joshua accent give me a mountain give them a portion a bunch of them didn't ask for nothing they were natural cannon believers they had to wait and josh and say how long are you so slack to get your promise oh come on preach back to me tonight no feeling good tonight hallelujah come on now come on now come on now them slackers getting a rebuke oh glory to god them joker's getting a rebuke how long it will be slack so you can't be stuck inside the air though we are going to wrestle with that promise it's yours the devil's a liar he's trying to tell you you need to belong to you you're not worthy oh give that off i'm excited about this because i didn't make the promise i could preach it i could preach it but faith i'm not afraid of it it's the promise of the holy ghost oh glory to god i know what i'm looking for no man do i have to come and explain to me what i'm supposed to look for now i know what i'm looking for i'm telling you what i'm looking for be it for the promise of the father oh glory to god hallelujah i want to come man come and tell me how you have a angel what can i enjoy bring the angel and come hallelujah i have a right to check out every angel man angel and wing angel oh glory to god let them talk let them say what the message is oh hallelujah because god sent one elijah with a message that spanned a generation oh hallelujah elijah is dead but the days of the voice is still here he said once more the world will get direct from god that means that same anointing that same angel that the one with the sweat back wings they come back again to echo the same promises oh how the promise of the father the promise of dynamics to the mechanics the promise of rebecca's veil all the other half of the shiny ticket oh glory to god hallelujah lights a mantle glory when they will say the spirit of elijah god bless upon elijah who is elijah that's you that's the bride that jesus christ that's not some man oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah hallelujah glory and they were continuing temple how scratching the hell i'm gonna set that notebook writing right to the preacher saying how long were you right for 40 years they would take notes taking notes on them he said don't take notes now but take your notes and worship shout out give god praise give me oh glory my god your life like a wick and party a diploma in oil and the other part on fire and the oil passing through you and fire fire you're dipping oil people for water you still have fire people lie on you there's still a fire people oh they say all kind of nasty thing about you you're still on fire because part of you deep down in the oil that has given me all in my lamp oh hallelujah you are the wick and sometimes you come to get smokey and smutty up and then go come to cut that pic pull up the glass a little bit that you could shine a little better oh glory to god when you come to church and look in the world to cut out all the black parts of your life that you could bond praise god you could shine recall to shine oak the devil can't take out your light i feel led to say that back again the devil can't take out your light you have a light good devil can't take all that light that light is in you that light is over you that light is with you the devil can take all your light oh glory you could come against it but you can't take it out gm was your confidence he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell could never come on come on now the gates of hell newspaper media gets a hell from undercover all on the day they can't stop against the ransom redeemed blood washed church of the living god and you understand that you should be screaming and shouting to the top of your voice you're gonna make it you're gonna come true my lord let me be seated all right let's read something here now [Applause] god promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return to the original word of god and the fate of the fathers what for the continuation to bring down the power of the holy ghost amongst the people so let's break it up now he promised to send elijah prophet to bring us back to original word and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the holy ghost among the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take him at that time so word can't take the bride in so why the church is not crying out for power because you know why they think they have it already they're screwed they messed up so they can't cry for it because they think they have it already and they got it to get but tonight i am telling you wait for the promise of the father oh give the lord some praises because it's coming who want to laugh let them laugh you want to make fun of them fun who are new name who are angel who have mighty angel who measure in the temple who have michael on this side and gable on that side i don't know where elohim is who is god who is the holy ghost you have all kinds of revelations out there you know all kind of thing you know yes yes yeah let's continue he said now watch oh let me see all right let me just okay let me just keep that you know now watch he's talking about adoption here now please another son please another son right take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you call me to be a fanatic now all this adoption talk is not the question of sonship you know it's a question of behavior it's not the question of simmons and teachings and revelation speech will be any pulpit adoption is sovereignly based upon behavior i don't think you get that if that is not so then sisters can be adopted because is the preach so the mighty sermon that is behind the pulpit that's not being adopted you know god doesn't have to defend this money now go to adopt any person and for god to adopt the person the behavior of that person have to be examined not by men but by god so you have the holy spirit the tutor the guide to report back to the father on people's behavior so then he said behold i come with me my reward with me to reward every man according to his work shall be so we don't have to boast we don't have to raise a big flag the works will speak for itself the results will speak for itself one and one will always equal two you could never make one on one tree much after adam so when you say the master adding up you know something's not right and you must not add enough they must have to add up oh praise the name of the lord are you with me now so then the issue becomes not sons these are brothers your son these are sons of son no it's what kind do i hear man the issue is not sons and daughters is what kind of daughter is what kind of a son i know you're a son i know you're a daughter but what kind and that kind have to do with your behavior not belief that's a big one that's the big one let me say it again not belief but behavior because there are a lot of people confessing beliefs but the behavior is horrible the behavior is nasty the behavior is evil and jealous and wicked the behavior is intentionally evil and in church hallelujah so many are called by the shout but a few could be called by the voice hallelujah i say it this way they shout call three kind of believers william branham malachi for a short message it calls three kinds but only one can go into rapture they believe i believe they're kind hallelujah it's called virgins but only the wise because they're wise and foolish it's a wise behavior and foolish behavior hallelujah it have wise action and foolish actions oh god come on come on now come on now a wise version is a wise version not a stupid version not a foolish version but a wise version she knows she has to get extra oil [Music] oh glory to god and she this version is prepared to do whatever is necessary oh i love that tonight whatever is necessary to get extra oh glory to god so yeah i want to be barely a christian and daily and no no no you want to be a genuine saint of god oh we're filled with the oil of god you want god to fill your very being what does he say the more you empty out the more the light expands that holy ghost coming to you and the more you get rid of this and you get more greater that is the more which may expand in you more self get all the way then as men are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god and god wouldn't lead you to where he can't keep you wherever god lead you he's going to keep you and preserve you oh come and preach back to me come on now you can't say you're being led by god and you're all messed up it can't be like that as many as i led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god he have to lead you through the air and lead you there and lead you you know he is you know he is with you oh glory to god so after you begin to see is not how much god have how much how much god you have is how much god have you how much your life is surrendered to him that he could have and that's the word bahrain use the preeminences that's a nice word lovely word beautiful word that he could have the preeminences not you being blessed and you're blessed and you're doing this and you're doing your own thing and you're blessed you know your blessed squad care you know you're blessed but we're not talking about being blessed we talked about him having the preeminences that he could direct you here and direct you there i'll leave you and lead you there you having to pray not your human spirit jumping up and acting up and trying to put god into it and fit it into your stuff oh and fit god where you want to fit him oh and boot him out when you want a bootyman it's not that it's him having the preeminences oh glory to god him

to stay with the world because god bless you on the world not bless you for compromising bless your own word because the ego then you work with the word the word is the conductor of the spirit so once you have the word you have the conductor nobody knows that you have the conductor hallelujah the spirit could come along any time and sit down in that word to you oh you have a channel to hear from god because the bride have the ability come on now to hear from god i know it's in you you have the ability to hear from god understand why i am preaching something taking place you know the spirit have to take the word to reveal it to you so you're not just coming for understanding but you're uncommon for revelation i can't give you revelation the holy ghost alone holds the key to revelation only the holy ghost will give you revelation hallelujah all the preaching jesus preached three and a half years when jesus died them fellas busted him then went back fishing normal normal normal after three and a half years i'm not fishing three other half years i know the ministry of shadow man ministry when jesus is dead and gone all everything all for long flat like a pancake guys who preach guys what signs and wonders guys who see devils run guys who rejoice because devils and subjects are them when jesus died then go on them because no more no i'm a fisherman sick on the right side right side god you don't know what to do with god already only on your own on your own and when you're on your own you have plenty trouble you're on your own because you're on your own which fish all night you get naked sweating out of the whole night they're casting out to the right side reading them inside the cast of the net so they had to call for help because god spoke just so they had no fiction had no blessing this all the time you had nothing you know and all of a sudden you had to get extra help to collect to pick up to gather to draw in the amount of fish god have inside of it for you oh glory to god hallelujah that could be a one-man show you can't be a one-man fisherman oh glory to god there could be no one man showing up the amount of fish got housed out there oh my god he was always a sinful mother when christ comes he sees he only recognize this fish thing is god thing every time you vision like when he recognizes the lord practicing apostle pastor boxing preachers take them back sending men and bring them in a room and start to teach them he said hear what and from genesis to malachi you start to break that within them through them joel too she show description 28 with stamina lips and another tongue i speak to these people show them all these scriptures so they had it clear peter fisher man carried on right but you know the scripture you know what when he comes he said this is that that the prophet jordan speaker he get it from jesus jesus fit everything into them so that they will look for the correct thing but watch something teaching and doctrine couldn't bring clarity it takes the dynamics to kill the confusion who right where right where right and who wrong and when right and i think he writers say it so i i i gather understanding i never see it so all i ever see it so you see when this is that come you have no i see it so this is that that the prophet speak of i'm not hearing you tonight i'm not hearing you tonight you understand that so it's not teaching the holy spirit and dynamics it brings clarity and clears out the confusion because by then the manifestation will be the interpretation god is interpreting his word then you say this day this scripture is fulfilled oh hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord to watch he said no if you call me to be funny from fanatic from this night on that very thing that i'm speaking of will be done there will be a power prophecy coming to the church he didn't say fight for ministry he didn't say men he didn't say some bishop or some message pope you almost see me always someone messes poop they have them that's why i see it and some of them know who i'm talking about some of them know the self one brother say every time brother you say my support i talk about him so he knew i talking about him i didn't know anything about him and i just identify message pope so he say let him keep fit where he kept said where's it yeah yeah he catch a revelation i see i i didn't say he's here i just said message pope because message pope wanted to be boss overall and they don't recognize that rank this cut off long time when god blessed you nicolette and spirit do you think right now you're encouraging the holy spirit but i like fire them this listen those believers bless them for listening to them all these you know they say you're not preaching what paul preached you are false then believe now i don't appreciate the believers what's boston so-called apostles i know we found them who said they're personal from them to be liars line apostle they have a lion angel by them they say they meet angel and the lion angel lying to them and them lying too so he's lying wing angel lying man angel you say that can't be that cannot be going to scriptures and lying demons got permission to receive a whole bunch of them he said let me drop upon them let all them 400 prophets lie with a lion spirit asked permission to go and drop on them to make them lie to bring to pass the word of god so don't tell me do i have no lying spirit it's a spirit you know making people lie normal normal normal i'm saying to hearing from god that's like if you don't know the word you get messed up you have to know the word not sign the wonders you have to know the word when you know the way they can check every demon every spirit i write for if an angel come from heaven and say any other gospel let them be a curse so when i hear them and just talking i want to hear what gospel they're preaching if they're saying what the prophet said because the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word oh give the lord our show know where we stand then all glory of god be standing on solid ground oh hallelujah [Music] have gifted people powerful people all kind of spiritual people and ending that but not a gift it's the word it happened because of people coming to the message gifted by these real men keep what kind of thing that that that that's intimidating me i want to know what they're saying i need the same things that didn't say i said my antenna going up one day nice brother but off that guy helped me now you know that that's the spot in the tribulation period any car don't have the gasoline they go shut down in the tribulation period no you're going to three and a half years of tribulation period i don't want that you know i want the right kind of octagon when we take off smoke but in devil's face but you don't even know who growing up only seeing smoke you can kind of see who you know because you see going up when he's more clear bright gone then he he comes to the remnant no he murders hell he mad he convicts he by the escape then he come to make war with the church members tribulation saints for the ministers my god when them believers begin to see some of those ministers and turn against them there will be something else you know why didn't preach all these promises something else and i will i i don't want to be guilty of shorting you all these precious promises that's why every time you come to priest become the preacher not baccanal not confusion not business outside become the preacher promises that is my job i have nothing to do with all kind of listen passing by brother clarence i see some newspaper this one on that this this and that understand oh i'm thinking taking place who should who shoot you i asked them i take four pictures from them i said i don't even know gonna train that i ain't separated i don't have a clue totally clueless it's not my interest this is my interest here oh hallelujah praise god these promises so he said watch that very same thing i'm speaking of will be done what there will be a power put into the church and now is coming in that here we go that the holy spirit will so anoint the people i say preacher you know annoying the people that they will speak the word and it will create itself just like that speaking the word is not for preachers only come on now i want a bigger amen than that you are sons and daughters this high priest is after the order merchandise they know all high priests but one man have to go inside the veil and have bells and all them drama inside of there this is you becoming a priest unto god [Applause] so you the people have to be anointed do you believe that do you believe that one more time do you believe that shout amen oh hallelujah praise god the anointing is to strike the church so he becomes channel of communication for the anointing to flow through god want dead man i hear you glory to god god wants dead men behind the pulpit hallelujah that we could become channels of god [Applause] paul explained why his teaching wasn't with enticing words of man wisdom because when mind brings wisdom you are impressed with the man but his teaching was wrapped up in the power of god that your faith may not rest on wisdom but rest on power oh glory to god because when you see the power come forward then you know this is god god is working among us god is among us even if brother over there is not there you're still seeing god because you know the word where the twos and trees are gathered together there he is in our midst i don't have to be here for you to see god i am not god oh come on same as i am not the incon writer i am not the holy ghost come on say amen somebody oh hallelujah or glory to god you shall receive power when oh glory all glory when when when the press come down that's not the scriptures that is not the word not when the press come down you receive power you receive power after the holy ghost come down upon you upon you upon you not upon the minister upon you you have got to get power after the holy ghost comes upon you you you you you it has to come on you oh give the lord a shout glory to god this is your promise [Applause] [Applause] [Music] when you press come know what you did well then well that time always the building but right now you shall receive power after the holy ghost i'm upon you no that's holy ghost is not pentecost 1906. that's not luto or wesley he said the seven angels came from eternity to gather all the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring down the holy ghost the object is to bring down the holy ghost because with the scattered world the spirit couldn't work because the conduit was broken through seven ages so the conductor was broken so what barram did he repair the channel of the spirit by restoring all seven mysteries hallelujah god complete number for the spirit to flow freely so nobody knew fate was being lived out virtue has been lived out you don't have to say virtue you could say the ages was being lived out you don't have to say ages you can see the men were stepping forward a star what did we identify sunday seven spirits are seven men seven men are seven messages hallelujah seven men are seven eyes so god put these seven stars in his right hand and through these seven stars the full word will be restored and once the full way to restore the devil in trouble because the full word was in a gardener ethan and the devil to eve let the full word fail the image and once the image is restored the power is restored that is why with the bringing all the scattered word and tying it back in the word don't come the holy ghost is immediately bring down the holy ghost itself then the prophet said the entire holy ghost visited the church producer luke 1730 son of man again oh hallelujah then god was unveiled come to the unveiling of the mighty god then this unveiled god inside idea put mysteries to catch you the bride you being a part of the mystery itself then the party revealed that the all them brothers paul and martin were hidden mysteries they were hidden in the word they were hidden these seals red horse white thoughts paid payloads and they say paul irenaeus martin it's a talk about them brothers it only gives symbols but behind them symbols behind the ox anointed and man anointed an eagle anointing and iron anointed had men that god had hidden and the devil was clueless and now under the seventh seal have believers that is hidden and because god put silence at it that is clueless he put seven thunders under there being in you to believe is gonna have seven thunders and the thunders and voices you hear what i said the thunders of voices and the thunders cap the pyramid mysteries yeah cap the perimeter thunders of the kept the pyramid therefore the thunder is the capstone oh give the lord a shout all glory to god you hear what i said this seventh order is the capstone revelation of jesus christ and mechanics and dynamics [Applause] [Music] and you know what god leave them to argue and debate about the mechanics dynamics on his way to dismiss all arguments let's finish let's finish this thing here oh glory to god hallelujah watch there'll be a power put into the church i'll say this to you it's just one day i put all these things together here it come to me one after one to put here and i wanted it because i wanted to continue from sunday didn't finish sunday so i have reached that party continued sunday yet we still floated on this year he said no watch watch there'll be a power put into the church and always coming in that the holy spirit will swallow the people till they will speak the word and it will create itself like that listen to this part we haven't seen powers like community situation now i knew it for a fact we haven't seen it yet all them jokers talking about they have this and this one adopted and this one happened mr jesus christ i said that i have not seen there's not one man in the united nations jesus christ right now not one if they had it we don't know about it you know i'm not going to penetrate push somewhere in some second and have enough denomination doing that i'm not talking about that now i'm talking about man with the word and spirit and god confirming that word with signs ones and miracles god please give my spirit for freely i believe there will be our awakening of healing i believe there'll be a revival of sick being here because you see the spirit on the prophet say i will ride this trail once more i believe the holy ghost is the white horse rider i believe the holy ghost gonna ride in healing and deliverance and breakthrough i believe that i expect that i have people to be lying outside coming with and crutches and i expect that i expect they can't wait for the door to open i expect that i am looking for that i am looking for nothing less than that i don't want nothing less than that oh i want the same power piece of hat if peter have it i couldn't have it if paul haven't we gonna have it because god promised it is the promise of the father [Applause] i'll die preaching this but i'll not stop preaching this if you don't like it go somewhere else but i'm gonna still preach this the promise of the father wait for the promise of the father oh glory to god hallelujah so saturday five and six we have a prayer power hour we call into the power hour that is not the prayer meeting to come and moping and i'm pretty long and no no no longer that it's one

with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sends away the tests come to prove the best [Applause] the tests come to show the difference of you from the rest you are blessed to have a test you are privileged to be called to be tested after 30 years of heart trials he gave jesus three and a half years harder trials because he was a son he could prove this son that's why he called the devil to show job he said come come come where are you going he said all over the world are deceiving people are dropping on all their message poops and them all them bishops and them receiving them the lord said come come come see that man there none like him say i didn't touch him because i see him behavior rang him he said don't worry take a crack take a crack and see if you can kill him the devil

of god let me see let me wrap up here jesus said i am the vine you're the branches but if that tree ever puts forth another branch it will bear its original fruit and there has got to be a restoration of all these things right at the end of the vine there is to be prophecy comfort a restoration and evening light to light it up and to make it right but it will come out of the vine not a denomination that's grafted into it and there will be a light in the evening time because it takes light to ripen it here we see so there's got to comfort our power shout out power i want you to see this we had 40 or 50 years of teaching of the revelation of these things being made known so god wanted this teaching to unveil and reveal the things that the prophet has revealed make it known but there has to come an hour where you get a manifestation of the things that have been revealed hear the prophecy there's got to comfort power the holy spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove this is about around or to make manifest what he predicted would happen this day the evening light produces that water time oh give the lord may the lord i shout hallelujah hallelujah my lord can you take a little more glory of course you can take a little more you'll leave your house to come here to get something you know commonly they come to go back home they come here to take something ezekiel 37 we know the spiral the heart of the law was upon me value of drag bones he caused me to pass a wronged them about and behold there were very many open valleys although they were very dry i like that description very dry very very dry he said let me solomon can these bones lift watch this god bring ezekiel the value for the dry bones and ask a question look at that look at the condition tell me if that could live now if you watch with your eyes nice bones let me walk over there that like a cemetery nice dry bones what you gonna say i say oh lord god don't do it he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and see unto them all dry bones hear the word of the lord not hear your feelings because your feelings you can't talk with your feelings just hear the word you're speaking the word to your dry condition you're speaking the word to your dry daughter son whatever condition whatever drawing you speak in your word your situation that's why you can't look at the style and the moon to speak a condition you have to look away from that to the circumstance here the man wow what is this how this could happen let's continue watch this prophecy under these bones and see under the bones hear there was the lord thus saith the lord unto these bones i want you to show you how god identified the end game and i answered and said don't know it he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them all ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live so from the very start he is saying bread is coming into them bones now he's going to go through the process of how the bread gonna come into the bones we know the bread coming but it have to have a process for it to come to the bread stage or give the lord a shell so when a prophecy comes it identifies the end you shall receive power [Applause] after the holy ghost has come upon you but it taken seven ages it taken looter it taken wesley it's taken pentecost it taken a process to bring it to the holy ghost itself because they are shouted in the house amen so when god tells ezekiel the bone's gonna get breath hear the process again he said unto me he said i say and i will list sinews upon you and will bring flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you so he is detailing the process by which breath because breakthrough come into bones bones that they get flesh flesh as they get skinned oh give the lord a shout glory to god hallelujah so i prophesy i will listen news upon you and will bring flesh upon you so sin uses muscles and flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know i am the lord so i prophesy as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise it wasn't quite there was a noise this thing start with some noise and the prophet said if there is no noise there is no god if he just quiet something wrong it'd have to have noise oh glory to god when aaron went into that temple they have to have theirs ringing when there was the opponent was praising god continually it'd have to have noise it'd have to have a praise and a blessing a shout a glory a hallelujah glory to god i prophesy i wasn't commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold shaken and bones come together oh glory to god and seven thunder's going to gather the bright together there has to be a gathering it might be small it must be wherever but it's going to be a gathering it's not a one-man island there are no church any backside somewhere or i might just have a nice bright diano bride nice somebody tucked item in the bush hallelujah god said seven thunders going to gather the bright together i can't explain that it will happen because god said it and god can't lie oh exclusive by promise or give the lord a shout bone comfortable bone revival hallelujah holly ankle bone come to knee bone knee bone come to hip bone oh glory to god hallelujah all the balls coming together i can see bone knocking one another bones coming in position because other things have to unfold hallelujah sinews have to come flesh have to come skin after come and breath have to come oh glory to god so don't just watch the bones prophesy oh glory to god i went to the angel i said give me a little book he said take it and eat it don't must prophesy again give the lord a shout there's got to come another prophecy a fresh prophecy of the prophecy [Applause] he said prophesy he said my god so i prophesy i was commanded bones come together and then i behold the sinews and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them and above them there was no where there was no breath in them he said let me prophesy unto the wind prophets i stand a man and say unto them and thou see at the lord god come from the four winds o bret and breed upon these lanes oh glory to god and the angel came down and stuck the four winds oh glory to god i saw another angel from the east having the seed of the living god seal them servants of god a hundred and forty four thousand to be sealed but before they are sealed there's a pride to be sealed that's you oh glory to god so god stopped them four wins he stopped the war they don't want to go and start world war three but you have to stop everything until this pride gets sealed i'm saying to you a cutter of power we ain't gonna press unhaunted dog and there is no power that doesn't make sense oh glory to god you shall receive power wait of the promise of the father oh hallelujah [Applause] prophesied to the wind he said son of man say to the wind dust in the lord come from the foreign breed upon these slain that they may live so i prophesy as he commanded me and the bread came into them and they live and stood up upon their feet and exceeding great army mission come on please oh hallelujah glory i think i'm going to finish with this quote it's one of my favorites i have favorite quotes the one of my favorites like israel back in her homeland she was automatically she was just automatically put there why national force put her in her place true who hitler eichmann stalin god used them to drive his right back to the homeland he said a gentle hand of jehovah guiding them back oh glory to god a gentle hand six million jews died and it's called the gentle hand of jehovah guiding back to the promised land guiding them into position yes i'm going to say something are you ready he's a national force but israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride you want to be in the bride it takes the power of god to put you inside a deer not a man not a church not a doctrine not a teaching not a revelation it will take the power of god let me say it again not a man not a church not a doctrine not a teaching but the power of god whatever we teach whatever we preach it has to produce the power of god let's finish the quote are we going to close so i'm going to get your song national forcept isn't on homeland national force will put the church in the world comes the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god because my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place cause she will recognize a positional word then she's in christ we'll put her in a place no national force will do it if all peter needed was his understanding to be opened and the book to be opened then there was no need for him to go in the upper room peter could have explained to people i know what god said in the word peter could have explained what jesus explained he could have shared what jesus said to them he can share the others but jesus tell them listen man with all you know with all your understanding no upper room you have to wait for the promise of the father hallelujah tarry in the city of jerusalem until until until you receive power from on high when you receive that you'll be positionally placed by power not by revelation but by power and brother branham said gogo calls him aside some sons aside by power by manifestation i know what some sons know is moving by revelation and by inspiration and so but he's going to call some sons by power being placed by power joseph was in prison oh glory to god interpret into the butler interpreting into the baker but he had to be placed by power through process
