deserves the honor he deserves the glory oh hallelujah thank you lord let's bow heads father god we are humble this morning to be in your presence lord and father god we want to remember those believers in florida father god and all those ministers minister pastor wesko but a jackie death by pastor duff and but on the word lord and those are some names that we know and there are many names we don't know many churches many believers many people have been getting away from their homes but we pray that your hand of protection be upon their lives for we are living in trouble as times where the bible prophesy that we're going to see the beginning of sorrows father god help us in this hour that we can be so prepared father and so being the spirit lord and so being revival father that we can keep the fire burning where you place us positionally here on this island father bless the believers everywhere and as we got around your word may your presence be with us in a special way in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you will be seated don't just give god some praises amen [Applause] hallelujah all glory surely surely surely the presence of god is in this place bring greetings amen from africa from uganda and what a tremendous time we had meetings day in uganda and some of you may know some of you may not know but but uh john cecconi pastor who who's pastor he lost his wife maybe about a month and a half ago and you know he was testifying and saying that many people thought he would have canceled meetings but man he had real faith and god blessed him and god bless the meetings in a powerful powerful way [Music] and uh sometimes you have no idea what some of these believers and people go through saving the lord in their countries and so on and because of the opportunity to travel that we see it you know and um we see how god bless fate and sacrifice amen god just god bless laziness and sloppiness and you know the best he blessed faith and sacrifice and um it had over 1 500 believers and over 100 pastors was there we have ministers from both uganda and kenya other parts of africa that came to this meeting it was glorious mighty old point of the spirit there's one time where john county was preaching and that was preaching actually he was talking a little bit before service all of a sudden he just got silent just silent i've never seen anything like that he said he always said he never saw anything like that silent like you could hear a pinfall he said but it is silent and all of a sudden the holy spirit begin to pour out it's not it's not the work of man it's god's work all of a sudden and that's before scripture before scripture was read so it's really powerful to see how the unity and the seatings coming together come into place and uh you have to have a heart for this it has to be in your heart whatever has to come to true to you it has to be in your heart you can't be hoping you have to have a divine revelation and i trust this morning that this word that we're going to be speaking to you would touch your heart and stick to your heart we appreciate brother stephen last sunday [Music] deliver i appreciate that service amen praise the lord amen his words but as i come behind him about how to die about denying yourself and that's what people find it so hard to do they want god to meet them at their level they don't want to come to god's level they want to be as they are live as they are natural and everything must work out just as you want it just as you desire i remember because you and fine no fight no problem no challenges and and that must be your life and god said big fat no amen he said every son that committed god must be tested must be tried he said that you have those spoiled children we spoil our children but god don't have any spoiled children amen so this morning we want to stand up we want to change the order of service and go into the word we want to turn our bibles to hebrews chapter 11. i want to read from verse one to six genesis chapter 22 verse 15 to 18 and matthew chapter 7 verse 24 to 29 i want to greet all those who connected to us on the internet would far and wide god bless you we're happy to hear we're here to serve amen read in genesis hebrews chapter 11. now faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen for by the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith evil offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speak it by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death i was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him genesis chapter 22 verse 15 to 18. and the angel of the lord called unto abram out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn said the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son and only son that in blessing i will bless thee and multiply and i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the sun which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice the last scripture matthew chapter 7 reading from verse 24 therefore whosoever inherit these sins of mine and do with them i would liken him unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell naught for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that here at these scenes of mine and do it them not shall be like likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when jesus had ended these scenes the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as described so this boy has once more father we thank you for your word and any man could reach scriptures but it will take the holy spirit to breed on it and reveal it father we pray you're coming now reveal an anointing and spirit and reveal your word to your people that the leader with a rock and their souls are rocking their heart a rock of revelation father come and confirm a word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name or pour your spirit upon your people this morning amen and amen you may be seated this morning i have a title because thou has done this thing as a title because god has done this thing and have an inspiration the angel is here to drive you back to the tree of life angel is here to drive you back to the tree of life other context scripture i'd like to read now which is from revelation chapter four and it reads after this i looked and behold a door was open heaven and the first voice which i heard was as well trumpet talking with me which said come up hither i will show the things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like jasper and saddam stone and there was a rainbow wrong about a throne in a sight like on an emerald and wrong about the throne were 420 seats and upon the seats i saw 420 elders sitting closing in white arrangement and they had on their heads crowned of gold and out of the throne proceed lightnings thunders thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the troll which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto a crystal and a midst of the throne wrong about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind first beast was like a lion second beast like a calf the third beast had a face as a man the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four piece had each of them six swings about him they were full of eyes within and the rest not day and night saying holy holy lord god almighty which was which is and is to come and we find out that this book of revelation we know is a book of symbols all the beasts and all the things that you're hearing is represent something it means something is not just idly placed here there's a purpose behind every scripture every word that god speaks in that bible okay here we go but from this is from melchizedek the great prince and king there are three elements that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation and third is vision that is thus saith the lord so the majority of humans walk in the earth follow the humanistic realm that's the realm of your five senses as a realm of your emotions and your feelings and this one hurts you and you're troubled and everything else that's just humanistic above that level is the realm of divine revelation so from a humanistic standpoint sarah couldn't have a child from a natural standpoint ibrahim is too old but from a revelation standpoint isaac is coming [Applause] if he lives at the humanistic realm he will doubt god he can't come to the spot to believe he will have that child but the bible said abram believed god to do that he had to jump over his humanistic [Applause] to believe in the divine revelation of what god said to him that he amidst his trying times could say god said so whatever proof you have god said so sorry i can't show you this but god said so and god is not a man that would lie if god said it it's gonna come to pass if god said it it would materialize if god said it he don't need no help to bring it to pass which realm are you following this morning hallelujah is the only tree [Music] let your mother say or your father say or your uncle or your brother or your grandmother say that's them saying what did god say amen well my feelings tell me and i feel so and i dream this last night i have nothing to do with that i want to know what god said i don't want to hear about your dream i don't want to hear about your feelings i don't want to hear about human spirit i don't want to hear about your emotions i want to hear what god said [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah red sea in front mountains on both sides coming behind and the people demanding what is going on moses and moses began to whimper and cry and god said why cry unto me speak and move forward moses backslid and fell from faith into the humanistic realm behind the anna rock the crowd to god god rebuked him push him forward don't talk like that don't think like that don't walk like that don't express that it walk fit speak for it act it lift it the josh shall live thy faith okay the lord i shout in the house [Applause] oh the human instagram can't help you much in expected to live here i think they say nice that's your taste a feeling is that you're feeling emotions your affection and so that that's nice but to take beyond that they take a higher order you take a higher pull and that's the pull of divine revelation he says again the third element is vision or i'll pray again the three elements that people dwell in the first one is humanistic you like the stars the fashion the world and things that i'm taking on this one have that and this one's going and i'm a friend doing this and i want to do that too this one pulling here that one pulling only humanistic right and then the next one is revelation that's isn't that's when something done on your heart anchors it and says it's going to happen then something could happen i remember doing the government exams the pastor get employment and um you know yeah they gave up the same time to do the exams and so on and i know this girl know what she's studying and studying i i think you know they did it for some fail but i i i didn't do it this time that she did it and something tell me i'm going to pass this time and what i studied is what come what she studied did not come but i had faith in my heart that i was going to succeed and i did that was something else it was almost like if it's like a revelation that i'm going to get through so i'm not coward at what i study i have to believe that what i am studying right now discovering the people so it's not that i will say i'm not going to study i'm going to study a little thing before the exam and what that little thing that come don't go and do that you know make sure i study it don't take that as and that third element is vision which is the word of the lord made manifest when you see it and it's thus saith the lord that's like what a brother but a brahmana mad when he was in india i think it was india and um some blind man or something like that and he brought him forth and and the lord showing that he'll be healed and he said if this man how much will give this heart life to jesus christ if this god opened his eyes at this blind man worshipping the son and go open the eyes with blind man that was thus said the lord he had a vision it couldn't feel and so on so that's the three elements isn't that right the third is vision that is dusty at the lord that is perfect that is positive when you break into vision isn't that right now back in genesis everything started in the beginning there were two boys king and evil not ten just two boys amen and god invite them to worship all right let's see they'll get this quickly the other fine i'll read it and in the process of time this is genesis chapter four it came to pass that cain brought forth the fruit of the ground as an offering unto the lord and abel also brought forth the first name of his flock and of the father of and the lord had respect unto evil and his offering under the king and his offering he had not respects and king was very wrought his consonants fell and the lord said unto the king why are thou wrought why are thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shall thou be accepted and if thou doest not wealth in light at the door and unto thee shall be his desire though shall rule over him and we know the story can come and kill evil but god actually challenged them to come to the altar to make the offering one bring fruits of his interpretation the other one just take a lamb and kill it and that blood come out and god said send fire upon that offering and vindicated abel's offering and that's why i read the scripture by faith abel offered a sacrifice which god confirmed that he was righteous because he break into a realm where it wasn't his ability or works or laboring it'll feel and planting and reaping it was a lamb he took a blood something that struck him isn't that right it was revealed to him so brother branham says uh those boys after seeing that have been made mortal and was going to die here we go they tried to find favor with god they both come making a sacrifice and if god only require religion then cain was justified king was just as believing as evil believed cain came with a sacrifice just as abel came with a sacrifice but cain's sacrifice was by works he raised his garden he brought his fruit the best he could find but abel was justified by fate because he come with a lamb oh could we give god praises for that hallelujah praise the name of the lord watch now when cain came and knelt down and built an altar i imagine they come to the east side of the gate and there is where the angels stood with this flaming sword you remember what happened when they got run out of gardener eden angels will stay with flaming sword to guard the tree of life that man in that goodness wouldn't partake of the tree of life and have eternal life in that terrible condition so the angel was sent to guard it to block man from participating about it isn't that right so watch the angel stood with his flaming sword god in the tree of life by the way he was guarding the people away from the tree of life but now he is trying to drive the people back to the tree of life and you know what history of life is right that's jesus christ isn't that right now jesus was our tree of life the woman was the tree of death we are the fruit of our mother she was the fruit tree by woman come dead and by woman come life which is true mary virgin born is not right but that person had to die but the man born of the spirit of god never dies going to church making a sacrifice worshipping god if that's all that god requires he will be cruel to condemn a man that met that requirement amen but you see there's a way to seem right unto a man but at the end there is death there's a way that god comes and that's the only way you are ever going to get there are you listening to me praise god that's the only way you're going to get there no there's a way that oh god i know you and it's the way that god provides for you and the whole bible is built upon revelation the entire bible so when you come to church you already come to get in the spirit and not just get information you could see a woman read information but when you come to church you get an opportunity for the spirit to come upon you and take this information and transform it into revelation then it's not information to you it's revealed to you then you could worship then they could shout then they could bring your offer into the altar then fire to fall upon you listen it's already the substance of what you're hoping for it's not yet but you believe it will be that's revelation it's not yet but you believe it will be you believe god bless you it's not yet but you believe it will be you believe god will heal you it's not yet but you believe it will be these men natural men we call following them and say what do men say i am you see some men say you're this i mentioned that he's who do you say i am and they got caught they didn't know who he was all of a sudden peter broke them but they were the christ the son of the living god and jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal that unto you but my father it has not revealed it unto you and upon this rock i will build my church not some church building my church and the case of i will never prevail against it it means once that rock strikes your soul lord devil anger take that prophet you can fight with it but he can't take it that's why you were here this morning there's a rock inside you there is something inside of you that's why you say amen to the world that's why you fall down get back up get something inside of you that the devil can't take off he didn't put it he can't take it out [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah that's why god gonna find his seed everywhere back fighting can't keep them seized back that lion's den cassicles fiery furnace sickness no wonder paul said what shall separate me from the love of god in christ jesus [Applause] nothing present nothing to come no wife problem no husband problem no children problem no money problem no kind of problem come on give the lord some praises [Applause] no old age problem [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah even paul said death where is this thing breathe where's your victory paul was dancing on their death where is your sting you casting me i'm going to rise hallelujah i'm gonna rise let me shake a little bit toasty answers one day people just booked just come on so when you get horrors in eternity there is just a small piece a break in timing a brick of eternity a kink an eternity called time and god put you here to live for him and to honor him and to bring forth seas of righteousness to bring forth more evils praise god and this time king can't kill it this time we're going in the rapture this time we go for translation power we're going for rapture and faith isn't that right oh glory to god hallelujah so therefore you can't build the church upon sensation you can't build it on nothing else but christ which is the revelation of jesus christ question do you have a revelation of jesus christ amen that is what you need to have amen if you don't have jesus christ you will see there's a man standing up there in a tiny pulpit and he's saying things to me i'm taking what i want like if it's a buffet style and you don't want that [Applause] are you with me okay let's continue now god called abraham and he was just an ordinary man i want you to know all right you don't have to be a special person for god to call i love that give your praises i'm not there as you hear and eaten good just say hallelujah you don't have to be a special man for god to call [Music] and abraham was elected how does god call you bye so who he phoned you he called you only recently called you he was thinking about you not now before you fall before your backslide before you fell in sin before you did this and did that and did that and did that and did that and all you did and what you didn't do he's thinking about you and he still choose you that's why you should be shouting this morning that's why you should be praising god this morning so when god elected you hallelujah he elected you to be abraham's seed in thy sea shall all well be blessed because god has done this thing you see abraham do a certain thing and god told abraham even blessed i will bless thee and multiply and multiply thy seed and thy seed this morning shall possess the gates of the enemy get the lord off [Applause] but is it possible for me to leave with my portion this morning yes yes you know what i wasn't thinking about it i want you to think about it you're not going to leave the ordinary this morning you're going to take your fate push your feet pick up what is yours and walk out of here with it no peek and can't stop you no elder can stop you no minister to stop you it is yours revival is yours deliverance yours healing is yours virtue is yours your family is yours [Applause] let me be seated so don't come with no small prayers [Music] [Applause] they're coming back his mind they have no right being in that condition satan i say when you notice yes yes yes you think a little like a little toe i like a little toy valentine i can still walk on you praise god i can stand for you praise god pray the weakest saint praise god howling and knees hallelujah oh you committed a soul of his feet you are a position to stamp on that devil you may not be a hand you may not be a wherever you are you have an opportunity to stomp on that devil oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god how many want to break through this morning that's good that's good that's good sit down and choke sit right right now and give us some shouts proving if it's terrible you could signal that shot but shout god suppose suppose this is the last service suppose it's the last service we'll be having we've got earthquake coming next few hours or tomorrow or next week it's the last service what were you giving it even angry hallelujah that's what you're giving keep it the endless worship four peace person thousand ten thousand pressure this is what we're supposed to give every time every time get in your heart give them your faith give them your praises [Applause] imagine the first few days how are you feeling there no different hallelujah seriously i'm not different my lord she got up by faith she dream of revelation see how you're feeling no different he said no problem you're gonna have it anyhow [Applause] could you go to that kind of test you might have revelation but you have it and you have to believe god for her could you go to that test or you're feeling the same way after 10 months same way after 10 years same way and you're saying abraham you like nothing [Applause] afterwards the devil would bang your mind to say your shoulder ain't nothing that is really nothing you know the devil will tell you that but abraham believed god not his feelings not the humanistic not them five senses not his wrinkles not not taking notice his false teeth hallelujah gives the lord a shout in the house he just believed god and i come to that spot i just believe god i don't care what condition you're in i am believing god for you i get how you feel this morning if you ever want to praise god this morning if you're born this morning i am believing for you if you don't believe for yourself [Applause] god has sent me to the bunch of unbelievers there are people here that believe he's gonna use believers he gonna use you who believe because there was done this thing there's a thing for you to do come on now come on now

redemption thank god for his blood thank god for his protection thank god that he's my rock he's my shield [Applause] may be seated so abraham's seed takes god's promise and anything contrary to the lie [Applause] now remember abraham when this promise was made was given to him on the sea the only thing he had to do was to stay in the promised land as long as you stay in the promised land it will work praise god praise the name of lord do you believe that but abandon read that scripture that we read about anybody hear my words like a wise man who bless house upon a rock because why the rains are coming the storms are coming you see as long as there's no storms houses look nice all right the one in the sun and one of the rock looking very nice sometimes he wanted to stand the pain better and have a better roof the roof is more expensive but it is built on sand and it's not tested yet all right all right so they have parties they have investment but it's built on sun and sun and the storm may come here but as long as there's no storm it's the best house in the street hallelujah five years no stop all right ten years no storm but storm coming it always does 50 say amen that's all right the rest will have to say amen i'm begging you it's just the truth and i can't lie to you because it wouldn't set you free if the truth will set you free see if your storm has reached yet it's coming 25 saying on that you think florida asked for this storm you think foreign come on bring it on no it's just coming and if a storm is coming you make preparation you stay and hang out or get out some people say they're staying in the boat some people are staying in the house some people are real brave aren't you saying brave that foolish because you're warning us for purpose you could lose your house but you don't want to lose your life say they said get out get out more than a million people how much people believe getting out that come by the whole train not emptied out could you imagine that there's a storm coming everybody get out to where so brother brown you ready to skip scripture let's go further jesus was speaking here in the message of the coming storm about the coming storm here we go are you ready which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world there is no way out of it the storm will strike you some time or another and depends on what kind of foundation you have whether your house will weather it or not many lives have been saved because of preparation for storms there are many of life lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming a long ago a story happened i believe it was in florida they had great storms sweep through florida typhoons off the sea big blocks into the city sweeps out everything i can stop you and preach for hours so it is today all we know is that we have got an uncommon storm and the only win i know can turn that storm have to be a russian wind that fell on their pentacles he said he was talking about akatobi which was in florida and there was a neighbor man who kept in contact with radio because of these storms he was a very renowned christian he heard that great typhoon was coming that way twisted down trees and everyone was warned to get to safety he thought of his neighbor who had a chicken farm had some light buildings with their chickens in them brew the houses so for pens and they had in his life was tied up with them chickens for the living he rushed quickly frantically up to the gate and stopped his car jump out said to the fellow take all the chickens put them in your storm shelter you rush over to mine because there's coming a typhoon a storm that's going to twist everything down that's what he's sharing with his neighbor all right the man stood looking in the face and laughed at him he said nonsense i have heard them predict such a thing before and it never happened and the christian neighbor was so excited he said but what if it does happen we we we hear remarks like along the line i've heard of this going to happen and what's going to happen and it's going to happen one of these days but it behooves us to listen to every warning but this man said i have no time for this foolishness i raise chickens i have no time for such he cried out the neighbor said in the name of god leave those chickens alone john come quickly you and your family if you don't want to believe it let your family come he said i will not have my children to be excited over a few radio warnings my children and i have decided we will live as i live my wife will listen to me because i am the breadwinner of this hole [Music] and she must listen to me i am the boss here and i will not have my children all excited to talk about some nonsense and the neighbor turned he went to his home into the shelter all of a sudden the cloud was upon him before he knew it that's the way judgment strikes it comes so sudden you wonder how it can get there so quick how i have seen cruel men who once chris god fall and scream and say how could you treat me this way the whole foundation swept out from under him in a moment it pays to take warning you might laugh at the messenger you might be able even able to kill him but you cannot kill the message it will go on just the same while the storm swept the country it caught the chicken house the farmer they never found his body his wife frantically fighting they live close to the great okeechobee lake and the waters begin to rise as a typhoon lifted waters all the way from the bottom of the lake and that's what make it so dangerous the boats rock how the waves come up and turn the boats beneath them the storm come up swirls picks them up for miles the water is sweeping until the mother knows there was no hope you were to get a chair into the top of the building she got to the top of the building with the children hold on to the chimney of the house and the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasin i believe a more deadly snake than your diamond back rattler they were calling for safety and they come up on the roof also with her and by listening to her husband listen carefully by listening to a husband not taking heat to the warning so this is not a family warning hallelujah this is an individual warning [Music] and by listening to our husband not a key to the warning she stomped she beat she had to stand and watch was vicious snake bite her children until they die on the roof and the mother herself was bitten so much until she died and that's the only way we got the story after the storm acquired and search parties hunting for buddies they found a lane on the top of the roof with a children laying by a side it appears to take warning the first thing to do before there can be a warning there had to be a preparation made for safety so what do you tell them in florida there is a safety place leave your house and get the deer it have food there you have dead deer you know whatever it is the structure can withstand the storm go there so before god could give a warning they have to be a safe place isn't that right and the warning is only a voice of one having you to prepare for the danger there has to be a preparation made first and if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward to cause you to make a decision because god has done this thing the warning challenges you to make a decision life is about decisions about actions about what people do isn't that right quota is the same method whether you listen to it or not if you don't want to listen to it that's up to you if you listen to it there is safety jesus if you don't listen and do it what he says you're full you're foolish man if you're listening to what he said you're a wise person that's the problem today about young people don't want to listen you want to do their own thing because they feel their heat on this side of energy on this side they have time on the side you don't have that amen amen you have to have god on your side so god has the same method we work on god's method in that way in the early days when the people got so wicked god could not look upon it he has laws when those laws are broken has no penalty there isn't a law the reason that there is a law it has to have a penalty for it to be a law if there is no penalty there is no law just do what you're doing you break the red light there's no charge there's no ticket you go over speed there's no ticket there's no there's no law then everybody do their own thing but the reason they have a penalty it's just a law however the law goes a penalty there's a price isn't that right watch so any law that's broken has no penalty isn't the law you cannot break the laws of god but without having to pay for it somewhere you must do it be sure your sins don't find you out there only to watch so therefore many people think smoking cigarette is a sin it isn't many people think that lion is a sin it isn't committed adultery isn't a sin these are attributes of unbelief the only two things either you believe or you're unbeliever if you believe you don't do this thing amen so when you are born you are born from above and you have the holy spirit coming from god listen that changes your nature no matter your sister your mother your best friend could be dressed that way but the christian that's born of the spirit of god is born from above their spirit is of another kingdom you are ruled or governed from above your influences even your hair style is from above it influences not what hollywood have your clothing is not influenced by hollywood it's influence from above isn't that right [Applause] i'm so glad the simpleness of the holy spirit to follow it watch it how it behaves and makes you believe now here we go the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another person amen so that's why it's so flimsy when people say i don't believe it like how you see it i i see it so i see it so or when you look at their life and their behavior no behavior so their their behavior come to adoption or teaching but that's not right that's why brother branham said i prefer somebody right in spirit and wrong in doctrine that to be wrong in spirit and right and doctrine if you're right in spirit you could be helped you could be spoken to you could be corrected you could be rebuked you could be instructed you could be guided god told everyone because you have heard obeyed my voice because you have obeyed my voice you see god told abram to offer isaac his only son this was his testimony hold on for 25 years he was asking abraham to give up the only thing he had what he stood for for 25 years and abraham told them men i am the lad we go up and we're coming down and he knew that he was offended by that isaac didn't know but abraham knew that so when they were growing up the boy's not foolish the boy said dad i see the wood i see fire but where is he sacrificed [Music] how are we doing this thing and god and abraham said god will provide for himself [Applause] abraham is climbing up hallelujah going up the mountain all right because god himself telling the monkey in advance he said keep on traveling until i show you the mountain to make sure everybody pass the mountain praise god thank you imam is going to mountain amen then he come to our spot jesus wait grab his son tired hallelujah and his son and fighting up you know praise god don't fight to the father don't touch me what if that was the kind of son of abraham scripture had to be corrected different scripture you got nixon you see that son obeying the father following instructions raise a voice now i know because those done this thing you're willing to give it your own come on you're willing to give your best you're willing to make a sacrifice [Music] [Applause] i see your heart i see your intent i see your motive i see your objective and i'm going to honor you i'm going to bless you not only you but your seed [Applause] okay the lord i shout because you have done this thing i am going to bless you i'm going to multiply you and your she's going to jump that devil your secret to possess the kids of the enemy you're going to back up sickness you're gonna back up diseases [Applause] somebody going free this morning somebody gonna be delivered inside of here this morning p.i abraham's loyal seed come on church you're not here to murder your dress you're here to worship god you're not to show off your jacket forget about your time give god some praises give god some worship [Applause] [Music] [Applause] after god a custom fellowship we'll do the sun every evening cool of the evening and he come and miss adam and the preacher said miss there's no sound service no atmosphere nobody no believers then god come to talk to his son church call and there's nobody there you gotta go inside adam where every day i come in and talk with you because this was my intent and desire to have sons that i could communicate with and relate to and talk to and i'm feeling good talking to my son every evening i'm looking forward to that fellowship god misses fellowship amen when they find adam not in his position adam where are you where are you he said i heard your voice and and he got in hiding and why are you hiding as a naked who told you we're naked did you eat up the tree yes um the woman no no he has no other brothers there him he's had no other people to adam head you know this is the first man don't pass anything already he's hitting on me or she and she said disappointed me so she passing on to god said unto the supreme because god has done this yes yes yes above all cattle but every beast and upon thy belly shall go it wasn't a snake like before he not going into that form he was upright god said no you're going down on the ground upon thy belly child i'll go already in jackseed gonna be evil king but curse discipline isn't that right then god went to the woman unto the woman because that was done this i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow shall i bring forth children and the desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee then for adam because i was done this because i was hacking unto the voice of thy wife and eaten up that tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curse is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall i eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and tissues shall it bring forth unto thee those shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread till thou return unto the grunge from out of it was thou taken for dust hallelujah so there are decisions that we have to make and the consequences of those decisions and actions amen hallelujah and if we do the right thing we get the right results when rebecca was caught if she would go to meet isaac a man she never saw and they asked her will you go to this man she said i will go she said the right thing and when she said that they told her may you be the mother of millions and may your seed possess the gates of them that hate him oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah what is god doing bringing forth the seed of the righteous i hope you see who you are i hope you see what lineage you come from i hope you understand you're not a serpent seed you're not a devil child oh come on get the lord a shock you are sons and daughters of the living god god know what you're going through god feel your pain he knows your struggle keep on struggling keep on fighting oh hallelujah [Applause] so the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person i'm behaving on myself in another it will make each person come into its character because it's the spirit that leads you you are subject to its nature it don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subjugate its nature and the holy spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the holy spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him on a thirst and a hunger just baiting yourself he brings realities don't watch your organization watch the way the spirit is leading and if the spirit is leading it will never lead you contrary to the word it will never misbehave itself it will stay with the world oh glory to god could we go a little further be in for feast this morning from possessing me and amy gates braham was reading and the angel called the ibrahim heaven the second time by myself have i sworn said the lord because i was done this thing now god has been testing the patriarch why why why the test comes because he had given him a promise no promise no test hallelujah did you get that amen once god gave you a promise here come the test why because god gave you a promise amen hallelujah i want to be a man on that because i'm talking your promise to you if god give you a promise here comes the test why deceive you worthy of that promise [Applause] when god makes a promise thank you jesus he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or promised if you think you will sit down and say god said so and you're not saying so too you're in trouble amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's not yours wherever you put it this morning wherever you want to put it you can put it on healing you can put it on deliverance you can put it on the holy ghost you can put it on ceiling you can put it on breakthrough [Applause] wherever [Applause] you want every fiber of your body to be filled with the holy ghost you want your mind with fire you want your heart with fire you want your hands with fire you want your foot with fire you want to be with consumed for all around you that's what i want [Applause] what do you want you wanna be seasoned oh i didn't hallelujah the worship anymore just sit down [Music] go stop the worship you know what i want when i want fire all around me the devil already seeing light but he must see fire he must say danger danger don't touch that man watch him but don't touch him because he's anointed he is commissioned to cast me out come on say him and somebody we have a commission jesus said in my name we're going to cast the devil out we are chasing devils this morning we are casting on spirit this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory may be seated that woman hallelujah [Music] diapers terrorizing them hallelujah they run to jesus actually just won't just unless one for me jesus said it's not fit to take the children's bread and casted the dogs just even looking at the woman and no one stood there call me a door call me a door but i my fear tells me this would have the answer my faith tells me this god man have the answer my faith tells me that man who's standing there more than a man standing there my faith tells me don't move i am moving if anybody want to move that's them i'm not moving my faith tell me i can't have a solution i recommend a question i come with an answer i come here for a result i come for a response my daughter mess with the devil i can't go to the pharisees and i know about that i can't decide you see they don't know about that but this man he has power to speak he has power to cast hotels i'm not moving praise god even the dogs get crumbs as she got to see the dogs she break from the humanistic she break into revelation then she break into vision so she's seeing the dogs eating the crumbs that she's poking even the doors get crumbs for this scene for this scene she said the right thing you could say the right thing watch that moat watch that moat out of the mold comes life or death watch that tongue say the right thing don't say you don't care care don't say i'm going to suffer the consequences care about it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come in the church god bless you my brother god bless you my sister they offered to sell their goods and bring money to the church nobody asked them it wasn't demanded of them nobody asked them or push them or force them they make a choice but an ass come to peter i see this there's it here you see that that's all yeah he choose to be dishonest peter said you are light to me you lied to the holy ghost fall down dead wife coming no she's living with her husband she must know the man he's a liar he's a crook he's dishonest she's living with that for years she knows that she also have a choice not to side with that that packs you out also because she talked just like she husband perished and brother branham said it will repeat amen disrespects will be judged jesus said it this way he said i do this while they come against it that's fine but when the holy ghost comes back and do these things one word against it will not be forgiven in this world or the world to come when the holy ghost begins to work that is what we're waiting on that's what we're on the expectation for for the spirit of god to begin to flow freely because god gonna find a bunch god gonna find a people gonna find people somewhere on this earth that he could walk through the spirit of god dear is my spirit flowing freely hallelujah all glory to god it will change one day from the teachings to the manifestation of god hallelujah when jesus begins his ministry there was there was challenging they they wondered about his authority because his doctrine was so different he was preaching with the authority of god so buddha says and after watch so abram has been promised that tourists see the whole world be blessed and we find out when he was 75 years old and serious white was 65 years old and that abram's stuck under the promise of god from belief it was strong giving praise to god and god time after time tested him and he come to that here we go are you ready are we going to bring a notebook and a pen i want to be able to write down stuff time after time was testing him are you ready and there come a time final test before the blessing was going to happen you've been as a final test you can't feel that one you know amen amen that is final test before you get your blessing hallelujah and that's the way it is with all the seed of abraham god gives us that final test just before he gives the promise are you ready for some more and if it's possible i'd like to say something here personally i will hold that that final test is to see how you will react upon it notice when god called people out from egypt he called them out to give him a good land right and we find out he blessed them in the wilderness the journey and everything else when he reached camisbania which was the final junction to cross over he sent 12 spies one from each tribe to bring back testimony of evidence of the land he's a good god and the promise and so on all ten brothers came up early brought their evidence but said we saw giants question giant see you no they didn't see us but we soldiers they're real big the biggest we ever see in town caleb and joshua came back afterwards and they came back to see the whole camp under a spell of unbelief doubt questioning and awareness and heaviness here it is this will be dancing on the hill of glory because we're crossing over yonder and whatnot that they're supposed to be dancing but instead of meeting dancing and shouting and rejoicing i said that deadbeat people all elders and them sitting down there everybody moping because i have giants in it caleb and joshua come and say we are wherever you are to take that man because god said so they have no they have no uh you know i haven't been careful with my words because i don't want to offend nobody i'm negative and i don't want to come like you know i don't want to shine my light too bright they have no shiny light too bright them guys was confident they were positive or this land is my land they have milk and honey god is able to have healing in it is that breakthrough in it it's a prayer life restored and have deliverance revival fire hungering and taste now the righteousness of all kind of help for joy peace long suffering goodness meekness [Applause] hallelujah all of that in it where were able well the whole point said well you're not able you know all right because you take 40 years on that sentence them for 40 years you said not born or you're going over yeah your children would but not you you will see it and composite 40 years 40 years until they drop off when caleb come for his portion to joshua he said you know what moses said because moses said because you have holy follow the lord hebron will be yours and caleb knew hebron is his own so when the time came for lamb being divided he said no careful give me my mountain because i have done this thing working only follow the lord and you are entitled to the holy ghost if you obey god for obedience to the whole world of god entitles you i am here for the holy ghost because i holy follow the lord give me my mountain oh give the lord some praises [Applause] oh glory to god so god have to bring you to the spot where you have to make your claims yeah commenting on a priesthood the catholic church have that great priest there's something in the mouth and bless you and whatnot daisy catholic church this is not that this is the voice told john go to the angel and say to the angel give me the book hallelujah when that voice was saying who is worthy to take the book god wants action there are things you've got to do got to go to the angel give me the book in that book of my name in that book of power in that book of the anointing in that book after faith in that book of the seals come and give me the book oh give the lord a shout in the heart glory love god [Applause] adam had the book the book was in adam adam wants to call your name from the book but because adam fell the book went back to god and the book was sealed up oh glory to god it was the tree of life become the book of life the seals of life it had gods around the book angels which saw god in that book all around that book but praise god and in revelation there was four beasts living creatures one with a man face one with an eagle face one with a lion face oh glory to god one with the oak's face what are they the guardians of the throne who give the lord some praises people give the lord some praises people oh glory to god [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory glory to god the goddess of the trump the holy spirit is him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes [Applause] [Applause] praise god for that lord's coin praise god the prophet said hallelujah woman lost her coin she didn't have the ring in that time that a a ban another wedding ring and in the banner coins all right and they found adultery they this woman lost a coin she didn't come in the dollar tree she lost a coin she had to find it before her husband come because if it's missing she'll be taken as adulterous so she begin to search she began to fight she won the blood of her age the word of the age the voice of the age because the voice of the age is broadly kindness spirit of forgiveness here's why faith is based on kind forgiveness get can't get fake without faith you can't get the holy ghost you need faith you need forgiveness you need to drop your hearts you need the blood of the age drink that you have to find it oh glory give the lord a shout [Applause] she swept the walls she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she had lost when she did she cornered little sister changes come now i don't care if you're a methodist baptist pentecostal i look at what massachusetts belong to what could belong to i don't care because i found it when you find it you don't care you have it you forgive it [Applause] you're sticking with honey you're sticking with forgiveness if people bought you you just stick with it amen you're sticky with love [Applause] so the prophet prophesied let us rejoice together then he prophesied when that time comes when the church finds his brotherly love all right when the church finds his holy spirit when the church finds its place in christ it will cause the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants the church to love him oh glory to god god wants the church to love him what's the objective zetti tantong does clash how's my wife and everything else what's the objective of oats grudges and all these different things to cut you off listen carefully from being and speak in terms with god you see the devil know he can't take away your sonship [Music] but he can mess you up that you can't talk to god [Music] [Applause] you're still a son but you can't communicate with your father your father have a couple of thousand hills and you can't go wrong you scrunching and your father is a big boss because you're in a backseating condition you can't ask what you will because you're not abiding you're not in the spirit [Music] hallelujah so he doesn't know he can't tell you another son you know your son all right but what he could do he can make a whole lot and whether or not you can't go to the altar all right come on now you're gonna bury the idiot leave your gift at the altar and go to your brother go to your sister and make it right then come back so as long as you have an oath or a grudge or something inside of you he will catch you [Applause] they will buy you by making you bang yourself [Applause] come on now so when you have an oath against this one anger this one and that one rapper the devil making you bang yourself but when you drop it when you stand praying forgive me if you have ought against any that your father in heaven will forgive you of your trespasses if you do not forgive neither will your father [Applause] so the objective of brotherly kindness is to bring you back and to speak in terms with god i'll give the lord a shout out how could a man really get into god's presence and condemn another man how could you do that amen you and god's presence that's why hatred malice anger and whatnot can't pray for your husband because you're doing this and the other and you hold a grudge and hold up earth and they come in you can't drop it because he hit you and that is the humanistic realm yeah you feel any hurt because it's in your spirit amen that's not revelation and you're really mad and you're really angry you know it god know it everybody know it they see it but you are called to drop it [Applause] yes [Applause] i went and cried at jesus feet i began to cry and so on when she received a pardon this woman was so sinful her sin has been forgiven she could rejoice so much because her sin was so many you see when you experience god's grace you could release god's grace to others when you truly get an experience of the grace of god you could offer it you could share it you could give it you could release it when you get god's forgiveness in your life you can release it you can give it because as god give you you could give others get the lord's time crazy [Applause] you cannot get anything from god [Applause] behind the emotions because all that you are all that you ever will be is based upon faith in the word satan god oh glory to god that's why the intellectual spirit could never understand the noise i'm the shout and the worship the intellectual spirit want to question a fine show and i find to always have a question why so why so byzo [Applause] no i am the resurrection i am the life where have you laid him roll away the stone lazarus come forth that's fake that's how faith lives that's how faith speaks a centurial man came to jesus he said my lord that's sick all right just i'm not even worthy for you to come under

if jesus speak it it's got to come to pass [Applause] jesus said yes he has never seen faith like that in israel that was not baptized believer no that was not church going member that was a centurion therefore god respected faith not his color skin not his height not his roman just the faith produced the result god didn't ask the woman who said amen the dogs and the crumbs and so on what kind of woman she is just the fate did it where is your fate this morning showing you your faith could do it your faith could bring forgiveness of your sins your faith could bring healing healing unforgiveness come together god can forgive you and heal you right now yes your faith could produce healing praise god the woman with the blood issue she told herself she didn't get the church and get

you've got a solution from god you may be seated notice what jesus said he never said he never said my virtue healed you he said i faith had made you home and it was you you had the key amen to your own healing i didn't know looking you had the key faith is the key and that could unlock the door to every blessing that god has once faith is applied once that faith is turned once that faith is expressed god must respond he got to respond only thing that moved god is faith when god saw those hebrew boys say our god is able to deliver and if we don't deliver us we will not bow down when those brothers step into the fire the fate of those brothers brought the fourth man in the fire amen and i'm telling you if your faith come on display right now you will see fire you will see god almighty

creed under christ by the baptism of the holy spirit and back to the world on the deer we have unity baptism and back to the world how many crying fights lord baptize my soul with the holy ghost and this was only made possible when god sent the seven seals and gave us a sign by it he sent seven angels jump from heaven what's the purpose what's the point of seven angels they come down to bring back this scattered word in them denominations and tied back into the word to bring down the holy ghost so the word was divided to seven church ages oh glory to god i'm feeling good now feel the spirit moving now the world was divided through seven ages and under them seven ages have four anointings the spirit of the lion paul hallelujah irenaeus martin hallelujah the spirit of the ox columba

earth give the lord a shout he saw you called he saw you sealed he saw you with him for dynamics to take you off the earth oh glory of god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory thank you jesus you will be seated he is the dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and we see him uniting himself with us with his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper oh glory to god let me give you a big bomb you don't have to know the mechanics you just have to know the dynamics the thing that pulsated they don't have to nobody spark plug and the engine and the fan on the radiator and the gas pump no just tumble the car and just drive go give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] oh give the lord a shout of appreciation oh hallelujah [Applause] you don't have to know the mechanics when i take your bank card and push it in the machine you ain't hold out working and get your number and whatnot any money coming up you know somebody behind it took any money out they know your business if somebody standing there and pushing it out you don't even know but what do you know when you put in your card press your pen and butt that's what you know you want if you put it and nothing come out you're in trouble but when you put it something come off that's what you want you want to spend it you want to do something with it that's what we're talking about that's what you will shall be done unto you you want to know you can get what you asked for [Applause] glory hallelujah when lasted give the lord a show don't be afraid to open your mouth john said all on earth all under heaven heard i praise god [Applause] the church is ready she has sealed him there will be a big old point of the spirit that will grab the church and take him to the skies so you everywhere you're supposed to be looking for that or point of the spirit you don't have to know the mechanics just know the dynamics the things that pulsated that's what god wants to fill you with he wants you filled with the holy ghost and then you will be knighted to our creed no sir you'll be added to god then brother will really be brother sister will really be sister your objectives your motives all that you are all that you ever will be or try to be will be for the kingdom of god and that's what i've been fighting for all these years i told him in uganda i'm not here to represent trinidad i'm here to represent the kingdom of the most high god oh glory to god i'm a citizen of that kingdom and i cannot be deported oh give the lord some precious people this is where i belong this is where i live walk in the spirit lead in the spirit preaching the spirit praying the spirit this is the kingdom [Applause] hallelujah mind my mind so all that you are all that you ever want to be you're trying to be waiting for the kingdom of god no matter what church you represent where you go or what you do there are so many people today who says the holy spirit is not a real today why tens of thousands are saying it's not so there are many enjoying the blessings of it mostly are poor people that's why the rich gospel is is false because god will all be poor people and and blessings don't ever change you my god hallelujah praise god i've never seen blessings change people i've seen people get greedy with blessings more mean and stingy with blessings all right but not changed trials changer 25 say amen distance changer fire action tribulation pressure thunder [Applause] watch your heart is his country room your heart is the control room controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions making you one with him in fellowship and in love god fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature he changes your carnal nature into his nature then you become a new creation in christ hallelujah then the love you go out the bird sings different whoa it's different when christ come in you have no enemies they all look sweet you can forgive everything that had ever been done the bitterness of enemy you could pray for him on the street you could put your hammer wrong here no matter what creed no matter what denomination he belongs to he's a creature who christ died for that is what god wants you filled with it [Applause] not not this thing where you cut you can't stand the sinners are you looking for a mountain to climb up on you don't want to see the world or the things of the world jesus didn't pray that prayer no he said father they are in the world keep them they're not off but they're in hallelujah amen that's what god wonderfully with that's the filling that's the kingdom how different it is today oh hallelujah you talk about the queen of sheba she wants under the wisdom of salaman she come with leading cameras with gold and more than frankincense costly apparel it's right if god is real then i am true with this thing i've been serving i'm going to support it with everything i got that's the attitude listen god is not concerned about how much money but he wants you to support him with all you are you don't want 10 of your money so much as he wants your time your talent your testimony all that you are is to be given into his hands so he could control you he wants to be your lord not only your savior he wants your talent he wants your time you are trying to do everything but permitted time to do everything but to come to church time to do everything else how much time you in church when you come to church you're not putting all into it usia was called to be king yes and you know he perished and so on i think his and he was a watch oh he's talking he was a king at the age of 16 years old after his father death his father was a great believer and he saw he had a godly father and a godly mother and i think that's a very fine example for we parents today set an example before children your best your worst at home and i think our lives though our children might not just exactly act but they are noticing it they are noticing it don't you never think they're not because they are watching not only children watching but their neighbors are watching not only neighbors watching but who you associate with watch you the people at your church watch you so you are being watched [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but i can't take my testimony or you would still see so he went in this bar to get a coke or something so like that and in the corner had somebody sitting there who recognized him also he didn't know the person was he's a pastor what we're doing here so he said what if he didn't have a coke in his hands what he didn't have what he was doing some other things you see how somebody's watching so but abandoned praise god i skip here oh my praise god so jesus said you must be born again if you're not born again you cannot see the kingdom and you cannot enter into the kingdom he said you have to accept it by faith and then he comes into you then you understand it to see is to understand you've got to have faith and you've got to know how to use that faith to make yourself well to get happiness out of life i want to say that again you have got to have faith one two you have got to know how to use that faith to make yourself well and get happiness out of life that's what you come here for they get a release to get a breakthrough to get a revelation of your calling of your position in god paul was seeking the lord for a certain preacher and god said my grace is sufficient physique and when paul heard that he adjusted his attitude and behavior and said in our glory in my infirmities if the devil figure you're buying me with that he's wrong in other words he punched the devil right back he said i've got rejoice now because this is what god gave me grace to go through this stuff and many times sometimes god doesn't take you out he gives you grace to go through okay give the lord some preaching come on help me bring back somebody somebody didn't help here this morning so sometimes let me say it again sometimes god don't take you out he gave your grace to go through [Applause] how many receive that [Applause] so all those unimaginable churches have got as children they belong to this mystic kingdom what are they waiting for they are waiting to see something take place that will draw their hearts into it amen so that baptist is only a shell over them it's not the real thing methodist this group interpretation only shell they look at normal and they believe and they're here in this group and in that church and whatnot but they are seeds of god waiting for something to draw their hearts right they're only hunting in the head and they have the choice and they think so and they feel so humanistic but one of these days when that holy spirit began to move my god understand this that come like a magnet magnet don't pick up cloth and paper it make up pick up thing that i'm magnetizing it it picks up metal and everything else so when the magnet of the holy ghost begins to move over the world it will pick up those that have the magnetism of the spirit you pick them up pick them up one here one there there'll be two in a bed one taken that one are the magnets in them oh give the lord some shouts there'll be two in the field one taken that one have the magnetism inside of them you come here to get magnetized oh glory of god you come here and sometimes when the metal don't have no magnet on it you take a magnet and rub it and they keep rubbing it and transfer it get the atoms going and when you take the word and begin to take that wood in your heart yeah start to rub it praise god something transfer oh glory to god the secret is the word is in the prayer so the magnetism inside of you devil can't put it the devil didn't put it inside of here he cannot take it out [Applause] [Music] so you come to church to get the word inside of you the word coming inside of you and then the holy spirit could take that up do you see it now glory to god it's in the last days they're gonna come a famine not for bread and water but for hearing the true word of god and they're gonna say come join come join but we're enjoying nothing oh glory to god question this church who set it up this mythical body it is jesus christ what ram says he is the head of this mystical body oh glory to god so i like what brother john chaconia said he said but over thanks for coming for doing bodywork i like that never heard that expression before he said when you're in his own church during pastor work you're doing local work when you go on the field you're doing bodywork oh hallelujah a mystical body you go there drop some bums and fly out oh glory to god and the body going to work but one of these days we're going to meet over yonder oh glory to god people lost this lost that but i had lost my praise oh god i lost friends i lost loved ones but i had lost my praise glory to god hallelujah people turn their back people walk away but i lost my praise god give me that praise i'm going to meet john one day john was in symbol for john shouted it wasn't reality yet but we are living in a reality of what john was seen in a vision it's only a vision he had and he shouted and he jumped and he prays and he worship for a vision but be living in [Applause] let me see reality i'm not done yet when i'm done i'll be done i have the unction and anointed and inspiration to preach what i'm preaching this morning and you know it and i know it oh glory to god we get into something oh hallelujah glory so not some organization but behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tyrion is in jerusalem until they endure with power from on high not power from a bishop not power books and tapes pour from on high when that power come upon you is his power coming upon your life oh glory to god you are sons and daughters of god god have no hierarchy you have no pope or not bishop and bishop over that bishop and elder you don't have that that soul structure here is to get guardian to the church you set up this church jesus christ no bishop no group of men no pope no man made powers but jesus christ is his kingdom was coming into power and you shall receive power after the holy ghost comes upon you you shall receive power after you made a bishop amen after you made a preacher after you made a pope after you made a priest no after the holy ghost comes upon you who is the head of the church jesus christ what kingdom is it the messiah kingdom the church is not an organization it's a mystical body to which christ is the head christ is here this morning to connect with you you are members of his body you are members of his machine oh glory to god what is the church it is the mystical body of jesus christ who set it up the lord jesus himself and you will never be able to understand the kingdom of god until you are born again it's an unraveled mystery but when you are when you are born again the plans of the kingdom and the kingdom itself becomes real to you you have got to understand the blueprint or you won't know the blueprint until you're born again i just said somebody go in and build one build this and build this there's a blueprint you have to understand how to build it then they could go and build a building isn't that right so therefore the four beasts praise god we said take care of the seven spirits lion paul irenaeus martin ox columba portage the man luton wesley and the eagle is william branham hallelujah it's not but this creature or living creature was not beast this living creature is a word called zun and beast wild beast is tyrion but this zone is living creatures tyrion is the word peace as identified as rome as united and united states they are beasts tyrion but these four beasts is not that these four beasts soon they are living creatures isn't that right revelation 4 is living creatures not beasts okay and in ezekiel ezekiel saw it ezekiel 1 and he read the scripture praise god hallelujah and watch living creatures they are not angels he said the voice of many ages are wrong about the throne there are three different categories there here along the throne is four living creatures outside of that 24 elders outside of that a host of angels so there are three categories wrong the throne four beasts living creatures isn't that right oh hallelujah they are not angels they are not redeemed men what are they would you like to know here is my interpretation they are god gods of his throne these are his gods they are god's angels to guard the troll so this throne of god is guarded that means any and anybody can't access the glory the power the presence the anointing from on that troll could we give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god the first peace lion okay i skipped that oh glory to god and in ezekiel chapter one there was on wheels and bahram explained that the four beasts and they couldn't turn backward because if they go this way is a man if they go that way is the ox if they go that way it's a is a lion if they go that way is that eagle so they all could only go forward and they have eyes within and behind and in front to see what was what is and what is to come are you with me the eyes on the inside the eyes behind and the eyes in front have a purpose behind it to represent what was what is and what is to come what glory that god and it could never go backward if they go this way is the man if they've got that place to be is the ox and they go this way is the eel and they're gonna depress the lion so on earth ezekiel with wheels because the church was on the move on earth but in heaven it was stationary because the throne was set in heaven and the peace was around the throne living creatures one sack of the throne with that book sealed guards around the throne 24 hours around the troll and thousands and tons of angels oh give the lord praise those people oh glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god so john and ezekiel saw the same vision now listen to this [Music] this is the mercy guard or the throne guard the throne right up next to god living creatures the next thing to god their intelligence they know what was which is what shall come they had eyes without showing what they could see what was to come eyes within knows everything now and eyes in the back that knows what was which was and we shall come which was jesus christ same yesterday today and forever revelation the intelligence node now know the future know the present know the past they know your condition right now they know your future right now they know your past right now oh glory to god just think about it and you have a past and you have a past you have a recent past i never passed past that your recent past is trouble but you'll pass past that and the back path of god's mind praise god there is nothing against you come on give the lord a scream come on now in the backpack of god's mind your passport hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah these peace bring down the supernatural intelligence to show you what was before there was a beginning yes you see that in the beginning god created i'm going to be seated [Music] in the beginning god created the heavenly earth and the earth was the form and void was upon the face of the devil and the spirit of the beginning god before the beginning these beasts know all about it because before the beginning you see the beginning is time and time of the beginning and time of the ending but you come from eternity but glory to god eternity never began never can end oh come on same as somebody so when time is over we go back to eternity we come from eternity we're going back to eternity time shall be no more you come on the back path of god's mind oh hallelujah glory to god in them you'll be seated now hear this bomb what

tie that in with the creatures the angels wrong the tree of life god in the tree so these guardian angels heart was mentioned in genesis they were the cherubims genesis 3 4. he says oh praise god

that way to guard it and they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood amen nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat and this altar of judgment becomes a mercy seat by the blood and when the blood is lifted it comes back to judgment again isn't that right and the only way to enter into the gate of eden is through the blood of jesus so cain went out from the presence of the lord from the gate of the garden therefore the presence of the lord must have been at the altar so the guardian angel was god in the presence of the lord that was at the altar that order reflected the throne of god oh hallelujah then the prophet went a little deeper he said moses was told to make things i thought in heaven and the act of the covenant had cherubims carved out isn't that right praise peter just wings touching each other to represent the gods hallelujah the after the covenant he put two cherubims the goddess what was it tron gods they got the mercy seat when god here we go in his shekinah glory where was she kind of glory at the mercy seat the guard that she kind of glory he said who listen friends then it goes to show that not no scallywag every scary one can't come there and take off that that is why when the sanza skiva was trying to cast the devil out come out of him in the name of paul who paul preaches come on in the devil and then devil talked after them and said paul i know so they know those devils know when the kind of glory comes off the throne of god those devils know and they recognize the authority of god that comes back in the church those devils know who's you are whose son you are whose daughter you are do you believe that hallelujah he said you can't no scary what could come in and take that you have got to be prepared before you enter into the presence look at aaron and type how to wear certain clothes certain type of clothes you had to be perfumed certain type of perfume he had to be he could remain that way yep and he had to anoint his church to approach his holiness jesus his life was squeezed out and the same holy ghost upon him is put upon the church perfume that person approaching the holiest of holies has to be anointed with the same holy spirit and he walks holy holy unto the lord here we go and the mercy seat now the mercy seat is in the heart the seat we're shining forth of his glory here is the human heart is that the mercy seat how do you come into it that through these different systems how do you get into this thing true self-will amen [Music] [Music] you have to choose it so go ahead come in and bring that platter for you no no no you have to choose it that way you ask the question will you be made whole yes the blind man what is it you want me to do for you you got to say open my eyes you got to say deliver me you got to say heal me you got to say fill me you got to say seal me you got to say free me you've got to see it it's your choice thank you jesus she kind of glory what is this kind of glory it's god's presence when a man walking a woman he is reflecting the shine of glory praise the name of the lord i'm almost done from the resume of the ages he says the age started at the 20th century as it was to the age in which true church would retain to be the bride she was at pentecost we know that there must have necessity be a return of dynamic power the believers sense this in their spirits i begin crying to god for a new opportunity in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts in the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain here we go can only come after the former rain which is teaching rain the latter rain is harvest rain how could this be the real thing talking about the pentecostal revival how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain has not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the heart of return back to the pentecostal fighters had not yet come hallelujah thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quickness of the rapture had not come amen in it was a mixture here we go of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing that is what determined the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the holy ghost as we have kept pointing out to you it was also was devil power as men was under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it and to prove it was not real these people even before the second generation that appeared organize and wrote it on scripture doctrines and build their own fences as every other group of eight of them did musicians come on please hallelujah oh hallelujah jesus first samuel 18 14.
