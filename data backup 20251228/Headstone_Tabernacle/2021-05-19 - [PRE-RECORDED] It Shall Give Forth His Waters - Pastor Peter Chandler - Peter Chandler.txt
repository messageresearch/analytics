very glad i'm just feeling uh lord mixed feelings really just just saying farewell to sister gail knowing we'll meet her soon and that the rapture is not just a word it's a real reality because the shout is the start of it showing how near it is the start is a he descends he does three things one is a shout which is the message then that all becomes so powerful it actually uh kind of uh all comes together into one voice and although that is in the bride dear god we want to thank you to be alive in these things and alive and remaining to god i pray that you would lord just continue to the lord guide everything we're doing now lord it's very much later than we think and dear god we thank you for the the youth on air that's so refreshed us but yet we uh our thoughts have been kind of mixed up with the the the the goodbye and everything but dear god thank you for our young ones thank you for the contributors to youth united it was really really something and dear god i pray that you would bless our precious brother nat as you'll be preparing to go out to ghana for just a short time dear god i pray that you bless him as he goes and may he be refreshed and blessed out there make him a blessing to many others as well we want to thank you for the prayer warriors they've stepped it as they always do to to shoulder the load and dear god i pray that you would bless their hearts their god and strengthen them and do in due time lord that they may the lord feel and and know lord that they are loved and appreciated for the work they're doing lord just watch over them to our garden we don't even contain our prayers just in our own church we go beyond all frontiers and therefore we pray for our brother wherever they may be dear god we pray especially for our brethren in india lord hearing about the the uh terrible uh pandemic over there we pray that you'll keep our people and watch over your people dear god wherever they might be found and dear lord jesus we pray that you'd lord especially protect those who are in danger lord is just so easy and especially these days we say oh i've had the jabs but we don't even know what the next variant will bring and so lord there's always that element of uncertainty and dear god i pray that you just help us and and be our protection dear god and lord as our prophetess taught us dear god i pray that you'd bless those giving of their ties and offerings their god bless them lord unfailingly as i know you will do we give you thanks and praise dear god and give you the glory in jesus christ's name amen amen praise be to god hallelujah may god richly bless you today and it will just be this title today is right in the bible and uh it shall give forth his waters it shall give forth his waters amen and that's a personal pronoun his waters amen so i believe uh we're all looking very smart today because uh there's a photo shoot going on later so um we're all uh sprucing up for the for the website photo shoot and thank you brother charles shall we stand to our feet as we go straight to the world today and uh we want to take the following scriptures as we look at this subject it shall give forth his water we start with numbers 20 verse 8. take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and er on thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth uh to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beast to drink who is our god save the lord and who is a rock save our god a little he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely is for the scriptures to know what this message is it's not just a preacher in america but it's a prophetic mind it's impossible being made known to a prophetic class of people we welcome you amongst us lord may the world edify islam strengthen encourage your people young and old lord that we will be uplifted and lord that thou they our eyes would be washed with eye sound from the sleep overlay odyssey in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen you can be seated saints god bless you richie it shall give forth his water thank you musicians a wonderful job today and uh it shall give forth his water such as water but his water the rock itself looks uh a bit like this this is an artistic depiction and it will bring forth its waters bring forth his own is a personal pronoun and we want his waters [Music] to the carnal what is more dry than that amen it's a dry it's the driest thing you could ever find but speak to it it seems foolish and maybe in your predicament in your situation maybe it seems ridiculous but speak to the rock it shall give forth his waters amen these aren't the desert waters even though and talk to a rock what would a modern psychotherapist say to that no matter yes you're speaking into a stone pier but yet god was in that storm and it came forth [Music] and the animals we are not worthy of our salvation but in the midst of all of it the same god that forgave their sins their doubtings he still said they didn't have to go the desert route they could have gone the direct route but they decided to go to the desert no matter what took place he says and i watched even in their sins speak to the rocky amen i don't care what what state you're in i don't care oh i've ever sinned away my day of grace i don't care what's happening speak to the rock amen even if you're in your sin memphis you don't think you see you don't have to get nice and clean and then you can come and speak with me no as you are come to it praise be to god like a little child who knocked on the door of us of your dirty clothes is you belong inside here we're going to help you hallelujah hey man i gave him my old tattered garments he gave me a robe of pure white hallelujah no matter as long as you come unworthy by what could she do but me she had been raised in a home that was acquainted with the rock creator ocean you need to be acquainted with the veteran between just like rahab was acquainted with with joshua hey man she knew what was needed not good works but a token she was acquainted between she had been raised in a home thank god for for for for for for the sunday school massachusetts emotion she was raised in a home that was acquainted with the rock what did she do she didn't want to see the baby die so she took the little fella laid him under a tree was on that one fell on her knees and she spoke to the rock and the rock poured forth his waters it wasn't about hagar's prayer because christ is the seed of abraham and he will hear the voice the son of abraham he was the seed of abraham and the bible says we heard you and here goes i heard your cry we heard the voice of the lamb that's what moved god praise be to god that's glory to god amen thank you jesus amen amen amen go speak to the rock this is from this message in 1960 it was to expect water in a desert it wasn't he said but elijah really he knew god was going to give him water that day i want you to notice elijah he needed water it was the end of the drought he said how foolish well he says if that's the best you can give me like elijah he went to pray what was he praying for water the place was dry [Music] just keep on going then you start to say thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord you start to worship him lift him up the cloud will get bigger the cloud will get bigger even if you see a tiny encouragement say fine but i you may see just a cloud like a man's head you keep on praising god you don't say that is that all you've got no you keep on praising god you will get the whole downpour amen when god does a small thing different just how to encourage it hey man hey man just start to encourage you he said it's not like the rock of gibraltar but the rock of asia pray for me stand there you will feel the sound of abundance of rain is going to give forth this water praise be to god in this or amen if god doesn't give me the house i'm going to praise him even if he doesn't he makes him i'm not going to bow to you nebuchadnezzar hallelujah he had but if not faith who can identify with that yes hey man no matter what happens but if not i'm not going to bow to you even if god leaves me alone if he doesn't even answer my prayers i'm going to praise god anyway amen hallelujah glory to [Music] the but he'll meet you in your fire as well he's the rock he was standing there in the fiery furnace hallelujah you want to say hallelujah hallelujah hey many many men hey man they spoke to the rock and the fire was cool by some invisible water by the way hey man and they weren't even burned but their their ropes were burned amen what happened we start to understand what a rock is praise be to god rock is not we're not looking for a physical right we're not looking for a a stone rock it's a revelation of jesus christ that's there's one thing just to say it but the the point was the revelation had been revealed from heaven that he was the son of god flesh and blood never taught it to you those keys it's gotta be the right [Music] she could not be healed by any doctor by the feelings of your infirmities jesus christ jesus christ he was a sorrowful nationwide which actually means greek actually when jesus said to her it's not meat for me to take children's bread and give it to the the devil's real something genuine and that water will come i don't know she spoke to the rock who else spoke to the rock the woman at the well hallelujah she she was a woman she was in a bad way she came to the whales she was a woman of of of of bad reputation reputation she said sir i perceived that

the water of healing hey hallelujah you know you know where i'm going today hallelujah there's another woman amen that spoke to the rock her name was hattie right right praise be to god and the squirrels had been created and even the people in his own church were disbelieving the prophets but this little woman they said put you down she spoke to the rock she said that's nothing lamborghini

please speak amen praise be to god it please please the holy spirit amen and the holy spirit spoken is never mind hagar uh elijah peter yeah uh what the the woman at the well they all spoke to the rocks what about our days what about our time so what can we expect you can expect omnipotence to speak hallelujah hey man let me tell you something when omnipotence speaks the miraculous is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the world who can shout a man who can clap for jesus amen amen hallelujah glory to god i feel good brother junior man the message is so sweet we're at the junction of all junctions of history you can expect better omnipotence in the when the disciples pray in acts 4 they won't just say oh give us a victory lord but no when they pray read it amen amen they took the word and they plotted how many knows what plating is all of us with the word of god it's you when you pray i was busy praying and i was planting this is the word you

of god that's where the seed sets root in the heart is the seed in your heart don't let a bird take it away you put it on good ground hey man it'll produce exactly what you exactly he is the high priest he's sitting at the right hand of majesty making intercession on our confession not a mental workup no pass used to you know that's nothing then you're praying like a chicken take that seed come in and sow the land yes silver the seed in your land sorry i'm kind of excited here amen hallelujah real confession it's a law the key to this law of faith that opens it up to you praise be to god it's not a doctrinal argument it opens it up to you amen the key to the door the key to this law it's faith that opens it up to you hey man you see what i mean it's a law you brothers who do computer programming if you get one letter wrong it will not flow how many knows that's right it will not flow amen and before you make any changes you you will receive that [Music] [Music] he's following you today it's just a pipe for you don't glorify the pipe it's not about the pipes oh brother peter's wonderful no no it's the water hello man glorify the water be lower man because that is his water so praise be to god it's not the person that's wonderful amen wasn't wonderful wesley wasn't wonderful but they were each pipes and remember it's just a stem it's juiced in tea but you drinking from the rock the smitten rock that's already been smoked hallelujah you have to smite it again it's already been smoked smite once then speak speak speak speak speak speak speak you don't smile to you know hit it again hey man moses tried that and he found out praise be to god what can we say to these things church glorify the water amen he said the pipe doesn't give you the drink the drink comes from the rock paul gave water from the rock martin gave water from the rocks messengers justification that's all luther he didn't have you know all these mysteries it couldn't be given to luther or to wesley or to the pentecostals they were begotten what will he say he couldn't understand that he just had to give you justification water justification that's the only water he could give him he had the mechanics and dynamics of his day he said and the it wasn't like the water we have today until we've got everything now this message it's got luther's water it's called wesley's water it's got the pentecostal water it's got a pole stuck on his water stain but now we have his water it was powerful with the manifestation blessing justification sanctification the new birth we have the gifts of the spirit children but we also have the divinely revealed word we have every blessing hallelujah amen he spoke justification but it was just like a child is it this is commando he wasn't an adult yet he was speaking like a child he was speaking to the rock ballet oh like a child come on no phone wesley what was speaking to the rock oh like a child come on now when you think like a childhood you speak amen when i was a child i speak as a child but now i put away childish things hey but now things are different now that which is perfect has come it didn't come in losers it didn't but luther had part of it but now we have the whole thing praise be to god we have the whole thing and just like the yeah i'm just going to touch on this like the arrow of deliverance if you to strike against the powers of evil we can strike against sickness worldliness strike at church lately don't hold back i can't as much as our senses can let us come to the permit but one day hallelujah it will be faced to face with the rock himself hallelujah who is the rock our god thank you thank you wesley thank you pentecostals but that was partial realization they didn't understand everything like we do today partial realization will be made sanctification i mean lucy's [Music] we'll be right in the glory no that's just because you know we have more than that and we do have today because with all the when that which is perfect is coming which we have a perfect message for a perfect rapture we have sorry divine vindication and he says when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child but when i become a man i put away childish things i'll put interpretation of the word now our confession is more powerful it has become omnipotence but what a confession this is where they come from and live you [Music] rock remember because it is silent you are not you you don't even understand it it says the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything too what's gonna happen to it because can we say because the end of the church is to come a prophetic gift to reveal this shows amen so you can say oh the civil seal silence no no a prophetic gift has broken that silence and given to the bride a perfect confession which we have now that's why i can boldly say to every devil you might as well give up now because the bride has a perfect confession now not a partial confession a perfect confession the word is naive even in thy mouth praise be to god brother there's something going on amen he says there's rapturing faith in these messages hey man all that he wants to hear just give you a ton i mean what language are you speaking today speak his language when was the last time you prayed that god would adopt you to save my family because malachi 4 has told us our family will be saved offspring shall be with us has given he has given you your confession told you what to say hallelujah joshua knew what to say because he heard moses and he reminded them caleb reminded them of what moses because the words you remember what moses said and he reminded them of the words of moses now you take this message and remind the devil of what this message is for praise god let's hurry along he says a prophetic gift to reveal amen the holy spirit has [Music] even after luther wesley has been bound but it is to be loose speak to the rock in the evening time message he says by the evening time message the holy spirit sent this to me is back in the church again satan you can't bind us anymore you can't bind us anymore you've bound people for 2 000 years [Music] praise [Music] come here equal come so negative we can talk properly now you can talk to god about the big issues to talk to god about the rapture you can speak to the rock man [Applause] talk like a he will recognize his language because he gave it to the prophet holy spirit back in the church amen water everywhere amen and he's trying to find you you're not finding him man doesn't look for god god looks
