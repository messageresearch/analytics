that will happen there Pentecost Misha's are unveiled to them you're desperate mysteries was unveiled to them in the opening of their understanding to the world but they still have to get fire there's an experience they still have to get power they still have to get the anointing they still have to get green or they were crises in the upper room and when that real begin to fall the Seas begin to manifest itself I'm the prophet prophesied the rain is going to fall or glory not gonna toss here the Lord just tonight you have to see in the Lord the ring is fixin to fall no man could stop it or glory I didn't promise it it's caught that promise yet I'm delivering a message to you that is what this pulpit is for don't touch it if you get dusty at the Lord see him what the Tipsy we are seeing what the prophecy we have come to talk more no dream last night we come to give it a word oh just the world Oh hallelujah my God my God whoa whoa whoa just stuff he has a nice butt around say the spirit nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because I was left I feel slow to understand this you must realize the Spirit is not speaking to the original scenes of FSS alone the message is the entire age it's a message then to all generations in that span now history keep repeating repeating itself in generations of Israel we should be viable in one generation only you see the fires fading in the next and the two generation embers may be glowing slightly in the fourth there will no vestige whatsoever of the original flame then going to testify again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore is any truth apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly born again believers then the next generation come along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken on a name Baptists and Methodists that's exactly what they are they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man any particle joint Baptist Catholic Methodist as human but when caught you must be born again when you are billeted from above that despite the will of God that is something you have nothing to do it that is what God did in your life is not just stop smoking and stop drinking listen it's a people who so sanctified forget about it they're not even in Christian it's Christianity and they don't smoke don't drink the roller on a woman they nothing at all they clean but he's not saved that is not the own doing they meditate and an amount didn't monk whatever it is she have the head ball they my coming near woman whatever it is that's not salvation my abstinence dice penance likes punishment likes putting a body to extreme that's the if I could do that and be see if you don't need Jesus Christ to come and die for you just for the leg and go on meditate you have to be born of the will of God but a Brian the full oven is at the police got the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit about a Norrish use a wood I just love he talk about the decline it's a wood hardwood for a long time any early days boy I remember the closeness service or kind of small holes different services and when that song pretty blessed be the ties that bind our hearts and Christian love I used to cry I used

people preach the Holy Spirit coming at the end of the service and bless the people and so on like that the anointing that you do you want to leave people stay back and shake what I had and that is how it works but conversation after one their first home ok fooling us just become a duty after my duties are born are gonna go in the goody nurse I mean we hustling comfortable you know I wish Pat eternity walk consume you hustle him to go away you fight him deliver you live in today so what's what's the purpose of living if you're not living for Christ what's the purpose of living if there's not an objective for the kingdom of God because born says only what you do for the kingdom comes the Belafonte Austrian self you have care how slam your whatever it is playing rocket that's still you

sending to pick you up change of the body so the footman is either please God the passion to know this word the cry for eternal spirit or begins to feed and instead of that church being on fire with a 5 goal he has cooled off and become a bit former that is what was happening back to the Ephesians they were getting a bit former yes the abandonment to God was dying out and people won't to careful about what God thought about them as they begin to be careful about what the world taught about so the abandoned men means you could wear a dress long I let people laugh at you that doesn't matter it went up a glass point a condition keep on driving let them laugh you pray over your meal in public it doesn't matter because that's you and your God that's all people will know that you're Christian because you're not watching because you don't nobody see you if you're free no no not that you're doing what is right hallelujah praise God amen I just need my testimony you know trouble no what is all this phone by building Bible on your phone it's good they are you back there phone you either but but carry a physical Bible Bible is written scriptures Gordon in print form not before is not going to patrolman so he was in his car reading this Bible somebody seen him read his Bible Bible some if any kinda phone doing so they show your reader but the Bible boy the Bible boy this Bible is God's will you know beside by belief on your name that Bible is the Word of God oh it's real you can't let people think for so every great nation has to fall but a random talk about I stood in Rome a great Jesus stood and they all fell all mortals will have to give with immortality Romans watch rumours 11 and he read the scripture for it if the casting away of them talk about Israel be the reconciling of the world what shall be the receiver of them be but life from the dead what if the first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy is the root before he saw the branches here we go if some of the branches be broken off that Dow sticking about us Gentiles being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the factors of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast our bear is not the root but the root D if don't we'll see the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in well here we go hit the pattern on a striking because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest my feet be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed mrs. Kennedy behold the goodness and the severity of God on them which fell severity but towards the goodness and it will continue in his goodness continue the goodness come to you continue in it do you have goodness come to you they caught bless you with goodness continue in the goodness of God over all either God if the goodness watch watch it over cut watch and also if they are bite not still and unbelief okay let me back up a bit but there was the goodness in the continuous goodness otherwise thou shalt also be cut off and if they also if they are bite not still and underneath one shall be grafted in for God is able to if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed it in four cords able to graft them in again and we know God will do that so God will take off the Gentile and cut them off and stick back in the Jews and they are the natural branches so we are here by the feet on the musha's of God take a whole of it thank you for your mercy thank you for your fever thank you for your grace oh god I love you Oh and we're I'm saying what what cause that they get cut off because I rejected Pentecost Oh glory to God hallelujah and he said they rejected Pentecost and became one of the greatest nations become one of the lowest and was scattered because of unbelief Israel no they disbelieve the Pentecostal message that Paul was preaching God cut him off and took a wild olive branch which was a Gentile US and grafted us in that we might live off the substance of the tree here we go momentum evangelism according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the feet that was wasn't about the Saints are you ready bring them back to the fate of the father's the Pentecostal pact in the restoration time and we are about to approach the restoration tank but there's a Pentecostal pact in the restoration time I will restore see in the law book give the Lord a shout and the people in the message they're missing this part what part the Pentecostal part or they survived partly because that belongs to us we have to have justification sanctification Pentecostal pact in the world we can't pull up any course and say we have the word no that's your spirit to make the wood come alive or give the Lord a shout the Spirit is what gives strength and power to the world itself the word is a conductor of the Spirit the reason the prophet brought the word is for the spirit the flow true government to place his sons and said death is my spirit flowing freely man become a channel of communication for inspiration to flow right true because that man has become the word this you see a witness of it you see evidence of it you see the power of it that's what put a bottom head many times one said that was not me speaking that was him he become a favorite channel of God tyreq remember what it Moses to bring them to the mountain to worship Him when Moses brought him to the Moncton Hotel and draw some lines there pulled some chords their drillin nobody crossed that we go when I turn down an amount any monthly slowly come on say Amen somebody told nobody cross that line there Moses going up to hear from God why Moses has gone up people backslide and dancing and then : class or glory to God on the sand and oh when can we get to rumble on that mountain them said don't let God speak let Moses speak all them thunders and lightning and falses was shaking the mountain it was chilling because the Living God was on top there they didn't know the Living God Moses was telling them what is living God because Moses met this Living God in the form of a + I or clothing a quorum you want to meet that letting go you want to meet him they only seen miracles flops flags we were telling to plot this in miracles but they've never seen the Living God the source of those miracles the scene a man's hand that my people call but they didn't see the sauce behind that man they didn't see the power cord behind Moses he was a power from heaven he was anointed from heaven he was speaking from heaven he was weakened us here the Lord he was speaking my favorite inspiration man sent from God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] children of Israel said to let musics me to like watch me to let watch week at Moses speak and God take the voices the thunders the lightning and God translate that into a voice speaking to a man the word but when God reflects it and translated in the next dimension it is thunders it is lightning it is shake him it is voices it's a son of a trumpet give the Lord a show [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the same God I was in the mountain coming on to be a voice a voice the voice of the prophet - heavenly bread alone but on every word that proceedeth emotive party Oh hallelujah listen listen movie season fire came out of the Mount of God wrote the Ten Commandments interpretive stool what was writin himself Moses came with two tablets but he didn't cut that he didn't write it was the hand of God that wrote those tablets of stone no God

hallelujah such a fire always having a tonight I feel like anything can happen here tonight I feel this living God is here tonight the Pentecostal party in the restoration time I will restore share the Lord that is the real event the real endtime evangelism Jesus ain't gonna stand outside your door not all the time there's a time when he would get enough i'm turn away then you will do the knockin but you will never find him come while it's time come why there's a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like it happened earlier Pentecost and the professor in adoption when the church is grown and that the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost not I am the Holy Ghost a lie not that the trick no no no when the Holy Ghost
