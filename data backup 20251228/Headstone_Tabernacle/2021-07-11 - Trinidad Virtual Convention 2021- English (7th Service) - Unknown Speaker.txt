the the ovid family and all the saints at the headstone tabernacle in trinidad on behalf of my wife francine my son isaac and the montreal church we say god bless you we love you jesus christ for inviting me to greet the virtual convention i have a little testimony here to the glory of god last january my wife was diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer yes a stage 4 cancer she had to go to through many treatments but before going through their treatments we called upon the name of the lord and all along we trusted the lord jesus and this week the oncologist called to say to my wife mrs ailstock i have good news for you all traces of cancer are gone praise be to god what a mighty god we serve praise the lord amen praise god we started hallelujah have a little thought here um as to greet the convention first corinthians 13 8 charity never fails i believe the bride has entered the season of that love that never fails yes because we see now everything is failing nations are failing israel's awakening this whole civilization is failing and also the love of many christians is failing it has waxed cold is hallelujah but when everything is failing there is a bride on this earth today that stands in love under the anointing of charity that never fails amen charity that never fails and it's a paradox she stands in love yes she stands in love way up in the pyramid she stands in that last virtue called brotherly love which is her requirement listen the bride knows how to say forgive me my brother and yes i forgive you my brother praise god we can disagree with one another yet be friendly yes the true bride of christ knows that rapturing faith is based on what unforgiveness is amen let me say this i believe that there was a season where we had to learn all the teachings pertaining to this glorious message that god gave us we had to receive this mystery and that mystery this mystery and that mystery but this time is past now this is the time to display what we received in our hearts don't you believe it brother and sister if for instance you have studied many years at the medical school to become let's say a a heart surgeon after all your schooling well you have to start somewhere to put it in practice to put in practice what you have learned amen for example now here comes your first patient he says to you doctor i badly need the heart surgery i want you to operate on me passion period what if you start telling him all the the uh theoretical knowledge you learned at the medical school you you would say let me tell you everything about the heart and the tummy and its functioning the patient would say well that's fine doctor but i want you to operate on me i want you to apply all the things well the bride all these years let me take let me say this the bride all these years since malachi 4 left she has learned the abc she has learned all the algebra to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being but now brother sister it's time it's time to display the token from faith to charity yes it's time to display that token from faith to charity le pools pano the earthly goal of each member of this bride is the stature of a perfect man so in closing i'll say this bride keep on pressing let go and let god have his wonderful way on our foundation our faith that's in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness the requirement of our age work in you work in me so the fond mother nature foreign then charity that never fails will cap off the pyramid of our life and then praise god praise god praise god we will unite with the dead in christ and go meet our lord precious lord jesus i'm longing for him aren't you god bless you amen god bless you thank you praise god amen i appreciate that the greeting this morning put your hands together god bless you appreciate it hallelujah hallelujah what a word from the lord thank you my brother god richard bless you amen i know my redeemer

resilience and your your faith and dedication to get put these things together and um so that it can be a blessing to all of us really you are the ones that put the convention together really because you have to do almost everything and we just thank you for your sacrifice all the time so you have your bibles i would like to pay attention to two portions of scripture genesis 49 verses 8 12 and revelation chapter 5 verses 5 and 6. genesis 49 verses 8 12 and revelation five five and six genesis chapter 49 reads on these wise judah thou art he to whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of their enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee judah is the lion's whelp from the prey my son there had gone up he stooped down he cut as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lord giver from between his feet until shall come unto him shall the gathering of the people be burning his fall onto the unto the vine and his ass is called onto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes his eyes shall be read with wine and his teeth white with milk revelation 5 verse 5 and one of the elders said unto me would not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and all the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth amen may glorify the reading of his holy words correctly bless you you may please be seated um one more time it's uh uh i want to bring greetings to the convention in the name of the lord jesus christ on behalf of my wife and family i understand our greetings to pastor arthur ovied and thank you for the invitation to be here today um [Music] for a few minutes i'd like to speak on this on this on the subject the shadows of redemption and my inspiration is the seven seals bring on another ephesians and my subject the seven seals of redemption i've got a few kind of scriptures here um romans 15 and verse 4 and um hebrews 10 1. i'll read romans 15 verse 4 uh romans 15 verse 4 written this was for whatsoever things were written at four times were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope uh brother branham in his ministry he brought out a lot of the teachings of scripture by using what he called and what bible scholars call types and shadows the apostle paul also did the same thing paul went into the mysteries of the that were hidden in the old testament and by bringing out the types and the shadows he brought out the deep truths of the gospel story of our redemption and brother branham uh um took this to an act in bringing out the real truths and the deep things of scripture by employing types and shadows he brought a lot of deep truths out just by showing us in types and shadows what um god was trying to tell us in the holy word of god um but the banham said on this quote here excuse me um um from the seat of god 1954 may the 14th now i know you say now i'm a topologist that's right because i know i know one thing if i'm going towards my shadow and i see what my shadow looks like i have some conception or what i look like whether i'm in a whether i'm a four-footed beast or a feathered bird or whatever it is it will shadow and the old testament was the shadow of the new we got it last night in revelation 12 the woman with the law under her feet the man i mean the moon and the sun at her head and it and he typed how all those things hebrews the 11th chapter tells us there were all types and shadows i believe hebrews 12 said that sin we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us now we sin those things also i i think i should at this point here i forgot to acknowledge my other ministry brothers who have gone before and who are going to come afterwards thank you so much brothers for your ministries and the blessing that your messages have been in this convention and always and the blessing that you always are to the blood of jesus christ i'm so proud and thankful and happy to be associated with you in the work of the lord god richly bless you so brother benham on this career let us see that he is a topologist he just you know goes into the word of god and brings out the truths of the mysteries of redemption from the types and the shadows and let us understand the old testament like paul said is the shadow of the new testament and when the real thing comes and the shadow disappears as the shadow and everything are coming together the shadow decreases in size and emerges and becomes a new thing now what the bible says about taps and shadows is said in so many places hebrews 3 hebrews 4 hebrews 10 different places but we can paraphrase what the bible says this way he said these things all of these things were written for our example for our learning like reading romans 5 for our learning so that will not come after the same manner of unbelief also that will get the same personal results that they got in other words all the stories in the bible all these things these types and shadows hold within them lessons life lessons positive lessons negative lessons lessons that we can take and apply to our lives so we don't come to the same negative spot and so we can come to the same positive spot the shadows in the bible preview for us what it's going to be like and what it is that if you see the shadow the shadow is a preview of what's coming the shadow is a foretaste of what's coming the shadow is a the evidence of what is coming and shadow lets us see and understand the end from the beginning let us see the end from the beginning let us preview once we see the shadow we can know what is going to come when we can see the shadow so the shadow is a preview and just like faith is a preview the shadow is evidence of what's going to come just like faith is the evidence of what is going to come what this means that when you see the shadow and you can identify the shadow in the old testament in the bible then you know what's going to happen and that inspires faith so the shadow um like faith inspires your faith the shadow lets you know what's gonna happen because forever oh lord that what is selling heaven faith is a shadow the shadow the shadow is faith the shadow inspires faith the shadow is evidence of what's going to be so shadow is an evidence it encourages inspires our faith it gives us faith it inspires us encourages us to press on because when we take a look at the shadow we know what is going to happen the shadow is the substance the evidence of what's going to be so the shadows in the scriptures they give us faith they give us confidence for every situation today sums up i mean summing summing it all up the shadow is all about life application taking the stories in the bible and finding the lessons in there to apply to our everyday living and when we see how it works out in the bible and we go the same condition the same everything we know we are likely going to get the same result so the shadows in the bible the stories of the bible the lessons that we can get from those who is not just for us to for our head knowledge but so that we can apply to our lives because the bible says these things were written for our learning for our example so we take the lessons from these shadows from these different things and apply them to our lives we apply the lessons of scripture to every single area of our lives so we can become like jesus and indeed all scripture all scripture old testament new testament is for life application to apply these things to our lives and that's what all boys and friends every single word in the bible excuse me boils down to this one thing life application to apply the lessons of the scriptures to our hearts and our lives so we can be like jesus christ that's what it's all about friends so when we read our bibles when we read the stories in the bible what we want to do is number one what does that story mean number two what's the lesson what was the lesson for that day number three what's the lesson from that story today number four how do i apply the lessons from that story to my life today so i'll be a better person i'll be more like jesus christ every day so it all comes down to life application friends that's what it's all about so we might be like jesus christ every single day of our lives and god's made it so easy for us to send us the prophet and the prophet of god the prophet and venom makes the word of god present hence brother branham by employing types and shadows he's made the word of god come down to also simply the prophet makes the world present ends by employing types and shadows he's made the word of god present ends he brings all the stories from the old testament from the new testament and he brings them right down into present-day present context so you and i don't have to figure out he lists principles in the word of god for you and i to go into the scriptures by and we can uh break down the word of god for every single situation so the prophet by employing types and shadows makes the word of god present in so we can find the word of god the scriptures relevant for today so we can apply the scriptures to every single area of our lives that's what the prophet does that's the the the importance of a prophet to break down the word of god to bring down the mysteries from from the man of god to you and i as the word of god the word of god broken down are made into presence and so we can see the world in present tense and indeed we see all scripture in that context in the present for life application because the prophet makes what present ends so we can relate to the world we can find the word of god relevant all the stories in the bible all the big gods all the genealogies it brings them down into present tense so we will know how to apply these things to our lives so it's not just a story it's a message in there so that the what's the message so that we can apply the life of god in the scriptures so we know how to live we'll know how not to live so the life of god or in the scriptures revealed and unveiled throughout the scriptures which is the life of jesus christ his literal life will be manifested in each of our own lives and the story of redemption is all about the literal life of jesus christ back in the believer today that's the story of redemption and that's god's original plan in the garden of eden let us make man in our own image after our likeness so the shadows and types in the bible the stories of the bible they're not just stories god put them there for you and i because he wants you and i to get the input the lessons from those stories that we can apply them to our lives so that god's original plan and program to make man in his image will be achieved every single day in each of our lives so to recap quickly the old testament is a shadow of the new testament and so when paul came he went into the old testament and brought out the shadows and explained the message of redemption he took the children of israel uh uh took them from uh uh uh from egypt and expounded and showed them as the church of the living god as a type and shadow of the christian church today and going through the red sea going through the wilderness he put all the shadows for us all the times and brought up the input for us how those things were depicting and typing out redemption that was going to be revealed and unveiled in the new testament and all down through the bible all down through the bible paul did this uh uh uh uh uh uh many preachers go into the world and show you types and things so the bible is uh uh uh uh is written in symbols written in stories because god knows human beings will learn best by stories by uh uh all these different things but it means nothing to you and i if the stories in the bible cannot be brought down into present context for you and me and that's what the prophet of god did he brought the word of god down for you and i in present context and so the old testament the odds man is all about when the oldest man opened we see god in his creation the garden of eden and then the four adam and eve you know in a perfect state and then the fall and then the rest of the old testament is god dealing with his people uh the children of israel uh typing are they called out tapping out the church of believing god and then we go new when we get to the new testament we see also god coming down the beginnings of it god and his cr his son just like in eden god and his son are on bringing our for a new creation um jesus christ and then the the uh are the i mean the gospels were written and then the epistles and the book of revelation so the new testament is all about the uh the gospels the epistles and the book of revelation and in the gospels john stood out john's writing stood out and the epistles paul's writing stood out and how paul's writing stood out is because of the by types and shadows he was able to bring out the great stories the great mysteries of redemption he was able to dig deep and bring them out for you and i all through the ages so all scripture when you read the old testament when you read the new testament and these stories about jesus and this story is about the disciples these stories about the red sea these stories about all the all the happiness in the old testament elijah and samson the patriots all of these stories in all these stories there is a message a message of redemption there is a message in there all these tabs and shadows in there is hidden a message a message of redemption and it's this same message that has been from eden since eden is the same message god has only had one message is revealed that message in every type and shadow in the bible but it's just one single uh strange you will find there the message of redemption that has been the gospel story since eden in the old testament through the seven church ages and is the same gospel story today is the message of redemption hallelujah and the essence of this gospel redemption is simply this god wants his sons and daughters to be like him that's the essence of the gospel story of redemption to be in his very image to walk like he walked to talk like he talked to have his own life do the works that he did born of his bone flesh of his pledge spirit of his spirit work works of his works as it was in eden as was in the early right that's the essence of the gospel story of redemption but then the essence of this story was lost in eden with the passage of time adam and eve lost the essence of this story and that when they lost that that that brought the very need for redemption because adam and eve were created in the very image of god having god's image on the face of the earth doing the works of god on the face of the earth living on this area in the place of their father god god was the god of the universe but adam was the god of the earth he had ownership authority rulership over the earth amen he not only had worship of that he owned the earth he was the earth was his inheritance but when he lost that that was the essence of this gospel the message the stories in all of these uh uh um shadows in the bible that was the essence that was a hidden message there god wants his sons and daughters to be like him and when that was lost by adam and eve god brought it right back again here came jesus when he was born he restored that right back and took it higher with the new testament the new testament age opened and the the the the the bread of christ was the church of god was breath in the new testament age on the day of pentecost but like again the essence was lost with time the passion of time the essence of the gospel was lost that early bird of pentacles was there in the beauty of his holiness with the same life spirit of his spirit works of his works life of his life born of his bone that was who they were but with the passage of time like it happened in eden the essence was lost again and god said i will restore see the lord and he began to restore he started the work of restoration in luther in wesley pentecostals until he sent a great prophetic prophet the prophet of malacca for the prophet william branham in this end time here with a message to restore this essence back and bring back a people on the face of the earth by his message the people who under him their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and malacca for the propaganda was sent with a message of redemption to re uh with a message to reveal full total complete redemption by the seven seals he said the seven seals was direct commission to reveal and unfold and open up redemption to open the mystery of the seven seals of redemption that was his ministry that was his message so that the blood of all the ages would come right down to full total complete redemption and have a life and a ministry like adam had in eden like the blood of pentecost had oh my malacca first message of the seven seals of redemption is a story of the bible and that's the message in there was hidden all of these glorious things to bring us right back to the garden of eden the seven seals message of malachi 4 is a story of redemption now you and i know the seven sails originated right in the man of god before the foundation of the world the seven seals had their origins in the man of god on the back parts of elohim's mind and so the seven seals they're all about our redemption all about our redemption and and and god splashed at names in blood that's when the seven seals had his origins when the seven seals came into being that was god himself coming into being and that was when your name my name was splashed in blood so whereas eternal as eternal himself whereas eternal as the eternal god himself the seven sea the seven seals from the back parts of god's mind that's where they had their origins from and the seven seals uh uh uh uh were the seven spirits of god because a seal is a the holy spirit is the seal of god and the seven seals of god is the seven spirits of god before the foundation of the world and that's the lamb of god and that's what you find in revelation 5 you will get there and by these seven spirits over seven seals god brought forth a perfect man in the garden of eden the seven seals brought forth a perfect man in the garden of eden a perfect god bringing for the perfect son into a perfect world and that world was ephesians the perfect god the perfect son in a perfect world that was ephesians oh my adam lived in this efficient nature in the garden of eden brought him by the seven seals the ephesians the lamb of god elohim himself before the definition of the world in eden the seven seals brought on an efficient age he put adam into these ephesians in eden and like i said before adam lived in this perfect glorious state until he fell by sin and god walked around right back because the seven seals was the seventh seal the seven spirits of god was what brought up the ephesians in adam in the garden of eden and here come the seven sails himself jesus christ the ephesians himself the perfect god himself the perfect one himself here he came down born of a virgin a manger and he became our lord and a savior when he gave himself on calvary's mountain and he died res went to hades and resurrected and rose again and on the day of pentecost the church of god was birthed what was it the seven seal christ coming back into his church by his seven spirits again to unfold and unveil amen efficient in that early efficient church age and we see the story book of acts it was a perfect church it was a god because paul's writings to almost all of the churches was one problem or the other he was trying to sort out but when he spoke to the efficient church there was no prominent efficient church at all it was just about the regional church you can i mean bible scholars can call you whichever way but the fish the efficient church was all about unity all paul wrote to them he wasn't addressing any particular prayer it was a prophet church he was a church on fire was a church focused on the deep things of god and all paul talked to the ephesian church was unity in christ unity in the church unity in the home and putting on the whole armor of god to become a perfect man in jesus christ to be to become the born of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit that's a vision a perfect church and jesus christ the ephesians came down and after him he produced an ephesians church age and those people were ushered by the holy spirit on the day of pentecost into the early efficient church age and we are promised after they lost it i will restore see the lord i will restore that efficient church right back again i will restore a perfect church a perfect bride right back again and so we were promised that there's going to be another efficiency jesus christ is going to come back himself he is the ephesians he's going to come back himself he is the ephesians he is the seals he is the seven spirits living in flesh the fullness of the godhead dwells in him bodily and through him when he comes he is going to bring on another ephesians and we saw that in malachi 4. malacca 4 jesus christ was willing him and he lived in these ephesians we saw the works of christ we saw the spirit of god operating that prophet he lived in an ephesians and just like jesus christ in the days of his flesh police and ephesians he was the efficient and priests and efficient in the early price same way jesus christ in malachi 4 produced an efficiency in that prophet and will produce an efficiency in this bride a perfect man stand on the face of a perfect bride that's going a perfect rapture to go to a perfect garden of eden like adam lived in before he fell by sin speaking about ephesians um let me read you a quote or two here from brother branham [Music] all right on the message the horizon of the song brother branham said it probably through it he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seal that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ and the seven the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme george showing that he's alpha and omega the beginner and the end and he said on a paradox now we are taught in revelation the sixth chapter i believe yeah the sixth chapter of the seven seals that's the book to be sealed up with seven mysteries or seven stills revelation six and the last day revelation 10 revelation 10 we find out that the laodicean last messenger of the last age and during the time of his prophecy that the seven sales will be opened the seven mysteries seven four misses that had been left off in every age there have been some of it left off the reformer uh didn't have the reformer didn't have enough time to uh um excuse me didn't have enough time to take care of it in the days of luther he only prejudicial by faith he was gone they made a church after that come wesley he preached sanctification very there it was and along come the pentecostals but we are promised according to revelation 10 and according to malacca iv 2017 i mean it meant 20 1730 and so forth there is that there is got to come an efficiency to this in other words in this day there's going to be an efficiency also jesus christ is the ephesians and jesus christ is was veiled in that prophet that's what he's talking about here was very in that prophet the ephesians here but after him all the time he always brings on an efficiency in his bright group too and that's why when he came the ephesians in the days of his bodily flesh after him was the efficient church and he is here there is going to be an efficiency we are promised there is going to be an efficiency to this also and an an efficient bride will also follow these efficient jesus christ that we saw in the prophet malachi 4. but we are promised according to revelation 10 according to malachi 4 according to luke 22 17 and so forth that there is to come an efficiency to this also there is promised it friends the most common efficience that these seven four mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded there it is the seven seals brings an ephesians the seven seeds the seven seeds of god creates in the people and ephesians [Music] the ephesians jesus christ gives birth to the ephesians bread of jesus christ and it's the legion churches that it takes place i believe we're there i believe we are right in the shadows of the coming of the son of god and as joshua just before the ephesians raised up so that john the baptist raised up just before the next official and we are promised another ephesians in malachi 4 in the bride jesus in malacca for the ephesians bringing on the ephesians in the bride it's predicted here in the scripture therefore i think we're living in the ephesians again there it is it's telling you right plump and plain the ephesians is here jesus christ back again we are promised that what was left of during those seven church ages oh my here is here it is friends again what is ephesians the ephesians is the literal life of jesus christ living in human flesh the literal life of god like adam had the literal life of jesus christ like it was in the early breath the literal life of jesus christ like malachi for heart living in the believer exactly as adam had the early bright heart as malacca for demonstrating this age here the ephesians in this age and after jesus came it would have been a long efficient day because that's the purpose of god in redemption so that his sons and daughters will live and have his own life he let us make man in our image after our likeness so they'll be like us so they'll have our image on the inside of them so their behavior their life their ministry their works everything will be and reflect us we'll be god walking in human skin on the face of the earth that's what the original plan that was what god planned to do and when he brought the ephesians on in eden the perfect man if adam didn't fall the whole world would have been filled with perfect perfection but adam fell but god come right back down again the ephesians himself jesus christ came and he brought an efficient church right after him on the deal of pentecost the spirit of god come down and the fullness of the holy spirit was come in that age to anoint the word of god that he spoke into the souls and paul came on and put it on an unefficient church was birthed through the first church age but then they fell again and the seven church ages instead of being an efficient church you saw the trail of the serpent trying to do uh damage to the work of god through those seven church ages so the efficiency is connected in all the ages the efficient is what god wants to bring all of his children into as a matter of fact when all of god's children go back into that great eternity that's going to be efficient perfect perfection that can never fail so there's a connection between the seven seals which is jesus christ there's a connection between the seven church ages and the seven seals and ephesians and perfection and eden and this connection is the story of the whole bible oh glory to god amen and the book of revelation holds the key to unveiling and untying this connection between all of these elements the seven church ages the seven seals efficience glory land the gun of eden now malacca for knew all of this thing because he taught us these things and he knew you must you need to understand the connection between the church ages and the seven seals because when you understand that the whole gospel story comes into clear context for you and i only that prophet was the one that was able to go into the man of god to bring down this connection for you and i but message people the message becomes very common to us sometimes and we tend not to value like we ought to but these are glorious truths rashford from the mind of god the prophet going to the man of god with a gift of knowledge to bring down not that the god is saying any new thing for today but the things that god has spoken before the foundation of the world for this day the prophet goes up and brings them down and makes them present tense for you and i so malakai for he let us understand there's a connection between the seven churches and the seven series when you get that you understand god's program got planning redemption for all his children of all the ages from eden right back to eden again and so in his ministry if you notice 1960 he it it he he preached on uh uh the seven churches which we call the revelation series the relation of jesus christ he put on the revelation series and when he finished he moved on to revelation 4 revelation 5. he was trying and he said we're going to go on to the seals he was trying to show you the connection there but he didn't get into the city because the tabernacle wasn't in a condition to be able to take a ladmin like the sales world the revealing of the seals will take and if you notice when he came right back 1963 to preach on the seventh season he went through the same pattern because he appeared in seven churches he saw where he left off he was what he was going to do he preached seventeen years and was gonna connect to the seven seals and he appeared revelation 4 revelation 5 but he didn't go on so when he came right back he started off on the revolution of the seven seals right where he left off he put the message god in simplicity which was a dedication of savage showing us the simplicity of god how god comes right down the spirit of god breaks down and becomes the word of god so that you and i can understand and appreciate the things god is telling us but then what is he moved on right into revelation 5 where he left off and called it the bridge between the seven church edges and the seven seals he was connecting you right back to what he was telling you there's a connection there when you understand the connection between seven churches and seven seals the whole redemption plan opens up to you and malaca already unveiled that by his message over seven sales and the seven thunders so there's a connection there the seven seals seven church i mean seven church ages the seven series that's what malaca was trying to show you and that's what he showed you and i on the seals because he was telling you in so many words that you need to understand this connection with the church ages or you will not be able to understand the essence of what's coming in these seals many people see the eruption of the series as one horse rider towards writer third rather i know it's deeper than that and malachi 4 let us understand the secret veiled in here in the bridge now i taught us revelation 1 1 to 20 uh was preparation for the seven church ages uh chapters two and chapter three were the seven church ages revelation chapter four was the rapture come up either the narration chapter five was the breach which was the preparation for the opening of this of the seals it was literally saying you need to understand this connection here between the church ages and the seers between all these sins in the old testament and all these things in the new testament church age who have gone on before on this age there's a connection there to connect every one of those edges to the seven seals and revelation 5 the bridge holds the secret to this connection between all of these elements the seven church edges the seven seals ephesians glory land all the central medium back to eden the bridge holds the secret of the connection between all of these elements in our redemption now revelation 5 normally we call it the bridge but what is that a bridge is a gap revision 5 is the bridge that bridges over the bridge the gap the original 5 is not the gap rotation 5 is the revelation that will take you over that causing that that that gap between that gap in your understanding your understanding your revelation on the connection between the seven church edges and this and efficiency and the seven seals because the seven c is what's going to take you into that eternal church age at the end of the season and you got to understand the connection so malacca let us understand this thing so what's in revelation 5 here quickly as we are running down revelation 5 you find the lamb you find the lion the book version 5 open a crown went out who is worthy to take the book and to lose the seven seals thereof and i got to understand john all the elders that they understood what was going on here they understood exactly what was going on many church people don't have a clue what's going on well thank god for the prophet malachi 4 we understand by the grace of god not we no no the prophet of malachi 4 brought a message that let us understand all these things that were going on there and we were represented by john so we understand what's going on my everyone what was john crying about you'll understand what was kind of about malachi photos but we don't understand what he was going about so revelation 5 the crowd wanted who is worthy to take the book and to lose the seven sales thereof so you understand right away this is the call here for losing sales so that what so that we can have an efficiency lose the seals unveil this is openly sealed so we can have a perfect man a perfect bride a perfect people on the face of the earth again like adam and eve were in the garden of eden like the early church was that's what they only understood that call they understood that when the seas open it unveils ephesians when it sees the open it brings on a perfect man a perfect people a perfect bread and face of the earth when he says open it brings that a prophet uh uh uh uh uh uh uh people on the face of the earth so we find the crown went out and when the crown went out who is worthy to the book unknown man was found worthy and john wept you understand why you wept we're doomed we're not going to be able to go back to that perfect state we're not going to be able to go back to ephesians john had experienced it and he knew that's how the bread of god must be to go in to their home in the skies and so john wept john wept and the elder told him don't weep john [Music] the elder who has been training the world from malaca don't weep john the lion of the tribe of judah the root and the offspring of david he hath prevailed he had overcome to take the book and to lose the seven sales thereof so that there will be an efficiency so there will be perfect people on the face of this there'll be another people on the face of the earth who under their mention will be the final voice to the final age and when the elder told him that john was glad and happy and he looked looking for the lion to come and take the book and open up the seals so that the revealing of the series the open of the seals one more time will bring on ephesians will bring down another efficiency will bring on redemption full total complete redemption on the face of the earth like it was on the day of pentecost he looked to see the lion come take the book and when he looked there came a lamb right straight from eternity you will not hear anybody tell you only malacca will tell you that that lump came all the way from eternity from the throne of intercession from the back paths of god's mind he came and entered into the picture and he walked and he destroyed the lamb the lamb having seven eyes and seven horns which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth these seven spirits have been sent forth into god's i have incentive all the earth from eden right now to eden again these seven spirits of the lamb have been how god has dealt with men from eden right back to eden again shannon falling to all the earth all the seven dispensations of man's history it has been these seven spirits that have been god's ways of dealing with man of relating interacting with men through seven church ages of man's existence on the face of this earth here and the lamb went and took the book out of the hand of him that set upon the throne the one on this one has the book in his hand and in his hand means ownership there's a difference between in the hand and on the right hand in the right hand and on the on the right hand means the authority the power i saw jesus standing on the right hand of god it means jesus with the authority and power of the almighty god but in the right hand means ownership i have the documents in my hand i own the documents in the right hand of him that sat on his own he went and took the book out of his hand who could this be who could this be it must be the same one the on the book the original owner of the book oh hallelujah but quickly what is the lamp represent the bible tells us the lamb was the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth into all seven dispensations of man's history into all seven ages of god's interaction and dealing with man and this seven these seven spirits this lamb represented the spirit of god the seventh the holy spirit of god the abstract from the beginning the book in the hand of the original owner was the title deed to earth to man's inheritance on the earth but he needed the abstract to search it all the way back to the very beginning you hear many people preach about the world the world the world and they do it very beautifully but without the abstract you are not going to get full total complete redemption on the face of the air because the seven seals come from way back on the back path of god's mind the seventh season just become a book you have to trace the book right back to his very origins and that's what the abstract that's what the lamb represents remains the abstract the holy spirit the abstract from the beginning that traces the book from the beginning trace the book way back to his very origins to his very foundations in elohim's mind and that's what makes this message different we preach justification just like everybody has the practice pentecostals preacher's question but we preach just question with the abstract searching your just nation all the way right back to the very origins of justification to where you know you never did it in the first place that's the difference same with sanctification but some of the holy ghost searching all the way back to where anything against you is cancelled to where you never did the first place to where you were with god you as old as god himself you are in god's genes the father jesus of god rested in you from way back before the function of the world only the abstract can take you to that place it's not just preaching the world the abstract will take you all the way back to that spot so the lamb represents the holy spirit the abstract from the beginning that goes all the way back to the origins that goes all the way back to the very foundations that goes all the way back to elohim's mind to search out these deep truths that's why you'll never hear these truths from anywhere else but from elijah's message the prophet malachi 4 because he is the only one that showed you the abstract the seven seals being such all the way back men completed seven seals um first fossil broke and a white house rider with no bu no hour they can say those things but the abstract must be there to search that revelation all the way right back into the minds of god and bring it to you as your message there's a difference friends i will get into it shortly all glory the seventh the the lamb represents the spirit of god to reveal to open to expand to take you right back to the very foundations of the war before the wars were ever formed before lucifer ever came into before angels were created where you were a part of god you are a jinn a seed gem in god before the foundation of the world the lamb represents the spirit of god to reveal to open the lamb represents the seven spirits of god which is the seven seals the lamb the seven spirits of god that came and took the book and opened the seals the lamb the seven spirits of god that opened up the seven seals what are we doing i've said revelation 5 is where the secret is to tie all these things together the church ages seven church ages seven seals efficiency redemption the glory land the new jerusalem eden on the other side new jerusalem on the other side of jordan in the fields of eden where the tree of life is blooming again where the tree of life is is growing again revelation 5 the breach holds the key with revelation 5 there's a bridge there's a gap in your understanding of the seven church edges how it's going back there's a gap in your understanding of so many things adam did they go to heaven they go to hell lot did they go to heaven they go to hell uh uh uh samson they go to heaven that's their bridge in your knowledge but malaka afros message such is all the way back to the man of god and gives you the real revelation the truth of these things so you'll know not guessing that it but straight from the man of god so we're talking about revelation 5 what were the things in revelation 5 so we can bring it together and tie it together for you number one celebration five is the thai block the diamond hitch is trying to tell you like that the rubbish is not a bridge it's a diamond hitch to connect over the bridge over the bridge over the gap version 5 contains the understanding the revelation the teaching the deep mystery truths the bridges all of these things for you it's a diamond each that ties in the last part of the lyricion church age ties everything and ties it all in amen so we have in version five the lamp and we're just showing through all the things the lamb represent and then we have also the lion and the lion represents the spirit of judgment that smites the earth and the people that is going to smile the earth and the people after all the names in the book have received the seven seals and have come into ephesians the lamb the lion represents that the spirit of judgment that's going to obstruct the earth lest i come and smite the earth with the cross but before the time i'll send you elijah the prophet with a revelation of a seven seals to call you out to drive you back to the tree of life to drive you back into the tree of life so that you can by the revelation unveiling number seven sales to you taking you all the way back by the abstract to the title deed that you might be able to come to ephesians a perfect man standing on the face of the earth here and they are waiting on you and i because they're without us cannot be made perfect and that's what the seven churches have to do with it that's the connection there where the seven churches are connected in there the lion after the last name on the book after the last cedar god has received these seven seals and these seven secrets has ushered them into an efficient the seven series ephesians jesus christ veiled malacca fulvilling the world the mysteries of redemption that we have received after this has called you out and has anointed the last name on the book and ushered them into the same efficient age that eternal church age at the end of the seals after that then the lamb becomes a lion on the throne of intercession where the lamb came from changes and becomes the throne of judgment lest i come and smile after the course but i have a little space there a dam on a hitch there i'll send elijah the prophet into that little slot there oh my because after the last name has come into efficiency their redemption is over the mediterranean work is done and the savior of the lamb becomes the judge the savior of the lamb becomes the judge these seven spirits driving you to the tree of life becomes the judgment that god's gonna judge the world by so this message here these thunders and things lightening thunder's voices you are gonna understand then amen oh my the lamb and the lion is one on the same thing you know that so here is the lesson here here's here's here's the understanding that we need to understand here between because he said who's while you take the book and john wept and then i said the lion has been able to take the book so the lion is going to take the book but before the lion takes the book he has taps the lamp to take the book first so the lamb takes the book first and the lion is also going to take the book but between the time the lamb takes the book and the time the lion takes the book in between those two times in there you can slot in there the seven seal book you can sort in there the john and the elders worshipping you can slot in there the elders crying out we shall reign on the earth amen the elder said the lana prevailed to take the book but the lamb took the book so the lamb took the book well the lion is also going to take the book how the lamb is going to switch and become the lamb i mean the lion the savior is going to become the church the the spirit seven spirits of god that's driving you to the uh uh tree of life driving you into ephesians is gonna become the church to judge everyone that's outside glory to god but when the lion takes the book is judgmental so between these two times when the lamb takes the book and when the lion takes the book in between there are the seven seal book the opening of the seals the revealing of the seven series the mystery truth in the seven seals searching out going around looking for sons and daughters of god to drive them back to the tree of life and drive them back to the garden of eden drop them back to ephesians drive them back to a perfect man standing on the face of the earth between the lamb and the lion of the seven seal book between the lamb and the lion ah john and the elders worshipping what is that john the bride worshiping seeing the capstone coming on top of the pyramid where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy and the monsters sang together and malacca said you were there you shattered because you saw the capstone commit capping up the pyramid of your lives that's why john and the elders shouted wept i mean cried for joy and john said all creatures in heaven on the earth under the had had a john sharding crying rejoicing for the cap stone is coming to cup of the pyramid of my life by the revelation of the seven seals of redemption oh glory to god amen and no wonder the crowd are the others cried out thou hast beat us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth they understood what it meant the seven seals when the seven seals opened then god's ready for the children of god the city of god to take the title deed back not jersey title did now they've had the title deed down through the edges notice the main age preaching the world preaching the word but tattle did such all the way back and that's why they abstract to the title deed the spirit that goes and searches the rings on the ancients of god and brings it to you here in the form of a message of the seven seals from that great elijah prophet of malachi 4 oh my so the lamb took the book and the land is gonna take the book because the lamb is gonna switch and become the lion when the last name has been totally present tense redeemed and driven back to ephesians a perfect man on the face of the earth what is the book he told you revelation 5 the book is a seven cell book and the book is from before the definition of the war of malacca photos on the series different places the seventh seal book has its origins in the mind of god from the foundation of the world and the book was closed in the hands of the one that sat on the throne in his hands he was the original owner but this book was open at one time oh yes it was now let's quickly trace the origin of this book through the bible and then we'll close malachi 4 told us that this book here is a seven seal book of redemption you don't see that there he said is the book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals closed closed up with seven seals but malacca fossa is the book of redemption and you understand that from what we've been saying tonight i mean we've been saying saying i mean uh these this morning malacca for also taught us that this book has its origins in the man of god before the foundation of the world where the redemption story was planned and actually affected don't pass present tense before the world was even formed the seven seals is based upon the finnish work of redemption not trying to be saved you always was you always were saved you always was a son you just come here to recognize it hallelujah oh my on the seven seals on the man of god seven seals seven spirits of god seven spirits of god send forth into all the earth from the man of god these seven spirits here come down in eden and we see him in the garden of eden the tree of life jesus christ in the garden of eden the seven seals himself the perfect one in the garden of eden the perfect one there he was the tree of life jesus christ the seven spirits of god sent fallen to all the earth but here he was amen and because he was there adam could maintain he created adam into a perfect state and because of the seven seals adam could stay in a perfect state the seven seals not only brought on the efficiency for adam it maintained adam in an efficient perfect state the tree of life was open god told him of the tree of both trees uh are everything in the garden you may eat you'll never find in the bible white ever said giving specific instructions instructions about the tree of life because open adam knew that he didn't say of the tree you may eat the tree of life no it's just of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou mayest not eat because the day you eat thereof that then you die but he never told him or the tree of life if not he was open to him he didn't have to tell him that the tree of life was the seven seals the tree of life was jesus christ the tree of life was the ephesians and it was by that that adam could live and maintain he said so adam knew he knew the importance of this tree he knew the importance of these seven seals he knew the importance of this efficiency he knew the important partners of this tree in the garden he knew it and by this seven sales book tree of life in eden adam lived in rulership dominion and authority on the face of the earth by this tree of life adam could exercise authority and ownership on the face of the earth and by the open book the tree was open to him you may eat it now tell that he was open and by that open book of the seven seals jesus christ in eden the tree of life brought on an ephesians a perfect man in the garden of eden hallelujah that book was opened in adam's hands the tree of love was opened to him the seven seals were opened to adam and by it he lived and experienced the life in ephesians a perfect man on the face of the earth book was open to adam triola was open to adam the mysteries of how to get into the life of god was open to adam how to keep the devil out was open to adam how to navigate between the two spirits in the garden of eden that's the story of the seven seals that's the story of the seven seals to such all the way back to the beginning and know so that you'll know how to be and how not to be so you'll know the essence of the gospel is to get the spirit of god in and the spirit of god coming in get the spirit of the devil out and know the truth of the enemy the trail of the serpent the two spirits walking within the framework of a christian church those two influences on the face of the earth today i don't know that that's why adam was not deceived amen but when adam sinned you know the story wouldn't have to go over that he lo he lost his access to the book in other words the book became a close book to him and the book remain closed and went back to the hands of original owner and that book remained closed and that's why we find the book in the hands of region owner in revelation 5 closed book still within and on the back side written within and sealed on the backside with seven seals genesis 3 verses 21-24 details how the book became close to adam and went back into the hands of the original owner it was it became a closed book an otherwise open book before became a close book to adam it was close with caribbeans and a flaming sword and so so will the book remain closed all throughout the old testament years new testament years unt till revelation 5 when the crime went out who was worthy to take the book and to open the series to guide the way back to the tree of life so that we can go back to them so that we can go back to ephesians who is worthy and so the book remains closed all those years oh my so genesis 3 verse 21 to 24 we see the book was closed until revelation chapter 5. but down through the years god temporarily opened the book every now and then like open the book to elijah and he saw seven thousand names under there like i'm the only one god said no you are not open up the book and saw seven thousand names under there who had not defiled themselves with burial and jesus even when he came he opened the book temporarily he went to the temple he got the peace he was closed in the hands of the priest jesus took the book and opened it and found the place where it was written he picked out a promise for that day the spirit of the lord is upon me and left the promise of judgment the day of vengeance of our god he left that off because he was the seven seals being unveiled to the people to bring them to ephesians which was coming on amen in that first church age he cut off from he did not go into the day of vengeance which is when the lion comes and takes the book hallelujah so god every now and then open up the book and close but the book remain closed effectively from genesis 3 21 24 until revelation 5. and you understand john and the elders understood these things and they knew if this book is not open we're not going back to eden if this book is not open we're going tribulation period because laodicea ends up in the tribulation period the only way you'll go a liberation period in this legion church age is that you go in revelation 4 1 into the rapture in the skies and the only thing that's going to take you go there is the seven seals bringing you into ephesians and efficient is the bridge the bridges between denominations and glory land and that's why john wept he knew if if the book wasn't opened he was in the tribulation period already where the fairness of the wrath of god will be putted upon all mankind but even though the book was closed what that book represented god throughout the old testament years demonstrated and depicted that in his relationship with the children of israel the hebrew children which one of the hebrews because adam was god's first born son on the face of the earth jesus christ came he was the first person he is the original son of god the firstborn son and every one of us is the firstborn son because we are born direct from god we are not born through another person we are born there from god so that's why paul calls it the general assembly of the first born every believer is a first born son so god to show the input of that book to his first born general assembly of his first born family where everybody is a frostbound son direct lineage from god he had israel the children of israel every frostbound son in the family every family had the birthright this birthright was representative of what adam had in the garden of eden adam was the firstborn son adam had inheritance adam had the birthright in the garden of eden and if you look at all just many years the birthright that every firstborn had considered of three things number one the birthright number two the priesthood every frostmonson accessed the authority of the priesthood in his family and number three the inheritance went to the first one let me say that again what the book represent to adam even though the book was closed god depicted all that in his dealings with the children of israel through the old testament years a shadow of redemption to show us what we are to have previewing for us to have given us the evidence of what we are going to have shadows of redemption and so every frostborn son had the birthright every firstborn son had uh uh uh the priesthood every firstborn son had the inheritance in the family put aside what adam had adam had eternal life fellowship with god and the inheritance in his eternal life what was it the birth weather every frost person had was the same equip equates with what adam had eternal life the birthright eternal life the priesthood the fellowship with god to go into the presence of god for fellowship for for for relationship with god and number three the inheritance the ownership rulership on the face of the earth god put all that together into the birthright for every firstborn son in israel a shadow of redemption and that's how i remained the side was until reuben jacob's first bounce on reuben sinned and lost that bathroom lost his bad god he went into his father's concubine and after reuben god split this birthright into three he no more gave it to every firstborn son no more he broke into three and how he do that he spilled and gave the birthright to joseph he split it and gave the priesthood to levi the levitical priesthood was born and he split it and gave the authority and inheritance and power to judah what was it who said besides what adam had the birthright was eternal life and joseph had that the priesthood was fellowship and levi had that to lead the people into the prince of god for fellowship and the authority and inheritance and the parent dominion ownership on the earth the inheritance that adam had judah had that when adam lost the book and he lost these three things god restored god slew a lamb that same lamb and restored back his eternal life in other words his birthright restored back his fellowship in other words his priesthood so he can come into the presence of god still and have fellowship with god but the inheritance that authority that rulership and dominion which went to judah was not restored that wasn't restored and god put that there for character formation to grow and mature to be a song that the father can trust with his power and authority to rule and and and be a king in the domain on the earth in the place of his father god that was not restored and that's why in genesis 49 that all patriarch jacob prophet signed literally on judah his son the scepter shall not depart from judah until shallow come in other words when shallow comes back when it's coming shallow the lord jesus christ that's when the scepter of authority will be back again on the face of the earth john and the elders knew these things they knew these things they knew these things when they saw when they heard the and when when the john cried but when the elder told him the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed john knew he is coming now with the scepter of authority hallelujah john knew amen the authority is coming back we had the birthright we've had the fellowship we've had the priesthood we've had the birthright but now we are going to have the kinship the authority the rulership dominion the inheritance on the earth and that's why john scream that's why the other scream you have made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth oh hallelujah amen so when jonah and the elder saw they cried out oh my they knew right away we are going back to eden they knew right away we are going back to the tree of life we are going back to rulership to dominion to authority on the earth no wonder they cried out we shall reign on the earth and i say we shall reign on there the scepters come back authority by the opening of the seven seals they knew right away right away they knew right away the book was going to be open once more like it was open to adam they knew what adam could not why couldn't get back to that tree was because the scepter of authority was removed from him but once they saw this after coming back they knew right away the book is going to be open oh my the new writer with the seven seal book closing the hand of the original owner is the same seven seal book from eden they knew that they understood the call who is willing to open the book and to lose the seven sales thereof they knew what it meant they knew what he meant this book here amen gonna take us back to fellowship i mean kill us by the eternal life such all the way right back into the abstract in god's mind fellowship right back into god's mind that's going to take us back to the inheritance in life search all the way back to god's mind to where this quarter can have nothing to do with it oh hallelujah glory to god oh my they know right away they understood and knew that the opening of the book would mean the restoration of eternal life would mean the restoration of fellowship would mean the relation of inheritance exactly as adam had it they know the opening of the seven seal book will produce and bring on another ephesians a perfect man with perfect holy ghost works as adam had before he felt by sin as the early bread had efficiency perfection perfect perfection that can never fail john and the elders know these things would happen when the lamb takes the book they saw a new when the lamb takes the book the seven seals will be open sons and daughters of god are going to be ushered into ephesians the servants is gonna break them the seven seals jesus christ himself is gonna break them into ephesians by the seven seals there are being officials like he's in ephesians reigning on the earth they knew these things oh hallelujah so they knew that that's going to happen with that all that has to happen before the lion takes the book so here's the lesson today we know from allah careful like i said before that when the lands take the then the lamb takes the book all these things that have happened when the lion when the lamb took the book all of these things happened the seven seals opened the seven sails seven spirits driving sons and daughters to go back to the tree of life when the lamb takes the book sons and daughters being ushered by the seven seals jesus christ who is ephesians himself they have been ushered into ephesians perfection a perfect man standing on the face of the earth doing it for all the other seven church areas that's gone on before because without us they cannot be made perfect all of these things happen and when the last name on the book is brought into ephesians that way then the lion takes the book the lamb becomes a lion and the only thing that is different is that judge intercession is over redemption is over there's no more drop of blood on the throne is now judgment time oh hallelujah when the lion takes the book only other thing that's added is intercession is over mercy is over judgment is here now is the land of judah time a judgment time with the scepter of authority to rule and reign with a rod of iron that's what it was that's what the elder announcer john is so close but before the time here come the grace of god the lamb stepped on the scene with the revelation of a lamb to take the book and break the seals and send the revelation down on the artery seventh oh my mama so when the lamb stepped fought and took the book first what is that that's not fixing the clothes what is that it represents the lamb and that lamb there represents a little space of time to drive the elect names on the book drag them back to the tree of life the same seven spirits that drove you away from the tree of life close the book to you like it was closed in the hands of the original owner raising fire the same seven angels seven spirits are driving you back to the tree of life now oh my you see how are the elected ones driven back to the tree of life they're driven back by the lamb because he opened the seas he took the book and the lion is waiting in the wings but the lamb takes the book and broke the revelation torsil after seal the seal is the spirit of god he said the book was written within writing was within on the backside there was no writing it was a seal on the backside the seal is the spirit of god the seal is the spirit to anoint the world the lamb broke the seals so how the elected one driven back the tree of life they are driven by the lamb who is the lamb we said it before the bible tells us that version 5 who is the lamb the lamb is the seven species of god from before the foundation of the world the lamb is the seven spirits of god from the origins the very beginning the lamb is the abstract that goes all the spirit of god that goes all the way back to the man of god and from the man of god breaks open and reveals this series to you so when all these guys say brother branham took what what uh um mr lakin said about the sales and all that but abram said he read what those guys had to say and the angel came down every single day with the abstract the tarot day to show him from the mind of god trace it all the way back to the man of god while showing him also tracing the origins of the enemy to his very very foundation to the very very beginnings the seventh sealed book of redemption and open up the seals the lamb of god driving you back open the seals to you he takes you all the way back to the very origins to the man of god he takes you way back because he's the abstract to the title the revelation five the book is written within like i said before and on the back side still with seven seals the book is written within that's words on the back side see with seven seals that spirit seals seven spirits on the backside the carabins in in the garden of eden seven seals and you see those characters four anointings through seven disposition of time the seven spirits of god protecting the way of the tree of life oh hallelujah so the lamp the seven spirits that breaks the seals is the same one that closed and sealed up the book with seven seals on the backside in eden on the eastern side in the eastern side of your bible is the back of the book and the angels the holy spirit the seven spirits of god closed up the book amen in eden and he's the same one that comes right back from the origins as the abstract to the title did to open up the seven seals in opening the seals in opening these seven seals he comes from eternity you'll not hear that from anybody else even if they tell you you don't even know what it means but malacca for let you know it comes from eternity sachi's every single redemptive promise every single bible uh teaching is centered all the way back to the very origins in the man of god in opening the seals this lamb comes from eternity it comes from the throne of intercession he comes with the abstract to the childhood the spirit of god the sachinide all the way back oh my to drive you back to order the tree of life represents not drive back to some of it drive back to everything it represents in other words this is what that means he breaks the seals to you and in breaking the seals he's revealing eternal life to you he's bringing fellowship to you is a very inheritance in latin that's what adam lost now we have eternal life we have a fellowship but we don't have intelligence yet but the seven seals opens up to you and revealing what it means to have eternal life to you how you never in the first place is revealing to you fellowship even to you inheritance is given to you your birth rights it's bringing to you your priesthood rights his advantage your authority and your power how god couched the three things that adam lost to the generations of israel and their firstborn and you are of the general assembly of the first upon the lamb breaking the seals to you represents all of these things and more it breakthroughs to you and searches it all the way back to the backside the back part of elohim's mind because the abstract to the title did that's what it does that's the difference that is right between this message here and every other thousand everybody else between the seven seven series and malacca for between the seven seals the abstract such is all the way back that's what malachi 4 says the abstract to such all the way back if you just have the title did a squad i can come and prove to you that no he had it before you ever got it but if you can search it all the way to his origins which is what the abstract does then where the enemy cannot say anything the the squad cannot see anything it's such all the way back to where there's nothing against you to where there's nothing no inconvenience against your your your your rights to that totality none right to the very origin where the tattoos took effect in the very first instance the lamp that's how he draws you all the way back by the abstract of the churchill deeds the lamb the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth amen everybody can claim to pretty titled it but this is the abstract to the title date that takes you all the way back showing you real true revealed justification where you never did the first place searching your just kissing all the way right back to his origins in the man of god were you never in the first place where your name was splashed in blood and it can never be raised the lamb driving you back to that to lose your fear to know that god has you in the hollow of his arms to shake yourself to get away from all the nonsense to know that you were there before lucifer ever came on the sin at all because you were there before he created angels the lamb taking you all the way back by the abstract to real true reveal sanctification chin it all the way back to his very origins in my in god's mind where you were kept clean the devil couldn't touch you he still couldn't touch you he couldn't touch you with his tail that lie that he told he could not touch you you are kept clean unstained on untouched by all the filthiness of the wall untucked by lucifer it could not contaminate you don't fear little sister the sin will not drown you shake yourself loose this abstract takes you all the way back to real to reveal sanctification to where you never did in the first place to where the enemy could not lay his hands upon you shake it off check that take that demon of his lying to you he's praying upon your ignorance shake it off you are more than a congress sin shall not have dominion over you because you come from before the foundation of the beginning and the abstract to the title did has been revealed to you the lamp driving you back by real true revealed baptism of the holy ghost without sensation searching all the way back to the origins before the foundation of the world where you receive the cap stone coming up to cup of the pyramid of your life to where you were adopted a finished work been unveiled and revealed to you by the seven seals of redemption making you lose all your fear knowing that is already done the pyramid already the pyramid of your life was already capped off by the capstone way before the definition of the world in elohim's mind you have finished complete work you're only here and god's gonna manifest all of that so bring you to a perfect man another efficient as adam was in the garden of eden and bringing you to your inheritance in life that adam lost but which was not restored back to him but which the lion of the tribe of judah and that's why when the last name on the book is redeemed and the lamb becomes a lion and the door is shut that's when you're going to see the power of god really strike this church and you are going to see for about 30 40 days you are going to see absolute power like the wall has never seen before when the door is shut that's when you are going to see the fullness of the power as they get adopted get adopted the power is there spoken with power but when the door is shut and the lion comes right back with the book the deceptive authority back in judah's hand shallow has come now you are going to see the full display of the power of god but the venom said when the squeeze comes then you are going to see that's when the door is shut you are going to see that which you have seen in me manifested in the fullness of its power because the lamp has become the lion and when the land comes along comes the deceptive authority amen the lion of the tribe of judah with the scepter of authority that shall not depart from judah he has it now on the fullness of the power of the living god will be unveiling his church that's why we know that the power of god is in this church that's why we know the blood of jesus christ has access even right now to the power of the living god that's why we pray for the sick we cast our devils amen that's what whatever it is the power of the living god because it searched all the way to the origins by the abstract to where the devil don't have authority over to where is the finished work your salvation your healing your deliverance your joy is the finished work and the devil cannot put a finger on you oh hallelujah all this because the seven seals of redemption have been unfolded to you to bring you to another ephesians a perfect man standing on the face of the earth oh hallelujah saw the seven seals amen the lamb driving you back to that inheritance that adam lost but which has now been restored by the revealing of the seven seals to this end time bride oh my bringing you to ephesians a perfect man standing in all of his glory that's what you potentially are right now because the seals have been revealed they have been revealed he's not going to come into monica but he's there oh man that's why i said go to the angel amen say give me the little book give me the book take me all the way back to the man of god take me all the way back amen where are the incumbents against me it's canceled out take me all the way back to amen these great truths are their very origins that's the power that's in this world here over seven sails from malacca for the great elijah prophet that god sent was the message of redemption the seven seas of redemption i'm bringing to you in our full total complete redemption bringing to ephesians a perfect man stand on the earth in all of his glory life of his life born of his own spirit of his spirit works of his works oh my already closed here since the opening of the seven seals this is the opening of seven seals god has raised the mud gate the title did to the earth released and the abstract the title deed that takes you all the way back to your inheritance has already been poured out also has packed that message overseas into your soul to bring you to ephesians like adam had to bring you to efficiency like the early brad hatch on the seven seals brings on another efficient a perfect man fully totally completely redeemed on the face of theirs only waiting for one thing you get ready and go to the angel give me the book and the angel gives you the book when he gives you the book you this is all we said tonight you know what it means to give you the book he's driving you all the way back to the abstract that's why malachi first message is so is it is so strong on what happened before the foundation of the world what happened in elohim's mind it's the abstract of the title deed it's not the title deed they abstract the spirit of god the seven spirits of god taking you all the way back to the man of god none other message like it on the face of the earth to bring you to perfection to bring you to another ephesians to bring you across the bridge amen and when you understand this then you are going to be ready to go in the rapture in the skies because revelation 3 amen 14 to 22 is the messenger and reverend four is the rapture and the black goes up in the rupture in the skies and ration four to nineteen is the tribulation period on the face of the earth if you don't go prohibition for your intuition period but you cannot go up into revelation for until revelation five is sucked in on direction 3 42 22 and this message of redemption in the breach the thai block the diamond hitch the bridge over denominations is anointed into your soul and the seven seals amen will bring you into efficiency the perfect man and that's the bridge that bridges you from the end of laodicea denominations into glory land louisia denominations going into traditional period but you are breached over into eternity by the seven seals jesus christ veiled on the inside of you and that's gonna be your efficiency bridge to take you up in the rapture in the skies one final quote and i'm done brother branham here amen oh glory to god amen amen on a paradox january 17 1965 brother braham said it is grace permitting it that will bring these people conscious of god he was there doing the discernment and all of that to show you the demons demonstrate to you the power the authority the rulership the dominion like adam demonstrated like the early bread heard never imagined the apostles of the power and the glory like malachi for heart because the seven seals in him brought him to ephesians and you have promised the same thing because jesus christ was the ephesians in him and jesus christ deficiencies in him amen he's driving you back to the tree of life by this message and when you get right there he said thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations and tongues and kings you're going to prophesy how like the early bride did because the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prayer you're going to testify of jesus christ jesus christ the official is going to be built on the inside of you and they're going to see a perfect bride standing on the face of the earth amphibians you are in that efficiency then you have stepped onto the bridge you have stepped out of denominations leo this year in other words and you are ready to go into the rapture in the skies and lyricia slides on into the tribulation period that's why john cried if you don't get on that efficiency bridge you are not going in the rapture in disguise it's a tribulation period but thank god for a mighty prophet amen amen you serious grace permitting it a paradox that will bring these people conscious of god now not knowing nothing about you not even knowing you no way just a strange man that come here now it will be absolutely a paradox for something to happen to know what was wrong with you or something you had done or something you ought not to have done or something or who you are or something about you it will have to be a paradox because there is no way for anybody to know that asset or some revelation of the unseen that's right now if you'll do that for you between you and i so that the audience not as sure but that they might see the ephesians is here they might see the ephesus is here perfection perfection don't mean is the power of god in the church of the living god the spoken word power of god thus seeing the lord keep still that the man or the if ephesus is here that they might know that this is the thing the ephesus that bridges between denominations and glory land in other words bridges between leonisia and glory land that's how you get into a glory land that's how you get the glory and glory line eden on the other side of the rapture ethan is done on this side of the rapture eden is on the other side of the rapture so that they might know that this episode is the thing that bridges between denomination and glory land he promised their friends that they might be assured that what we are telling is the truth oh my revelation 5 who's the secret friends the key to tie up for you the connection between the seven church ages on the seven seals and the seven seals will put into you the spirit of god the seven spirits of god that that you might know like he said this message on teaching is to tell you and show you that man that redeemed man that's going to be in that eternal church age glory land at the end of the season but to get from the end of the seas to the end of it to that glory land you need to be on that bridge and ephesians is the bridge the seven seas is the bridge jesus christ is the bridge he is the ephesians god richly bless you amen oh hallelujah let's all stand just close your eyes and raise
