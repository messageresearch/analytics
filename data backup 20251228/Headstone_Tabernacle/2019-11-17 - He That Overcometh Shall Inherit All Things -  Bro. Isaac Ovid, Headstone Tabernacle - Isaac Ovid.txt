look through the blood so you don't see the mistakes we made this morning you don't see the mistakes you made yesterday you don't see the mistakes we made last week or last month or last year but when you look through the blood it filters it filters this temporal existence and you see the eternal sea that's in our soul that was there Lord God before it was a moon before there was a star we had

happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning so your thank God to be in the house of the Lord this morning to give Him praise to give him glory and [Music] while we're standing let's turn to our scriptures greet you in the precious name of Jesus I want to read two portions of scripture reading from second Peter 3 and reading from verse 1 certainly a great privilege to be in a house of the Lord second Peter 3 and reading from verse 1 this second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that II may be mindful of the words which was spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior now Peter is speaking here and this is in essence the last text we would have of Peter and there's something that I find very special about last words I was sharing with the young people yesterday that last words are important they have a certain weight if you know is the last you're going to be speaking you approach things a certain way as someone is preparing to leave the earth they're very careful with what they say because this may be the last time that they're seeing something so peter has been very careful with how he's speaking here knowing this first was three that they shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and seeing where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as the world from the beginning of creation for this they willingly are ignorant in other words they are making a choice to be ignorant in other words they know better but they are pushing aside what they know they are willingly ignorant that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the earth which I know by the same word are kept in store so the word created and the word is also keeping in store so it's the word that is keeping you here it's the word that's keeping you alive it's the word that is keeping you moving without the word you have nothing because the word is God can the church say man reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all all in English means all although means some all should come to repentance so it's God's desire that all should come to repentance and he goes on but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works at therein shall be burned up seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that he look for such things be diligent and this is the instruction to us that ye be found of him in peace without spot and blameless an account at the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction EVF o beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen and our last reading from revelation 21 with moving revelation 21 verse 1 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord and he could give the Lord a hand or praise amen we are so happy to be here once again and we had a tremendous time in the youth service yesterday for those that were here those overhear you appreciating youth service yesterday amen a wonderful time we tomber the Great Commission and we're talking about Jesus's last words that he was sharing with his disciples before he left and the Bible says in acts 1 and verse 9 as he was seeing these things and fact let me just drop it here some of you would know it certainly and certainly for those we would do what Peter said to bring it back to your remembrance is that okay this morning October drove it I'm not gonna be too long but I want to take my time a little bit so you appreciate a pastor this morning amen what a tremendous time we had last Sunday and this week and all mark I can't even I can't even get enough of it and I feel unworthy to stand here this morning but I have to put my shoulder to the wheel to give him a little rest I love him said catch his breath a little bit Amen so I'm here to put my shoulder to the wheel this morning amen so in acts 1 and verse 9 and axud as a question to the young people what would Jesus last words you know I have this thing about last was a few months ago I preached a message the last words of the great warrior Joshua I'm seeing whenever somebody's about to leave the scene what they see they are very careful in what they say you had already talked stupidness when about to leave people serve up and Archimedean Suva when they come down to their last words that's why the Bible said is better to be in a house of mourning than the house of laughter because in the house of mourning you get wisdom you know so in in in in Jesus's last words you find in Acts chapter 1 and verse 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight so it means that whatever Jesus was talking about before acts 1:9 was what were the last thing that he was talking about it was a things he was leaving with the people after his whole ministry after his three and a half years ministry after he went to the cross after he rose again after in his resurrection ministry after he dealt with him as he was parting with them and what did he say acts 1:7 he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power he's the one controlling that but here is your promise he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you so he mansion the disciples are now taking these notes now there they have already experienced a lot and he's about to leave and this is his word to them he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and it doesn't end there and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the and that is what he was talking about and while he was saying this Jesus began to disappear from them while he was sharing this with them he began to move from them so he left them with a promise of power and a promise of being a witness and a witness is not a here see a thing is not somebody tell me that that you could be healed a witness is jesus healed me so I could tell you what it did for me Jesus changed me so I can tell you by my own personal experience with a pillar of fire that he did it for me not if he did it for the pasta but if he did it for me then he could do it for you and unless you have your own experience you cannot be a witness so we want experience witnesses we want witnesses who've been in the backside of the desert we want witnesses who a pin through the fire pin through the flood been through all kind of trials but you could all see you been through the blood can the church say man that's what we need with this is and he said witnesses in Jerusalem in other words right where you are right now you're supposed to be your witness you're supposed to be a witness in your house on your job in your school even in the church give you another witness there's something wrong with you because you supposed to be a witness everybody in your neighborhood of Jerusalem wherever your Jerusalem is you should know that you know Jesus and Jesus knows you it's two sides of this you must know Jesus and Jesus must know you does he know your name this morning does he know where you come from does he know where you've been this morning can the church give a lot of shout of praise hallelujah you may be seated I'm not preaching it I'm just recapping a little bit from yesterday I'm trying to bridge into this morning hallelujah testing the temperature sister 7 gotta make sure the temperature is right some of you didn't warm up this morning so we have to warm up before we get into the word this morning some people came yes we'll have another service but that's not everybody not everybody is like that no no no no no no not everybody some people because we know in every church have three kinds of believers so it's expected it doesn't come as a surprise to us when we see people looking all this way and that way but when we come into the house of God we come to preach the sons and daughters who knows their names are under book condemnation has nothing to do with it your past has nothing to do with it what went wrong has nothing to do with it you are heaven bound you're looking for a new heaven you're looking for a new earth you're looking for sin to be dissolved you're looking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire you looking for a snake in your heart to be permanently burnt until the devil has to release you he could have nothing to hold on to you he has nothing to say about you can the church say man Oh hallelujah you may be seated I said it a few weeks ago I said my past is under the blood and my future is under the seventh seal the devil has nothing on me and he has nothing under you if you made any mistakes put it under the blood whatever that ever sees lies because he has no evidence he has nothing on you your past under the blood your future under the seven shield Satan who you talking about you don't know who I am you don't know who I am he didn't even know who Jesus was if the devil didn't know who Jesus was you think you know who you are all power that was in God dropped down on the earth and the devil had to ask if Doby I'm not sure are you the one are you the one because God is a master at feeling himself he's a master at disguising himself he could use a donkey he could use a stone he said if you don't want to worship the rocks are gonna cry out he could use whatever he wants he doesn't need me he doesn't need you he can raise up a generation who will remember the words of the prophets and the words of the Apostles because that's the foundation of this church it's built upon the foundation of the prophets and the apostles can the church amen you may be seated it's not built on the pastor it stampede somebody over it's based on a show for nation but never has had a motive Korah his prophets it's based on the prophets and the apostles peter himself we read it and I love it - nobody time Peter is right in this Peter is making sure that everybody know there's nothing between him and Paul because when Paul arrived pause at the shake things up and he back said Paul withstood Peter to his face yeah anything real belly to do that it had to be God that was in Paul that put upon him to approach pizza and say Pizza ability have the wrong approach towards these Gentiles you can speak for these Jews but for these Gentiles this group is a different bunch of people their natural bloodline may not be Abraham but call them grafted them into the Covenant the hidden messages will be revealed is that God blinded the eyes of the Jews because he had some Gentiles that he had to print the pass and God only if he didn't do that we wouldn't be here Oh God happy this mornin but for this Gentile dispensation so pizza couldn't end off without letting everybody know Paul and I may have had disagreements Alleluia Paul and I may have had no misunderstandings and Peter chose to end his discourse and I counted long-suffering awful Lord salvation even as our beloved brother Paul he didn't want people to say I am a pizza and I'm appalled he said my beloved brother Paul also come to the wisdom given unto him it wasn't by my instruction of advice or due to our deliberations but the wisdom given unto him and written unto you as also in all his epistles so PJ is about to leave the scene but Paul as the master that was age the battle is already passed on and Peter is making an old hesitation look at all the stuff that Paul has written about and our prophet said Paul was the gold standard by which every messenger was supposed to be measured that's why even after all the ages but the Branham said I rest on the fact that I preached what Paul preached by the wisdom given unto Him that's imported for a joke come from heaven and see anything else let that interfere cus check that angel passport see where he came from and find out where he come from because that's not what I preach [Applause] Paul was super Sweden he said if I come back next week Sunday and say something different from what I said this Sunday let me be accurst also because the revelation I received came direct from God and I'm resting on that [Applause] come to church hey man we talked my rugged Christians we talk about tough christians christians with backbone Christians who are warriors am i talking to that group of people this morning hallelujah so our title let me just drop it because the way are going I might forget to give it so I don't want to forget he that overcometh shall inherit all things he that overcometh shall inherit all things now this thing about this would all this with all the popular dinner this would all do have no exceptions this would all means to the overcomers brother George every promise that was ever counted as part of inheritance it's counted in this thing called all the overcomers are somebody all is the inheritance that is all the inheritance goes to the son who overcome because not everybody but a nice will overcome but the doors that overcome if you go to the scripture if you find someone a qualified as inheritance material put it in this bucket called oil can the church naman so rapture in that bucket called all resurrection in that bucket called all can the church came in until your children in that pocket call all missing limbs be restored in that pocket call oil before the doctors hand touches my wife smoker or healing in that pocket call all you have taxes to pay go find a fish that's in that bucket call oil you have no money that's in that bucket call on him be an jehovah jireh is in that pocket call on him be Jehovah Rapha is in that pocket call but to dip into that pocket you have to be an overcomer and if you have to be an overcomer machine you have to have something to overcome and the bigger thing you overcome is the more of an overcomer you become somebody help me this morning Oh hallelujah listen it's so simple enough but sometimes I receive believers curl up in the fetal position it's this trial is this pressure is this trouble and I see but you don't want to be an overcomer well yes well you have to have so much overcome every punch the more you have to overcome is the more you arrest you make God look in the series you miss he overcame the lust of the eyes so when temptation come that is to get a checkmark lottery a spoon last study flash overcome money overcome jealousy overcome backbiting they talk about you but you forgive overcome you didn't do nothing they did everything but you're chopped you ought anyway oh god help me this morning overcome room overcome homosexuality overcome fornication overcome adultery overcome lion overcome cheat him overcome backbiting overcome gossip and overcome church members overcome force anointed ones overcome all come on somebody reach back to me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah I'm not going to be too long with you this morning but god help me I'm gonna push as much as I can push but - I'm here on fumes I'm here on fuse enough the body tired but their soul is on fire this soul is on fire can the church say Amen so I needed to preach back to me this morning I needed to carry some of this burden with me I can't do it alone but if two shall agree touching anything that's what my Bible tells me if two shall agree touching anything they can have what I asked for I see more than two people in here this morning what happened when three people agreed what happens when four people agree what happens when everyone agrees the Bible says they were in one mind they were in one Accord he had one vision they had one purpose it was one Lord it was one thing it was one baptism they were in the Ephesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah I certainly young people if you're not growing you are dying if you are not growing you are dying and I was challenging the young people if 2020 is not more than 2019 we are feeling we have to do more we have to Jesus whole teaching greater shall you do when Elijah told Elijah what you want to be say what a double portion yes I wanna see him thing so as we come to the end of 2019 2020 cannot be the same thing it need to be more as we come to the end of November December need to be more January need to be more February need to be more more overcoming more victory more prayer more of the anointed more fire more the spirit more of the word so let me finish wrap up what I was singing yesterday then touch this and see where we go so our 70 young people about the Great Commission that the message has also created a bunch of lazy selfish people who don't who only think about themselves and they miss the Great Commission which Jesus some said isn't the Commission given by a prophet this is a commission given by an apostle this is Jesus himself seen you shall receive power after you Holy Ghost is upon you and it's a conjunction not so it's a continuation right you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem in all Judea and he goes on Samaria and it's in the autumn ook so what have you done for the kingdom who have you witnessed you know buddy Branham said if you don't testify you'll find yourself back soon one knee and let somebody recently and know when people ready ready to leave this little everything about you speaks leaving everything about you speaks I can come out to hear everything but it says you I am leaving this place how your approach service what time you come this is how your pre when he comes everything you do says the people you go in somewhere you see where somebody about to fly out doesn't even in fly not any state sending two weeks before they fly but they start back on could be excited to go ahead you know that way you going somewhere sorry they even tell it is fun and claim to get something and all kind of different things see them carrying bargain is like you will somewhere here and I waited waited without you we're good because they're making preparations your behavior such as just the people that you fly in on can the church say Amen wonderful but I just wanna go back into something here in the scripture we read even when Peter was speaking about Paul I want to take it a little slower even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him have written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which listen carefully as some things hard to be understood so Peter say and know Paul said some things that is not easy to understand but listen he qualified is who happy problem which theater unlearned and unstable wrest that word rest means battle so people who are unlearned and unstable have trouble withi we think that Paul always mention there are difficulties with our challenges they know why Paul's or often as they do also the scriptures so it's not just Paul's if you have a problem with their preliminary sketches unto their own destruction ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware less he also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness so I want to encourage you church this morning that the world that we have received for all these years don't take it for granted don't fight it don't battle with it but embrace it as even what you don't understand there's a promise of understanding coming to you but have the right attitude towards it and be ready to see a mentor you would even if it rub you the wrong way because you don't want to fall into that category of people who have trouble with these scriptures have trouble with you would I want to make that clear to everybody this morning can the church say Amen so we talked about overcoming this morning he that overcometh shall inherit all things and but I'm Adam said many times and we know it to be the case that you can't overcome unless you have something to overcome you can't have a victory unless you have a battle you can't win unless it's a sacrifice the thing about God is he don't let us choose his sacrifice he let us choose if God tell you choose your child your nature would be the truly trial and you know you the pass if in your school is na you right III questions for your exam and you answer did you concern what what you gonna do you will be foolish the true chuka chuka answer you will always put chickens in your New Ager answer if you give em much sense and hybridize that to a man says write your own tests write your answer and correct people one plus one is two less question 1 2 plus 2 is 4 4 plus 4 is 8 I said my whole paper submitted because of my nature would be to go to the easiest thing why would I want to put plus or minus a square root of B squared my for over 2 e and work the square root and I didn't approve something that no that's not our nature but when it comes to God God designs trials for us not as a collective so you can't look at somebody else trial and say well well yes he if I was he I wish I had his trial you know how his back make you looking at it and you think you couldn't handle any style and you're back at least I don't know you don't know what he had telling you about each other it might sound simple but the reality is somehow we look around and be like nobody but God and dealing with you in the context of anybody else he has no grandchildren and he only has sons and daughters and he has taken time to look at what you need and create situations are wrong your life specifically designed for you your boss waiting for you tomorrow with a world trial he done anointed for that she didn't no idea at all ready to make sure that patients have a perfect to make sure that time he waiting for you you know you can avoid it this is not no ostrich gospel I put my head in his sand and because I'm not watching the boss the boss turn watching me that's not what we're talking about because if you want to inherit all things you have to overcome everything the same way Jesus overcame and he overcame to prove that you are also overcoming and he's to give you a key he said I conquered and he said you are more than conquerors because I live you gonna live also oh come on now the same words I do you are gonna do also as my father sent me so send I you the same Commission the father gave me I pass the baton of the Great Commission to you that you can finish the work that this bride will be a continuation of the book of acts can the church Haman can we give a lot of shouter praise I'm just encouraging you this morning how lonely this overcome anything because we have a promise Prince I promise to break out of this motel to put on immortality we have to keep nailing it down there is an eternal place there's an eternal age where there's no beginning and no end we want to break out of this time and break in the eternal age where we came from it's not foreign to us we were there before but God wiped our memories to give the devil us belief that he could take out his bride but when the time comes he will restore your memory Oh God and you will remember what you were before you were here and at that tea you wanna know that the father is come on now you're gonna remember the DNA and the genes of God you may be seated it's only when your memory is restored could you walk into all that is your zero with this new and this new technology might make it a little clearer in cryptocurrency is it in you will have cryptocurrency blockchain and the world is going they say if you have Bitcoin and you forget your password there's no way on the planet anybody could recover your money it is lost forever you see with the banking system now if you forget your PIN you could go back and sadly to get a new card I forget my pin I want to reset a pin in this cryptocurrency work if you forget your password your money lost in them so if you forget your password you could be living on the all kind of pressure or cannot stress you don't know where your bread coming from but your money you know but you're totally possible nobody can help you get it but what is happening you need to get into a state of relaxation because I my stresses make you forget the child's make you forget but as I get more confident this walking this journey you'll get more calm and relaxed Jesus went when he was any poor here he comes chess enough he just gets up he's looking wrong he said peace be still and he went back and sleep that is what made this I've asked what manner of man is this when they're maintaining their undying appeal on water he was calm he was relaxed he said peace be still went back and sleep curled back up to see look at this man can the church say man so what will happen one of these days you will get so calm in his presence he got so relaxed in his presence when you got to know who you are where you come from and then your memories had to come back like the prodigal somebody came to his senses in other words he remember his password he remembered that in his father's house even these servers eat better and when they gonna remember your password and when you remember your password and you put it in your password opens up a new world streets of gold The Tree of Life come on now somebody preached back to me this morning so this whole great message of overcoming inspire us overcoming everything included in this world because this message of the seven seals and the finishing of the seven church ages is a message with a brown set on teaching that ties the man that's going to be redeemed in that church in the eternal church age at the end of the seals so this church thing is temporary but I Mikey I'm tired of children I'm tired of church this won't cost for the two of us let's have church you know church is not the end people treat you like you see and children means at the end we are on a destination and eternal destination commented service is you and part of the process get already this is the astronaut training room zero-gravity you're floating in his presence you're practising in his presence because we are leaving here for another place can the church Sam and Friends you may be seated this understanding is what pushed me a few weeks ago to preach the message salvation Redemption a perfection and adoption because they're people who are satisfied with being saved but that's not inherited all things they're people satisfied us to come to church but that's not my promise that's not the inheritance that when Jesus died and he wrote his will and he said to my sons who overcome I leave this and I leave this and I leave that and I leave that I [Music] read the will do we'll have real things on it and I hope you will say well I will take a cookie and that cookie in the fridge I will take a cookie butter in that list of cookie fridge stove house clean planet Universe constellation stars whatever it have on that will I wanted to know my Bible tells me once I overcome I'm entitled to everything and he will I can't talk about nobody else but once I overcome he that overcometh shall inherit all things if there's anybody else in here who wants overcome as well and tap into all things because this will is inexhaustible this is the only will that pivot to take and take a little run out because this bank account does never get bankrupt [Applause] hallelujah you could never exhaust him you can never take away everything from him he has all power he has all anointing he has everything can the church see him and go I don't have to wait until he faced over the gorge to walking where the Eclipse and then we to be filtered by the Eclipse to walk around among us talk to do it all at the same time he could touch by the gorge and touch by the Mundus and he could touch you meet you may be seated for a minute I was having a conversation with some Christian businessman and we going back and forth because it's different beliefs and listen some of these dialogue does be good just be good because it is helped you understand how much you're really blessed a notice thing when I talk now is he's smiling because they look at me like where you come from way I need to use wisdom you know so we are talking about this whole thing about about going into all the world and I learn it man this is a little bit man qualified scholar decrease upon decrease you see going to the only world is impossible I see well brother that much scripture because he back she will all God all things are possible so they say where do I embarrass him so we couldn't back and forth so you say what salvation is are indeed very watching as a simple one and one and somebody I say no scriptural because India Pentecost when Peter preached free chosen one says and after that five thousand one says so then he say well okay I think he's he's even then we do re power I see no talks over and over we had a war dance power my message have power this gospel a power if you don't have power speak for yourself but don't tell me that the same God he said all I was in corn he ported to Christ all that is in Christ he parted the church the power is here this morning can the church say man you may be seated but a Branham taught us that the word is the conductor of the Spirit and the Spirit is power for the revealing of every mystery the tying up of the loose ends to bring it together of this word means there's nothing that's stopping the power the spirit from moving and Cynthia is my spirit friend freely oh come on now come on now somebody preach back to me don't tell me my god is dead you woke me up this morning don't tell me he's not alive I spoke with him today he opened up the blinded eyes and shut my spirit free all I want to know about is that man from Galilee what to think

anything else cuz my time is not yet come I still have something to do and we have a work to do the Bible said this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come so the end is waiting on this gospel to be preached but God wants some more preachers he said the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few when last have you preached in your house when last have you preacher your children he said the Mamas could preach by the light that they live come on now let's bring it home the fathers could preach by the way that they live come on young brothers come on young sisters we need to cross what we preach because this gospel the preaching of this gospel is not a word only but it's in power and demonstration that's the fun that shakes the devil that's what the devil is afraid of you know [Music] [Applause] hallelujah glory that should be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I'm getting I don't know about you but I'm getting ready for eternity [Applause] I'm getting

eternity there's no time there's no morning there's no evening there's no night there's no summer there's no winter there's no dry season there's no rainy season there's no flood there's no famine that there's no sickness there's no pain there's no heartache there's no struggle there's no bank there's no mortgage there's no rent there's no disease there's no doctor that occupation to exist because you have no way to heal in eternity there's no lawyers you have a right to defend can the church say man any tell you there's no architects because he's a divine architect and you already went to prepare a place for you but where he is you may be also you have no rent appear because you'll be our owner and the mortgage already paid because he paid it all [Music] [Applause] does this song like the kind of place you want to go to I don't know what Europe I want to go there that please and the church hey man there'll be no more demons there'll be no devil there'll be no temptation oh I feel spiritual this morning can I just take my time in a room just Bridget Abraham when qualia braum Abraham wasn't looking for a Landon oh he was looking for a city whose belong maker was God Abraham didn't know that that time wasn't it yet but you know that place exists because the God who spoke to him has come a whole different level so Abraham one time looking for this city and who's making the last God he was tired of atmanah built he knew there was a great appealing somewhere hallelujah hallelujah so called the divine architect that is the doctors trying to understand the human body it's still a mystery to them that God cannot only design this I was watching a small thing on the up the octopus animal is the octopus unbe man Kachina shaman could change complexion and change color and ching-ching-ching and I said listen if I'm manageable octopus imaginable one and the divine architect put butterflies and butterflies are different patterns because core like variety you don't like to get bored so you like uniqueness you want to make them different you can have one kind of tree but you wanted different kinds of trees he could have had one type of animal but you were two different kinds of animals he put the whole ecosystem and that told ecosystem was he put stars and please that styles with fun patterns and you look at his task if you're lost he can find your way he taught of all of that he totally little microcosm and you want to tell me cork a solve your problem listen I was thinking the other day I listen my van at five years old demands that I give Tobi always say when I might have five years of your trouble get the changes it achieves that I said look look oh god put an engine in Mancala hat and I am I live in 10 20 40 50 60 it was a car engine change five ten time oh no think about it how old Methuselah lived to 969 I believe that was hot that was hot that was lungs and I'm a cross actually something was Adam my Army's minds of difference that was hot then what

Seaver be careful Cragen all if you think it easy I say no take it easy I see and don't be careful but listen we promise that over me is bigger than your advice he promised over my body is a change of body I have a whole new body that I get sick of a whole new body that I get tired of a whole new oh god somebody help me I feel mighty often me walking in the room this morning I feel my connection calling me hallelujah [Applause] somebody say man so I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God we get so caught up any simple little things but if we still focus on these spiritual things it puts these small things in perspective if those ministers who left Joshua who left Moses rather to go and look at the promised land and still looking at the scripture and he promised like just one Caleb did then I come up with a good report no but they lost sight of the promise that's what a lost sight of it was not 30 Giants were big because Caleb and Josh were looked at the same tires I had a different report it meant that they were looking for occurrence at a different thing that they were not prepared to look at that giant and call it a giant the promise was bigger than them many time when David look at Goliath he wasn't seen a giant he said who's this uncircumcised villain he can I say who is his giant yes he called my dad he said who is this uncircumcised all I see him is he not circumcised I know as for this Ian but I would I know he not circumcised and maybe not second tehina on with under this covenant so he you know have the protection I have so I don't know electrum million about because I see no uncircumcised philistine and my word tells me that if he not circumcised he is meat for the chicken just like a lion and me beer and where where's my sling where the sling soil so Batson saw this studying Oh to kill a giant for strategies for giant killin three ways to poison a giant five wins proven strategies for giant conquering the chronicle of all all the five times before died times fall in his room historians in there where Giants come from or just live how long has died if we have to wait whisky scenario if you get the weirdest thing out would eat I suddenly the biology of Jhansi chemistry physiology the mental state do they go crazy what can we expect because we don't know what to do we're sinking and they were just sayin wanting who is this uncircumcised Philistine quite like you see unlikely was and a simple feature no simple principles you know this Gospels are complicated it's fear to wield the gospel you see the simple principle I will come in I was there with my sheep and when a lion came the Lord helped me a property lion I was there he became I took a leap here this uncircumcised Philistine correct me mama wrong I was nearly a minute earlier but I was led to believe that we are mightier than the uncircumcised philistine [Applause] so what trouble you have in school I trouble you have on your job you are mighty a greater is He that's in you that's peanuts in the world overcoming is built into you can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much longer I'm gonna have to do a part two to this message because I had start to preach about George soil so back sitting he closed the book on the ends and say take my best armor do you wanna just make the one I'd make if I was to get inspired if I go ahead at least at least he can look good why good not you know the problem in soil God is the only employee about George you could fire an Italian good is the only boss who could fire an idea five because well stall in the Kings seat Gordon say I don't find a better man to replace this money and God's so good he makes sure that David and openly in the Kings place play music just watching how the politics moving and who is who and who does make different decisions I think so he watching hoes so by time time for Kings have come he don't know who to fire whoever working who this holding position

you see you have them you have them and he was the wave sheaf for others to follow don't need a preacher to do that alone you were to speak to your son as he come back it would need explanation but it'll be that same Jesus he said when that time comes you and me not to say in Jesus name because his name will be in you because to him that overcometh will I grant a new name the overcomers in Ephesians will come forth to produce a manifestation of the sons of God only the overcomers could be counted in the manifestation of these sons of God I'm almost finished everybody feeling fine [Music] so I pray that as you look at the trials differently is that a smile Adam there's a stretch to smile at them because every trial is a not only resume towards you pass them all the exams I didn't wanna drop some scriptures you know it but I just want to bring it back to me remembrance revelation three if I he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment you gotta find clothes and I will not blot out his name out to the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels revelation three tell 12 he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall cool no more no more backsliding no more no more being flimsy another way and stand them your they had a rough week so this week and no idea need to my Debussy you don't need no boots make a pillar in the temple steadfast firm and movable the winds come but you're still standing don't $10,000 my reservoir my it doesn't matter what comes my way I'm an overcomer how other people act don't move my nature about overcoming if you don't want it don't hinder me with your stupidness but I'm on my way to Kenan slam I'm on my way to the resurrection I'm unaware that eternal city can the church him and tell him that overcometh Murray cliff will I make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name so when you overcome God write his name on you and when you read the Bible korto lateral Basra because for my name's sake I will fight the battle I know you made mistakes but my name is more important than your present condition because I give my word to defend you even though you're messed up I'm gonna keep my word because I will let nobody disrespect my name and that same name he said I'm gonna write up on you so when you walk they will see my name written on you in my name they're cast out Devils what happens when his name is on you and you walk in his name those demons see that name the same women Jesus went to the other side into the city of guitarra the Bible said the moment his foot touch the ground that demon collegian knew that the master of the wind had dropped his presence unto the city of the Tara [Applause] to him that overcometh but a shame he will write his name the demons will know your family will know his name is written on you you may be seated [Applause] you know how much trust and confidence God has a place upon you but a black one to write his name on you in the old days but whether but Anthony now we have warrants and these things but in the old days you will say open the door in the name of the king open the door in the name of the king that was the authority where the King me but here you come walking her George walk into your family and his name is on you you don't need to say open the door in the name of the king because when they see you they see the name of the king you can walk into any door walk into the hospital room that's why the prophets say and see a laying there and say get up no wonder the prophet said when that time comes you will command the devil to leave you will never tell a handsome you will speak but that promise is to be overcomers [Applause] [Music] to him that overcometh where the Terrance will inherit all things you maybe see that he I feel like my second wind coming boy musicians hold a pole up don't come yet call up any musicians I already I already we can warm up now I feel like a charge I feel charged because we over come in every week we over coming for you to come every service is over coming you could have stayed home this morning but you overcame and I know you have child and I know you have problems but you are here this morning giving God praise despite your trials despite your troubles to him that overcometh will I give in all things and God listen to show how God sitting my call corners cover every angle enough it's not one scripture over coming after if you want maybe me don't convince you that you will be special revelation 3:21 to him l overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also him over him and I'm sat down with my father in his throne so because I overcame I in mom I would prefer in his throne and you whoever come be with me in my throne in my Father's throne all of us you know what Ron means somebody preach back to me oh the throne is a seat of power the king sits on his throne to make decrease the king season is shown to pass judgment that's why I say the Lord in it he sits on his truth when he get past judgment and if he live the judge says you are free if the judge says you are free and if you overcome listen if you overcome and you in his throne and you see you are free to your Duns to your son to your daughter what'd you think would happen no one the Bible said whatever you final it is born in heaven what if you loosen it is loosed in heaven God was building a whole kiss in secret waiting for this time now because he didn't want the table to know how this thing was gonna play out how sons were gonna comment a position of power like no other sons ever had before in so much that they without us cannot be made perfect Corey serving something better for us you may be seated think about it God could have left Elisha to raise us up you know go could have left brother branham to raise us up but God said that's not who I want to do it I want Stephen I want bird over it I want Anthony to be the one to raise a brother branham I want the group of people in this age to have the power to bring on the risk to the resurrection think about it where Stephen you are part of bringing on the resurrection but about City Souls over yours are crying out how long must we wait they're waitin on us to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection and you want to stay at salvation or still Redemption but I want salvation I want Redemption I want adoption adoption is the father's sink as good as mine his name as good as my name his name written on me could it be that his whole over commenting his title adoption with authority [Applause] [Music] [Applause] revelation just a Nealon on 2:17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him but over comment well I give to eat of the hidden manna I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it revelation 2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches to hear my overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is the midst of the paradise of God but a balance it is tree of life you eat from you take a holly holly leaf from the trees here it brings peace he says we all he said but this tree reminds you of where you coming from and we read it already in revelation 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son what a relationship between father and son what a relationship in every age have promises to the overcomers now in this age this last age all the promises of every age are gathered in this dream the time of the manifestation of the seven thunders seven promises throughout the ages to the overcomers and all captured in this last age because everything be had we have it plus can the church say Amen but the random said I'll be changed from this creature that I am when that day comes for I'm going to that city I'm bound for that beautiful city I feel the redeeming power in my whole heart now if this isn't so then I've throughout my life or we have taught others deceitful things but when I look down and see that the promise he made of this B and C it vindicated at look at and put it my name is speaking and he's seeing it and look at this fifteen hundred miles away colouration city and elect has been called from the nominations and races and creeds and things gathered together as they see the whole word vindicating itself I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the jewels of my crown will outshine everything in the world and that be hallelujah I'm almost finished there will come a time but about himself people we're not gathering here in vain we're only waiting for that time it is very very late but Jesus is still very very near and his glory it's wonderful his name shall be called counselor that city can you see it there's where the bride and the groom will settle music she could come now blessed be the name are you looking for a CD friends Oh overcomers overcome everything hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and with that testimony of overcoming how grateful we ought to be because it was His grace first overcome we can overcome on our own but he promised string to help us to overcome can the church see a man's we are mystery and that is the key to it is a mission that they cannot figure out God always knew there'd be some promises for the overcomers Adam could have never claimed these promises because he had nothing to overcome Adam had no trial no testing no frustration or depression when he spoke in the animal the animal is totally mocking him on the move he had nothing overcome but you and I God wanted our character to be formed by overcoming and with that we ought to be so grateful you could we gonna play something softly overcome and keeps you alive keeps you alive we keep sniffing you I would say today on people yesterday you say what I can't depress the best way the best remedy for depression it's unlike eyeliner all day I depress it better be just get up and just get up another load is overcoming do something get up another pray there's a tangle you'd be surprised what Thanksgiving does I share it with but every power of x given I say enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise he say enter the church with worries and stress on what you need he say enter his gates with Thanksgiving did you enter this morning eight times given hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory and turns kittens and it's cause for praise and many when last have you really give go times well let's take a really really given Gordon banks thank him for taking you true something because we talk about overcoming by you without him we can't overcome nothing you couldn't even wake up I said a while back what woke you up this morning she well my alarm tika alarm I put it anymore dinner and play around all day and see who see who girl it was near la mochila his God who said time for you to get up every morning every morning he wakes you up and he don't forget to do it [Music] you imagine if he forgets to read Rogers every single morning every morning and you forget to pray god help us and when he wakes you up at Elisha go say thank you Lord at the very least when he wakes you up in the morning and sin thank you Lord for waking me up to me seeing a new day [Music] sweet Jesus hallelujah I'll end with this I hadn't planned to talk to preach just to see this part but there was something I wanted to walk in for another message but I was many teaching over the 10 lepers the Bible said Jesus was walking between two villages as it were he didn't take the main road it was deliberate because he had an encounter with these ten lepers because these lepers lepers were not allowed to be near the villages so for him to ever make to meet them he had to go out of his way so only he knew why he was passing that way and the Bible said they cried out to him if you study medicine and biology leprosy damages your vocal chords so you can't really scream so they've I've said they scream it had to be in unison for them to even catch his attention and when Jesus heard them he didn't lay hands on him he told them to fulfill what Leviticus says because under Levitical law if you have a rash if you have any mark if you have any kind of something formal and his skin the law was go to the sons of Levites of Levi let them examine you to tell you if you could go back among civilization that was a Levitical law so he told them to go show yourself to the priest which to them is like okay well he presided check us out the CV so they were walking out with I guess some measure of faith because if Jesus a go show yourself to the priest and the back said why they were walking God heal them but what is interesting friends is that it was not ten Jews it was not ten Jews it was named Jews and one Samaritan you would expect that the Jews who understood the context of the law would understand where their healing came from but they are the ones who kept walking and this Samaritan who didn't even understand why he had to go to the prison he first please say well what he pleases to do with this let me go back because it had to be this man had something to do with it and Jesus said where are the others only one come back and it is notable that he's a Samaritan which is like say he's a Gentile here not under the law he not too caught up in the religious fanciness everyday but he came back to give things and God gives special recognition to him because he gave us friends overcoming is on in different levels to be here this morning your overcomer we have a baptism after service where the Joseph Williams senior will get baptized god bless you my brother [Applause] it takes overcoming to say I want to get baptized when last have you really give thanks for how he has brought you through you
