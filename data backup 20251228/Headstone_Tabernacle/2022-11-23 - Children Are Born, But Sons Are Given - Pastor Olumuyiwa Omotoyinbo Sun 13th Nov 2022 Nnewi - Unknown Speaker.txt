the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous other works Lord God Almighty just untrue other ways Thou King of sins the prophet said you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement of The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement or The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that is his present

this world system even as we are not of this world that is a reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebate where Jesus is the king that is why our women do not dress immense clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world like so much that's a reason that is why our men don't drink and

glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ a risen resurrected Lord and Savior and Redeemer and the people of God said amen amen God richly bless you so we can go into the world this morning so let's send the prayer feeders away from the scriptures amen all right I'll actually invite attention to um three portions of scripture Isaiah 9. uh are we from verses six and seven Saint John 1 and verse 12. and acts 1 and verse 8. Isaiah 9 um reach on these wires For unto all the sun is born unto us his son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace five descriptions there of this son of this child who becomes a son amen and you know you know right away there there is there's something he's trying to tell you that there because you can't put the weight of government upon the shoulders of a child the child will crumble under the weight of the government amen so you can see it's telling you this child has become a son who can carry the weight because the weight of going upon his shoulder means Authority rulership Dominion even power amen wisdom maturity that's what it represents verse 7 of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end so it only receives the government it increases in power it's still upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever not you but the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen now I know this is speaking about Jesus Christ specifically but like brothers scriptures apply to you at least two different ways but many times in so many different ways and because that's speaking about Jesus Christ Our Lord Our Redeemer thus speaks about us and brother Benham said if you have the faith put your name in the scriptures and so we know this child this son is speaking about us also amen and acts 1 chapter 8 Acts chapter 1 verse 8 I'm sorry but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Julia and in Samaria and onto the ultimate Spirits or the most part of the earth amen Lord Irish especially what God bless you and be seated thank you all right um God bless you I will travel over here too long so um but I got a job this morning uh my child is killed children are born but sons are given [Music] um just bear with me I'm trying to get my notes together here [Applause] all right I have a few that scriptures um and I'll read one of them Galatians 4 verses 107. and um also Ephesians 1 verses 46. and um Genesis 1 verses 26-28 and Genesis 2 7. Galatians 4 verses 107 reach on this wise you don't have to get it already now I see that the air as long as the child different nothing from a seven though he built the Lord of all the child is on the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children wine bondage under the elements of the world elements of the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life because that's how we come here and that's that's in us from um childhood all the way up until we meet the Lord Jesus Christ and his Spirit comes into our souls and that changes us from inside out and something else happens on the inside of us and we can live a different life in control and authority over the elements of the world verse 4 but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son switching over from child to the son now man of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he has Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart's crying Abba Father wherefore that abnormal is sovereign not a child no more because the child differed not information he told us earlier on in verse 1. wherefore that abnormal A7 no more child but a song and even son then an air of God through Jesus Christ adoption time amen God bless you amen my inspiration is in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thy C amen until I want to read that from um Genesis chapter 22. I may not get to it but um I just read it all the same Genesis 22 and verse 15 through verse 17. and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn uh um say of the Lord for because thou has done this thing and brother Malik has spoke about Brokenness you've got everything before you can claim any access or expect any access to his glory and power at all by myself have I sworn say of the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sandwich upon the seashore and thy sea shall possess the kids of his enemies amen and invite see shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice amen of his holy words amen God bless you so um post um um when Paul came the Bible says the book of Hebrews and historians let us know that the book of Hebrews delved Moon until the mysteries of God as they were revealed through the Old Testament years and Hebrews lets us see a whole lot of what you know wasn't a man of God for the New Testament Christian Church now because in Isaiah speaking about the common Messiah it has been spoken that unto all the child is given unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen house Christianity doesn't see the son as the father really beats my imagination even from that from this verse verses alone you can see that Jesus Christ or the New Testament Jehovah of the Old Testament it's so obvious but that's not our Focus this morning so under all the childish born and was and was his son is given now notice even though many times we use the words child and son interchangeably and it's okay to do so you can go or dedicated the baby son daughter you know a child is the same thing but in the context of scriptures when you read in between the lines like brother Graham explain to us there's a little difference between a child and a son amen now so even though we use the words interchangeably there's a little difference between the two words and many words in scriptures were used like that for example we talk about our salvation but really Our Gospel is a gospel of redemption salvation is only a part of redemption but many times it's usually a lot about salvation and Redemption and it's all right once you understand the context of it is okay once you understand when we're talking salvation we're not just talking about getting saved and giving your heart to the Lord we are talking about going all the way to adoption time to where you will stand on the face of this Earth amen the spirit of God anointed again into the Flesh of man to wait you will have thus saying the Lord or keep still to where God will have three more words to you here ye him adoption if you understand that then you can interchangeably use salvation and Redemption but Pentecost the Baptist the preach salvation but Malachi for he brought a gospel of redemption Hallelujah you may be seated amen and Redemption Malachi for Taurus is an inheritance that was lost but has not been restored back to us that's not salvation that is redemption redeemed when the Seven Seals were broken redeem amen when I saw my name in the book read them from the father foundations of the world I'm sure that's your song Too Many that's your song Let me hear you say Amen are you in church are you in church this morning amen I hope so you maybe see that amen amen so in the same way in the same way like salvation and Redemption same way child and son they say shuttle difference there but God veiled that in the scriptures but Malachi for that great Elijah prophet of America he unveiled on their tallest seals open and make God In Plain Sight Jordan plain size oh you thank God for that great larger prophet glory to God amen amen so once we understand the context we can use child and some the same way like in Ephesians 4 Paul talked about the adoption of children by Jesus Christ but when you look into the context of scriptures from Genesis to Revelation let the message of Malachi for explore explain the scriptures to you and I then you'll know what he's talking about there is the adoption of sons like he said in so many other places even in Ephesians and all through his Epistles amen you may be seated Hallelujah so once we understand we can use the phrases interchangeably amen excuse me [Applause] Hallelujah thank you so when it was a child is born and unto us his son is given so children are born but sons are given amen what's it what's the difference what's the Gap I already said from what he said in Isaiah on was a child is born and towards the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder a child cannot carry anything cannot a child is carry you carry a child but for the child to carry something that child has grown to become a song I'm not sure with morsels and everything so he's telling you something there between the child and the son there's a gap there's this case of time a span of time and when that child goes to the span of time and becomes a son he can be given authority to pick the government upon his shoulder amen gonna give an authority in the kingdom of God and then his word is as good as the father amen thus say of the Lord or keep still can I get a witness from somebody amen amen so the difference is children are born but sons are given at Birth you are a child and infant a baby and those who teach us those things let us know when a baby is born between the first two years of a baby's life is called an infant when it starts to work and fall and walk when it stabilizes feet a bit it's called a toddler yes and then the child grows up tomorrow and gets into that age amen where he can converse with you and then you know this child is growing amen you can't put anything on that child no he's not responsible no he's not aware enough he's not conscious enough even of the world around him for you to give him that kind of responsibility so the child needs to grow amen amen amen oh Hallelujah so you were born and after you were born as a child an infant you need some growing up to do before you you become somebody that can be given sonship amen amen send you one of us did I read that no no I didn't I'm so sorry I didn't read my scriptures but have mercy I must be getting old wow it used to be that you know I could I could memorize all my scriptures and come to preach for I won't tell you so so you won't think Lord help us let that anointing not come upon him from the old gems and he preaches those long hours so but I used to be able to memorize my scriptures and just just just read off it but you know I'm getting old so uh so these young men tell me that you know you're not looking all are still them um um I'm following your footsteps if you are not old I am not old but I'm sorry just um open your Bibles or if you if you can let me just read it send John chapter 1 and verse 12. but as many as received him to them give him power to become the sons of God are you reading that even to them that believe on his name so they believe on his name first and then they are given power to become Sons give even something Sansa given even power to become songs right in plain sight can you say amen amen and acts 1 8 here is our promise that we are going to be receive the same thing ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and you know Judea and in Samaria and you know uh and onto the ultimate Spirit of the Earth amen Lord are His blessings of his holy watch amen so Psalms children are born by sons they're given and like uh uh the Apostle John let us see there will receive him believe on him become a child of God I know we are given something to help us to become sons of God and when we get to that spot brother Brown said a man can be something and then if God I don't actually quote now but I mean I'll read it but Mom said God calls you Assad and give you something to shake the nations with that song's been given something amen amen hallelujah amen so we start as as children and then about sons that can be evenly given songs amen and that side is with everything in life almost everything in life your status a little child and then you go up there amen you go through the process of growth and maturing amen and tutoring and training and character formation until you get to the spot to where you are ready for promotion to the next level amen you don't go to school and start from ss1 no you start as a child in js1 you don't go to medical school and start at seeing patience no you start from a child and then you take some training and some tutoring and then you come to where it is someone a doctor an engineer that can be given your degree given authority to see patience and see clients and represent them in court before the judges children are born but sons are given is the principle that runs throughout all of life [Applause] and while you are going through the training you might not see the need for some other things like for example I really up till now I'm still trying to make sense of some of the stuff that I learned in medical school in the early years I don't see their relevance to medicine at all I don't I still don't but I subscribe to the superior knowledge of those who from the curriculum that they know better than I mean that I needed those things so while the child is going through their process of training they think many things they don't need as a manufacturing when get to a spot to where they think they know everything I call it the age of infinite wisdom no you have gone through that with your children and your children are going to go through the center of their own children because that's just the way life is that's just the way we are the child gets to where he thinks he knows everything but a child that can take his training and if the trainer is a masterful trainer under the guidance of the holy spirit that child in due process of time will come to the spot to where they can be given something and trusted with authority trust them with responsibility trusted to carry out the father's will and you say Amen you may be seated amen oh Hallelujah amen children are born but sons are given and sonship speaks of an inheritance that is given given that inheritance given a position given Authority given a responsibility amen sonship speaks about inheritance given to Sons amen it also speaks of adulthood somebody who's responsible mature enough that has taken their training and you can trust them with responsibility amen amen amen [Music] so therefore there's a space a spinal time between the child and the son in the Bible context amen in the corners of scripture there is a space and even your own natural experience too there is a space amen and I should run through a few examples for you I'll try not to hold you too long because I have these things to be a long whiny preacher and you know all that but after all that has been spoken I don't really need to say much but anyway just you're happy to get a context of this because the Basic Brothers here and say charity never feel it should let me see how we come to that school child never feel it shiny never flood means that he never fails he's always successful in every single thing Charlie doesn't feel and if you're if you apply the principles of Charity to everything that you do you will always come out right you'll come out right in your Christian Life you're coming right in your walk with God you come out right in your relationships you'll come around in your business life you're coming right in your school life you're coming right in everything because charity never fails I don't know what other pill you can apply that doesn't fail at all in anything man some things that work in the church I mean that works in the in the home may not walk in the church something that work in the office may not walk in your village may not walk in my Village but charity works everywhere the same way every time because charity never fails can you say amen and you say charity never failure nobody never fail at no no no no father bam said there is one thing God cannot do that is he cannot fail so you know charity is God himself oh Hallelujah so when we are talking about the power of the spirit we are talking about the power of God to bring you to the spot to where you will never fail because charity is dwelling in you with a speed of believing God in fullness and the authority and power of Jesus Christ amen amen amen all glory to God amen and then if I should skip this here Oh Glory but anyway a few examples should let you see the Gap fill the Gap in for you when a woman takes in seed we call that conception the meeting of the male and female eggs and that's a baby conceived in the womb there but that's not a child yet Medical Science fetus brother Charles right Medical Science course the defeaters where is Dr enoka as you know oh you just stepped I don't care right because when I'm talking those talk to things I I'm very careful so the doctors don't tell me that way you talk so anyway so the doctors I mean Medical Science will call that a features it's not a child yet the fetus and doesn't even have life until like about three four five six weeks really because when the blood cell breaks that's when life comes flowing through that thing in the mother's womb because the life is in the blood amen glory to God Amen amen so conception first and then when the the baby is conceived and blood is Flowing then the parts are formed fail after sale after sale is formed and forms the baby in the mother's womb and one of the mysteries of creation that it really amazes me is like Solomon said after maybe Ecclesiastes 11 or somewhere around there Solomon said that my bones in my mother's womb how God can hide our poems our bones can even be bent but God can God's wisdom can hide them in our mother's womb what a mighty God we share oh truly we are fearfully and wonderfully made Hallelujah [Applause] right and if he can do that surely he can take good care of you and me they can heal every disease they can heal every cell he knows yourselves by name he can heal every single ailment and if you went through that prayer line last night amen the angel is about to visit your neighborhood Hallelujah [Applause] the angel is going to visit your neighborhood I felt such a prince of the Holy Spirit on that prayer line last night I couldn't help the tears running down my cheeks and brother Pam said when you feel that way the angel is there somewhere around there and know the angel is here today the angel called the holy spirit is there he's walking up and down his eyes he's walking up and down from Heart to Heart from Ben to bench from Hallelujah the angel is here and if he's here what deep demon what devil I double deer Spirit to try to stand in his presence they cannot you may be seated Oh Glory [Applause] so the baby is considering the womb and then the pastor added the baby grows up in the womb amen matures and girls onto a child that's fully formed and then the child is born conception and the child there's a space and that same principle carries on even when the child is born the child is still growing amen Medical Science says when the child is born all his parts are not fully developed yet African Northern medical school stuff but I still remember that they don't see too well yet clearly yet who are some parts of their bodies they start learning the environment trying to get some awareness as early as six hours after they are born but some parts of them are not fully from yet like you know the eyes are not fully formed yet that this training them Uncle bones not fully furnished so they can walk here and so many things like that and they grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and become like I already said from a from an infant to a toddler to a child and then to an adult so even after the child is born it still goes through the process of growth a process of God that's a span of time to where the child matures amen into adulthood and sonship that you can trust with some responsibility you won't keep your little baby with a two-year-old brother because he is not a son yet that you can be given responsibility that can be given responsibility no it's not yet so the child matures until he gets to a spot and a place in town where it can be given some restaurants but that's when you can say in the natural my shop my my child that's brought to me has become a son I've been given a song that I can give some responsibility to oh Hallelujah say Amen somebody amen amen I'm the same way the breath of wow is it all right God bless you I'm sorry um so um so I said I was giving you a few examples even the birth of our Lord Jesus was on this wise a child and a son and same look one um um I don't let me get it let me get it so I will make it uh pulling to you because people say that after you say brother Panama brought us back to this Bible so we should not forget about the message and I'll read some books anymore and go in the Bible I don't even worry with people like that they just they just they just don't believe I mean what what would you bother with with that unbelief doesn't hinder God it only hinders the unbeliever but if you understand there's no dichotomy between brother benham's words and the scriptures because brother Venom shine light on the scriptures because the four beasts said come and see shun some light on the scriptures amen [Applause] all right let let's focus on ourselves let's leave those guys alone all right all right send Luke chapter one the breath of Jesus Christ was on these wise all right um verse 26. and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee amen Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said thou that thou that at highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are among women and the angel from God called the prophet of Malachi for the seven angels to the church ages has come to us with the word of the Living God and all of the same world president thou Pride among the bride there has been bribes Brides churches churches Brides bride but there's coming one The Pride that's gonna bring them the resurrection and the Rapture of the going home [Applause] among women you are highly favored amen amen amen and and and uh verse 29 and when she saw him she was troubled at his sin and casting her mind what manner of salutation this should be all right okay um okay and the angel students were a fan of Mary for that has found favor with God and behold Here original here it is now and behold thou shall concede in thy womb why is that conception coming from I already told you Medical Science the way you and I were born mother's egg that is egg mother's egg and we were conceived in the womb and that's where our life started from but Jesus Christ was not conceived that way because he was too he was told his conception was totally Immaculate totally God had nothing of man at all many people think God's spirit anointed the egg in Mary no no Mary's egg had nothing to do with this he was fully God [Applause] it wasn't the mixture of Mary's egg and God's spirit no this conception was totally God God's spirit the seed the Gin the theophany of God come into Mary's womb and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us but that word came first into Mary's womb as a conception you may be seated [Applause] so number one Thou shalt conceive in thy womb God's spirit come in there and then after that you bring for the Sun and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great what what qualities it shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest the Son of God he's talking about sonship here shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over their house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end shouting like Isaiah 9 6 amen then sent Mary unto the angel here's what I'm what I'm telling you how shall this be sin I know not a man and the angels sued for the light on how this son is going to be born how this conception is going to become a song that's going to sit upon the throne of David and have all of this quality and greatness and and power and Glory the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and overshadow thee the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore shall overshadow thee some Shadow means there's some light there when lightning meets our flesh which is all Darkness it casts a shadow for the problem explained so the latter gospels so over shall so come upon you Mary amen and overshadow you amen amen so watch the order Holy Ghost shall come upon you with the power of the highest and overshadow you totally take you over therefore also that Holy thing we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God amen Hallelujah the Son of God oh very important words there amen the oppressed but with this child turns to the Son of God oh hallelujah amen so the angel explained to Maryville and Mary Shaw an understood how this child is going to be pronounced that's what we you and I need to understand in this age here there's a process amen from the scriptures how the Son of God will be born up when I was in Pentecost one of the most popular um topics for ministers to preaching when they have a power conference is the manifestation of the sons of God and they just tell you about faith and all that but there's a process to it just like in the natural so it is in the spiritual and the angel told Mary the process to it in other words the process to form the Son of God is by the Holy Ghost overshadowing the seed of God in Mary amen the seed then grows a man amen to the son of God you see it grows and grows and grows and grows from glory to glory to produce the Son of God simple process but the spirit of God that's why you are you and all the way you can become a son of Son of God you are a child of God about to become a son that can be given Authority given sonship you need the power of the Holy oh Hallelujah in other words it takes the power of the Holy Ghost upon the sea to produce the son of God like Saint John 1 and for us to have already told us receive to them that received him receive him first amen and then power is given to become a Son of God power is given sons are given oh Hallelujah so he checks the power of the spirit of God to be given sonship it takes the power of the spirit of God to come into your sonship inheritance amen it takes the power of the holy spirit of God and time holy ghost power unveil and revealed by the Seven Seals of redemption oh my amen acts one age Jesus told them you shall but you shall receive power before you go to the Lord you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you then you'll be my Witnesses you'll represent me you speak it will be like me speaking after after the Holy Ghost has come upon you oh Hallelujah so Jesus told them to tarry in the city of Jerusalem I want you to be endured with power from on high it was for this same reason that he told them that because he had spent three and a half years showing the seat of the world in their souls and the seed of the world was a conception of God in this world like you and I today they were fisting on the unfailing Bodywork of the son of man Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah the unfailing body world Hallelujah the unfailing body what he cannot tell it cannot fail can you say Amen believe us though this it cannot fail Hallelujah up here so Jesus for three and a half years what on top of water on top of water on top of a world into their souls to from the seat of the world on the inside of them sure there were seeds of God but they are to identify their own day and age by receiving the seed of God from the messenger of their age like one of the brothers said you believe in God believe also in me people said they believe God you got to believe his messenger believe God believe His prophets you believe in God believe also in me Jesus said you believe in God believe also in the prophet Malachi fall no we're not worshiping a man I'm pulling the scriptures to you from the man Christ Jesus from the man Christ Jesus who was fully God and fully man [Applause] so Jesus breathed upon them the promise of the Holy Ghost amen acts 1 8 what for you may be seated to create sons of God Amen to write a book of Acts behind them oh my same way this age here amen amen has breathed upon us the promise of the Dynamics that's why mechanics the power of God in this end time Church the power of the Holy Ghost to take awesome to the Rapture of the Skies the power of the Holy Ghost shall come upon You Like It Came Upon the early brother panickers wrought for to create again sons of God in this last day to write another book of Acts amen like the Battle of Pentecost teach they wrote the book of God behind them and we are going to write another book of Acts today this is a amen whether you believe or you don't believe it doesn't matter God is going to do his work whether it's gonna happen or not that's not the point your job is

great church of age all the Dynamics of our mechanics Amen to create again sons of God that will run another book of Acts like the Battle of Pentecost wrote a book of Acts behind them oh my and then we shall go all the way back to Eden where the original Son of God Adam was created through the same process you may be seated foreign [Applause] that's why this this bride here is President will be greater than the better Pentacles because the better Pentecost got to a spiritual Eden but we are going back to a spiritual Eden as well as a physical Eden and there without us cannot get you there physical even so they are waiting and resting and waiting on us that's why this bread is greater that's why there was never a gentile Prophet like Malachi 4. amen send me the message to normally prepare a prayer for the Rapture but to bring on a race God Garden of Eden on the face of the earth oh come on George come on Church we are going back to Eden we're good in the Rapture and I will come back here to a physical gonna be there where the land shall stay with the lamb and a little child shall live there try try to make that right to make the rapture Hallelujah you may be seated oh

yet they got to come to the process you may be seated God bless you Glory [Applause] Oh Glory so friends we are going back to Eden to where the original Son of God on the face of the Earth Adam was created through the same process Adam was the original Son of God on the face of the Earth Jesus was the original Son of God the Lord before the foundation of the world but on the face of the Earth Adam was the original I created Son of God let us make man in our image after our likeness amen and Adam the original Son of God demonstrated the power of give a gay son has been given some amen given the inheritance amen and the and the power of the spirit of God was evidently accidentally evident in his life Adam was given sonship and in there he exercised Dominion Supreme control over the Earth over the domain of the Earth and he lived and walked in a world of No Limits all things are possible there was not a doubt nowhere in his soul amen we have failure was not an option he lived a war where charity never fail [Applause] Hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory to God so how did Adam are the part of the spirit from Adam into a son of God by two-step process Genesis 1 26-28 the spirit of God so let us make man in our image a spirit that has no certain form so it can have an image to have an image there's going to be some setting form so brother says so the sweet Elohim started to form toward flesh his his goal was to make a mind his image but firstly he needed to have a representation to where he can now make an image of saw him form himself into a body like not a body like this body but a supernatural Spirit body called the theophany the word that had informed that he can now make a Man In His Image so Elohim poured into the Lord of us and then could make an image of the Lord was quoted an image of the world and that's where you have it the word image the image of the world that's what Adam was what image so Genesis 1 26-28 was the falling of the one image all right and the word image is not work it's spiritually is not it's not a word it's a what body but it's also spirit so the word image is Spirit Genesis 1 28 is Spirit but the word is the seed that the spirit comes upon the seed of God that Adam was the spirit of God pulled out of that seed the seven spirits of God the spirit of God from the back of the Bible from the back parts of God's mind to form Adam into an image like God amen the water image amen and then that was the word image was the one that God spoke to to be fruitful multiply it demonstrated and that's what the plan said Adam even though in the spirit like the Holy Spirit leads us today he left those animals through the Garden of Eden even though there was no flesh man Adam yet but the one image was not in flesh yet in other words but the spirit of God had formed Adam into an image like God himself but then the goal is to make man in the flesh and so Genesis 2 7. God took that what he makes spirit for the image I'm placing into flesh in other words he anointed that or image Spirit into the Flesh of man Adam became the word made flesh Hallelujah he became a son he was given sonship the word with flesh Adam had now had hands her legs had feet to walk not to speak and betray the Earth like the Son of God that he was he was given sonship an authority to rule on the face of Israel but the power of a spirit of the Living God oh Hallelujah [Applause] the spirit of God the spirit of God United with the Flesh of man to make a song given his son that was given Authority and dominion and Power on the face of the Earth oh Hallelujah and that represented Genesis 2 7. representative Adam's adoption time represented sonship inheritance given to Adam to rule and reign over all the jurisdiction of the earth oh my god let's run here then the fall came and the word image got infer from the glory of God the word image was what is the glory of God the theophany was the glory of God signs wonders miracles was the glory of God Genesis 1 26-8 Jesus said father glorify thou me with the glory that I shared with you before the definition of the world and this Glory I have given unto them the glory of God failed in the water image will in the world the water image of Jesus Christ oh my God because the devil came at the fall to attack that one image because that's what was happening that flesh into their flesh and I'm attacking the word image it was all in God's plans attacking that what image became reduced again to a little seed a little bottom and that's how we come here the seed of God in us we don't come like Adam no more fully formed statue of a perfect man we come as a little seed tucked in the very sockets of our soul but the spirit of God shall overshadow thee Mary and walk on that sea and act of that she will pull out the spirit of God the image of God put it out of your seed all you need is in the seed of God on the inside of you we just come as ministers and and preachers to pour it back into you to advance your promises to you so you know your day your season your time and your hour so you can Dash into the blessings of almighty God hallelujah all right [Applause] so when Adam fell the water he made became a little in Adam and in his seat after him since the fall that's you and I we come here with a little sheet of God in us but that's enough amen the story of redemption has been God looking for a road to bring sons of God back to that spot again to where they can be given sonship Amen to be given sonship inheritance as sons of the Living God for this end time here and the prophet Malachi for a prophet like like unto Elijah a prophet like unto Moses the great larger prophet of Malachi 4. amen how we thank God that a prophet has indeed come to know this year and has called us out in this last closing days of time he has come to call her the bride to bring back sons of God again to bring the sons of God Back to Eden the stand on the face of these are there call up the resurrection bring on the Rapture coin the Rapture of these guys and come back on the face of the Earth sit on the great white one judgment rule the nations with the word of iron on that white Throne amen and quench every rebellion of all the devil and his subjects that he goes to again and that was one judgment to instigate them to fight against the Judgment of God you can fight against the Judgment of God and God will come you and I on the breath of the earth while he deals with them and he will send them into the lake that bonds with fire and brimstone where hell itself is in oh Hallelujah Hallelujah for we shall bring on a physical restored Garden of Eden on the face of the earth a spiritual Eden has already begun first started in Malachi 4 and that's going on right now but we are precinated to bring on a physical Garden of Eden she's on the other side of the Rapture on the other side of the rapture [Applause] we're charity never failures you may be seated [Applause] so Malachi Frozen with a message to bring back sons of God will be given sonship will be given sonship inheritance amen by the Dynamics which is the promise of the outpouring of the power of the Holy Ghost to create the bride you and I into Sons and Daughters of God like they had on the day of Pentacles to take us back to a spiritual Garden of Eden but beyond that to take us into the Rapture in the sky shouting on the inside of you the view that's gonna have Rapture in power that's gonna take you up in the skies Pizza did not have that Paul did not have that but Malachi 4. he came with a message beyond beyond the seven age particular Rapture in the skies and I believe tell these seven age man that's coming seven mysterious Thunders and they will reveal surprise Faith to go in the Rapture in the sky we're going out of here you may be seated oh Hallelujah so quickly like 10-15 minutes now close out amen quickly malaka remember amen with a message to call us out and after we are called out that's the problem that's why many people and we preachers are the ones to blame in my opinion for all of that because some of these guys just going around attacking brother Branham here and there I always say they are wise they're very wise because they wanted to make sure brother was gone for 50 some years before they sell original challenging everything challenge the clouds challenge these Miracles and telling all that stuff they're very wise [Applause] because they know this but the bam I just wake up I'm not saying you wake up until the resurrection but they you know people believe that I'm coming coming back and all that they feel like maybe he might wake up and and find out all these lies they are speaking against him brother in the world the Tommy osbornes they're all robots all of them were there tell me what you want that Vision ever failed one time and all these Rascals all these Rascals who need a full dose of the Cross have the gumption how they take marriage how they how they are how the gall the nerve to telling the prophet of God [Applause] but too late too late too late a prophet has been in the land this is Malachi for land I don't know about you but I heard the voice of God she talking through a prophet that was God very God fell in William Branham speaking for saith the Lord first say of the Lord and unbelief does not hinder God it only hinders the unbeliever according to that world hallelujah amen [Applause] look at your friends you ever see that it's very simple it's a very simple process God is not complicated we over complicate the simple very simple let me see that what didn't Jesus say my yoke is what easy my body is right it's not difficult the gospel young man young woman is not difficult no it's not life is hard tell that baby when it comes when you came out of your mother's womb your father is a totally different ballgame it's tough in the world there's no easy no free lunch in life Jesus said my yoke is if there's a yoke that's a yoke he won't deceive your body it's an easy yolk and my burden is light but the button of sin is heavy it crushes you but this button is light oh Hallelujah you may be seated so Malachi for call us out but that's where I find many people in the message get lost and forgive me I don't say that disrespectfully but just something I've noticed them through the years the people come in the message and you just hear ministers and Believers and you get a lot of young people I mean feel a color go in their hearts and we don't have enough ministers still yet we don't because Jesus said the Harvest is right onto Harvest but the laborers are few but with everything you have got to be a child they groom trained to be able to be given son as a minister as a as your responsibility to preach and God can trust his word with you so you will not use the appropriate for a bully pocket you and I will not use the property to settle all scores you and I will notice the prophet to create the essentials in the church you and I will not use the puppet to favor some and disable sound because Mary the bride has found favor with God there's no favor no unfavored all of us are found favor with God children all of us are from favor [Applause] and you may be seated my friends after you are called out we're corner from Pentacles only Penny consciously on the left side and the Hebrews legalistic speech on the right side called into the middle of the road the foot of the cross amen were called out into the bride just to hang around no just to preach Acts 2 38 that's probably but that's all there is to it and I see many people come out into the message and don't know what next to do maybe see that and I don't say that it's just not fully maybe she did but we're on a journey when we see that we are going to the promised land Israel came out of Egypt cross the Red Sea baptized in the boxing of Moses cause the rest of your Redemption baptized into the person of Malachi for about the Seven Seals right sea of redemption how many people lose their way like the mixed multitude like Pentecostals and that's why they Wonder for 40 years because they did not have the promised land in their view but Malachi 4 said we are going somewhere we're going to a promised land and so when we come out we're coming into our Wilderness life and what is that we come to be nourished to be tutored to be child trained amen for behavior for character formation amen that's the second thing I've only come out we find a church maybe see that when you come in the message find a church where the man of God is preaching the on fairly realities of the Living God Amen the unfailing body water of the sons man's message amen from Malachi first message of the Seven Seals and the Seven Founders and you stay in that church to be filled to be child trained to be too dark Oh Glory to God Amen for character formation amen before the power of the Holy Ghost amen for sonship is given because power without character is satanic so you are called out and I'm almost finished I'm wine up here you are called out from the Pentecostals from the Baptist Grace Grace spirits and all the spirits in Christianity into Ephesians the middle of the road amen like I said many many don't know uh what's next how do they come out but what's next is you find a church funny funny message believe in church not everything that says they believe the message is they believe the message Father if that person believes everything but the plan I'm saying [Applause] if Alabama said this we are dumb we are stupid we are sheep we believe it we swallow it we're eating up we eat the whole world oh everything is said whether we understand or don't understand it we believe the prophet of Malachi foreign do you believe like me let me hear you I can hear you no you are too quiet I can't hear you you are too quiet I cannot hear you it is no secret I believe the world I met the prophet and he took me in for single with the son of man Jesus Christ failing him making him a son of man it's no secret I follow him I don't know about you but that's my testimony that's my testimony is does your testimony tell your neighbor that's my testimony [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the seven Angel is Son of Man you may be seated [Applause] [Applause] so Malachi first message of the shout has called you out I'm being called out you'll find yourself a church a mess I believe in church a message where they believe the prophet explained the Bible not the message and the Bible are different they are not different your Prophet put the scriptures back into the message hallelujah or rather put a message back into the scriptures to anoint your promises for this pain so you'll know what is yours and what is mine is mine and I will take it the old charge is here to charge into your promises to charge into your hour to return to the Dynamics to your mechanics the hour charges here Soldiers with armor screaming Hallelujah pull out your sword we are ready to fight ready to run over the devils and talk about the Promised Land was already there amen I'm done amen just my closing remarks here so coming out called out you'll find yourself a proper believe in church amen why you are trained amen train the child in Europe by the world tutored children instructed in righteousness to change that child grow that child in maturity by a process from glory to glory training that child growing that child into sonship Hallelujah during that child by the world to become an adult growing up that child into a sonship into adulthood so he can be given sonship so they can be given an inheritance some ship inheritance adoption time oh hallelujah amen glory amen brother panel I'm done really what PanAm said on adoption part two he said brother 205 the judge is supposed to be predestinated after they become children of God I'll tell they are born again the trumpet is there to be adopt is is supposed to be predestinated onto the adoption of children where amen God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something Hallelujah the first try that and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirits don't believe every Prophet this man claims the certain thing try it and see if it's right if it's right move right with it then say Lord send us something else keep moving just keep moving your eyes shut forward set Like Flint just keep moving till every fellow take his place then you are going to see the Church of God begin to get its place that's when the village times will go to a packing up Hallelujah the shots will go off here will go down faces will be washed Seekers will be missing that's right when the job begins to get into its Mighty power oh Hallelujah when we're having an Anna NASA Safara amen and a few of them yes sir you see when the holy church stands together in its power personally please are sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful Church standing there in its Glory oh that's what is coming from is coming for a powerful job that has been given sunshine to speak the world oh Hallelujah so you are called out you're getting too acceptable Phantom with children with child's Reign for behavior for character formation and in there why you have been tutored you are given your promise that's the footstep of a promise of your Dynamics to your mechanics shall overshadow you the seed of God has from the water God in your heart the word of God has from the synagogue in your heart waiting for the Dynamics Dynamic power the Holy Ghost to come upon that sin and from the sea into his son on God and in your promise there's a person of the

your promise is adoption time to take you aside and give you three more words give you something to make you the Living God walking on two feet oh Hallelujah Genesis 22 and I'm John there's a stranger Abraham had the same promise like us amen of a promised son amen and Abraham was called out of all the counties and he was called out to go into a land that he had not seen here but for 25 years more than that Abrams tiger nuts are the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith like brother Juan's happy the other night it's aggressive girlfriends not because I'm in the grace of God
