Let's turn to our Bibles as we want to read a portion of the scripture in Psalms chapter 130. Amen. Um, and I want to commit the day into the Lord in prayer. Psalm chapter 130 says, "Out of the depth have I cried unto thee, O Lord, Lord, hear my voice? Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou shouldest mark iniquities, oh Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. I wait for the Lord. My soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning. I say more than they that watch for the morning. Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. May God add blessing to the reading of his word this morning. Let's just lift our hands and uh pray as we pray together and ask God's blessing upon the service this morning. Amen.

This day that you have made, we shall rejoice and be glad in it this morning. out of the depths. We are crying this morning unto you, dear God, now that you would come into this place, Lord, and bless the hearts of your people as we wait to hear from you this morning, Lord. As we wait, standing on your promised word, Lord, knowing that you are able to fulfill it, Lord, we pray that you're blessed, Lord. Pray that you pour your spirit in a mighty way this morning. May your anointed people, anoint the word of God, anoint your speaker, Lord, as he prepares to get ready to preach the word this morning. Lord, we pray that you would just, Lord, clothe every fiber of his being in the fire of the living God. Lord, may anoint him to speak the word of God this morning. Give him strength physically, Lord. Give him strength mentally and in every other way. Father, may I just ignite his spirit this morning and make him a flame of fire to be a tool for the harvest today. For the fields are white to harvest, but the laborers are few. Lord, may you send laborers into harvest, oh God. Lord, that we'll reap a rapture this morning of souls waiting to be caught up together with you, dear God, in the clouds. For this is the great promise you give to the church in the last day. Father, make us ready, dear God. make us fit servants by your word and by the release of your spirit this morning to minister to us and get us into shape this morning. Granted, almighty God we pray.

Take me out of the way and be glorified in our midst. May we see Jesus this morning granted God in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles I like you take to two portion of scripture. Deuteronomy chapter 11 want to read verse 10 to 25 and Joshua chapter 14 want to read the first verse and then from 6 to13 reading from Deuteronomy chapter 11 reading verse 10. God speaks for the land whether thou goest in to possess it. It is not as the land of Egypt from whence he came out. Where thou seest thy seed and water it is with thy foot as a garden of herbs, but the land whether ye go to possess. So God is telling them where they're heading to. He's telling them where they're going. Is a land of hills and valleys and drinkketh water of the rain of heaven. A land which the Lord thy God carth for. The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, &gt;&gt; from the beginning of the year, even to the end of the year. It shall come to pass, if he shall hearken diligently unto my commandments, which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give you the reign of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil. and I will send grass in thy field for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full. Take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived, and he turn aside and serve other gods and worship them. And then the Lord wrath be kindled against you. And he shut up the heaven that there be no rain. And did the land yield not of fruit, unless he perish quickly from off the ground good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall he lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes that he shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sitest in thine house when thou walst in the by the way when thou liest down and when thou riseth up and thou shalt write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth. For if he shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, then will the Lord drive out these nations from before you, and he shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. Every place whereon the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours. From the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river and the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall be your coast be. There shall no man be able to stand before thee. For the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that he shall tread upon as he had said unto you. &gt;&gt; So you can understand now where God gave Joshua these instructions is from right here. And let's turn to Joshua chapter 14 and see what the Lord says here in verse one. And then we go down to verse 6. And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which Elazar the priests and the Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them. Go down to verse six. Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gal. Caleb the son of Jeffon the Kezonite said unto him, "Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses, the man of God concerning me, and thee in Kenesh Bania, 40 years old was I, when the Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kenishbania to espou the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my God." And Moses swway on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance, that thy children forever, because thou has holy followed the Lord my God. And now behold, the Lord had kept me alive, as he said these 40 and 5 years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, lo, I am this day four score and 5 years old. And yet I am strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in. Now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord God spake in that day. For thou heardest in that day how the anarchims were there that the cities were great and fenced. If so be the Lord be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeff Hebron for an inheritance. May God bless his word. You may be seated. Just give him a shout as you sat sit down. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So you know where I'm going this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The title this morning is claiming your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have a subject. Give me this mountain. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I have an inspiration. It's the truth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's my inspiration. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; It is mine. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Praise God. So, we in we getting into warfare this morning. &gt;&gt; We get into battle this morning. I don't care what condition you're in. God said certain things about you. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here in the church. That's why you hear the word of God. God actually spoke certain things in your life. The devil that is troubling you, he got kicked out of heaven. He don't even belong here. Praise God. He is just a temporary resident on this earth. But we shall reign on the earth. We coming back. This earth belong to the sons and daughters of God. I'm not talking about church now. I'm talking about the earth. We are promised dominion over the earth. When God called Adam, he he called Adam to have dominion over. Power over. Hallelujah. And God want you to have power over your circumstance, your condition, your situation. It must not power over you. Praise God. The devil want to afflict you with depression, frustration, sickness, tiredness, weariness, but you have an authority this morning. Praise God. To raise up and say, "My God is able. My God is real. He is still a way maker. He is still a miracle worker. He still opened doors. He opened Red Sea. Praise God. When the door shut, he can still open those doors." Glory to God. Hallelujah. Are you with me this morning? So you can say clearly sickness is not mine. Depression that's not mine. Frustration that is don't belong to me. Hallelujah. Joy is mine. Uhhuh. Peace is mine. That's my inheritance. You have a right to have joy. Praise God. Jesus said this joy that you get, no man give it to you. Amen. Amen. Amen. God don't let no man steal your joy. &gt;&gt; May be seated. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me just put a curtain behind a message. Brother, &gt;&gt; someone said, "How can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names?" Answer. You don't live for yourself. You live for others &gt;&gt; that you might redeem that man. &gt;&gt; You become sons. The trouble of it is the church has forgot they are sons. &gt;&gt; You are sons. You are taking Christ's place. You are sons. So don't live for yourself. Live for others. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I can live for this brother because he's sure a nice man. That's not it. Live for the man who hates you. &gt;&gt; Live for that person who will kill you if they could. &gt;&gt; That's what they done to him. Jesus. They killed him. He died that he might save them. That's eternal life. &gt;&gt; When you get that in your bosom, you are facing heaven then. &gt;&gt; But you sacrifice your own things, give them up like sheep gives wool and you look towards Calvary. &gt;&gt; So if we ourselves then in our ministry, in our thoughts, in our life, if we abide as we are, we can do no good. We have got to also die at the altar &gt;&gt; or we will live alone. We would live here we go to some denomination of some creed. &gt;&gt; You see that's why some people love the church so much and love the pastor so much in the way that they're not loving the word of God to apply to their hearts that it could be effective to them. &gt;&gt; Do you get that? &gt;&gt; They love the church. They love the teaching. They love the and that. But they have to love God. &gt;&gt; Love the Lord with all your heart. Not so much church, but God. &gt;&gt; Because when you love God, the word is personal. &gt;&gt; Because it's the truth. &gt;&gt; I claim it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; So if your sister don't want to live it, that's that's her. That's not you. &gt;&gt; If your father don't want it, that's him. That's not you. &gt;&gt; If your mother don't want to walk by it, that's her. That's not you. &gt;&gt; You want it. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. stand alone &gt;&gt; because that's what Caleb did. &gt;&gt; When time come for inheritance, he stood alone. He wasn't looking for the brethren to be with him. He wasn't looking for the crowd to be with him. He stepped forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So watch, we lift to some denomination or some creed. We lift to some organization. But if we die to ourselves, then the Holy Spirit will be spread forth everywhere by our lips. We have got to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. How we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and feast on the word of God so that it will give us strength. So he was talking here because he knew it will be a long journey. He was going he was going to die 965 but he knew that the the in other words the vision is true but the time is long. So he knew that we will have a time where we have to feast on the word to get the strength to go through this journey. &gt;&gt; Okay. Many of us were very young when we received this message. I received it when I was 17 years old. But now I'm way double past that right now. I want to stop counting. So he said now now we what we need uh we are now to find a place of rest to feast on the word of God. So it will give us strength. Night after night go to the room and rest. Come back the next morning fresh. Eat more for there's great journey and a great battle ahead for the church &gt;&gt; and we reached that yet. &gt;&gt; Punch only 5% say amen. They feel in a real battle. The church get no battle yet or no. &gt;&gt; When they come to close us down fight &gt;&gt; a great battle for the church. I believe that we have been children long enough. &gt;&gt; God is going to turn his church into manhood now. We have what? We have played and frolicked as children. But now we are going to have to put away childish things &gt;&gt; and take on manhood &gt;&gt; or maturity. &gt;&gt; Now we preach already under tutors and governors. Though a son and an heir, if he's a child, he no longer from a servant &gt;&gt; because he's a child. &gt;&gt; So God objective is to bring the church into maturity. God objective is to bring you that you could stand on your own. &gt;&gt; Solid as a rock. &gt;&gt; Place it anywhere, anytime, any place, you will still stand. If we have no church, you will still stand. If you can't shake somebody hand, you will stand. If nobody is encouraging in your house, in the school, on the job, you will still stand. That's manhood. &gt;&gt; If you say manhood, he's talking about for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, &gt;&gt; not a boy leave &gt;&gt; a man. &gt;&gt; So the objective parenting is to bring them to manhood, &gt;&gt; not to own them and have a helicopter hoing over them. &gt;&gt; And you be a helicopter parent, you only child, my child, my child, cut that crap out. &gt;&gt; It's not your child. It's a son. It's a daughter. That little baby is a man in baby form. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. But when I become a man, &gt;&gt; God, could you come and take away childish things? No. He said, "No, you put that away." God know angel are coming to put away that for you. You know what you're doing. You know your childish foolishness. You have to put it away yourself and get some sense inside your head. Get some wisdom, man. You can ask God for wisdom. Oh, don't get me rocking this morning. Oh, glory to God. We got to get inheritance. We got to get abortion. If your mother fail you, don't fail your children. If your father fail you, don't fail your sons. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. No excuses. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] For every excuse you make and somebody who succeed under worse condition than you. &gt;&gt; For every excuse you make the man who complain he have no shoes &gt;&gt; but then he stop complain when he saw somebody with no feet. &gt;&gt; At least he have foot you could walk. &gt;&gt; So a lot of things are viewpoints &gt;&gt; how you choose to see how you want to see. &gt;&gt; We have to put away child things see. Amen. Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him." Am I too rough? &gt;&gt; I hope not. &gt;&gt; Don't think I don't talk to my children like this. You forgive me. Isaac is quite different. Okay. So, let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the Let me pause a little bit. The reason why I speak like this many times is because I challenge your trinat spirit. &gt;&gt; I told the ministers in ministers meeting I said you cannot even get to the Holy Ghost if they can't get to train that spirit. &gt;&gt; German have spirit, American have spirit, France has spirit's a spirit. &gt;&gt; The country have a spirit in it and that is not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of the country. &gt;&gt; You have to bust that. You have to get out of that crab and caroo gospel. Stand by ba by the side gospel. You have to get out of that. All you want is the word. Give me the word because the word is God and the word is what will transform you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear no excuse father in a day for me. Oh, God is your father. &gt;&gt; I was 17 years old when I was reading Proverbs. A young man, watch your life. Watch them women out there. Watch this. Watch that. That was my father. My father was God the word. My father died and gone already. But my father was God the word. Praise God. Let the word be a lamp unto your feet and a light unto a path. How can a young man cleanse his way but taketh heed according to the word? Give the Lord a shout. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about my life in my early years going to ministry education working there. The first thing when I go on a job or department tell I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; First thing &gt;&gt; you make an impact I'm a Christian. You know why I said that? Because I wanted them to know what side I'm on. &gt;&gt; And I wanted to be accountable to all who are around me. &gt;&gt; So I ain't playing no shady games because they see me smoking. But he Christian. I used to tell him my friend time one of the girls in work push move I show him my ring this time I die nothing I said call my wife precious I say I have precious home I have a Mercedes Ben's home they come with the old car like I have a Ben's I wanted them to know where I stood. &gt;&gt; You have to be able to do that. &gt;&gt; So, put me in the desert. Put me in a mountain. Put me in snow. It doesn't matter. I'm a son of God. You are daughter of God. You have to be able to stand. Friend or no friend, wife or no wife, boyfriend or no boyfriend, girlfriend or no girlfriend, church or no church, you have to be able to stand. It's not man you're serving, it's God you're serving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had a girlfriend when I came to the Lord. You know, I wasn't working on myself. I found a good friend and when the gospel come to me I rested down very gently because I couldn't handle the minuscule the lipstick my taste change &gt;&gt; I didn't do like Terry he had a girlfriend too when he come to the Lord when she come she say she Satan I'm not there outright Yes, &gt;&gt; at least I did it differently. &gt;&gt; But when you give your heart to God &gt;&gt; and you want to truly serve the Lord, &gt;&gt; it's a whole different thing all together &gt;&gt; because I recognize there's something supernatural &gt;&gt; that is looking over my life. There is super something supernatural that is influencing and guiding me. Why should I give up that? Why should I let that go? God told them the land that they're going through is not like Egypt. The land that is going through it have hills, it have valleys, it have rain. You have to plant your seed. Oh, and I will send you rain. If you listen to what I tell you, God going to bless you abundantly. He'll bless you in the north. He'll bless you in your south. He bless you when you're going out. He'll bless you when you're coming in. Give the Lord a shout. You shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. God said so. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:7. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready. &gt;&gt; And that we know that there's going to be a bride. There's going to be a wedding supper serve in disguise. that's just as sure to be as God is because it is his word. And we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be in his church and they are going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle. Now hear the bomb. And they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready. &gt;&gt; If you notice it said she has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; That come like a student. All the students have books, textbooks. They have teachers that's teaching them. But all that teaching is down to an exam room. &gt;&gt; It's not to say going to school or passing through the system. All the teaching is to get you to exam room. &gt;&gt; Same thing with if you're learning to be a doctor or a lawyer. You have teaching. It's a thing to learn. &gt;&gt; You don't walk up and say give me a sticker and put lawyer on your chest. &gt;&gt; That make you a lawyer because have a sticker. You have a mouth saying that you a lawyer. No, you had to go through the process. to do what? Get yourself ready for the exam. &gt;&gt; But your books are there. &gt;&gt; The text is there. &gt;&gt; Everybody had the same books. &gt;&gt; The same list to go and buy. &gt;&gt; Some children would apply, some children won't. I remember a prayer in moment. A man was praying. He said, "Lord God, bring back to remembrance what the students study. And those who have not studied, have mercy. Help them Lord. God can't bring back what you have not studied. &gt;&gt; Jesus said the Holy Ghost will bring back to remembrance &gt;&gt; what I said unto you. &gt;&gt; So if you don't get into the word, what will God bring back to you? If you don't speak the word to your children, what will God bring back to them? The word have to come to your mouth. The word is 90 even in thy mouth. You have to speak it even to yourself. I am going to be healed. I'm going to be delivered. You have to speak it. You have to claim it. You have to exercise that mouth and get out that dumb condition where you're groping and you're moping and you're saying nothing and you're griping and you're under pressure and you're not going to open your mouth as I claim it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. Don't give the Lord a shout in the house. You have to claim what God say is yours. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I read this many times. I'm going to read here now. But I hope it come across different to you this morning. So many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing, I will serve him. But that's up to you. &gt;&gt; See, you have got to do something, too. They that overcome shall inherit all things. They that overcome, you have power to do it, but you must be willing to lay it down. She has made herself &gt;&gt; ready. &gt;&gt; Friends, there is always a better way. &gt;&gt; But I realize there are people who don't live what I call examined lives. &gt;&gt; They don't look back to see the path they have taken, the choices they have made, the words that came out their lips and therefore they they live with consequences. &gt;&gt; You guys preached many of times. &gt;&gt; They are called secondary consequences. &gt;&gt; Decisions are made. So Lot pitch his tense up about Sodom. He could have handled Sodom. Not his wife, &gt;&gt; not his children, &gt;&gt; not his family, &gt;&gt; there are things you could deal with, but that doesn't mean others in your family could deal with that. &gt;&gt; And that way many pastors don't understand. They lose the lips of the congregation. Tell them all kind of things. But there are people that cannot handle it. &gt;&gt; And these people become dangerous &gt;&gt; with their mouths &gt;&gt; and their disrespects. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, God could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out the other end and say, "Blessed is he that overcome it." &gt;&gt; You had nothing to overcome. &gt;&gt; He just pushed you through. But you have got to make decisions for yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a ministry here that God place here &gt;&gt; that give you an opportunity to access divine communication and inspiration and guidance and prayer. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't want me in your business, that's okay. But at least they could solicit prayer &gt;&gt; for the business instead of you failing &gt;&gt; because you powering yourself. &gt;&gt; I hope that means something to you sitting here. I have nothing to do with I I I I don't want to disturb the pastor. You know, he busy. &gt;&gt; That is none of your business if you busy. Your business is to disturb him. &gt;&gt; If you are fellowshipping here and a believer here, your business is to get help. &gt;&gt; Your business is to get intervention. When when when when Morai tell Queen Esther, if you think because you're queen and you're behind that desk there or on that throne there, you wouldn't get affected. You're wrong. How do you not know for such a time as this you were raised up? When she recognized the gravity of the hour that her people was about to be destroyed, she said, "Fast, fast. I am going to fast. My maids are going to fast. You fast for me because I'm going into the presence of the king and if I perish, I perish." She was prepared to push further. She was a prayer to step out against her own hurt to get deliverance for her people. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. What would you do to see a family breakthrough? What would you do? What are you prepared to do? &gt;&gt; There was fasting and praying. &gt;&gt; But she was under instructions and guidance of Morai. &gt;&gt; She had a tutor. She had a governor. &gt;&gt; She had somebody. And we have the Holy Spirit here. Not just the Holy Spirit for you personal, but there's a ministry here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To help you. and to become a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; If you are willing to hear, listen, and obey. But some people don't want to bring nothing because they want to do their own thing. &gt;&gt; You are afraid different thing altogether. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, Abraham was a promised child, but here we go. But he must maintain this promise for 25 years. The ups and downs that he had, the temptations in those 25 years, but he held on to the promise. And Israel was promised a promised land. &gt;&gt; But they had to fight every inch of it. &gt;&gt; What if God had tell Abraham, Abraham, you have a child, you know, but it's like 25 years. &gt;&gt; Then Abraham hitting all the bars in the country and all the feds. &gt;&gt; And in 24 years, Abraham 24 years, he dripping in the church. Hallelujah. Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; The Bible couldn't talk about Abram stacking at the promise of God. &gt;&gt; But God never tell him how long. &gt;&gt; He said, "Believe this thing." And for 25 years, he held on. So therefore, Israel was promised a promised land. &gt;&gt; God promised that. &gt;&gt; They didn't ask God for that. God say, "I have a land for you." &gt;&gt; As an inheritance, &gt;&gt; you don't buy an inheritance. &gt;&gt; You don't work for inheritance. You are given inheritance. That is what I want to get to you this morning. If your uncle leave it, your grandfather leave it, it is still an inheritance was left for you. I don't care if you're drunk, you're half crazy. It is still yours. Oh, give the Lord a shout. It have nothing to do with your worthy. It have nothing to do with your sin or fail. It is inheritance. Preach back to me, somebody. If your uncle, father, whoever leave something for you. It has nothing to do with who you are. Is what has been left for you and what is your right to possess. God left healing for me, joy, peace, longsuffering. But give the Lord a shout in this house. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Like a years ago, I hear about a man drunk but he belong to me back drunk and somebody tell her brother's a false prophet. He said I might be drunk but I ain't stupid. I may be back to the man not stupid. God send a prophet &gt;&gt; he knows that &gt;&gt; all kind of people can be prophets now. Prophet this prophet and lying prophets you know not one thing they say come to pass. You know you have a social media prophet now he calling your name and tell all about you because going now he say believe in social media. Who's your brother or sister? Oh yes so and so and man have tablet there. So your name and who's your uncle and who's your thing and people think he's doing med Facebook prophetic all that. Okay. So Israel was given a promised land but they had to fight for every inch of it. Wherever the souls of your foot shall tread upon have I given you. You know there's a song on Jordan stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful eye to Kane and fear. That's when you're using losing binoculars and they snapping pine on Jordan banks. Yeah. Crossing Jordan spoo my go. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's something called subtext. &gt;&gt; Anytime God gives something. Look at the fine print. &gt;&gt; God said the land is yours. His promise is yours. But there's a subtext. &gt;&gt; There's a fine print. Say every place You put &gt;&gt; your foot &gt;&gt; is yours. &gt;&gt; If I don't put it, it's not yours. &gt;&gt; Do I hear a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Do I hear somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Every place you put your foot is yours. &gt;&gt; It's mine. I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. It is mine. Put your foot on something this morning. Okay. The Lord I shout. Where there's healing, whether it's breakthrough, whether it's deliverance, whether it's revival, where is to clear your mind from the trash that's inside of you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God said to Joshua, it was all there. The land was there. God gave it to them. But they must fight for it. The same way is about divine healing. God has the power to heal you. If you got courage to accept it, but you will fight every inch of it. God has got amazing grace to save you. But he will do it. But you have to fight every inch of it that way. I've been behind the pulpit for over 31 years. Every inch has been a fight constantly. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must lay aside ourselves. Praise God. We can't say God come lay them aside for us. I said that before inspiration here. We have got to do that ourselves. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hear this. &gt;&gt; If Wesley hadn't stepped out on the word and got a bad name behind him, called a crazy man and everything else, he would have never been able to achieve. But Wesley was one of God's great scientists. &gt;&gt; Luther was one of God's great scientists. They didn't care what the churches said, organizations said. Luther didn't care what the Catholics said. He just believed that Joshua lived by faith. He took God chemicals of the word, put it together, and the church moved by faith. &gt;&gt; Wesley put it together by the blood. Prove it was the blood. The Pentecostal believe that the bapt Holy Ghost, that's the promises to you and to your children, and they put the chemicals together in the word, and they move into the air. &gt;&gt; They moved out because they were able to accomplish such. &gt;&gt; Now, why did these men do this? Why did Luther find it? Why did Wesley find it? Why these others? Because the material was laying there on earth that could make a T- Model Ford. [Music] &gt;&gt; He had this bomb. &gt;&gt; There was the electricity that could make a car to run. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's talking about electric car there. This is Bram. There was electricity that could make a car to run. There was gasoline in the earth. There was pistons and so forth. All the mechanics. So plane was here when Adam was here. Car was here when Adam was here. They just didn't discover it yet. But all the materials to make car and plane and and astronaut was already here. &gt;&gt; So the word to prepare us, to change us, to transform us, to make us wise virgin, it's already here. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Nobody have to go up to heaven to bring it down because Revelation 10 said, "I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven." But the book no longer closed, but the book is now open. We have an open book. Praise God. We have an open deed. We have an inheritance. It has come down on the earth. Glory to God. Vindicated by said in Malachi 4, the first mature son, the first mature seed, but other sons are coming. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The inheritance will be divided. Do I shout on that one? &gt;&gt; Don't prove sanctification because the material is laying there. Did you notice those scientific achievements? one higher than the other. The automobile was higher than the horse &gt;&gt; and the airplane was higher than the transportation of the automobile. &gt;&gt; Horse power. If that's horsepower, what about God's power? What about Holy Ghost power? The Holy Ghost power that can justify you. The same Holy Ghost that can sanctify you is the same Holy Ghost that can sanctify you can fill you with his presence up and up and up. The same Holy Ghost that justify the Lutherans, that sanctify the Wesleyians, that baptize the Pentecostals, is now setting in order. The coming of the Lord, that same Holy Ghost, not a different Holy Ghost, the same Holy Ghost working in unfolding power right now. The Holy Ghost is unfolding by his word to you right now, this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; What's your objective this morning in preaching what you're preaching this morning? By the way, I'll tell you. My objective this morning is that each one of you will come to the place where with your mouth you can say give me &gt;&gt; this mountain &gt;&gt; or my mountain. &gt;&gt; You see if you're back in a condition you can't say that. You would have the faith to do that. You take faith to do that. You know &gt;&gt; listen Joshua Caleb didn't wait for the crowd of believers and people all around and look at who saying it first are shy. All that foolishness have to go out of your system. You have to know because you only can have faith for what's revealed to you as your own. That is what revelation is about. When God reveals to you this is yours, you say, "Wait, wait a minute. It is me." God talking to somebody else. He is speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Someone listen to me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So when it's revealed to you, it's yours. &gt;&gt; I remember doing the government exams and failing, failing, failing. How about for clap one and something like that. and people studying hard and thing like that. One of the days I get re I go and pass that you know and I went I had faith I had confidence and I pass the thing &gt;&gt; and guess what I didn't study half of what study but guess what what I study come &gt;&gt; figure that one out &gt;&gt; just what I study is what come &gt;&gt; you can't explain those things people for all kind of thing to study everything that I study come by the revelation I'm going to pass that thing praise God I'm telling you red sea in front of you mountains on both sides pharaoh behind you we going to pass this thing okay the Lord A shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has done it before. He could do it again. &gt;&gt; Let me say it good. He has done it before, he could do it again. What he have done for others, he could do for you. Give the Lord a shout in the house. What he has done for others, he can do for you. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses, so I be with you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Although if I'm trying and I fail, God won't leave me. &gt;&gt; If I'm trying and I fail, God won't leave me. I don't have much confidence in anybody who's afraid to do anything. I rather be from a failure than too lazy to try. &gt;&gt; I want to read this script from Hebrews 3 verse 7. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost said, today if you hear his voice, had not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation of the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and proved me and so my works 40 years. This is God speaking. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always error in their heart for they have not known my ways. How much time I keep telling you that when they came out of Egypt, they came out of Egypt based upon the power that Moses had to demonstrate God to the to Pharaoh. They didn't know who that God was. So he was calling them out of Egypt to bring them to the mountain that God could share with them his ways, &gt;&gt; his words. Because you can't please God if you don't know what pleases God. If you don't know what pleases me, you can't do and do you don't know. So it has to be revealed. So the revelation of God didn't come to them yet. He said bring them to this mountain. When Moses went to get revelation them having connival man and they carrying on with the foolishness making golden calf and all kind of thing like that. When Moses come down because them dancing and partying and whatnot go to kill half of them. &gt;&gt; This is human beings now. &gt;&gt; This still happening now. You know, &gt;&gt; people still have the golden calf. You know, &gt;&gt; it might be a car, might be a wife, might be a house, might be their job, might be their money. Whatever it is, same calf. &gt;&gt; You didn't think about that one. &gt;&gt; Same calf. &gt;&gt; The pride could be a calf. Big. Oh, that's a big one. That's a inside calf. &gt;&gt; Ego. Lovers of their own self. Anybody have that? &gt;&gt; They high on the self. &gt;&gt; They don't even eat marijuana. They smoking their own self. The inside inside the smoking up inside of there. &gt;&gt; Lovers of their own when they look in the mirror. So the hand something the most beautiful thing I seen for the for for the morning. Lovers of own self. &gt;&gt; That why they want selfies you know clicks clicks. &gt;&gt; Some people Facebook things only selfies. All kind of nobody else but them. &gt;&gt; All right we not here for that. &gt;&gt; When your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and I that they do always earn their heart. They have not always known my ways. So I swear in my wrath they shall not enter in my rest. They get God so angry God say no rest for them &gt;&gt; which is the land. &gt;&gt; What take heed brethren warning least there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief &gt;&gt; in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, that you may be made partakers of Christ, if ye hold the beginning of your confidence steadfast unto the end. While it is said today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. For some, here we go, when they had heard, did provoke. How be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses, but with whom he was grief 40 years? Was it not them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness, and to whom he swore he would not enter into his rest, but to them that believe not? So we see, here we go, that they could not enter in because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Their own unbelief. &gt;&gt; God didn't put a barrication and say don't enter. &gt;&gt; God didn't say a no entry sign for them. Their unbelief kept them out. Next scripture, the word heard by all of them wasn't mixed with faith. &gt;&gt; They perish &gt;&gt; because they come in the church and going back home with no change, with no transformation, with no application. Church was just a outing. Church was just a place to take a time out on a Sunday morning for them. Oh, glory to God. But they were Joshua and Caleb. They were a little different from the rest of guys. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When they came back, they say, "We are more than able to take that man." But the people was already under anointing of unbelief, under anointing of no praise, under anointing of no worship because the ministers couldn't handle worship. They couldn't handle the shouts. They thought we wild and we carried on. But they don't understand the praises is what brought the blessing. And the praises is watering the word. And Abraham staggered at the promise of God through unbelief. It was strong giving praise to God. And there must be a worship of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There must be a praises going up to him. But they rejected that. Oh, glory to God. They rejected the worship of King Lamb. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. They rejected the revival to get out your stinking flesh and spirit. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh, glory to God. But Psalms 118 says, "The voice of rejoicing is in the tablet of the righteous, not the voice of no dead dumb saints." Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. The voice of rejoicing is in the tablock of the righteous. This is the day that the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. Give the Lord a shout in the house. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's not another message on the earth like this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; So when man fell, the original title deed went back in the hands of original owner. God himself. Adam had the deed to the earth. Adam had speaking power, dominion power, power to create other sons. He had to wait until a further revelation. That is where Eve got deceived by serpent bringing an interpretation. That's how Cain come on the scene. But Adam supposed to wait to speak from his mouth out of sons. Let there be. Let there be. Let there be. He was a son under God to speak like God. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Adam was have a spoken word son. He was a spoken word son. Let us make man in our image and likeness. Let that man of dominion. So God spoke a man into existence by spirit. Give the Lord a shout. Then God took the dust of the earth and create a physical man and put the first man in the second man and man became a living soul. That's what you're seeing here this morning. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. But the book that Adam had was lost. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Watch. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. God gave and the boots out of Eden &gt;&gt; because he told that son the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he put guards &gt;&gt; around the tree of life. &gt;&gt; So Adam can partake of eternal life in that condition. &gt;&gt; So God protected the tree of life from this fallen man &gt;&gt; and give him the boots and kick him out. &gt;&gt; God will kick you out, you know. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of grace extended to us &gt;&gt; that give us this opportunity to serve God. &gt;&gt; I don't care if your mother is the poorest thing inside of here. The father is the drunkest thing inside of here. &gt;&gt; The fact that you are here, &gt;&gt; it's a privilege to have them as parents. &gt;&gt; However you come, you come. You land. But God didn't give up on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God didn't give up on you. &gt;&gt; God looking over your life. &gt;&gt; You must think God protect you from. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you're still grumpy and hardfaced. &gt;&gt; You know how much think God hedge you from. &gt;&gt; Things that seen and unseen. &gt;&gt; You know devil try to pull you down to his pit &gt;&gt; and angels fighting for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God, don't get me started this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you know your life is interrupted by angels? [Applause] Glory. &gt;&gt; So when time for redemption &gt;&gt; angel crying &gt;&gt; who is worthy said take the book &gt;&gt; John weeping &gt;&gt; John crying holy ghost felt man weeping &gt;&gt; because no man was found worthy looking for man &gt;&gt; under the earth above the earth all them angel was worthy but no man had to be a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No man was found worthy. People don't understand Jesus died not to save us. &gt;&gt; Not just to save us. He died to get the book &gt;&gt; because this book t this book tied to Genesis. This book tied to the original man &gt;&gt; that God made in the garden of Eden. And if God had to bring us back before the fall, to bring us back to have the Adamic nature, what Adam had before the fall, he has to bring back the book. And the book was sealed in heaven. Somebody had to bring it down. Before they bring it down, somebody to take it. No man was worthy. So when Jesus died, he was the worthy lamb. He went and took the book. He didn't ask for it. He took the book. Well, give the Lord a shout. He didn't ask for the book. He took the book. Oh, glory to God. And he said, "I claim them. I claim them. I claim them in Trinidad. I claim you. He claim your soul. He claim your spirit. He claim your body. &gt;&gt; Glory. [Applause] Ah, [Music] &gt;&gt; that's why Job by inspiration &gt;&gt; and by revelation he could say this do the skinw worms &gt;&gt; destroy my body. &gt;&gt; This the skinworms have a legitimate right. to work in your body. &gt;&gt; He said, "Though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh." What is Job saying there? Job is saying, "I'll be transformed. I'll be resurrected." Nothing can stop that. Though the skin worm destroy my body, yet in my flesh, I shall see God for myself. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Woo! Help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now watch. The title deed of redemption &gt;&gt; of all creation &gt;&gt; is in his hand. &gt;&gt; He come to claim it back for the human race. &gt;&gt; Not claim it back to angels. Claim it back to the human &gt;&gt; which it was given for &gt;&gt; to make sons and daughters again. &gt;&gt; So this book &gt;&gt; is what going to make sons. That is why when Jesus came the first gospel he preached you must be born again &gt;&gt; of the word &gt;&gt; and of the spirit. &gt;&gt; A man ask shall we enter back in the mother's womb? He said that flesh thing we not talking about that you have no revelation. I am talking about the word coming into you and the spirit coming into the word in you and turn into power and you are born back again a spirit man &gt;&gt; image of God &gt;&gt; in seed form. Oh, the Lord I shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Come on now. This this is the message, you know. &gt;&gt; This is the message of Yahweh. And to that seed of faith, you add virtue, you add knowledge, you add temperance, you add patience, you add godliness, you add brotherly kindness, and the love of God will come down the bond of perfectness, and you're back to Eden again. &gt;&gt; Okay, the Lord, I shout in the house. [Music] The bull test coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bull test is coming. &gt;&gt; You remember the bull. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; He said, "Bull, I'm sorry to disturb you. Go back and lie down." &gt;&gt; He couldn't tell the bull about seals and vials and woes and the mystery of Russia and Ukraine. and who the president Mr. tariff is in America there. &gt;&gt; He couldn't tell the bull that you know &gt;&gt; the bull only understand one language, &gt;&gt; language of love. &gt;&gt; And he had to have it to give it. &gt;&gt; He said he forgot his gun at the gate. If he had remembered the gun, he was to take the gun and shoot the bull and pay for the bull. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's easy. &gt;&gt; But God didn't want this to be the normal routine thing where you bust bullet and pay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God make sure the gun is not there. to make sure he's helpless. &gt;&gt; To make sure he's defenseless, &gt;&gt; to make sure he have to rest and punch something, something come over him. &gt;&gt; He said he can't explain it. He felt a love for the animal. &gt;&gt; He couldn't explain it. &gt;&gt; That is a bull. You know, &gt;&gt; it had to get me close to that dog bull. &gt;&gt; He said he felt no fear. &gt;&gt; What does the word say? &gt;&gt; Perfect love. cast it out &gt;&gt; all fear. &gt;&gt; He felt no fear. &gt;&gt; Love was there &gt;&gt; and love stopped the bull in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Make the bull turn around. That was back in the garden of Eden. Bull go and lie down. Lie and hush him out. Roar later this evening. I don't want to hear no morning raw. Give me a evening raw. Go give the Lord a shout in the house. Don't tell me this message don't have power. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me this word don't have power. &gt;&gt; This have plenty power inside of it. The devil want to make you think it have no power. But it have power to change you. It power to transform your walk and your talk and your attitude. This is what this is about. To change your thinking, to make you stretch a little bit, to push a little bit, to press a little bit. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to push yourself. &gt;&gt; That's what we talk about on Wednesday tonight meeting. &gt;&gt; If you don't push, you wouldn't get anywhere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You don't push to pray, you'll just say morning Lord, evening Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Guys, more than the time you taking to watch your Facebook or WhatsApp or some Tik Tok nonsense that they send for you to look and kill your time with that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say all these short videos and whatn not making people have short attention span. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now sure find things so boring. Everything is push whoo whoo whoo whoo whoosh whoosh. And God will have no instant food, instant faith, instant patience, instant heat. Not any instant business, instant coffee, instant tea, instant this. Just some people want something instant just a packing and then they go make food. &gt;&gt; You want getting lazier and lazier you know &gt;&gt; because man making things make it easy. &gt;&gt; Why you think people getting problem for exercise now? They're not walking enough in front of the house. All park this distance you know if I said people chance they park straight into inside price they drive straight inside people to get the nearest park foolishness just to walk is that 5 minutes walk 2 minutes walk human being all right so watch so this word is to actually make sons and daughters again so we cannot say get away from the word itself here What the Bible says, as many as receive him, who's him? The word to them give you power, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to become, &gt;&gt; not instant sons. &gt;&gt; Power to become sons. &gt;&gt; So God give you power to start you &gt;&gt; into sunship. &gt;&gt; Now this power to become means that you're under tutors and governors to be trained &gt;&gt; to be disciplined to be guided. &gt;&gt; Discipline is a word young people now don't like to hear, but it's still part of God's package. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the young man who said, "Father, give me all my money. I want to go now. I wait till you're dead to get inheritance. Give it now." &gt;&gt; He thought he was mature &gt;&gt; to manage what he had to get. &gt;&gt; The father he give him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He know he's not ready. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he give him anyhow. &gt;&gt; He buy fancy car, red car, he have friends, all the pizza, all the Chinese food and all the fast food and whatnot. He want to country the car text call him. He making sure there's no accountability to his behavior. So he's away from church eyes, &gt;&gt; deacon eyes, elders eyes, everybody eyes, pastor eyes. He's away and he doing his own thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until his money run out. When the money out, his friends run out. He didn't know he had only had money friends, food friends, &gt;&gt; pleasure friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then as I say already, they thought he was living in the white house in front. He live in the band behind the house. But the entrance was through the white house. So they could hallelujah. Glory. They may see when he spinning around when the back of the band there &gt;&gt; and for a while he didn't pick food. He ain't say nothing. You know what I mean? I'm going through hard times. I want to confess. I want to tell anybody through hard times. So when he recognize he sharing food with the pig, he say, "Oh God, oh God, oh God." His mind said a thing back in his father's house. He said, "Oh God, oh God, oh God." Every day he Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. &gt;&gt; He ain't ready yet. He said to pray yet now. Listen, you have one day that food was tasting so terrible. You say, "Oh, God. Oh God, this last time I'll arise. I go to my father. I say, I've sinned against thee. Let me be a servant." Yes. I go wash the dishes. I I sweep the yard. I &gt;&gt; I'll clean the fountain pen, the pig pen. I'll clean any pen you have down there. &gt;&gt; I tell the last time his friends see him, last time they see him behind the house. He's had a truck home, no car, no walk. And every evening his father looking out for him &gt;&gt; because the father knew that behavior had to come back in him. &gt;&gt; He man ready yet. &gt;&gt; So every day looking out for his son &gt;&gt; and one day but Anthony he see that walk in there. &gt;&gt; He said he coming back in a distance there he coming back. He said kill the fatted calf. &gt;&gt; Get the robe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get some relief you have outside there. Get some herbs. Get some seasoning. Start to prepare that thing there man. Get some music. We can't just have this dead thing come here. Dead, dead, dead. All these churches dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. All you have is special, special. The people can worship. Don't sing and clap like it's a concert. Praise God. We don't want that. We want you to worship. Every man in here supposed to worship. Everybody supposed to open their mouth. Give the Lord a shout in the house. Make some Holy Ghost noise. Let them think we are crazy. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You think I care about what anybody else think in the message? Not a bit of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I care about producing a revival. He said what we see should make a church that should make a revival that people will find from everywhere that will say the seven thunders that are not written is manifested. [Applause] [Music] That's the burden I have on me. Oh give the Lord a shout. The Lord had chasened me sore, but he hath not or given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness, and I shall enter in. The stone that the pillars refused has become the headstone of the corner. The Bible said, "This is the Lord's doing." And it's marvelous in our eyes. This is the day that the Lord had made. [Music] [Applause] be seated. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me let me tell you one time. You will shout before the walls of Jericho fall down. &gt;&gt; If you think you're watching the walls to fall down and then you're going to shout, God will make you wait. &gt;&gt; Wars around your life, the walls around your family life. &gt;&gt; Joshua, tell them when I bid you to shout, &gt;&gt; then shout. Seven days silence, not a noise. &gt;&gt; Don't feel led to shout nothing. Wait till they tell you to shout. &gt;&gt; Follow instructions, not your emotions. &gt;&gt; They walk on Jericho once, twice, twice. &gt;&gt; The last day, seven times. &gt;&gt; Jero inside know something chang &gt;&gt; the first time they say you're going back home. Then next round you can't say you're tired. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; On that day, that last day, &gt;&gt; your first rounds, &gt;&gt; second rounds, you never to deliverance, &gt;&gt; you never to break through, you never to inheritance. God tell them, "Take Jericho." Not only that, God tell them, "I have already given you Jericho." &gt;&gt; You just have to take it now. &gt;&gt; It's already given into your hands. Healing is given to you. Deliverance given to you. Hallelujah. Joy given to you. Anointing given to you. the blessings released to you. Let's take it this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When they shout the walls, I don't know what in the shout &gt;&gt; the Lord himself said with a shout. There's something there something about a shout. You know, &gt;&gt; a loud noise and the walls came tumbling down. &gt;&gt; They were trembling before the walls come down &gt;&gt; because they heard the report &gt;&gt; of what God did &gt;&gt; with Israel. And the Bible script, the story read, God shall send the fear of you &gt;&gt; to all the nations, &gt;&gt; all your enemies. They're going to hear about what God is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; This is who he think the devil believe you about to say anything. No. The devil didn't even know who Jesus was. If thou be, if thou be, if thou be, you too small, you too this, you too that, you so sidden, you so backsitten, you this, whatever, whatever you want to say, that's his business. &gt;&gt; He has no inheritance to get. He has no access to the book. When he try to access it, it mark access denied. He can't access this open book. This book is for the bride. He said, "Go to the angel and say give me don't give me." And we took the book. He said, "I took the book and I prophesy." And if you took the book, if you take the book, you're going to prophesy of your healing. You're going to prophesy of deliverance. You're going to prophesy of your breakthrough. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Before you curse yourself or neg yourself, prophesy before you blame yourself, prophesy. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Look at the power of love and the power of grace. That son who spend all his money, who live a want life, fooling around with with whatever he fooling around with, when he's coming home, his father already make preparation from him. He repent to his father and his father say, "Son, love." Lov give him a good hug and welcome him inside. &gt;&gt; He's feeling embarrassed and shamed, but he know he's loved. &gt;&gt; The father didn't accuse him. As far as the father concerned, he was lost. &gt;&gt; Now he's found. &gt;&gt; His older brother who never spent a bad scent, have all the money lo. Come and hear music. He say, "Where is that?" He said, "Brother, come home now." And guess what? They killed the fatted calf. He said, "Nah, how much grass he been for that fatty calf?" The Bible described as a fatted calf. There was no normal calf scrunching and and skinny and what you know. This calf is sized up, beefed up like you went to the gym. Then there's a fullbodied calf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the son &gt;&gt; that outside that that older brother he upset &gt;&gt; because his brother who come back get some beef &gt;&gt; cook have him he said not I'm not coming inside the father say son &gt;&gt; watch this all that I have is yours &gt;&gt; watch this &gt;&gt; the inheritance belong to him &gt;&gt; that son is firstborn &gt;&gt; that was his younger was playing the fool. &gt;&gt; All that have is yours and he blind like a bat. &gt;&gt; He has no revelation, brother Steven, &gt;&gt; that all that is his own. &gt;&gt; If he had revelation, he was going to rejoice &gt;&gt; that his younger brother come back. &gt;&gt; But he was in his human spirit. Blind as a bat. No revelation that the book is open and inheritance belong to him. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That mean people could be in the message blind like a bat. Mother kangali no revelation that revival belongs to them. Holy Ghost is mine. Power is mine. Deliverance that's mine too. Oh, glory to God. You got to get a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I guess when the father tell him all of that if he comforted it come inside. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But expose his spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go. We going good. Our 14 pages which is which is nothing much. Normally on Wednesday night is about hour preaching at 12. This is 14 pages but so my preach page five. So it might look like we might be 5:00 this evening but we only having one service this morning. We didn't tell you if you're joining up to the evening service. We only have one service. &gt;&gt; All right. What a brother. &gt;&gt; Someone paid a price that I couldn't pay. &gt;&gt; He did it for me. Now, I want you to take it personal. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here now, &gt;&gt; I want you to take it to your heart. &gt;&gt; Someone paid a price I couldn't pay. &gt;&gt; He did it for me, Charlie. He did it for you. He did it for the whole human race. And now he comes forth to claim his redemptive rights. &gt;&gt; Imagine Jesus had to claim. &gt;&gt; Claim it for who? Not for himself. For us. &gt;&gt; He is one of us. He was He's our kins folk. &gt;&gt; He's my brother. &gt;&gt; He's my savior. &gt;&gt; He's my God. &gt;&gt; He's my kingsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; He's all what I was I without him. What could I be without him? &gt;&gt; So he is standing there. &gt;&gt; The promise is yours. But you'll have to fight for every inch you claim. &gt;&gt; The devil will see to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He certainly will. &gt;&gt; What are you doing, Lord? &gt;&gt; What do they do in Canaan? They were possessing their rights. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Glory." &gt;&gt; They were possessing their rights and they could not possess their rights till they get into Canaan. &gt;&gt; So the journey is not your land. &gt;&gt; The wilderness is not your land. &gt;&gt; You can't claim desert. &gt;&gt; The journey have no deed in it. &gt;&gt; And people falling out in the journey. The journey was from Egypt to Canaan land. &gt;&gt; In Canaan land was the land of promise. &gt;&gt; From Egypt to Canaan is the journey. &gt;&gt; Some of you in the journey, &gt;&gt; but you're on your way to Canaan land. &gt;&gt; Canaan land is the land of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Canaan land is a land of promise. &gt;&gt; They own nothing in the wilderness. When they come into Canaan, they had rights. And we have got rights. &gt;&gt; When you receive the Holy Ghost, you're in Kenan. &gt;&gt; You have to fight for it. Every inch of ground, you have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason people say, "Baby Brandham, you pray for me." Get over in Canaan at once, brother, and you'll realize where you belong. &gt;&gt; Watch prayer start things over yonder. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look here, Satan, this is mine." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is where the language begin to change. &gt;&gt; Changing from you being a believer, I believe the message, but you're making no claims &gt;&gt; because you don't feel is yours. you don't see is your right and you are coward. &gt;&gt; Not a amen on that. That not to insult you. That's not to make you feel bad. But I'm saying it challenges of what we really believe. &gt;&gt; Or if it's subconscious unbelief &gt;&gt; that is affecting us from stepping forward to claim what God promised in his word. &gt;&gt; Understand this. He want us to claim it. You know he's the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; Do you know you have to confess it first before he intercede on behalf of it? &gt;&gt; He wanted to say by his stripe, I was healed &gt;&gt; before you are healed. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abraham could lay hold on it. Yet poor is starving. Lot took the best ground. His water was short. Hot days. His men have been in trouble. Everything looked like wrong for Abraham. Yet he owned the whole thing. He owned the whole thing. And today the true believer is cast out among the people called fanatic. &gt;&gt; Holy ruler. You can't call them people in churches hand so fanatic. Unless he's called them what call formal fanatic. &gt;&gt; Formal fanatics. Guys have the message right now. Formal fanatic. It's is over 30 or 40 years they say now. So amen. Hallelujah. Glory. And the prophet taught us that wine, which is revelation, &gt;&gt; comes with stimulation. &gt;&gt; So if the people not saying amen and praising God and worshiping, it's certainly not wine. &gt;&gt; They gain water. &gt;&gt; Put Jesus in water into wine. &gt;&gt; So unless they get Jesus, but unless Jesus come and turn that water into wine, &gt;&gt; they only sipping water, you know. [Music] They can't lick their lips with you. No, you never see nobody lick their lips with water. &gt;&gt; Nobody lick their lips with water. But they will lick their lips with wine. Ah, they smelling good. &gt;&gt; Don't go and drink wine now. We talking about this wine. See, people start to think about wine. We not talking about that kind of wine out there, you know. We talking about the stimulation of revelation, you know. That has get you tight. That's get you high. That's get you staggering. That's get the preacher gypsy a little bit. Praise God. You can't be drinking wine and you're just dull and you're just dull dull. No, no, no. But when them people drinking and they talk plenty, you know, &gt;&gt; you see pap said that that's right. But know we're talking about drinking. They always talking, they're smiley, they're happy and everything else. That is what the gospel supposed to do. You're smiley, you're happy, you're glad you're Christian, you're glad you're in the Christian walk. You're smoking, you're saving on cigarette, you're saving on licking booze. You're running a woman to minor, outside woman, outside child. Praise God. And so like that. You're living right. You're living good. The angels happy. The church happy. You happy. Family happy. You're rejoicing in God. All things are possible. Not some things. All things are possible with God. Nothing is impossible. Oh, glory. Give the Lord a shout. Nothing is impossible with God. But all things are possible. He can heal you on the spot. He can deliver you on the spot. He can fill you on the spot because all things are possible to them that believe. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. What do you believe this morning? Do you believe he can deliver your son, deliver your daughter, deliver your family, deliver your wife, your husband, your children? [Music] &gt;&gt; You have to work and toil and sweat for a few dollars to make honest living to put shoes on your children's feet to feed a hungry mouth. And yet, you are heir to everything. &gt;&gt; Abraham could possess the land. What was on it, God give it to him. What was a part of that land so Abraham had a right to it, he could call and lay hold on it. Now God, you made me a promise. This this is the attitude. &gt;&gt; God, you made me a promise. &gt;&gt; Now you have to leave here thinking God made me a promise. &gt;&gt; And that's was this land all his minds. You made a promise. Now my kinsman has been taken and all he's got is gone. He said, now watch. In other words, if I apply that today as your church could say, you saying it in modern terms, Lord God, here is my brother. He's laying here stricken with cancer. He's stricken with tuberculosis. He's got so and so. I lay hold of the promise. He's telling you what you have to say. I lay hold of the promise. It is my possession. You told me so. &gt;&gt; And then he went after the enemy. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Remember, Abram wasn't a fighter man. He didn't train in the gym. He just went with what he got and beat them &gt;&gt; and take lot pack out. Go give the Lord some praises. You ought to be no fighter woman and fighter man, you know. But you're coming with faith to believe that God will make a way for you. Yet Abraham watch had a right to the promise. The promise was his. You had to fight to possess it. The believer today we are heir to all things. We are heir to every spiritual blessing. &gt;&gt; That's a good one, right? Hear this one. Heir to every physical blessing. &gt;&gt; Thhouse, land, money, you name it. We are as of physical and spiritual. Don't just talk about spiritual alone. Physical too. I know we don't talk about that. But God could bless you till your cup run over until your enemy take notice. Hey, David said it this way. He prepareest a table for me in the presence of my enemies. My cup run it over. [Applause] Oh hallelujah. Feeling good this morning. Then David added that surely goodness and mercy shall follow me in the millennium. No shall follow me all the days of my life. I am walking and goodness and mercy. &gt;&gt; Goodness and mercy. Look it behind me. Wherever I go following, look back and see goodness. Look back and see mercy. Look back and see blessings. [Music] Everybody inside of here have something to praise God about. God, you passed through hell, but you're still alive. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. You passed through sickness, but you're still alive. &gt;&gt; You passed through stress, &gt;&gt; but you're still alive. [Applause] Let's go. We're here at every spiritual blessing, every physical blessing, every blessing the Bible promises. Yet you have to fight every inch of it. That is the way God got it set up. &gt;&gt; That why the people like priests &gt;&gt; and they want a message priest &gt;&gt; and they have them &gt;&gt; because the people remember they love this preacher thing. &gt;&gt; God hate it though. Because God don't want no man between him and his people. &gt;&gt; It sounds good for them. They like that &gt;&gt; the fight for ministry and permanent, you know, is till we all come, you know. &gt;&gt; This ministry thing is temporary. &gt;&gt; When we all come. &gt;&gt; So once my sons and they were babies, little babies, I shaking them, rocking them, burping them, changing them. &gt;&gt; I did that to you know. and me train me. &gt;&gt; But the point is this, they didn't stay babies all along. &gt;&gt; Now they big and they having not babies. I ain't going to have men that going to be teens just now. &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is this. The object of God is to bring you to maturity. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; When you're mature, you could handle stuff. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible teaches this way in principle. The subtext, he that is faithful in little &gt;&gt; will be faithful in much. &gt;&gt; God can't drop much in you. He even tell them little by little you will take the land. &gt;&gt; If you take it in a big way, the thing will overtake you. &gt;&gt; You cut, you plant, you grow, you cut, you plant, you grow, you cut. You cutting, you're cutting. Your big tractor going there cutting. when you reach down say it's because the devil take you the other side that grass and go back they in trouble. &gt;&gt; He said little by little. &gt;&gt; So God has give you $100 to see how you manage it. &gt;&gt; And never get that the snow cone and just wipe you out 10 snow cones. &gt;&gt; You saved none. &gt;&gt; God know if he put more in you is more snow cone you buy cuz you love you can't see the ice and them colors and thing coming out. You understand? So he give you little &gt;&gt; to see how you manage it. &gt;&gt; The Jews teach their children how to manage money. &gt;&gt; One set tithes for good for God. One set for investment. One said they teach them small. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they know money principle for small. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Other people say not a sent for them. &gt;&gt; Afterwards they taking their own sense &gt;&gt; because you haven't taught them. But these things could be taught. A lot of things you don't know. &gt;&gt; And some of you need to learn and recognize you don't know. &gt;&gt; I know I don't know everything. So, I'm willing to learn. I'm still learning because I'm still growing. I am this age, but I'm still learning. I'm still growing. I want to learn. I want to grow because I want to do better. &gt;&gt; And if there's a better way, I want to know that way. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All right. Let's see. Come on church. You have to fight to possess what you know is your own. Here in lies the problem. Do you know what belongs to you? If you're not reading the word, if you're not in the word, how would you know exactly what is belongs &gt;&gt; to you? &gt;&gt; That you could apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; The promise is yours. If you ever get it, you ain't going to get it easy. I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan. Satan captures your health. You have a right to go to Satan and say, "Give it back. &gt;&gt; Hand it over. &gt;&gt; I come in the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; the possessor of heaven and earth. You took my child. You got a mix up with the wrong boy. You took my boy. Mix up with the wrong girl. I claim them." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This here, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; is when I see a sign of maturity in you &gt;&gt; when you begin to make claims. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about saying prayers. Lord bless them in Jesus name. Bless my son. Bless not talking about the kind of praise. I'm talking about warrior prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't see your children tied up, you can't pray that prayer. &gt;&gt; You will say they're going through a stage or a phase. The devil telling you that &gt;&gt; it's not stage and phase. You know, the devil have them captive. One time brother Ram saw some young men in prison. You know what the God tell them? That's the house of hell. &gt;&gt; He said go and free them. &gt;&gt; God tell him go and free them. &gt;&gt; And he look at himself. Look at the bars. He said can't break that. He said he had no strength to break that. Then he say house of hell &gt;&gt; give way &gt;&gt; to the name of Jesus Christ. He had to speak to the house of hell &gt;&gt; to loose them guys from inside of there. Who's going to speak? Who's going to say it? Or you want to play dumb? You're only speaking for who you like and who you love. Somebody got to say it. &gt;&gt; Somebody got to claim it. The lamb claim it for you. &gt;&gt; He's depend upon you to make some claims. &gt;&gt; Now I mean this, you know, because they what he felt led to bring. &gt;&gt; If you notice from the quite couple of series and services, we talking about inheritance, being a heir, adoption, all these different things. You know, he's getting to something. All right, let's see if we can wrap up here. &gt;&gt; I'm heir to all things is given to me. I'm air. I can claim everything that God promised me. Notice I know I keep skipping and jumping. Notice when Samson prayed, he didn't say, "Oh God, sorry Elila. Oh Jesus." If Samson go down in that mode talking about his past sins and the li and he fall I don't know I meet their brother who falls so much of years and 20 years you meet him 20 years later he still talk about he fall a keep falling he just he in the ground &gt;&gt; because they teach that they want to batter you this is what ministers do and pastors do they batter the people in subjection and keep them under the foot under the tongue &gt;&gt; if you fall fail fail you repent is either God forgive you or go there forgive Amen. &gt;&gt; If God forgive you, you could move on. &gt;&gt; If God ever forgive you, go to him for forgiveness &gt;&gt; and get his forgiveness and come back and praise and shout and rejoice and worship God. &gt;&gt; But nobody is to keep you down because this happened to you and that happened to you. Get back up. &gt;&gt; Get out of that pit. &gt;&gt; You're not feeling good down there. &gt;&gt; You don't belong down there. You are sheep in the big mud because you fall inside of there. Well, your sheep, the pig, forget it. When he get that mud, he want to move. He's in love with that mud. &gt;&gt; But the sheep is very uncomfortable &gt;&gt; because that mud messing up your wool. &gt;&gt; You're not a pig. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So, watch this. It is mine. Satan cannot watch. Satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it is mine &gt;&gt; and lay it down. Now a child can't do that &gt;&gt; but a mature son can &gt;&gt; a mature daughter can. &gt;&gt; This is mine. &gt;&gt; God give me this help. God give me the body. So Samson could have said watch might not even backside and fell but you have no right to take out my eyes. &gt;&gt; So Samson tell God avenge me of my eyes. They had no right because they they didn't give it. &gt;&gt; They shouldn't take it away. &gt;&gt; They had no right to take it. &gt;&gt; God, you give me those eyes. They had no right to take those eyes. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Satan have no right taking up my son, taking up my daughter. So, I send in a word after them. Whether they like it or not, whether they want it or not, it doesn't matter with me. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; As I say, if they don't want you, pray for them when they eye open, pray for them when they eye closed. &gt;&gt; When they lying down, go right by them and say in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He said, I like that. Satan, you lay it down. You took it from me. You give it back because I'm serving notice on you. Oh, praise him. So you understand now &gt;&gt; I want to hope I didn't pass one. When a sinner can see you don't have to sin. A lot of people they sin because they have to sin. That's a pitiful shape when you're in you say you have to sin. But when you realize you don't have to sin anymore. There are people stand up and curse and laugh in your face and call you an idiot. Everything else they're willful sinners. There's no hope for them. But that man who does something constantly they don't want to do it. He steals he don't want to. He lies he doesn't want to. He does things he doesn't want to. He don't want to be a sinner. There's hope for him. If you can let me see see what truth is. Come up to God's promise. Lay hold of faith on that. Walk out here to the enemy and simply say, "I can't hold it any longer. That's all because it's yours." Tell Satan, "Give it back. Give it back. It's mine. Don't let him bluff you. Stand right there in the line and say, "Give it back." Praise God. So Abraham wasn't a soldier. He wasn't a fighter. He was a farmer. And Abraham could not do anything. He was a soldier. He wasn't a soldier. And he took that promise and of course he got that deliverance. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to see if I missed something here. All right. Maybe slow down. I have to get to it. All right. I'm air to divine healing. I'm heir to joy. I've got a right to be happy. I'm heir to peace. Take this person out. &gt;&gt; I did this. I did that. No. Take what God say. I'm an air to peace. I'm an air to eternal life. I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit. I'm an air to every evidence it's got. I'm a heir. Hear this. To the authority of God. Who made you that? Not me. He did. And every one of you is an heir of the same thing. I'm a heir to the throne. He that overcometh with me shall be on my throne. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Are you a heir to bham tabernacle? No. I'm an heir to all things both seen, present, future, to everything. I'm an heir to it. And every sin and wickedness has been put under my feet by the grace of Jesus Christ. He rose on Easter morning, triumph over death, hell, and the grave. and his anointed authoritative servant said, "The promise is unto you and to your children, to them that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. I am an heir." Amen. I'm a sinner, brother Brandham. You don't have to be. You are a sinner because you desire to be. You don't have to be. The debt is already paid. Brother Brandham, I wish I had joy. You can have it. You are just letting Satan rub you from the privilege that Jesus died for. I'm an heir to it. It's all mine. Everything he died for belong to me. Oh, give the Lord some praises. God don't send you to hell. You send yourself to hell. You break every barricade. You'd run every stoplight trying to make yourself go to hell and then say God is good and won't send you to hell. You are sending yourselves to hell. God sends nobody to hell. It was created for the devil and his angels, not for you. Give the Lord some praises. The Bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels. Amen and amen and amen. Let's go. Almost there. To restore means to return to the former condition. So when God say I will restore. He want to restore your health, your strength, your zeal, your enthusiasm, the passion to know the word, the to get in the spirit, the fervent desire to please God. He want to restore all of that. Give the Lord some praises to bring back to the former owner to bring back to the former state of condition. If a claim is made on something to make a restoration, you can enforce it. Glory to God. So when Jesus died because only when the testator died the will is effective. The death of the testator only when your father dead your grandfather dead he the will could be effective. So when Jesus died the will was in effect. And God sent the Holy Ghost as the enforcer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let's go. Right with me. I almost listen. Your father and father leave some land for you &gt;&gt; and there on the land. You don't know that that land is yours until some lawyers come and say well listen we have this for you you know when you have of age you reach 21 now this land is yours when you go and spy the land squatters there how long is sp 5 years 2 years four years and you come and tell them I'm the owner you know all that to leave you know they say we not leaving but they just walking out so they say they're not leaving then you go to the court and they get now the enforcer that when they come with tractor and bulldozer and all kind of thing like that then say 5 days and you're gone 5 days, we break it and everything and the enforcer is there to enforce it. Well, just as in the natural, the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; he is God's enforcer. &gt;&gt; But you have to make claims. &gt;&gt; You can't watch somebody land say that my land. You're coming for it. You're mad. You own that land. &gt;&gt; You watch somebody land say that it's my land. Could you imagine that mad people? &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; You can't watch somebody land and say, "I claim it in Jesus." That's not yours. It has to be yours. &gt;&gt; Your grandfather, some family have to leave that for you. &gt;&gt; Then you have a deed. &gt;&gt; The deed is evidence of purchase. &gt;&gt; The deed is document. &gt;&gt; That it is actually yours. &gt;&gt; This is what this book is about. &gt;&gt; That Adam had it. &gt;&gt; The the the original owner held it. &gt;&gt; Jesus brought it down. &gt;&gt; Give it to William Brham. William Brham gave it to the bride. and to give a five-fold ministry to re-echo to echo the very same promises to you. And the Holy Ghost is the enforcer to enforce your healing, to enforce your peace, to enforce your joy, to make you get a good night's rest. Oh, give the Lord a shout. He giveth his beloved sleep. &gt;&gt; Good rest. [Applause] [Music] Are you ready? &gt;&gt; We have the privilege &gt;&gt; to enforce upon Satan &gt;&gt; the claims that God gave us. &gt;&gt; For God has a law and his word is a law. And God in his word made certain claims to the church. Therefore, we have a right to force these claims upon Satan &gt;&gt; and say, "Give it back. There's a song they say, "The Lord save me. Why should I be B? &gt;&gt; The Lord save me. Why should I be B? I've been baptized in Jesus name. Why should I be B?" Amen. Amen. Amen. That's what we talking about. The Lord save me. Why should I be born? Oh, glory. The Lord save me. Why should I be born? The Lord save me. Why should I be bound? Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go. The law of the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; the law of it, &gt;&gt; is to force Satan &gt;&gt; to give up that which he has unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God. Souls of men he took from God. Souls of women, children, sicknesses of the body, he placed upon people where God made them in his image to be like him. And the church has been given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and enforce this upon them. &gt;&gt; God promises are true. &gt;&gt; This is where I get the scription from. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them. &gt;&gt; That's right. They are God's promises. &gt;&gt; He give us the promise of just like he did the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church has come to Kenesh Bania. Are we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ. yesterday and forever. Can we walk up there and take a hold of God promise &gt;&gt; and say, "It's the truth. &gt;&gt; I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. It is mine. &gt;&gt; God, give it to me." &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; You have to say, "It's the truth. &gt;&gt; What's the truth?" The word coming to me, that's the truth. That joy is mine. Peace is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; It is mine. &gt;&gt; God give it to me. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is the truth. &gt;&gt; I claim it. &gt;&gt; I own it. &gt;&gt; It is mine. &gt;&gt; God, give it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you don't have to do like, "Oh, God, I paid for his sins." You can't make your claims. &gt;&gt; Skip. &gt;&gt; Skip that. &gt;&gt; Notice in the the what disciples, they had mechanics. They were sitting there saying, "Oh, I'm afraid of them. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid to make a claim." &gt;&gt; Call them great bishops and things out there. I'm afraid to what the other message world would think about what we doing. Don't make no claim of Holy Ghost revival. 7 revival. We going too far. Nobody else is talking about that. They don't want to talk about that. That's the that's the business. They have plenty messages to preach. But we want what God promised &gt;&gt; for the bride. This is exclusive promise to the bride. &gt;&gt; The rest could get anything they want. But the seven toners got us the bride. Seven tenants give the bride faith. Seven thunder show about how to be pier seven bride revival seven voices to that group that's seven sing that seven of business this is our business that's my father's business that's the business I was sent to see about okay the lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah these disciple were cowards afraid to make a claim because the bishops and them all of a sudden dynamics come what did it do it not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanic And they went out to the people. Whereas before the dynamics come, they were just mechanics. But when the dynamics hit them, these people are not afraid. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. They are not drunk as you suppose. I'm one of them. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Musicians, come please. &gt;&gt; Watch. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that is the token &gt;&gt; that you have. Every redemptive blessing &gt;&gt; that Jesus died for &gt;&gt; belongs to you. &gt;&gt; It's in your hand. Are you afraid to claim it? Move out the worldly trash. He's showing you what you have to do &gt;&gt; out of your house. &gt;&gt; Get ready for it. &gt;&gt; Burn up your shorts. &gt;&gt; You don't have your shorts in your back just in case they want to rock back on it. You burn the shorts. You burn the mini dress. You burn them with a long slit. You burn them, &gt;&gt; not hide them, &gt;&gt; not put them in a deeper drawer. &gt;&gt; Come like when you're fighting them days, you bloody bridge behind you. No turning back. &gt;&gt; All right. Burn up your shorts. &gt;&gt; Throw your card tables away. Get rid of your cigarettes. Dump your unbelief, your church papers in the trash can where they belong. Then you're getting ready &gt;&gt; to do what? To apply the token in prayer &gt;&gt; with real evidence, real faith. Apply it with confidence. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close. We're going to play something. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with a prayer from brother Brennham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh God, our heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we just thank thee, Lord, for all that you have done for us. &gt;&gt; Your great being is near and you are here to make every one of the people well. &gt;&gt; I pray thee, heavenly father, that right at this moment, you will take every person here into your divine arms. May the fire of God begin to fall. &gt;&gt; May the power reach down and pick up the people. Shake them, Lord. And let them realize that this is the day of their visitation. &gt;&gt; This is the time the Lord has set. This is the time of their healing. &gt;&gt; God is spreading forth his arms over this audience tonight showing his signs and wonders. I pray that you would take all unbelief and skeptics, drive out every demon of unbelief and all formal ungodly indifference and take this people and heal every one of them. Lord have mercy. Now as your servant, I ask every unclean spirit that is in this room as God's prophet. I ask every devil to be cast away from the people &gt;&gt; that they might go from here free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, &gt;&gt; created of heaven and earth, author of everlasting life, hear the prayer of your servant &gt;&gt; and grant this tonight in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Now with your head bowed, set closed, believe all your heart, every man and woman, now sit tight in God. Now this is the part I want to get to. I want you to repeat this prayer that I tell you. &gt;&gt; Now you repeat it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it and you just pray it. I'm going to say it. Surely God, I know what it takes to defeat Satan. If God so confirm it here tonight to prove it's the truth. I've told you the truth and God testifies the truth. And while we are just a little bitty group of people sitting here together, you said, "Why not let this whole group be healed tonight, you repeat this prayer after me everywhere? Almighty God, God, creator of heaven and earth, author of everlasting life, everlasting life, send thy blessing upon thy servant. &gt;&gt; For I am desperately in need. &gt;&gt; I have seen. &gt;&gt; I have heard the gospel. &gt;&gt; And I believe now. &gt;&gt; Lord, help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; And now for a long time, &gt;&gt; for a long time, &gt;&gt; Satan has bound me. But I realize tonight &gt;&gt; he has no legal rights to hold me. &gt;&gt; I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; And I claim &gt;&gt; my God-given privileges. &gt;&gt; And from right now on &gt;&gt; I accept my healing. &gt;&gt; I accept my healing. &gt;&gt; And I go from this building. &gt;&gt; I go from &gt;&gt; glorifying you. &gt;&gt; Standing on your word. Let's all stand and give God some praises. Father God, may you pour out your blessing upon your people tonight. bless them in a special way. I commit their lives to thee. In Jesus name I ask it.
