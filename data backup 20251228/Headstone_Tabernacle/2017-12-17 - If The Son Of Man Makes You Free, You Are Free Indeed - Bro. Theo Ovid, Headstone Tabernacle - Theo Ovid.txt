said afterwards the earliest nights there is going to be this Sunday night into Monday so we had never Sunday morning service that all years D that would be Sunday itself so the night will have a midnight service the ten o'clock service at night so remember us in prayer I appreciate that special this morning heart of um I'm brother Brannan and Jesus said that the hour come where the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth and it was one thing to have spirit but then the truth is what was lost through the ages and God sent a prophet to gather the scattered wood to bring back truths when he got a disgusted wood that word now can bring down the Holy Ghost but the object of God is was going above us go to with us and know God in us the object of God is to come into his people so God has not content to be around you he wants to be in you look to your eyes and speak to your lips to check your life remember you are not just a single being your triune being body spirit and soul remember that God wants you to be a twin like a dual being one on the earth and one in the spirit many times we are not conscious of how much things happen in the spirit realm and we have to become people that are tuned to the spirit realm not just natural things and you want to have a scripture and a coat and know you want that we understand in the spirit realm you want understanding what spirit is sent against you what's coming to challenge you will come and affect your home and family and your whole situation environment around you it is spirits and demon powers and you cannot fight demon powers with natural things you kind of find demon powers with physical things you have to have the authority Authority to fight back what the devil's a loose but we have a scripture whenever the enemy come in like a flood the Spirit of God always be is a standard God must have a witness somewhere God must have 7000 they have not bowed and needs to bear one time Elijah

Jerusalem wasn't expecting that fire these men come and fire hallelujah that the others could not explain man on fire after a long journey man not dead tired after trailer of years man on fire sorry how long and you're driving to come here you better come here on a man on fire [Applause] when them guys recognize things up mr. Bush crypto script is that again give my quote get my coat fine define scripture they find in Scripture and then they say hey boy something suppose be happening no look look it here boy yeah I said bring me wood when you find him so I could worship to worship who understand this persecution was an effect to try to wipe out Jesus persecution was an effect to try to wipe out baby Moses the devil later cut off potential because he is sure what you will become you see when somebody take the first cigarette there wasn't sure they didn't know they might they end up on coke in from that time something start somebody do something wrong and from that time something stack then then show hug and you see when you make the right decision when you make the right choice when you do the right thing the devil is sure who that gonna really work out so understand this don't expect the devil that comes for who you are the devil didn't know who Jesus was that way saved over here and the fullness of the Godhead was dwelling bodily in this one man and the devil didn't have the spirit to pick up that was him the Christ the other which to see something manifests yeah it was sealed up jesus knew he was the devil you I couldn't touch that man that man it is written for that man at the most yet no power so I don't watch him closely he's a dangerous man because he's staying with the word that's a terrible thing for the devil that's a dangerous thing when a man's here with the word that's a powerful man you can't move him if he ever got the devil can move him so Jesus Jesus Jesus went to the temple never sittin on witnesses Allah for his man boy watching me watching him watchin he find the place where it he's watching him because he is accustomed reading scripture and he finalized a 61 the Spirit of God is upon me be has seen nothing yet for he has anointed me they still think he caught in Scripture but he quoting himself bah hallelujah to open the eyes of the blind hope line either open yet he still read in Scripture he still prophesy and from the book praise God hallelujah and when he finished close the scripture and said this T this what you just heard here this is it this is fulfill it's no longer here it's inside of here and the word became flesh and fell among us okay the Lord our shop in the house or glory no God [Applause] net next thing the booty mode research maybe season eject him out of the church the reject him eject him put him out and he become the rejected stone then he's not heal the sick raise the dead cast out panelists and the devil couldn't do nothing about it you didn't hear me this morning you didn't hear him in this morning we are bolted that stop it we waited 40 years and we are no about to get started and the devil himself can't do anything about it or get the Lord our show in the house [Applause] whoof [Applause] Lohmann courts in the arc of adultery with witnesses this is a kagama court Nanette bring out the Christ say Moses law says we have the code field we have the tip on it that she's supposed to be stoned what see you know problem is which one of you without sin cast the first stone so he switched it from Ricky the heart in other words you have to have not just talked written word you have to have the right spirit motive and objective so God does see the layers between the mount and the head and the heart so God not intrusive so much in your in your mouth and head as much interested in your heart so you have to have a hat for God David had all his problems but he says he's a man after my own heart Jacob returned loads a problem but Jacob I love because Jacob has the Hat of God for the butt right so you can't just watch that sinful man you have to see what seed is in that sinful man because if that seal of God isn't that sinful man be it your husband being a wife beat your daughter beat your son God is going to bring that person now [Applause] so you've got talks until you're blue in the face if that seed is behind that skin got going to come because all that the father gives me will come back sizes coming to those who leave the church is coming back to the Holy Spirit go after them bring them out with a mighty hand because the self you'll notice you're going to let God's people go but with the pride and all the hands of false shepherds because the Bible prophesied you have false personalized days that would the binder people to themselves by fear but who does shudder man set free it's gonna be free in me how many one of those free this morning you're gonna be free this morning let's all time and give the Lord a show [Applause] let's turn the Bible says in John chapter 8 want to read from verse 32 to 36 on Revelation chapter 2 we'll read from 12 to 17 if you were not here last week Sunday you need to listen to the message from last week's Sunday many things were addressed you need to hear it listen to it I have kept a lot of things from you to church over the years not anymore a lot of problems and challenges and issues on the international front and whatnot I have said no where we got kept the church clean from now that you will grow in the Lord by just the Word of God I never used a pulpit or assault insult and do this and tell us about people on what that I never did that that's not why I see the pulpit is for I see the pulpit of the place to speak truth because this is what will help you it's not about me and my personality is about what the prophets said I am out of the picture I have no opinion and feelings about it if God speak it we have the packet out that's all I am here to speak at you yet a shout and confirm it and say Amen to it once the Prophet said it so reading from sin John chapter 8 let's read from verse 32 oh the essence of investiture and he shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man who says though you shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son our body forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed revelation is up two to one I read from verse 12 under the angel of the church in Pergamos write these things saith he which had the sharp sword with two edges I know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you with seat and to elect but I have a few things against thee because thou hast dere them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to class a stumbling block before the chin of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so as doubt them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which things I heat repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the him an over commit will I give to eat of the hidden manna and I will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it let's pray father we thank you for your word now God may breathe life into it speak to our hearts we need to hear from you granted Father in Jesus and we ask it amen amen Yura be seated well this morning I have a title if the son of man make you free you are free indeed if the Sun Amon make you free you are free indeed of a subject the doctrine of the Nicolaitans another an inspiration he that had ear he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches oh praise the name of the Lord but a brand speaking in a church age he says in verse 23 I believe talk much in John 20:23 to speak in the disciples he said we father and son will come unto Him thus it is not it is it that is the Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at one time it is one person comprising the Godhead not truly it's just one the advent took place at Pentecost they an two comments of the Spirit just one the trouble is that people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in Jesus for the remission of sin but never go on to receive the Spirit before I close this subject I know there's a question in your minds you will want to know if I believe in the deduction of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls be careful here and see this listen it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or the seed that it is that is in that that is it way back there too far from the human mind to grasp the eternal God with eternal towards thought and decreed Jacob I loved but Esau have I hated in Romans 9 13 Nita was born but neither had anger or evil see it was the thought and when that thought became Express God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed so that seed is what predestinated that seed is what was eternal Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respected a bit right and the Covenant of God and if you are a true seed you will hear that word the Spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ selling you and empowering you you will receive the word for your age and your deal you see o clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you though Jesus was the Royal seed like that no talking about seed jesus was what royal seed here we go he lived in the human body what living a human body this royal seed live in a body called Jesus okay the Lord a shout you heard it now this royal seed lived in that body Oh glory to God hallelujah and when the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to Jordan and was baptized in water upon of being the word the Baptist upon or being the way to the whole world and tackle you to the token upon obedience to the word he gives the spirit to them that obey Him do we a shout in the house do you hear somebody confirming what we are preaching this morning this is the Prophet upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved son the voice did not say this has become my son Oh glory to God Jesus was the son but the Holy Ghost position him as the son before them all or give the Lord a shout that's why we said but a promise will pull him do the work of an evangelist and he had to wait on the Holy Ghost positionally and we have to wait until you are positionally pleased oh my so let me say it again the Holy Ghost before them all then haven't been filled us and the same pattern holds at Pentecost and ever after he went in and demonstrated revelation of God from go home I know glory to God now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the Iijima she lives let me show you clearly the seven ages sat for toleration two and three take the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles so this seven ages that we talk about seven two changes completes the times of the Gentiles when the ages are over the Gentile times is finished right what this is the whole time in which God is dealing with the Gentiles unto salvation in every single age band none it says the very same thing in opening and closing a message to each church age on to the messenger Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum ty Tyra Sardis Philadelphia right these they see it he etc he has an ear let him singular hear what the Spirit says to the churches let's quality / notice here Jesus by the spirit in every age address himself to only one person relative to the word for that age only here we go one messenger for each age receives what the Spirit has to say for that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church God put a messenger and a half a messenger and another messenger is only one behold I said you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn back the hearts of the children or glory to God this messenger let's continue he speaks for God by revelation to the churches both true and false Oh give the Lord a shout all glory to God enough traditions in our forces but this messenger have to speak to booth okay the Lord will have to claim the messenger both have to believe the message born out to be claiming to preach a message but it is a true church and there's a false church or gives a lot praises people there's a true vein and there's a fault line and the prophecy when the bride by design meant could discern the two spirits were given the framing of the church and on my facebook puts page I put that coat and so you're asked what for discernment because you cannot withstand what you have not discerned when the bride could discern the two spirits in the church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand you can just is in it you have to withstand it that's what will kill you if you allow it or give the Lord some praises and not taking prisoners sit and look at the steel to rob and destroy did you hear that dough feels sorry for the devil and he appears I himself you have to steal robbing destroy he's a busy busy bandit oh yeah he could ship you off every write that you have yeah every blessing you strip you forget get a chance let's continue Oh glory he speaks the God by revelation to the churches which one falls the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within the range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way or glory of God each individual of the group is one who has the ability to hear what the Spirit is saying by way of the messenger not by we have no faithful but we are the messenger [Applause] faithful and messenger not on the same class at all but a Branham didn't recommend but Abraham has the evening place as a fight for his place above that he plays as a major elijah prophet he was placed even to reveal son of man even - shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed so he William Branham was a shallow man reveal indeed Shannon on so these phenomena words to the bride words of deliverance bullets of Zealand words of restoration so when we talk about shadow man setting you free this is the words of the son of man when you go back to the words of the son of man and that set you free you are free indeed no pasta no patient no faithful so-called good hold you back when the Son of Man set you free you shall know the truth and the truth is what gonna set you free [Applause] you don't want information you want fruit you know what information he want revelation ask God for revelation ask God for revelation that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the Spirit is seen by way of the messenger there we go those who here are not getting their own private revelation nor is the group getting a collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God so no man can come under no new teachings new revelations that the messenger every we deem them false and if the communis morning trivia you are false [Applause] were it again each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God that was you're saying what the Tipsy you're seeing what the prophecy because he alone had the ability to hear what Jesus was saying to the churches so when Jesus tells the Prophet the top / tell us no man in between you didn't hear that there was no man in between now tink it not strange for this is the case of Paul said this pattern under the hand of God Paul alone had the full revelation for his day as evidenced by his confrontation of the other apostles who admitted that Paul was the prophet messenger to the Gentiles so Paul being a messenger could confront the Apostles because Paul was not a faithful minister or a faithful prophet Paul was a revealer of the Old Testament he had to go on the backside of the desert they haven't beaten them no they're from God Almighty I only come back from that he said any man since I'm spiritual let him acknowledge what I say is the commandments of God and if he's ignorant I am a painter wish I Paul a prisoner Jesus apostle to the Gentiles or give the Lord praise offer [Applause] one day I'm gonna meet that man hallelujah I'm gonna meet that hook-nosed dude hallelujah add hot tempered you I'm gonna meet that man called Paul old glory to God Paul is within us what a Branham is waiting on us this just have to come to perfection to bring the resurrection [Applause] [Music] Oh glory will be seated in every age we have the same pattern that is why the light comes true some god-given messenger in certain area and then from that messenger get spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught one man gets the light resent the light like how Habakkuk say write the vision write the vision then other ministries come to make it plain that's you the people might see it run or give the Lord some princess do you see where I'm preaching this morning the Prophet came and write the vision then make it plain and butter balancer this way I hope that God raised up men to make more sense to what I am preaching and who only hits in the highlights but me men come and bring it into written authority so as we near the coming of the Lord there should be less confusion less misunderstanding that should be a clarity of faith and purpose we come from where you're going what you're about where you're at it should be specific Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] when somebody up a vision for house or a company or business did you see our vision with the vision I just love it the lion a vision could be defined you could put a vision within time I have a vision within six months I want to plant this I want the booty someone to do that and next ten months I'll do this next five years I'll do this when they bring like a phone that is iPhone or whatever kind of phone it's not know they make that what what they working on no they don't tell nobody before come on know was working on tree as I go why he was sleeping and slumber in like blackberry one time it had plenty plenty like Marion library was it why they were sleeping and slumbering another company was making a phone showed radical and different that then don't you realize that he is up that is numbered everybody showed that Blackberry and even if it took an expression numbered finish because I think any of them churches finish this did a long time and we do numbered finish you come back coming for a super church people Superman okay there are some praises people hallelujah so if you think the devil gets caught by surprise is the other way around because Birnam already hear what the secret is the secret is that the bright is God not the brightest the Holy Ghost not a secret that is bogus the secret is the word is in the bright or glory to God hallelujah that's the secret and she is waiting for the main of Christ which is the spirit which is revelation 22:17 come on now the spirit and the bride the bride becomes the word and the spirit of the monk got bread tell me one more ride our riders Hill once more the white horse rider the leaders put the mountain rider bride straight down to the resurrection and the devil can do nothing about it do nothing about death there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a rapture Tamara's going to be eleven supper [Applause] [Applause] listen to this that is why the light comes true some god-given messenger in a certain area then from that messenger there spreads the light through the Ministry of others what we faithfully taught but of course here we go all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger a spook so I tell about don't tell me what Bert Coleman see tell me what the prophecy and tell me what the Bible see because we only have one messenger don't make him an eight messenger because he didn't make himself that people want to make him I eat messenger get me scripture brother and put it back when the Prophet says put it back in the scripture he that shut up sorry walking keep on moving now Johnnie Walker keep walking or get the Lord some praise these

Lord some brizzy's people all glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but abano how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has what one voice which is the voice of God that's why if somebody

not running around shopping do let bad Jesus but Jesus is the Jesus who come before Jesus game but watch his name by Jesus what does that B is before Jesus so you get it how carefully must be the year one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God and Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them Aereo that even Paul prophet Paul could not change one word of what he given by revelation Paul cannot even come back and say you know I should have change it so I wanna change he can do that once it reveal it stands the revelation will just Paul himself because the word is God that's a big one the other than it watch how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his messengers and then see what has been given them to see to the churches then barbam said he has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches of each and each age is the same cry hear what the Spirit sees the spirit not man the spirit if you are a Christian you will get back to what the Spirit is teaching that is the world of his age save a pastor decides to play backward round tips halt in the name of God that could be a fallen angel did you hear what I just said if a pastor choose to play for the Branham teams in this church how in God's name that could be a fallen angel that is impossible that is impossible the only way we could come up to the tips and what the Prophet said is the gather people back to the word because of wood is a plumb line you know the plumb line is is what the tradesmen use a weight with a string on it to see how straight it is so you're building the wall in a drop a plumb line you could see is the Wall Street if you also diploma I will expose it you know shifty problem 9 to shoot you all so you want little so and you push your plumb line so so yo all and you're plumb line going so that's the holy plumbers work the plumb line don't lie the plumb line is the plumb line when you hold up so it's straight for everybody for the preacher for the deacon for the elder for the janitor for whatever it's the same plumb line it's the same word when the plum nice you coming home 11 Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Oh is he coming okay he's a 5-4 bend and then because he bent then to the plumb line I'm not listening to the voice call bend the plumb line this double chop he does drop and just wait there everybody measure up that just said if I mention you're straight you're crooked all wheel spins really something when the broom check the foundation some fraudulent bill de bill are wrong ting under the lid and the bill is an ability in the going good and when the plumb line of the word come to check the revelation the building or from then gossip break it down mash it up or get a lot some praises if it's not according to specification they have to break it down [Applause] [Music] Oh get along you that is the word for this age every messenger to every eighth word preach that word here we go every fresh and true Levi's ver would have the age you the cry of every edge is the rebuke you have left the word repent come back to the word from the first book of Genesis to the last of the revelation there's only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to gain favor back to the word [Applause] scripture acts 20 verse 27 to 30 says Paul speaking I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves unto all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood for I know this after mighty battle this is profit Paul speaking shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock prophesy and Paul also of your own selves men shall arise not Saddam men gonna sit down and and cool yourself no all gone you see when him when a dog on it and when when he kept burning most horribly right so Paul gone men rise speaking put for these things to draw away disciples after them the object of speaking things so people know what Paul speak I'd never hear that so you have more where that come from then at occasion like that that's not a new way to mix wheat bread you know that is that once is not what Paul said it is deafness guys with with reasons on it but O'Bannon was interpreting this scripture he said also of your own selves watch that man could look don't you and see the thing coming of your own cells mentioned arise because of those things to draw away disciples after them years later a bunch of men that want to make an organization take the sacredness and the holy spirit away from the church and push it on bishops and Pope's and priests that deal be holy and the congregation live any way they want to they pay the priests and he'll pray them out to hell and it's nichole eaten now listen let me see and God said he hated it God hits an organization now you see watch don't you the church if it don't do that he hits an organization he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches no Paul wolves he said wolves are coming right has become Nicole Eaton so the Wolves come to bring doctrines and teachings put for the stuff attract people onto themselves their ministry I have the angel connect to the angel but I want to tell you there are two engines I want to call it angel II and Angel we will get down into it shortly these two angels represent two sides two forces two spirits 1/8 from above and one B from below but we don't get down into it Oh glory to God so pause wolves become nickel eaten they were trying to form a priesthood a little priesthood not a china forma a faithful priesthood to rule over man they're saying Jesus ministry no because Jesus had come at the rule nobody Jesus if thou be hallelujah Jesus said do you want to remain whole just as a gentleman jesus said behold I stand at the door and knock jekima say I am your boss you know not Jesus hallelujah so watch the Wooden Nickel the Greek word Nick oh I wish my time it's a conquer and overcome the laity the Holy Spirit to conquer the Holy Spirit to conquer the laity to take out of the church the resurrected Lord Jesus with signs and wonders among the believers and put men voted in to be Pope cardinal overseer to take the Holy Ghost away from the laity and give it to order a holy order men placing themselves over the lady this is now converted into well the fake fight over men who want to be in charge of other churches these guys hit this ability of the local church I talked that some brothers and estates I said decision train I I said as a sovereign Church and if brother hit the table where we were dining and said we should not go back to serenity it will break the unity then I knew they were off the word because sovereignty is the word and I say there is no unity without serenity you have to respect what a man is doing respect that there was no fight for over no church the faithful ministry is for a specific purpose for the perfecting of the saints I've never said one run churches is for the work of the ministry where is that ministry it's very any fan of the body I'm before a man could get into that fight for ministry you have to past you before Jesus had these ministries what ready Jesus go the spirit let Jesus into the wilderness it wasn't a Minister Association to come Jesus who we are all one the spirit let price into the wilderness and he overcome the lust of the eyes the overcome the lusts of the flesh he overcome the pride of life in other words he overcome himself and before God to give a man power he has to be able to overcome himself could we give the Lord a shout [Applause] people want power over others and acai hop over itself so not to call em pastors with mean Shepherd but I'm sorry first timothy 4:1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the feet and we already see some that want pom I mean he's like Isis they gone extreme they go on had a terrorist level I kid you not I'm not freaking out over there I'm a person display with words I don't I'm not any word game thing okay some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils second Timothy four one two five says I charge thee therefore before God under Lord Jesus who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come prophecy where they will not end your song doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth what did we preach last week you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free they're going to tell it on the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry or praise the name of the Lord what about I'm sayin if those churches are fine people but it's the system that binds them it's not the church itself it's the people in the church it's the system behind that binds them put them into a place and brick or fellowship they won't let them go on with God what about beautiful thing and God heats not the people in there but the sister that is Bynum is what he hits it's that organization that tells them if they go to another church they're going to be excommunicated cut off and the people don't know what to do but we're around said they were peaceful it's Sunday and these brothers that's showing these false doctrines and false teaching about you are a Holy Ghost and all kind of foolish and contrary and prefer things they will be judged one of these days or you have to pivot oh it's the enemy with this revelation and hell - oh yes damnable heresies oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God when I'm talking about Jonah he said we are not going to the shift of dashes we got a duty before God he said as a message we are responsible for I am responsible to tell you the truth and I am NOT going to tell you nothing but the truth as long as God let me know what the truth is or glory to God not to deceive you not to try off but to tell you the truth I hope I am duty-bound to a message that he given to me from a mighty God but around words and I hope that you will understand if you disagree with me on these messages and things you remember at least have this respect that I have a responsibility and I'm not going to Tasha SHhhh I'm on my road to Nineveh have got the cry out Oh glory to God could you take a little more so this pull almost become the seat of Satan Babylon was the seat how did it become the seat of Satan when Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians the priest king Attalus fled the city I went to Potamus with his priests and sacred mysteries oh you didn't know that Lucifer has some sacred mysteries yes he does his priest was packing it sacred mysteries mysteries from Hell but around say one time all the world believed in one God then it came to the three gods and the tree has one person and what not and then mysteriously he said father son the patrolman for father with a sick of a son and Holy Spirit they end up sticking a woman inside idea and put Mary dear brother that a revelation father son and bride is the Godhead good imagine father son and bride he do the same thing them did back there this take a woman side idea father son and pride God said let us make man you mean God Father Son and bride say let us make man that's so confusing that not even so an intelligent it's something kinda real foolish is only one Lord but around said the Godhead is settled it is scared he's definitely got head no tree persons one God a man come and flip the card upside down and say you know what is a hidden mystery it's father-son and brain nobody ever pre that that is one of these secret mysteries [Music] God give that one think about it now he said the Father Son and Holy Ghost these three are all glory of God gives a lot of show Father Son and Holy Ghost Istria these trees are yellow Israel the Lord our God is one Lord don't bring no primary third-person electricity false teachers false revelation so the priests set up a kingdom outside the Roman Empire and strived under the care of the devil so you'd ever have care to the care his priests he makes sure his priests get covered already let me go the false vine was telling Lucius anger against the Living God by killing the elect even as Cain killed Abel the true church kept trying to get the first church to repent it's not the other way around the true church trying to get the first church to repent it would not do so it increase in science and influence and by Rama influences then we take the name of the Lord use it anyway prophesy on it when means nothing but some panel inference and so forth and see things have never happened and act like it never pay any attention as if you say something honestly it didn't happen you say if you say something and it didn't happen who repent and tell it that you were wrong then your influence will come back that the man is honest but there's no reference they seem to be that we can just do anything in the Lord I get by with it as long as we belong to certain group so these brothers for 2010-2011 didn't want to repent because they want to know how it will look for the five whole ministry how they go look really good because I look honest because I recognize a wrong Spirit came and brought the wrong prophecy wrong teaching Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God amen praise the name of the Lord so we see the two angels injured a I call it injure B who me talk about the GB virus already right so a is representing Arkansas representing the image of the Lord a represent above angel B represent belzebub represent the angel that once was in heaven man skip down or below this B angel is the one that was working with Brunel writing underworld false prophecies as an angel that two angels Harlan for question the B angel I was working 2010-2011 where did it go all that question think about it but a Branham says watch how close it gets that razor-edged this some trying to do God a service or status pingos will between right and wrong a reason edge between right and wrong remember it will fall on one or the other side till it comes down sometime like a hone razor between the difference of right and wrong it's got to be every word of God not just almost every word but every word is cut down today not the Lutheran's not the Methodists not the Pentecostal but that I warn edge with this edge where the Antichrist anointed so perfectly it would deceive the very elect 'add they will fall on the wrong side is there none watch it like a wedge watch be careful we are not living in the Pentacles of each now we are past that age Oh glory to God amen hallelujah praise God so the devil job was a set up a hierarchy of ministers try to controlling their own way complete influence isn't that right hallelujah setting up and maintaining a system that is contrary to God's plan and program hallelujah praise God you cannot reject and deny the sovereignty of the local church a little brother dogmas of any local church but you just talking that talk he the respect he given that the whole but not respected at all his behavior and action tells otherwise but you have to see certain things people to believe that you really believe that oh my I go all since 2013 I've been hammering because of my experience with bread - Lucy we should not go back to sovereignty 2013 Germany after preach about serenity of local church and I believe that that's why I am in nobody's Church business I am NOT just business at all I do interfere my want to do so and so on so up to this morning people asked me a question about what we do in here up there this morning on the internet after answer I say the truth is sovereign you chacorta's yourself you fine fall fine photo watchers are open church people looking in the people and again music and drums this that they wanna find this and I said well to uncheck about yourself Oh glory to God are we ready for some more for the most he said by this stage we have two churches bearing the same name but with a bit of difference between them one has he parted from the truth she has high whereas I sell for the signs of debt she is powerful many members she's favor of the world the others a little persecuted group that falls the word we see the churn of the flesh persecute and destroy the chair of the spirit the Butley one father even as was the case of Isaac and Ishmael Revolution horse finish won't take me too long we run to $15 them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which things I heat didn't want to get on to you recall that Nikola 10 comes from two Greek works nikkyo to conquer Leo which means laity Nicoletta means to conquer the laity now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership with moves with political maintenance he has placed his church in the care of God inane spirit filled world living men who lead the people to feeding them the Word of God he has not separated the people in the classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood or holy fifl it is true that the leadership must be holy but so must the whole congregation further there is no place in the world where a priest or minister mediate between God and the people but we give the Lord a shout there is no place where the five hole or the minister mediate between the people and God Oh glory to God the men behind the pulpit supposed to be pipes when God opened that pipe the Spirit of God just have to flow through to you or get the Lord of screen give the Lord a show I am NOT here for me I am supposed to be here for you bringing love letters from your lover love letters from Jesus or give the Lord some praise these people so when you're coming to the fore to rejoice they can afford a shout because you're hearing from your Lord then the ministers become deadly like a dead pipe like a trumpet and I just had a blood true oh my further there is no place in the world where priests or minister or such as mediate between corner people nor is a place where they are separated in a wish of the Lord God wants all to love and serve Him together Nicole it isn't destroyed those precepts and instead separates the ministers on the people I make the leaders overlords instead of servants overlords instead of servants so what am i doing interfere with another church and saying who supposed to be pasta underfoot all the pasta and the ship of a right of photo mode because the ship supposed to want to connect to the angel which one angel II or angel be because right here I pull the plug an angel be and I have to make sure in the beat don't return [Applause] the keep in shall be out angel it is welcome in the ether walking and sang he said there'll be a church with in jelly in it the shout of the King will be in the camp she's just going to be walking in it Oh glory to God let's continue so now this doctrine started as a deed in the first age it appears that the problem leaning towards elder precipitous and overseer bishops both scripted shows that they are several elders in each church to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over elders so that Fripp now is a disciple of power and control over the elders and is a difference no lot difference talking French now between the faithful ministry and the elders and you have to explain will be faithful and the brother I see talking with two sides of his mode one side in Mount he's in his local elder next site trying to say he is five or so he said imagine a local elder a fallen angel spirit coming local error to make him think he's a faithful befall already chosen really faithful that's five fools means five men think about it they called another Englishman got to talk Spanish French German think about it once the Englishman at the only language Jesus spoke in English just wasn't over English he's talking Hebrew or whatever he was talking then you know so I can limit God to English only Faisal you mean any houla South America it will have one minister on the planet and South America that God could take fill anoint and bless and use and give the finest touches to the bride because men are perfect any bride you know the wood is doing that b54 is the duty finishing touches like the hem of your dress like you typically toward his shoes are wearing for the wedding finish the bouquet of flowers the finishing the fight formation of the party virgins of the people and the car to drive back miss reason the man has to have the virtues for it to flow and pour for 50 years we have mysteries and revelation and wood and teaching and script a-courtin and so on the secret is the wood in the bribe but the spirit has to be released to activate that Buddhist in you to make you an empowered Sun or glory to God don't let the devil think you are finished you are not finished yet you have to come into a manifestation because a word is a tort Express but the word itself must be borne into manifestation so go ahead bring thought bring you to the word know the word in you have to come into a manifestation you catch us you mean as a word you have to come into an expression the Bible said the word was made flesh that is when the invisible would become visible when the world come into your flesh then the invisible becomes visible all glory to God so the Prophet said know the truth of the matters it would L signifies who the person is why the word bishop signifies the office of the same man the elder is the man the bishop is the office of the man the elder always has and always will refer to a man's chronological age in the Lord he's an elder not because he's elected ordained but because he's older he's more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of experience long standing proof of his Christian experience but no the bishops did not stick to the epistles of Paul but rather they went to Paul account of the time he called the ilysm ephesus and record states elders were called and in verse 48 he called him over stairs or bishops and these bishops no doubt here we go politically minded and unjust for power anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local elders with official capacity on his own to Overland Church to them a bishop was not one with extended authority over many local leaders such a concept was neither scripture nor historical yet even a man of the statue of Polycarp into what such organization thus what status that did in the first age was made a literal doctrine so it is today I call it five for bishops still claim power to control men and deal with them as the desire placing them where they were so will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the holy ghost who said separately Paul and Barnabas for the world parent to I have called them this is an T word and Antichrist or Cobra say Amen okay I'm gonna do in Chechnya now Matthew 20:25 28 Jesus callin to them and said you know the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they have great exercise authority upon them it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your Minister and whosoever be chief among you let him be your servant and as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many oh praise the name of the Lord praise God and this Roman Catholic Empire now watch what the bigger room do on the basis of a success she divided on conquer that was the seat of room - did I divide and conquer human knowledge and power and programmed the kind of take over divine wisdom and place the Holy Spirit no longer in control this indeed was a tragic evil for the bishops begin to maintain here we go that is no longer required a transparent Christian life and character to minister either the word with this man-made doctrine of elevation of bishops to a place not according them in the scripture the next step was handled greater titles the development the religious hierarchy soon they were acts Bishop lo bishops Cardinals over as bishops and by Boniface deterred there was a pontiff overall pontiff anna nicola turn doctrine this rule i was established in the church did not hit it off too well with a lot of people for they were really all a pistol oy essay on the word written by some godly person what did I just do excommunicated the righteous teachers and burn the school's telling me not an inspiration the out it takes special education to read and understand the world after all these years come on it took five fall to bring what known seamless they better bring the life because the word here for all these years it's hardly ever think we do already nobody profits it we could find it it only computer it's only in it its internet and so on you can find this anywhere it need more than that right now it's really that light because it breaks come in room coming home so just coming judgment is coming and we have to have what it takes to deal with that we can't have we have a church it happen less touches Satan embodiment that he's still marching him but a wrong quality invasion of the USA he said the invasion of churches the invasions of home is Devil's loosed hell is not below he'll have come on the earth do you understand you in a real war he'll come from underneath and come on top so part of the cell heaven from dong he said heaven consists of the word so he sent seven years of bring down heaven with a message of the Holy Ghost to loosen go across the world and you in the land of mortality you are in between fight brother [Applause] maybe seated almost done and though we are angel from heaven preach any other gospel and which we are cursed we should let him be accursed it was the Apostles who brought your original word to the people the original word could not change not even my dot or - Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to bring a second revelation try to make one little change if I give originally left me be accurst do you see how powerful that is he had was to stay with your original revelation did he Paul knew that the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation than a second revision now listen this if something is not any Bible only a prophet could reveal it if a mystery is not inside only a prophet can reveal it nobody could claim but a man never revealed the mystery of pitch three or four and he revealed it no so that make him who what what a what a man is that right the Prophet is the only man call to review this book men come under that and see what that was said by revelation inspiration oh my are you with me no so Paul knew the first version was correct God can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can't give a revelation and an app to it like he didn't garner Eden he promised the sea to the woman and then later desert in the sea to come to Abraham and then later say they will come to the planning of David it was the same revelation it only gives the people more information to help them to receive and understand it he can actu'ly the revelation will catch injured god's word can change the seed came exactly as revealed and you see what those false apostles were doing they came here we go with their own would go wrap it up here those Ephesians knew what world Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost the lane of Paul's hands the look post false apostles in the eye and said you are not seeing what Paul said you are therefore false this is not laity or elder correct and fight for you know this was believers who no apology challenging them apostles chlorine Oh God a brother say explaining the difference in a local elder a fiber ministry because son lieutenant will not correct a general what that could work in the army but will come with that here this is Ephesians didn't on lieutenant correctly know L know fine fall this is a famine of the word dynamite or glory that God is no lieutenant correct in general it doesn't have that oh my hallelujah they look those apostles for in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you're therefore false that says my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tried the Apostles on profit on teacher it is the word that tries them oh my one of these days there's going to be a profit to the loudest interchange you will know if he's a real one sent from God or not for he will be that in that word exactly as God give it to Paul music I'm a please he won't deviate from that word for one moment not by one iota and that's in this last age are you ready when there will be many false prophets apparent watch and see how they will keep telling you if you don't believe them and what they say you'll be lost but when that last day profit comes on the scene if he is truly the prophet he'll be crying out get back to the world or you are lost or glory to glory man praise God praise God praise God so once the clergy separate themselves and organize themselves they oppress the people by leading them into an abandoned organization this organization was based upon Crees and dogmas which they taught the people instead of the pure Word of God you act instead of the pure Word of God are you ready ritual and ceremony was given Christian partnership and soon the whole system was a militant and diabolical power that did its best to control all to persuasion or discourse or literal force oh my god this is too much this is too much this little ism his it came to be a militant this church she's only like if his militant diabolical power that did its best to control all true persuasion of discourse or literal force it receives his energy from its own false prophecies the false prophecies Israeli was getting energy from and not the Word of God it was no absolutely Antichrist though it came in Christ's name after what seemed interminable time where and truth must surely die men begin the protest of vileness of the Catholic Church because by no stretch of the imagination could God be in such teachings and such conduct and I swear Luther came in and start the Reformation oh my he said they're Antichrist spirit manifested in organization dimension on false talking to the ages and the poor little root and stock is going to be restored and so forth amen religious I'll skip that but Ram says I sincerely believe that the Spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of the ages but he has been faithfully delivered our hearts that they may turn to Him that is the reason for all the preaching and teaching for it is the preaching intention of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him not for one moment do I bring a message of the people that they may follow me listen Brown or join my church or start some fellowship organization I have never done that and will not do that no I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I cannot come to just one thing I'll be satisfied that one thing is the see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and men wherein men become new creatures in Christ filled with the spirit and live according to the Word of God praise God so this false prophet praise God later he become the devil incarnate so the devil begin with the spirit of the devil he become a false prophet a teacher of false doctrine so the teaching of the false doctrine is the first move of Lucifer on the move he didn't have a classical power yet but he started in with a demon of false teaching and that teaching became a doctrine and the doctrine become incarnate and a false prophet that went and not known the room Nicaea room god only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti Bible were teaching this he put 68 million into the sword and kill and billions died spiritually on false teaching false teaching notice he give us space to repent but he didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it reject it oh my so what I will do her okay almost so then this force teaching the Antichrist first road in a teaching ministry what did God do to combat that Antichrist spirit listen know what he did and one window to meet him the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word when this false teaching went out the anointing of the lion has to come to combat false teaching that anointing is a pole anointing fearless anointing Judah to come back what false teacher oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that she anointed one what I'm saying is not designed on one design or is it teaching different village to anointed only for some limited question an answer Matthew 24:24 and there shall arise false prophets and false Christ's and false prophets show us and the one is how shall we recognize them whatever him say a false Christ is false anointed because Christ is anointed how many knows that the Christ been anointed there will be four so noted ones they call themselves prophets but how will you recognize them by the word that's how you will know it by the word whether they're right how will you recognize them will be by the word if they say that they have the word and then deny the word there's nothing to it they might heal the sick they might open the blind eyes and deny the word stay away from it don't care what it is stay away once it's not the word Oh glory to God when a man turns on the world and joined the church instead of receiving the Holy Ghost that man dies Oh glory to God amen oh praise God hallelujah what's next I'm frozen and this is from Isaiah 28 this is what coming next Wow praising of the Lord wherefore yeah the word of the Lord is confirming that rule these people which is in Jerusalem because you have said we are made a covenant with that I would hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we are made lies or a refuge an under false enough we hid ourselves therefore does see the Lord God behold I lay in Zion a foundation of stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make his judgment will I lead to the lane and righteousness to the plummet and the heel shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the water shall overflow the hiding place and your covenant will death shall be dishonored your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing score shall pass through then you shall be trodden down by it and from that time that did code for each I'll take you morning by morning shall is Passover by day and by night it shall be a vexation only to understand the report for the barest shorter than a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than a man can wrap himself in it for the
