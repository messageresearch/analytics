Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence and thank you for this opportunity that we could come and call upon your name. You have blessed us. You have help us along this life's journey and I pray keep and preserve your children. Lord may anointing come down tonight in a special way. Inspire the exaltation, inspire your word to your people that it may have an effect upon their lives that they wouldn't leave the same way that they came into this room but they leave you changed. They leave you different. Grant it Lord in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. So it's good to be here tonight and I want to say that you know of a truth we have no continuing city but we seek one to come. There is no permanent ground. There is no you know like you cut the grass the grass will go back again. You put a roof on a roof and roof will get rusty. It will fade. Everything is have to be repaired, have to be redone, have to be recharged. This is what we have here in time. And even our energy, our strength is not permanent. Everything is temporary. So this journey of life is is temporary. We really don't have our city here. And we have an opportunity to to serve the Lord to to to surrender to him to give over to him. And I remember one time sharing with you how the devil shifts the goalpost. One time if you get this, you'll be happy. And when you get that, you're still not happy. And I keep shifting shifting just you you know you you want to achieve this and when you do achieve it you're still not satisfied because that satisfaction that each one of us has to have that comes from God that void in our hearts that come from God you you you you want to get a husband go get your husband you want children and then you know you get children then you find it's problematic it's challenging and whatnot and life is just like that some don't want this, don't want that, and life spins some balls that you wasn't expect, wasn't looking for, and it comes your way. So, I pray that God help us tonight. Strengthen us tonight. Stop looking for destination. If you are a destination type person, waiting until you reach something to praise God, reach something to do. But I want you to be a Christian that enjoys your journey. Whether it's up the mountain, whether it's down the valley, whatever challenge come your way, you could say safely the Lord give the Lord take it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. None of us here tonight expected where we are in terms of this thing called the journey of life. But it is what it is. We are consoled by his word. Romans 8:28, we know that all things will work together for good to them that love God. That's our confirmation that we love God and God will make it work out well. He knows what's in our hearts, in our lives. And he know what to take out of us. He know what he want to teach us and what we need to see. So tonight, I have something that I'd like to share with you. I've titled it all that call upon him in truth. And you see where I get it from. A scripture Acts 17 verse 22-28. This is Paul and Acts 17:22. Then Paul stood in the midst of Marcel and said, "Ye men of attent, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious. For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God, whom therefore ye ignorantly worship." Listen to these words now. Him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing he is the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth in temples made with hands. Neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything. See, here he giveth to all life and breath and all things, and had made us of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth. and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation. Verse 27, did I get it from here? That they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring. This is verse 27 is the context that I have but I'll get to the scripture where I get the title from. Verse 27 says, "And they that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us." Psalms 145, I want to read from verse 14 to 21 of Psalms 145. The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those he that be bowed down. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is, here we go, nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him. He also will hear their cry and will save them. The Lord preserveth all them that love him, but the wicked will destroy. My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord. Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever. Amen. So that is what we want to share the scripture and let's continue. for the brand. He said, "Now we read in the old prophets of old. We read about the power of God and how it operated the church." Tonight, friend, here that is lukewarm. That's not to where you should be in Christ. The great glorious powers of God is ruling and reigning in his church. Again, don't you be the one that's behind. Do not try to be popular with the world and right with God because you can't be. You must be right with God and then you are not popular with the world in this day that we are listening. Seek God with all your heart. Call upon him while it is time to call while you have a chance of repentance and while the mercy of God is reached down to you. For the hour is coming when it will do no good to call to be told it then call now. And this connects with something that brother Gideon shared on Wednesday night about doing it now. Seeking the Lord now, holding upon him now. So watch. He says that the time to call while you have a chance to repentance while the mercy of God is reached down to you for the hour is coming prophecy that it will do no good to call it be told you dead. So he was talking about but when they from second ro when he come down to the Jordan to face the critical world what did he cry where is the God of Elijah it wasn't the robe of Elijah that done it was the power of the God of Elijah that did it and the thing the world needs this morning is the power of the God of Elijah you might have spoke with tongues shouted run over the floor but what we need is the power of the God of Pentecost to produce the lies and things that was lived in the day in the apostolic hour. A secondhanded robe was all right, but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God. He needed a fresh anointed from God. He wore secondhanded robe when he come to the river, but he needed a brand new firsthand call from God, a firsthand power from God to perform the miracle. Now listen to these words now. And my brother, don't you be afraid to ask God anything. Hear me again. Hear these words. My brother, don't you be afraid to ask God anything. You must demand God or ask God for anything that he promised. For if I am introducing a God that is omnipotent and all powerful, and if I be a servant of God, I must do the works of God. And if I do the works of God, I must be a man of God to bring these things to pass because he is demanding of me to produce the impossible. I have to ask him. I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promise it. So do you every person this is incredible but Brandon is saying he is demanding of me to produce the impossible. I have to ask him. I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promise it. So do you every person you shall receive power acts 18 after the Holy Spirit come upon you after the Holy Spirit come upon you after you are robed as a Christian after your faith is set in Christ then you shall receive power there you are now brother sister everyone that's this morning may I say this before praying for the sick may I say this by God's help you pray for me I stood 10 years ago on this practice form preaching on David and Goliath. Now, it isn't that Goliath that's hindered me. Listen to these words. It isn't that Golad that's hindered me. God has slain him before me. But the thing that is hindering me is the lack of faith. This is the prophet speaking. The thing that is hindering me is the lack of faith. The lack of something that I know was around. And this morning before this little tabernacle again, I'm screaming, "Where is the God who give this promise? Where is the God who met with us yonder? Come forward, God. Give me courage. Give me strength. Give me a determined mind. Regardless of what comes or goes, whether it looks dark, whether it looks good, whatever it looks like, move on. Your promise is true." Amen. Isn't that wonderful tonight? So on and what the holy ghost given for almost done. So Jesus Jesus uh knowed that there'll be great intellectual move in this day. Washing up pots and pans, wearing clothes, turning around colors, everything else. He know that right? So he says, "Now the purpose, here we go, of sending the Holy Ghost was for God to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest God to the world." That's exactly not by a creed, not by a denomination, but by the power of his resurrection, by making his word real, by taking his promise. Here we go. and standing on the side of the minority and believing God and watch the black skies move back and the power of God moving and take over. That is what he wants. That is what the Holy Ghost was sent for. That was the purpose he sent it for. Psalms 142 we read David was in the cave and David said this. I cried unto the Lord with my voice. So this is not no mental praying and praying is mine. No, I cried unto the Lord with my voice. With my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. I poured out my complaint before him. I showed before him my trouble. And when my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knest my path. In the way wherein I have walked of the privileged leaders near for me. I look on my right hand and beheld there was no man that would know me. Refuge fill me. No man cared for my soul. I cried unto thee, O Lord. I said thou at my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. Attend unto my cry for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutions, for they are stronger than I. Look how sincere, look how honest, look how truthful David is praying. He is not speaking with eloquence. He's not using fancy words. He is praying to God. He said, "Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name. The righteous shall compass me about and thou shalt be bountiful with me. We want you to pray like that. So I wrote some things here. Cry unto the Lord. Whether in sickness, in fear, in worries, in hurts, in danger, regardless of of your soul condition, don't hesitate to call upon God. But call upon him in truth. Submit yourself to him. God is not interested in fancy prayers or words. Don't cry for help, but trust in human intelligence and the ability to get you out. John 4:24, God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. It must have spirit and truth. Psalms 138:68, "Though the Lord is high, yet he respect unto the lowly, but the proud, he knoweth a far off. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will provide me." So David is not negging himself, talking negative to himself. He's saying, "Do I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will revive me. Do thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me. Note David is confessing his dependency upon God. He is not talking about my men will save me or my my my my generals and my said no no no he said thy right hand shall save me. Then he said these words the Lord will perfect that which concernth me. Thy mercy, oh Lord, endureth forever. Forsake not the work of thine own hands. So listen as we close. God is near to those who are seeking him. And that's where we get Acts 17. That they should seek the Lord if happy they might feel after him and find him. Here's what though he be not far from every one of us. So I want to say tonight, he's not far from from any one of us. Psalms 145:18, the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him. And this come after what? The next line, the qualifying part to all that call upon him in truth. So this scripture Psalms 114:5 brought a division. You could say you call upon him, but then it says to call upon him in truth because you could call upon God in hypocrisy. You could call upon God, but you're still looking for some kind of cement, some kind of something else to work for you. That is not the truth. So you could call upon God and you have a hidden agenda. You have a hidden motive, hidden objective. God doesn't want that. And I have time. I want to read this. I think I'll read this. read this years ago. I think I want to read this again, but Abraham had a vision of this black snake, the African mambber snake, and this thing kills. Okay, once it attack you, hit you, it kills you. And he says this now, he look at angry at me, licked his tongue. Here he come. But when he got right close to me, this is a snake now. He'd run up fast and when he gets and then slower, slower, just quiver and stop. And then something would hold him off. He couldn't bite me. He turn around on the other side, try to approach from this side. So this snake taking one side approach and we taking every side he could take to see how he could attack. He would get back, get a start, swish right towards me, get slower, slower, and then stop and just shake like that and move back. He couldn't strike me. Then he turn and look at my friend. Here we go. This is the partner. So he turned and look at my friend and away he went after my friend. And I see my friend just jumping way in the air and over him and over him and over him trying. The thing was striking at him. I thought, "Oh, if it ever hits him, it will be instant death. No wonder everybody is so scared." Cuz when this thing hits you, it's instant death. And it was just striking at him like that. And I threw my hands up. I said, "Oh, God, have mercy upon my brother." And he said, "If that serpent ever strikes him, it will kill him." And just then the serpent turned to me when I said that. Wow. And look at me again. And a voice came from above me and said, "You have been given power to bind him the worst or any." So, so this is very dramatic. It was trying to get to him. The same the snake slow down and stopped. He recognized he cannot bite brother Brandham or hurt brother Bam. But see the same thing but then it take off after his friend. But Abraham with a voice said, "God have mercy. If the snake ever strike it, strike him, he will kill him." The snake turn around. And then the voice said, "You have been given power." I said, "Well, God, what must I do?" He said, "There is one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. You must be more sincere." I said, "Well, God, forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity." And when I raised up my hands to him again, there was a great something came over me. just lifted me up. Seemed like my whole body was charged with something. So now the anointing has struck him. He's feel a charge of the Holy Ghost, a charge of the power of God. I look at this serpent and when he started to watch me and couldn't do it, yet I said, "Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you." So he knew the snake couldn't get to him, but he spoke these word. Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I I knew. And the serpent, a blue smoke flow to him, and he curled up and made a sign like a S, capital S made backwards, a and sign, and means and means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst. Blue smoke fell out of him. His tail choked his own self to death around his head. And when he made the backward s and sign like a conjunction, the brother was free. Now he went over and smashed on it. I said, "Now I've got to find out about this because it's a vision." I hit on the thing. It turned like it looked like a handle on a glass handle on a picture. It made of solid crystal. Think of that. How quick that blue smoke was life and everything that left it and all the elements turned to glass. Then a voice came again, you can unbind him also. So I said, "Then Satan, that I might know, I unbind you." And when it did, he started coming to life again wiggling. I said, "I you back in the name of Jesus Christ." And when it did, the smoke flew out of him again. He choked himself right back and turned to crystal. Then when he did that, the voice said, "No, you must be more sincere than what you are to do this." Then it left me. I was standing in the room. A few moments I hear a clock go off, my wife getting up, the children, and I skip. So I slipped into the den room. I got on my knees. I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know these things. What must I do? The turner will be calling me to take them to school in a few moments. What must I do? I look around and my Bible was laying there. I said, "Lord, if you will forgive me, I do not believe in just opening the scripture and taking something out of the Bible saying that, but there is times when God can comfort you by such a thing." I said, "Lord, in this case of emergency right now, before your spirit leaves me, I don't know what to do. The kids will be in an hour yet before they come on. Would you show me if that is there? something you're trying to get to me, heavenly father, and just let me know. And I took the Bible, pull it open like that, and my thumb was laying on first Corinthians the 5th chapter, the 8th verse. Then something reads something like this. When you come, I was planning to take a fast to the Lord. I told him, I go out and fast. He said, when you come to the feast, which is a fast in the body, is a feast with the Lord. We know that. So when you come to this feast, don't come with the old leaven or leaven of malice and so forth, but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. That's exactly what he had told me in the vision. God is my solemn judge. Come with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. That is the word. Then I seen what he mean. So the scripture is 1 Corinthians 5:8. Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleaven bread of sincerity and truth. So, this is what I had in my heart to share with you. Praise God this tonight. That praise all that call upon him in truth. There are many people calling upon God, but there are different heart condition. That is why many of times the prayer even is not even answered because of that heart condition and the high and lofty one that dwell with him that of a contrite heart and a broken spirit. That is how God wants us tonight in all humility, surrendered, yielding to him, pouring out our souls to him, sharing with him what we need, have need of. So may the Lord bless you as they get on in prayer by God's grace. God be with you. Praise the Lord. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat.
