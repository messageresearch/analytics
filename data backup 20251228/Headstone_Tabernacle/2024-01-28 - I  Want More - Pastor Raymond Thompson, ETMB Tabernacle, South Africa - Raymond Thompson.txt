never be the same amen God bless you and welcome what an atmosphere this morning I one want to trade this for nothing in the world nothing in the world okay so I just want to read a scripture you don't have to stand this from Deuteronomy chapter 18 this is the prophecy concerning Jesus I will raise them up a prophet among their brethren like unto me and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not harken unto my words but he shall speak in my name I'll require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak in my name which I have not commanded him to speak Lord or that shall speak in the name of other gods Lord even that Prophet shall die and if thou see in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken ha not spoken come on now when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord had not spoken but the prophet had spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him God has a Vindicated Prophet that God sent in his last day his name is William Mari and BR Vindicated Prophet that the word out of his mouth came to pass that means God sent him and the words out of his mouth is Spirit given or Spirit spoken word which is the Original Seed when the fire came on the Mountain of God the people told God don't let don't get tell Moses don't let God speak you speak and God said okay I'm come down I'm going to speak to the prophet and that's why the word command shall not vibrate alone but every word which proceeded out of the mouth of God and God put the prophets as his mouthpiece so if you want to hear from God you have to hear from a prophet and a prophet the God's mouthpiece and God said behold I send you Elijah the prophet when praise God before the terrible day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so right now this morning you are sitting under a Vindicated message not a message to be Vindicated it's a Vindicated message by a Vindicated prophet he brought a Vindicated word to a bride who will be Vindicated oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God let's go now if God so loved the Jews and were his first chosen as a people he called the Jews out and they sowed and what they sow they had to reap what they sowed and were not expelled or were not immune from God's judgments all right when we disobey his commands that's right that goes for Nations or individuals or churches whatever it is do you understand that God is no respect to a persons he don't he's not respect to how long you're in the message he's not respecting how long you're in this Tabernacle he's not how long you're sitting on your Pew he doesn't who your husband is who your wife is who your father is whether if I is a pastor a Elder a deacon he doesn't study that he respects his word he told Adam the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die that's the God we talking about that's the God we are serving you shall surely die keep my word and live keep my word and be blessed oh give the Lord some Praises this is God we talking about Hallelujah when we disobey God we receive judgments for it God is just and can't do nothing else one of his characteristics is just being just he sees the Justice he can't help it it's part of his nature you have to seek the interest of the widows you have to seek the interest of the poor you have to seek the of the struggling oh give the Lord a shout that's the God we serve he is just his judgments are righteous Oh Glory to God when God bring judgment is because they deserve it he said I take no pleasure in the debt of the wicked but I am trusting to come to repentance he trusting to come to Mercy he said go come unto me and reason though your sins be as CET they shall be white as well let's negotiate Oh Praise let's discuss this thing you don't have to leave your burden you don't have to leave your heaven with sin you don't have to leave your heaven with amen all kind of pressure Oh Glory let let's negotiate though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as wool and what God make white is white what God make clean is clean you are clean by the word which is spoken unto you oh give the Lord some praises and the fire will come behind that to wash you clean and to make you whole praise God let's go now in the great time of sliding away all right and the falling away of the Jews God permitted a heathen Nation to come over and carry away the chosen D into captivity because they had not served the Lord with a full heart very beautiful picture of the day we living in yet we have been chosen and a selected people a blessed people above all the rest of the world but when we forget God's Commandments and cause the great drinking and rting and divorce and adultery and things we are putting up and making it absolutely legal in this nation God has got Nations that can come and take it anytime he wants to he is saying to America God have Nations that can come and take them into captivity you heard that commentator the other day that just left Russia they said they had 10,000 jet bombers that could never stop to fuel and loaded in the hangers with atomic bombs that could fly over America return back without even fueling each plane carrying at least eight or 10 Atomic hydrogen bombs that could put 150 people to this nation in total annihilation in one hour time and we wait in sin corruption forsaking the Lord doing things contar will laughing making fun of those who are trying to do right what else could we expect but a repeat of the kind of way into Babylon just right remember America is already judged they're just waiting for sentencing now God will not repent on this judgment to America the vision is fixed the vision cannot change oh give the Lord some Praises when brother Brandon saw that Vision he saw America all over with smokes and crater and destruction everywhere praise God before that happening watch the economy have to break also because they have to have a new world system a whole world new economy it has to be broken also oh give the Lord some Praises but listen to this now God sent God had a servant down there by the name of Daniel a young Prophet about 40 years old who was serving the Lord with all of his heart he call him a young Prophet so 40 is not that old and God had a work for him to do and in the kind of way of Babylon Oh Glory to I love that hallelujah praise God remember if God has a work for you to do all the demons out of Torment can't take you they just can't stackle you in any way God has got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the Devils of Hell will never be able to take it away God has a purpose for it it's will never be destroyed until God lets it fulfill the purpose that he ordained for it so even in Babylon Danel was blessed even in Babylon sh M was blessed I don't care the car in captivity you'll be blessed what God bless is blessed okay the Lord I shou in [Applause] the glory remember as Daniel went with the Hebrew children down in there I want you to notice many of them were worldly minded many of them didn't care while they just go with the tide of least resistance and isn't that about the church to picture today this may be shocking it's about a picture today oh God give us men like Daniel give us Christian like Sho who are willing to sacrifice watch that word sacrifice people don't want to sacrifice nothing they don't want to sacrifice sacrifice a meal they don't want to sacrifice nothing time praise God little time with God little God little God little God more time with God more of God they don't want to sacrifice no time to study no time to read the Bible no time to pray no time to dress right look right praise God praise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah pra we said long time already praise God don't go to a Babylon baraba get a right baraba to get your here praise God don't go some Jezebel sress get a right person to get your clothes pray go by the right people some of them Anointed with witchcraft some of Anointed with demons and devils and all kind of spirit praise God hallelujah and you notice when they wear the clothes out their Zach you want a boy with a normal pants good good wear pants on buttom day and he walking with a crawl all them had the same crawl it's a spirit upon them it make them act that way when they paint up the face the same thing they feel there's some I don't know who the latest Star they have right now but the makeup on the face and big earing and they scking their head smiling and smiling and smiling and and all the men suit them and whatnot I said the foolishness but sex Spirits upon them it's a spirit upon them making them dress that kind of way it's a spirit upon them want to walk the road sexy it's a spirit upon them want all them tattoo and they can hide the tattoo if the tattoo quite up by the ways have to get it just quite up by the ways to demonstrate a tattoo devil put the tattoo in there devil want to advertise the stuff oh glory to God but God going have a bride virtuous Sanctified clean washed in the blood of the Lamb oh give the Lord some [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praises serving you notice I'll be talking to some of you what we tolerate in times pass we're not going to tolerate No More and if you don't want to come back to the church that's all right also I repeat if you don't want to come back to the church that's okay also we are not preaching to those who not wanting to come back we preaching for those who in the church and they want God and they want to be in the church there are many other groups many other churches but this church will be governed by this word not by me by the word and we going to be led by the spirit oh give the Lord some praises this what I'm sharing with you is what I lay up on my heart to share before we put on a tape for you a special tape you going to be blessed with this morning from brother Raymond Thompson from South Africa so you be blessed this morning so get your get your CS ready amen praise the Lord so he said now oh notice Daniel went he went down to Babylon he know he was going among unbelievers the uncircumcised and when he went down there he knowed he would be entangled with them all right not because he wanted to but because the nation had fell and he had to go to captivity with them Daniel no fool I going captivity oh God I'm a Son of God you're going to captivity because God said so how much Saint you think you are how long you praying you for 30 years if God say the whole bunch go in captivity the whole bunch and Daniel went with them but Daniel was different sir and you have to be different and if you can't take pressure now I don't you're not with to last you're not to the last with de pressure that is yet to come it's yes I prophesy in this it's yes I believe in this it's yes I'm speaking this is that right brother Kang raise up his hand he's a witness yes this message you know precious pressure yes people born dead in the M there pressure no trial com because time is not yet there's a trial to come to church come to church early that that trial that gol you have to leave on time think about it now you got a fight which seat you get sit down on you're going a fight stay home sit your seat at home that's a fight nothing should fight you come into church every devil in hell trying to cut you off from hearing th say the Lord every devil in hell they don't want you hear this you're hearing songs every day Cals every day music every day in the Maxi in the taxi you're not hearing this every day it's Sunday 2 three hours a short time out of all your time there's not even a tenth of your time this not even a tight of your time this is a short time that you have you can't come so far and sleep in church you come so far to be awake put the toothpick and open your eye and stick it inside of there but keep your eye open wash your face stand up shout dance spin around do something clap make a little noise pin your ass or something but make sure you hear what God have to [Music] say see over with other churches pastors who talk like that I know I know I know I know that I'm aware of that but God help me Jesus he said what because the nation had fell and he had to go into captivity with them but God was with him as an alien I love that though it be an alien god is still with you and God I'm almost God is always prepares his people for events just before it happened May I stop here minute and say I believe that the people are in preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know I believe we are at the end you can speak to people you could put biligram in every city in United States they will drink whiskey smoke cigarettes laugh at you they are in the spirit of the last days now watch these words watch these last words now they are in the spirit of the last days and God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction Woo is a spirit thing then that's right that's why they have the gay agenda to bring on full blood full F Sodom and gomorra that's why the spirit of sodomy and the spirit of perversion sexual perversion is so preeminent because one of the cursed sins is adultery and fornication got that is sinning against your temple he said know you not you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost every sin is done without but that is with him so God sees it a certain way what you think God judging Rome for a fornications and adulteries all right let's go they are in the spirit of the last days and God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction God never did never destroyed anything man always destroy himself all right two more and we finish notice let's get back to Cain again let's get some faith in the beginning watch it now those Spirits as they begin to move it's the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow the people have to be in this kind of a spirit to bring the latter days the people in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time yes they got Atomic weapons and hydrogen all kind of things because it's the spirit of the day the people are in the spirit of the end time the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit and the world is running out yonder making fun scuffing laughing and they are living like the devil every day it's the spirit of the thing so friends the foolish virgins they were good they were clean they were Sanctified they were not living contrary or or filthy but they wasn't have a burden for extra extra oil am is extra that you do the extra prayer the extra cry the extra sigh the extra burden you have to fight loudes here you have to fight the spirit of the age which is slothfulness laziness have need of nothing you have to actually fight that you know I'm going to leave here now I'm finished the quotes but bandam had a vision when he was young vision of Hell or S to hell and he saw when he came he saw woman with the mascara on and the makeup and so on when he came back years later years later he saw somebody with it and he couldn't believe it and then he said hell is on the earth yes so this mascara and all this makeup and all this thing that coming is not coming from Earthly you that coming from a spirit level that comes up from the earth and anoint people give them the wisdom long time the material they have for clut for wom didn't have that long time that kind of J like material that fit their form and shape somebody get inspired that's right understand and technology has become inspired and don't know maybe next week I preach but they have reached now where they reach with artificial intelligence that's right which is the final frontier of man this is man becoming like God because the total sum of all knowledge now is encapsulated in a m AI artificial intelligence and the bride will have the intelligence of Jesus Christ you have no other way to fight this thing but with the intelligence of God and the prophet prophec side The Pride will have the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word the mind of Christ is not pressing the tape and saying play the mind of Christ is to know exactly present tense Angels coming down to give Supernatural instructions and guidance Oh Glory to God every service you come here should be a super Supernatural experience every service you come here should be you under great expectation you should never come to church without unexp expectation for your children for your family for your finances for your business for your loved ones for your spirit for your heart for your mind for your soul you should come here knowing that this is the day for you to go free this is the day for the band of sin to be broken off for you you don't have to live in sin stay in sin you could be delivered completely out of sin to love the Lord with all your heart mind soul Oh Glory to God I'm almost done something is lingering Hallelujah I'm being lingered here this morning understand this hell he said the lid of Hell have been uncovered and streams of demon power coming up how you fighting that how you fighting streams of demon powers as a human being you can't so for God to defeat that he had to send another power to get you what are you saying about over I'm telling you you in your human strength in your intellectual mind cannot find fight the demon powers is upon this Earth you need God's power you need God's presence you need more of him you got to recognize that your head your intellect your degree your doctorate your Masters can't work Oh Glory this is a supernatural being that devil Lucifer oh god oh glory to God he had over 6,000 years to perfect his [Applause] acts how about to wrap up nine into the tree but Bram saw a car like an egg that time had four big old truck big old engine this CES which is the we had the computer all display of all the latest technology is a company can't name of the company now has almost an exact thing the chairs in the vehicle face one another just said the profit saw it so they're not sitting down behind each other they're sitting facing each other because there's no need for steering there's no staring a app calls the vehicle you say where you want to go you step into it and it takes you there this is for the city now City driving so there's no need for traffic and whatnot you just call the app you call it call it call it a taxi and it comes to you and you steping people and they using it already it is amazing it

here but it's a place where brother man says we come to be right with God we come to fix up with God whatever is wrong in our lives we want God to fix it it's a new year 2024 so we see the signs of the coming of the Lord all around us we see the world falling apart we see Wars not rumors anymore we see Wars and the time is so so far spent we need to be right with God so we going to have a special prayer line after this but before we can pray we need to be dedicated we need to say Lord while the word is preached I'm dedicating myself I'm getting right I'm fixing up I'm not just sitting here and and going back and say it was a good service and nothing happens in my life brother B says every service you come to you go out better or worse and I've seen so many people go out worse wor until they don't even come back to church anymore we seen young girls sit in the benches hear the word of God walk right out and still go do their own thing and live in the world brother B says it comes a time where you cross the line and you can't come back so don't do that because we're living in such a serious time that you can't play around with the Lord anymore you can't take your chances anymore that time is pass even the married people we can't play around anymore why because the day of the Lord is upon us so we just pray that during this time that we listen uh deacons please keep the children from moving their parents also keep them and let us have a real dedication and a real consecrated service today and we believe that by the time we call the prayer line that God is going to do something for us who came for God to do something for them who came hungry who came thirsty thirsty who came wanting God bless you man so I got a special that I want brother Emil to sing and I

everyone feels that way you want more praise God let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your great grace Upon Our Lives we thank you for keeping us we thank you for the love that has shed abroad in our hearts we thank you that through so many dangers toils and snares we've come and Lord you carried us through you've never taken away their desire to serve you and Lord yeah we find ourselves in the house of God and we want more Lord we're not just satisfied with the blessing we want the blesser hallu we're not just satisfied with the gift we want the giver Lord we're not just satisfied with a little Lord uh just a a little common thing we want we want to that inexhaustible Fountain Lord to pour out his blessing upon our lives and fill us Lord fill our cups till it runs over oh god father that's what we need and that's why we are here 2024 Lord we want more Lord that's what we're looking for take us to another level God where we've never been before the days are shortened the days are evil and without more of you Lord there's no way we're going to make it Lord on our own strength and our own knowledge and how long in the message it doesn't matter a thing lord it's knowing you in the power of your Resurrection it's been born again out by the spirit and the word of God so Lord while the simple message I preached this morning may someone be touched our young people our elderly people our babies our children Lord we claim them all as we commit the service into your hands and we pray you come take glory and may you BL the prayer line and people will be sincere and while the word has been preached they'll confess their wrong before they even come in the prayer line that's what the prophet taught us confess your wrong make it right before you even come in the prayer line so Lord may they do that Lord while your word is been preached and your Prophet taught us too that the word cast out demons so may it be so Lord that the anointing will break every yoke of the enemy take me out of the way may we see Jesus Christ Lord and we won't forget to give you all the honor the praise and the glory in Jesus name we ask it and the church shall say amen amen if you have your Bibles we in the Book of Matthew just two short scriptures Matthew 5 and then Matthew 13 if you have it just say Amen am uh Matthew 5 and and verse 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst of the righteousness for they shall be filled amen amen and then Matthew 13:45 and verse 46 some of the the holy spirit said preach it from this scripture which we is very seldom read and yet is so striking if you have it amen amen he says again uh Jesus speaking of The Parables here again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pears when he had found one pear of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated thanks so again what a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and there's some somehow Echo David on the speakers here and uh we looking forward for a blessing now the the pastor or the preacher don't have Revival the people brings the Revival so uh I believe you're going to sit there and uh preach with me and I'm going to try and talk today Lord help me amen so uh just to start off he says here in in expectation amen it says how many in years are believers in Divine Healing amen let's see your hands the power of God thank you look before there can be a creation there has to be a Creator to create that creation is that right well as long as you hungering for Divine Healing and the power of God there's got to be a fountain open somewhere so before you can hunger for that that's why I read that scripture there must be a fountain open somewhere before you could had that hunger the fountain was open he says yeah uh is that right is is is he says if there isn't healing you wouldn't have that in your heart the creator has to create that in your heart before you can even think of such a thing the process Hallelujah then you want more of God this is more or less where I got my uh my inspiration for the quote he says and if that is so he says then you want more of God cuz why there's something in you crying out but before you could cry out for more there had to be more amen isn't that beautiful it says then you want more of God you Hunger for More Of God and because that you do Hunger is very fine listen and because you that you hunger is a very fine evidence that there is some more of God to receive wow isn't that beautiful so before you could hunger he says that's a evidence that there is more of God to receive so if you came for more this morning then remember there's going to be more hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God and if you crave for Divine Healing that shows that there is a fountain of Divine Healing somewhere that creation wouldn't be in your heart so that's why I say it depends how you came to church this morning hungry you came thirst and you want more of God well there had to be a fountain oh my goodness BR the song you sing I want more before there had to be more there had to be a fountain to get more amen Divine Healing somewhere that the creation wouldn't be in your it says uh for Divine Healing that shows that there is a fountain of div Divine Healing somewhere or that creation wouldn't be in your heart you get what I mean so it wouldn't be there and that's why we're here so it's a deep calling to a deep he says before there was a f on a fish back there had to be water for him to swim in before a tree could grow on the earth there had to be a Earth first so before you could hunger for healing there had to be a Healer first before you wanted a savior that you a sinner there had to be a savior first so before you could want more there had to be more [Applause] first my I see you spiritual so you got the message amen so he says here uh he cares for you now he says and Jesus so graciously taught us in the man buying pearls and he found the one great price and he sold all others to get it all the truths and everything that he had now watch he's he's making it he says truth so in other words this was a spiritual man so he had to let go of all that he knew so I hope you you CAU that n so it's not so much a natural things that he had but it was spiritual things and what he grew up with and who was his Pastor before and what he was taught and what church he had to let go of that Hallelujah he had to let go of that to and okay he says and he found the one great price he sold all the others that to get it all the truths and everything that he had though they were good BS this meant he says but this one meant all to him and when you find God's ultimate word watch a promise Upon A Certain thing you must know first that is God's word that the things that you've seen been done in God he says there there is no no no maybe so it could be so it looks like it might be so he says it is God then when you get to that spot that's when the P of great price must get away and you have to get away from everything so this is not a maybe so or a so so or I think so no this is the pearl of great price who is the pearl of great price Jesus Christ so you sell everything to get the pearl of great price you let go of the world you let go of your friends you let go of your family you let go why because you found Christ Christ is the PE of great price and you sell out brother it doesn't matter you let go no matter how precious it seems you had to leave church friends you had to leave your family but when you get Christ that means nothing because now you got everything hey come on once you have Christ you have [Applause] everything now when I drink more water you must keep the amens going okay so we don't want we don't want the anointing to drop and then I must build up just keep when I take water you say come you keep going out amen so that man that when he found the ultimate one he says then he says you might be it is God then you get to that spot that you know that the pearl of great price you get away from anything else and that's what we all did we were all in different denominations but when we found this message Hallelujah brother we found the pearl of great price he didn't care who said what he didn't care what the minister said when we found the pill and remember the message is Christ this message reveals Jesus [Applause] Christ Hallelujah my feel anointing here he says here and then anything is right he says price you must get away from everything that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must he says you get away so you get away from the ch ch ch ch and this one is doing that that one said that you get away hey I don't want to M my experience with Christ I got the pearl of great price and I don't want to lose it I don't want to lose it brother Frank so no matter who says what what who's doing what I don't want to hear that I got the pear of great price and I want to cherish it amen hallelujah you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what God has said and what he promised and see him do it and that's your ultimate right there and then everything that you are everything that you was everything that you hope to be must be placed upon that and just as though it was death and life to you at that moment so this P of great price is so great it's between it's between life and death it's more than your food it's more than your job it's more than your house it's more than your car it's more than your money it's more than listen it's more than anything you can gain because all that remains behind but Christ will be forever brother when there's no more Moon and there's no more stars Christ will still be there the pearl of great price will still be there brother when everything fails he will still be there so make sure you have him this morning young people make sure your experience is not intellectual but it's heart heartfelt a heartfelt experience because they can brainwash you but they can't heart wash [Applause] you my hallu so he sold all he had to buy The Spill and wanted more he says so I wrote you he wanted more though he had it but he wanted more he knew there's something more and you know there's something more this morning more than the experience you got you know there's something more and sometimes we can be years in the message and didn't have a real experience but I'm telling you as the day comes along you're going to have a real experience if you hunger and thirst wow so we so all you wanted more this p is one of the kind it is priceless listen it's Priceless Christ is priceless and order to get the rid of all of the other things in life to obtain this pear of great price and brother s Christ must by one Spirit we are all baptized into this body born of his Spirit then we belong to a kingdom and our lives are not Americans and we are not Germans and I want to say we're not cets we are not uh Africans we are not whites we are not indians we are not caas we are not they listen brother says we are Christians hallelujah amen can I say that again we are Christians we come from God and we going back to God no matter what color this body is God is not even going to ask you what color you were he's going to ask you about his word so we are not listen man we are not Germans we are not Americans we are Christians [Applause] Hallelujah it says we are settled and walk in the spirit a love slave from the things of the world and our rights to the world we sold out and bought the pearl of great price and walk and let in the Holy Spirit manifest itself that's what is real his church is that's what you are and what I am and if we let ourselves go and serve God so let us go and go serve God why we are Christians we come from God and going back to God so The Thirst in your heart God put you there because there is brother says he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and we haven't even finished it yo so that mean uh the cor said this is like heaven to me now if this is like heaven what's Heaven going to be like come on

know when Ruth and orpa and Naomi came together her sons had died and they were married to Naomi's sons and she said no I'm going back to the Homeland she was out to the Homeland so she went back and she said listen man I'm too old to Bear Sons we why don't you go back go to your gods and to your cities and go back to where you come from go back to your churches and everything so the Bible says and Ora kissed the mother in-law but Ruth cleave unto her now watch there there was something in Ruth that wanted more she seen something in the Mother-in-law that they didn't have in Moab so she she wanted more oh God I I want more I wish I was a singer man I I want more so so so so Ora kissed and left and went back to her Gods like many is doing now they leaving the message going back to their gods but that's fine there's a Ruth somewhere hallelujah praise God and Ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto a Gods return Thou after thy sister unto thy gods and turn after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee Hallelujah now why would Ruth say that if she didn't want more she seen something that she didn't have or that she didn't see Moab or that her Gods didn't have she saw Naomi had it entreat me not to leave thee or to return from falling after thee for for whether thou goest I will go whether thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people will be my people thy God will be my God where dest I will die there will be buried and the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death about thee and me so in other words I the way you worship I'm going to worship the way you serve God I'm going to serve God the way you shout I'm going to shout hallelujah they don't want noisy Church but the first church was a noisy church and every church that comes behind must be a noisy Church where Jesus is there's always a noise why Jesus is [Applause] here my hallelujah hallelujah you going to hear this quote now he says you're in Kingsman Redeemer now notice closely now when Ruth said Naomi said to Ruth said now he is our Kinsman and if you can find Grace So eventually she went back and then they begin to glean in Boaz field and boas was the lord of the Harvest and when he came riding on his horse and he spotted as they were gleaning there he spotted Ruth and he wanted to know who's this girl Ruth was a gentile Bo was the lord of the Harvest I hope you got a revelation she was a gentile he was a Jew but when he saw her he told the Reapers don't let she glean in any other field let she stay in my field you can't glean all over brother you're going to get confused you got to stay in boaz's Harvest stay in his land cleaning his field that's where your blessing is going to come now you find people that we say run from church to church then in this church they so confused they don't know what's going on but brother when you stay in the same Harvest he said make sure she stay and you know what he said listen you you you Reapers don't make it so hard for her purposely drop some B for her so it won't be so hard for her to clean God don't you feel the blessing the angels are dropping special B special blessings anointings Powers the presence of God he's dropping it purposely my so he said now he's our Kinsman and if you can find Grace with him you'll find rest oh my if you can find Grace you'll find rest poet represented Christ the rich man oh my goodness you see the only one that could redeem Naomi had to be a rich guy and he had to be family of Ruth so her father and boas was brothers so when they came back listen he said man when he spotted Ruth he says if I redeem Naomi I'm going to get Ruth Naomi rep the represented the Jewish church but Ruth repres presented the Gentile bride woo hallelujah oh brother may you spiritual today man I see the Revelation going right all over you amen and boas came riding there in that Carriage looking around over the fields and his eyes fell on Ruth he was Master he was Lord of the Harvest and she found Grace in his sight now watch not not she found Grace in BO sight not the other way around so it's not our good works it's not who we are and what we can do we found Grace in the sight of Jesus Christ he chose us before the foundation of the world your name was put on the book of life before the foundation of the world [Applause] and it says b was a type of Christ he says consecrated themselves to his servant God I believe every word of it when your word says anything I stay right with it that's your word I believe it every word that's what he's looking for and the lord of the Harvest that's what he wants to give the Holy Spirit to those who are hungering and thirsting blessed are they that hung and thirst for they shall be fullish trying to find a church today that will find Grace in so we want to find Grace in his sight so I'm not yet for more popularity I didn't come to see who's dressed how and what have you got on what labels you what are you wearing no brother that's if you came that way you wasted your money you wasted your time you might as well have stayed at home but if you came hungry and you came thirsty and you say Lord I want more of the and I tell you right now if you did come that way change your mind right now while the Holy Spirit is here change your mind and say God I want more I want more because there is more my and because she wanted more she got Bo as the lord of the Harvest and the bride gets Christ Our kinsman redeemer brother B says one preacher says you know what she didn't only was a servant cleaning but she owned the Harvest because she married Bo I'm telling you you're not only going to get a blessing you're going to own this thing brother you're going to own the Holy Spirit you're going to own the promised land you're going to own what belongs to you brother why because you're married to Christ come on young people man get away from the world you think you can keep complain in the world mess around with this boy mess around with that boy listen God hates that man he hates fornication get right with God before it's too late my we go to another lady her name is Hannah 1st Samuel 1:20 Hannah was parent and panina was the first wife and she would mock her because she was Barren but Hannah she wanted more oh I hope you see this no matter what the critics said and what they barking and saying this here and saying that there she let the dogs bark she said I want more because God is not looking to what I say he's looking to my heart hey come on now and she wanted more on Hannah and she prayed with such desperation until the priest thought she was drunk and B says one place she came in the church she didn't look at the clothes and how the people she came with desperation she didn't care who sat next to her she would scream out and cry and pray and scream because she wanted more from God she needed a reproach to be taken away so she wanted more and brother can you imagine she prayed so much until the priest thought she's drunk now how desperate was that woman but the reason she did that Bros she wanted more and she knew if God could give Sarah a baby at the old age God can give me a baby at the old age hallelujah hallelujah so he says you're in desperation Hannah a baron woman in the Bible she wanted a son and she got to fasting for him and she fasted and prayed until even the priest thought that she was drunk she was in such desperation uh with the rest of the woman watching what kind of a bonnet the other one had more and knowing how it goes and the other one seeing what kind of clothes they had on and talking about things that's going on on the farm or in the church let us say but not Hannah she stepped right through the whole crowd and went to the altar so you don't listen to the ch ch ch this one is God to say did you see this did you see that why is

you know whatever you give to God is going to give you double sure whatever you give he's going to give you back double don't you want double yesterday I want whatever is got brother Emory we are Sons and Daughters the whole inheritance belongs to us and our children belongs to us let them go and party and do their thing they don't know the holy spirit's on their track protecting them all the time watching over them there's a mother's prayer a Father's prayer following them Hallelujah but one day God is going to turn them around they'll be running to the altar to repent brother and give their lives why because God is going to give us extra this token works it works Hallelujah it works brother how many mothers pray for the children that's here those mothers are gone on but look at them here

we're not concerned about you we concerned but you know what we rebuking that devil that's got you bound it's a spirit it's only a spirit that's got you bound and you feel a little later a little later a little later one day he's going to say enough Hallelujah then the extras kick in hey hallelujah oh Hallelujah and the spirit that's in me is one with me and I'll speak the word for you and you're going to come child you're going to come daughter you're going to come brother amen son you see so when you ask more God gives you more we look at Jacob in Genesis 32 Jacob wanted more from the angel and he could not make it if this Angel didn't bless him Hallelujah so we know how he sent over everything all his money his wives his concubines his C and and and his brother Kan I mean uh Esau was still upset and wanted to kill him because he stole the birthright but you're going to see something that that that made Jacob special even though he was a Shyer something in his heart was right with a word his life wasn't but his heart was right with the word or there was a seed in him and you don't even know there's a seed in you and you running this way and you in that way and you don't want to give your life to Christ but listen one day the holy spirit is going to come and he's going to track you down so he says something more to meet the challenge because he realized he sent everything nothing we need to get alone with God and when he was alone with God tell him you need more you're not going to make it without getting more so no matter what he did no matter what he sent over it didn't stop the WTH and the judgments but you see God wanted to get him alone and that's our problem we too much in a click and a group and in this click and we don't talk to that we don't and that's your problem that's why God can't move God can't deal because we form Clicks in the church young people you don't do that you must be able to speak to everyone in this church fellowship with everyone there's people you don't even know their names there's people that come and visit that's why I I I asked the deacons what's the names because I want people to feel welcome but we run to our click and we just with our click and we forget these people visitors that come we leave them they need to be talking they need to feel welcome and what I want to tell you from me I like you mothers and you visitors I'm glad to see you when you're walking and I mention your name because I want you to feel welcome this is a church built on brotherly kindness not on scandalism and not on one side this and one no it's built on brotherly kindness even even if we don't have one Miracle but we have love for one another oh this one comes fresh man how can you say you love God but you didn't see him he said if you love me love my [Applause] children [Applause] my the Bible say you say you love God did you see God who saw God but we see his children now he said if you love me love my children so when I love you I'm loving God don't say oh Lord I love you and I treat my his children like nonsense like rubbish they don't even exist because I feel I'm higher than you and I'm more important you are nothing man I am nothing we all on the same level that's where we are that's where we are we on the same level brother k no one is Big me and small you we all the same whether you 30 years in the message whether you two days in the message we are the same Hallelujah and in this church there's no aparted here we are all the same amen we all the same we believe the same we stand the same Hallelujah man that's how it ought to be I love you my brother I love you my sister man no colard no Africans I don't see that where do I see that I see you as my brother I don't care where you come from and you old people you know me you know [Applause] me you know what I got a brown suit on today those who know me you know who I am and I got this year I'm not playing games with nobody I don't want any clannishness I don't want any among the children talks and stories and I don't speak to that one and I'm more higher there's no one Higher there's no one more important we're all the same we all need God all of us need God you see I can speak to anyone in this church did you see may do that anyone I'm friends with I don't have a special click I'm [Music] with so where did that come from Hallelujah God help us man I'm saying that because we want more and those type of spirits cut off the spirit of God so with anointing upon me I'm cutting off that Spirit chopping it off brother Ben says becomes a cancer in the church so cut it out before it be becomes a can as a whole church so you see sometime God wants you alone so he gets you away from those friends he wants you alone he can't deal with you because you were that click now God give you re but you must first bounce it off this one and hear what this one brother God is dealing with you as an individual it's not group Revelation it's an individual [Applause] Revelation okay in the church ages he says it's a word or receit that is way back there uh too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 9:13 and neither was born neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed BL and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed yes you see why you are brought back because you alone are seed the you know I thought the whole world will Embrace this but they didn't only the seed can come back only the seed so you're not even the seed it's a seed of God in you and he's calling that seed oh prci God hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so only that seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why you had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age oh my so you see because you see it you will receive it amen you're not going to be lost you can't go lost your name is there and there's a seed in you now watch so I said he needed more but here he says in the first seal and then there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written in at all that's right and I believe what the prophet now that through these seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith now listen because what we got now wouldn't be able to do it so you mean brother Raymond we need more to make it for the Rapture hey I hope you see that what we got now we can't do it we need a Rapture in faith yes so you mean brother I want more because what I got now I can't even have faith for healing but I need faith for this body to be changed so those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for Rapture in faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there is something oh my goodness we got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment to we swep out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while where it is written so you mean brother Raymond what I have now I can't make it but listen those seven Thunders will be here in order to give you Rapture in faith you say I don't have it now I don't have it too but I know it's going to be here and when it's here it's going to change your body woo Hallelujah where's the scientist now they can't explain it but you know there will be a faith that will come on the earth amen hallelujah brother George that's going to change the bodies okay this is where I really also got inspiration and this is a double portion he says Elijah and Elisha and Elisha followed him all the way from gilgal then he says is the Lord sent me to bethl and he says stay behind he says no as my soul liveth in yours I'm not leaving you what did Elisha do that for he knew there's more woo Hallelujah and remember when Elijah got him he just took off the mantle and threw it over Elisha and Elisha felt that anointing he chopped up the ox he chopped up the car and the brother says he gave it to the poor to eat but he says as your soul liveth than my soul I'm not leaving you they went from gilgal to bethl from bethl to Jericho then they got the sons of the school of the prophets and he said no listen man you better stay here he has all your [Music] bodes he said I'm not leaving you he says well the Lord sent me to Jordan now that's where many people fall off because Jordan means dying out you can't come in here with your ideas this must be done that way this must be done that way why isn't hey come on you got to die out to your thoughts brother M say you don't even have a thought coming he says it must be the word and then he went to Jordan now watch he knew there's more brother Malcolm he knew there's more why would this man follow this man he felt the anointing didn't you feel the anointing when you came in this message something changed your heart you said I'm not going back I'm not a Lutheran anymore I'm not a Pentecostal anymore I'm going to follow this message this message I felt the anointing and I'm not going to leave this message because it's taking me somewhere where I want more Elisha said I'm not leaving you I want more don't you want more this morning well keep following the message there's a promise of a seven funder Revival my Elisha and Elisha he said now when they got down to the Jordan time to cross over he made a way and when the cross over the stage of the Holy Ghost Church said now I want to ask you something what do you want what do you want this morning I'm asking you the question what do you want what do you want in the church this morning young people what do you want I want to see you show it you're not showing it to me show it to him what do you want this morning mother you're in the church you heard the message what do you want someone more degrees that's good someone more money so it depends what do you want I want a better job a better house a better car that's fine what do you want what's speaking from [Applause] here so Elijah ask him what do you want and he said a double portion of your spirit to come upon me that's the way to ask don't be scared ask for a whole lot Jesus said you have not because you believe not and you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your Joys may be full and a whole lot God just don't make a little B better he make me all the way well don't just let me have enough religion to make myself miserable kill me out sin the sin that I can live for Christ that's it don't make me so I can step back and maybe bow my head once in a while now listen to this quote the people that don't want to worship listen make me so I can shout make me so I can open my mouth and sing and scream the Praises of God give me the whole thing Lord let me have the baptism Kill Me Out to the things of the world where the people around me and I won't go to church let me and I will go to church to let me worship you that's right so he says scream holler worship Him brother that's why you come you want more scream and worship Him worship brings him down he dwells in the Praises of his [Applause] people now this is the new uh International Version instead of your shame you will receive a double portion this is Isaiah 61:7 instead of your shame you will receive a double portion instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance and so will you inherit a double portion in your land and every every Everlasting Joy will be yours Hallelujah so don't let no one talk you out of this Everlasting Joy will be yours remember when he said except he eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he said uh uh you cannot live and then 70 of the ministers walked away then 70 walked away and left him and he asked the 12 don't you also want to go now watch Peter he knew there's more he knew there's more and he said he said Peter said he said uh he said y the 12 don't you also want to go Peter knew Christ had more he said where shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life where can we go brother we can't leave this message there's nothing more there's nothing better than this you can only go back and that's back to Pentecost but going forward what do you have better than the message so stay with the message man there's more then I don't know what this translation is MSC it's it's in John 6 the same verse he says yeah Peter replied Master to whom we go you have the words of real life eternal life we've already committed ourselves confident that you are the Holy One of God hallelujah okay so I'm winding up quickly so there's the five wise virgins Matthew 25 he says then all the virgins arose remember it says behold the bridegroom cometh and all the virgins arose and they thr the lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out out now watch here the this is the foolish virgin but the wise virgin they knew they needed more yes yes a revelation yeah please don't miss it I'm busy closing they knew there was more so they didn't just go with a regular they took extra oil the musicians you can come he says here now he says here in questions and answers this is in COD if you got the old book page 50 now they had extra oil so when they woke up now the the foolish version said hey we don't have oil can you give us so he said no I'm sorry go to them that buy but it was too late now I always make this example the Five Wives wasn't here one side and the five foolish so you could say oh they foolish no they were intermingled you didn't know who they were they were in the same church in the same message in the same you know what I'm saying so you couldn't but the wedding supper exposed so if you want oil you better take oil don't say no I didn't come for nothing to church I came for something watch what she said then the pro John question answers there's your five wives now watch what he says who had oil in their lamps rapturing Faith you mean brother Raymond the extra oil that was more is rapturing in faith now what gives you rapturing Faith th the seven Thunders so you mean what they had extra on them was Rapture in faith come on now brother sister if you want to wake it make it for the wedding supper make sure you got the Rapture in faith make sure you got the seven funders they don't want to preach it they don't want it but brother in this church we want the seven funders because here the prophet says that was the extra oil that is what they had more more than the foolish virgins head come on brother let's believe those seven Thunders it will change your body it will take you in the Rapture it will take you to the wedding supper it will take you to the Eternal [Applause] [Music] City [Music] my the prophet was so worried about and there was so much but we leave it brother George and and I'm just going to take this one instant he this voice that spoke to him all the years and he wanted to know who it is and what it is and he couldn't understand this Supernatural that spoke to him so he he told his wife listen I'm packing a bag he says a certain place there's a money if I don't come back use that money to raise your children so if I don't come back use that that's for you take care raise them up but I must find out he knew there's more he knew this voice is spoke to me to find out what it is oh brother Kevin yeah he goes to his cabin his cave and he's praying Lord what is all this about why am I in the message why do I believe like I believe why why do I feel the way I feel over this message and I see others don't and brother bam was concerned oh brother and can you imagine the desperation it's dark in the cave he's praying he's crying he he made sure he left his family you see what it is sometimes you have to separate God got him alone and when he was alone and praying and screaming and all of a sudden while he's praying he looks on the floor and there's a pillar of fire circling circling like that and as he looks he says and into that fire steps an angel and he stands there folded arms brother say over 6' tall he head to his shoulder a gown on and he said fear not I'm sent from the presence of God God to let you know your mysterious life is for a purpose that God has a Ministry for you to take a cross around the world why he knew this more I'm going to close with Samson I want us to stand Samson knew that he had failed God they pierc out his eyes and brother says that was a sign of the Prophet cuz the prophet is a sear he says but only the intelligence was left above the eyes tongues was Pentecost here was prophet and then here was Intelligence and they cut his hair off now watch how smart is God he blinded those Phil Ines not to see that his hair was growing again that's why God says I will restore the enemy eat that tree tree of life right down to a stump but God said don't worry I'm going to restore and then Luther came and then Wesley came and Pentecost and then Malachi 4 but now we're right back hey come on brother and Samson stood there and B says he kept feeling it's not there and he go another few years and he kept feeling it's not there but he knew it's coming and I hope you know that it's coming brother there's no blessing I was just speaking to brother car and I said you know what brother car there's no more Revival left that's why people is falling away but there's one Revival and that's a seven Thunder Revival nothing else is Promised but that Revival the 144 will have their Revival so I'm not interested in 144 Jews I want to know about the Gentile Revival and that's a seven Thunder Revival that's a promise brother so you

and all his enemies was making fun and they were screaming and he says lead me to the two pillar where this Temple is built upon and brother B say there he stood and he prayed the right prayer Lord let me die with my enemies and you know what's your enemy this morning it might be pornography it might be lust it might be Pride it might be jealousy it might be I don't care what it is but put your

that Seven Locks is there I must hear his prayer brother I want to tell you this morning God is looking for those seven Thunders to thunder out in our lives in Holiness sweetness pess it's a life

ago for my healing and the discomfort I was feeling I continued believing for the healing cuz I know God promised healing as a daughter of God and he's going to perfect that which concerneth me on Wednesday night brother Gideon said in the service how we ought to love God and Obey him in and in doing so there are benefits I believe that and after the service my husband and I was were fellowshipping on the word of God and I started to feel sleepy but something happened I looked at my foot and turned my head I heard like a voice said look at your foot I looked and turned my head
