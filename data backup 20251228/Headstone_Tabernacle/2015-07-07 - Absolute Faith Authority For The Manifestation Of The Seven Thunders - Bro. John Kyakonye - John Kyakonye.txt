of the church is with the church in an Switzerland Mar and a part in Martin so we are part of the Revival we are a part of you I hope you are part of us and one day we are we are departing from yes this is my vision so we love us we love you from from all our heart the ministry is in but I want to say something I want that uh when I leave the puppet in a few minutes some something uh rest in your heart uh I love the Ministries here from all my heart and we are often hearing what it's preaching from this and transl translating them in French so we are not I am not here only because I love those Ministry I am here because a vision because a great vision the lord gave us and it come to a point where the same vision is here too the vision that is to it's also in France in also in Switzerland we are here because of the same vision do you understand I love them I I love them for all from all my heart but the most important thing is the vision do you believe that so I I want just read before you if you want if you want to take your Bible we go to Matthew Chapter 2 first and second [Music] verse now after J after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold wise men from the East came to Jerusalem saying where is the where is he who has been born King of the Jews for we have seen his we have seen his in East and have come to worship Him amen amen amen you may be seated God bless the reading of the word so I I I have thought men of vision amen what it's important today what our strength today what is our power today is a vision and every one of us must have the vision I don't speak about each man each Vision each man a vision I have a vision you have another Vision this one have another Vision I don't speak about I speak about the VIS now there is a difference between Revelation and vision Revelation is something that is here yeah here something that is here but you need a revelation to see it but the thing is here but you need a revelation from God vision is different vision is something that is coming something that is not here yet but you need something from God to see it and you must see it before he comes there is a great difference between Revelation and vision the time of the Revelation is beginning a long time now we come to the time of vision to let the word of God the promis go of God be accomplished be manifested amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ we have we need to have vision and there is only one Vision there is not so many Vision that's the problem with the message so many vision but God sent men men with a vision do you understand this is very important I hope you this is uh sealed in your heart until the coming of the Lord hallelujah amen I speak no we don't have personal Vision the vision the vision we receive is from the word of the lord it's not personal Vision so the three wise men had vision and you know they all sees the same vision brother spoke about the three stars we was above Bethlehem 2,000 years ago and now they produce the same three stars on June and the men saw them Hallelujah and the three wise men because this is this this is a great sign for us in the last months in the last year many things signs many signs come come above the the the Earth and many signs are above the people to see that the coming of the Lord is at end very close Hallelujah so three wise men came from West from east from North from South like us today with the same vision Hallelujah they you that the the vision leads them to a certain place do you know that do you know what it's important to leave with a vision yes amen hallelujah Glory we have seen his star we have seen they saw they they said we have seen his star and We Came To Worship Him that's the true worship true adoration Hallelujah

7,000 there [Applause] 7,000 that never bow need blessed be the name of the Lord we got the vision hallelujah hallelujah that the seven Thunders the seven voices the seven Mysteries is not a man God's voice for our day blessed be the name of the Lord and that the fivefold ministry does not rep Mal but the fivefold ministry ech back what maless be the name of the Lord when God took the prophet the word remain when God took Brotherman the word remain blessed be the name of the Lord and we are here hungering and fasting to see a manif what blessed be the name of the Lord so without wasting time let's just go in the Bible so God takes his man but he does not take his spirit so where is the Lord God of Elijah we want the god of Elijah Elijah came and went that's right but we want the god of elij bless be the name of the Lord so Mark chapter 9 so I really appreciate you very much brother thank you for the opportunity and all the Brethren may the Lord bless you mightly so let's go to Mark 9 verse 23 Mark 9 verse 23 and the and James chapter 1 Mark 9 ver 23k just one scripture there Mark chapter 9 verse 23 it says here Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth Jesus all things are possible to him that believeth and then James chapter 1 James chapter 1 verse 5 to verse 8 says here if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that give to all men liberary and up braids not and it shall be given him verse five but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and to for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in his ways may the Lord add his Blessing on the reading of the word just a little word of prayer loving master I'm entirely and completely depending on you father because this is your word and Lord give me the utterance forgive me and forgive us where we are family Lord Lord our faith is in your blood and in your word Lord father help us speak to us Lord open our understanding father and Lord this conversion let it be a great blessing to your children and let it start that manifestation of the seven and Promises that we have been we have been believing and waiting for for a long time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we amen amen so God bless you you can be seting so I have a little Title Here uh my title is the absolute Faith Authority for the manifestation of the seven Thunders yes the absolute Faith Authority for the seven Thunder manifestation and my inspiration is that fear is the greatest robber of our blessings blessed be the name of the Lord so what can we say about brother's testimony yesterday brother God bless you surely love produces faith that was wonderful and what can we say about brother zigma brother zma God bless you for that testimony about the Holy Ghost experience and surely that's what we need not to be scholarly believers who who are dead for and brother bam said when you are born again he said you will never be satisfied with Creeds and doctrines you will always thirst for the Supernatural That's why we are crying out for a manifestation of the seven blessed be the name of the Lord and brother Z thank you for the vision sure we have a vision bless be the name of the Lord now I have a little quotation here um it is from the message um um possessing the gates of the enemy after trium brother bam was preaching about organizations and he said he told us how that the organization religious organizations actually followed those great spiritual men men like no men like Billy men like Luther Wesley men like M they never started those organizations but those organization followed them after they died the people that remain behind cut their ways into what those men preached they said this and said that cut away this and added this and very soon they ended up with an organization but then brother bam says but the real spiritual minded people the real humble people who had the mind of Christ he said they never looked to that they looked to the word that's why we are looking back to what malach say we are not hearing what a bunch of men are saying you either give us what said all give us death blessed be the name of the Lord therefore we know that the seven Thunder Revival is not going to be a denomination going to end up to end up an organization because we have a vision the word must be manifested everything God spoke through Malachi we we are here waiting for the manifestation of the seven promises oh blessed be the name of the Lord we have a vision you can be seated now listen to what the prophet said here now in the message the way to have Fellowship preached 1955 he preached it 1955 paragraph 26 it says that's the trouble with man tonight that's what's the trouble with people tonight you are scared that's the biggest there is on the Full Gospel people all on any other people is because they are afraid God has made it a provision but you afraid to take his word for it if he wasn't afraid tonight why would you take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing would just go Plum away from you afraid scared and have not and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something is going to happen blessed be the name of the Lord now in this quotation is talking about the provision God has given us the provision which is his word the promises the seven Thunder seeds we know what the prophet spoke about the bride we know what he promised the brain but he said the problem is that people are scared and he says they are afraid to take God at his word and he said that is the greatest Cur being scared to take God at his word being afraid to take God at his word brother says it is the greatest C am that's where I got the inspiration that fear is the greatest robber of our blessing in another place brother I'm talking about fear he says fear is the greatest plague today in the world everybody is afraid of abor but e is not the greatest plan fear brother said fear is the greatest plague and in another place brother said fear is of the devil and in another message the state of the perfect man showed us why fear is deading because because he said what you fear happens and what you believe happen actually fear is perverted fa fear is the opposite of Faith so fear is deadling it is the greatest C it is the greatest plague and in another place brother bam says fear is the greatest hindrance actually what is hindering us to see the manifestation of the Prophet prophecy what is hindering us to see the manifestation of the word PR to the bride is fear the word is right God keeps his word brother saying when God speaks something isound to his [Music] word to his word to fulfill it God is under obligation to God is under to his word to if it God to live the heavens bankrupt to leave the heavens empty God will rather leave the heavens empty than to let his word f blessed be the name of the Lord God's word can never fail that's why God says in the Bible shall my word be proceeds out of my mouth it shall never turn to me void it what I sent it [Applause] for be the name of the Lord so my brother my sister whatever God spoke through Mal concerning the bride has to come to pass every seventh th promise has to come to pass the New Birth has to come to pass the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come to pass the state of the perfect man has to come to pass a super Church a super has to come to pass a Power House a reflection of Jesus Christ a living Monument of the Living God a living Temple of the Living God that is our inheritance not that is our promise not promise that's what we are going to be before the Rapture takes place God said signs wonders Miracles has to be in the bride because God said where is the problem fear fear you can beting hallu soar is the greatest robber fear is the greatest [Applause] robber of the blessings of the Bride blessed be the name of the Lord fear is the greatest robber as long as we have the fear to take a step of faith and claim these blessings we're going to continue to live under our privileges the bride is going to continue to live below her Privileges and I want to read you something here that brother bam preached in in the message of the great Prince MC the great prince prince and and and the King he preached it 1955 he says it is God's promise that he saw he would do he he would do he did what he saw it is his promise and God saw he would do it no matter how much Rises up to try to counter fate or impersonate no matter how many things raise up to try to contradict it or to take it down it will go on and on and on [Music] forever God is brother bam is talking about God's promise for God has saw by himself that he would keep it then listen what brother said if I fail to preach it this is Brother speaking if I fail to preach it and let it down God will raise somebody in my place to go on with it he's talking about the promise he says if I fail to preach down God will raise somebody in my place to go on with it then he turned to us Believers and he said if you fail to believe there will be somebody stepping in your place to believe it instead of you for God has sown he would do it oh what a consolation that oh what a consolation that that gives us so brothers and sisters fellow Minister that is the danger we are in today you can be seated if we fail to preach God will raise up somebody that will preach it if you and if you Believers fail to believe it God will raise up somebody in your who will believe it because saw by himself every promise in the Bible every promise in the word every promise in the message all the seven thund promises never preached them to remain on the TS and books we want a manifestation let God be God let God be God beess Be The Name Of The Lord hallelujah huah fear fear is the greatest robber of our blessing we are afraid to take a step of faith and declaim these promises that's where the problem is you can be seated hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord the hour is now we have pushed it in the future in the future for a long time we have kept pushing it in the future in the future hour is now blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallel hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord yes hallelujah hallelujah so you can be seated yes so you see the Prophet The Prophet The Prophet was very was very serious about this m says it says it is God's promise that he saw he would do it no matter how much Rises up to try to counterfeit or to impersonate it how many things raise up and try to contradict it or to take it down it will go on and on and on forever God has saw by him that he would keep it so brother is talking about the promise promise the bride exclusive promise the name of the Lord and he says if I fail to preach it and let it down will raise somebody in my place to go on with it to believe it there somebody stepping in your place to believe it instead of you for God has shown he would do it and he says oh what a consolation what a consolation that gives us blessed be the name of the Lord so every promise in the Bible is [Music] yours every promise on the TS and the books of the Prophet is your and God is under obligation to manifest it God is dy bound to manifest it God is under Earth to manifest it but God will never do anything until we step out in faith blessed be the name of the Lord we are not here to plead for [Music] God the Bible is right is either right or it is not right Bible is either God's word or it is not God's word blessed be the name of the Lord the message is right either right or it is not right brother was either the El of Mal all he's not the Elijah of Malachi so we are not here to plead for God let God be God blessed be the name of the Lord let God be God oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so this is either the truth or it is not the truth listen what says here brother bam says here he say says in the message Divine love and Sovereign Grace preached it in Prince Al 1956 August 14th it says here now there's one thing he was talking about the Bible and the word of God now there is one thing it is either right or it is wrong he was talking about the word the Bible the message of the hour it is either right or it is wrong there is one thing it can't be right wrong and it canot it cannot be wrong right there's one thing either wrong or it is right this [Music] Bible is even either the truth or it is an error error if it is a error error then let us close up this church building tonight and walk away from here and forget about Christianity that is our Prophet if the Bible is wrong then let us cross up this building and walk away from here and forget about Christianity there is no such a thing let's forget about Christianity there's no such a thing in case the Bible is an error in case the Bible is wrong but if it is the truth then Jesus Christ is [Applause] bound stand by his word hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord if the Bible is right and Christianity is Right Jesus Christ [Music] isound to stand by his wife and proect himself in his church for his word said the same things I do shall you do also even more than this for I go to my father a little while the world will see me no more yet you'll see me so I'll will be with you to the end of the world the Bible says it's the same yesterday it's the same today and it's the same forever oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah oh Hallelujah you can be seated you can be seated brother that's where we are standing today and we that believe the seven ther inspiration our reputation and our names is at stake because for over 40 years we have told the world what the prophet said we have told the world that the bride is going to be perfect the bride is going to be adopted we are going to be another Ephesian we are going to have another Year of Jubilee we going to have the spoken word we are going to have a seven Thunder Revival we have told in the world that we shall be the manifestation of the sons of God we shall have the minist of the morning promise after promise after promise after PR promise and the world is waiting the world is waiting the world is waiting that's why I say your name is at stake our reputation is at St and after we are gone in the rupture history is going to judge us how are we going to go down the history of the world we who believe this message we either going down the history of the world as Liars who followed a false prophet all we are going down the history of this as a true church as a true bride that had the manifestation of the word of God because a Revival 77 Church ages brother say the Revival is a move of God in power blessed be the name of the Lord we have talked and talked and talked and talked but now we want to manifest the world is not waiting for talking is waiting for [Music] manifesting of what the prophet say blessed be the name of the Lord our reputation is at stake our names are at stake and the only thing that is going to save us a manifestation of what the prophet said about the bless be the name of the Lord when the critics see the manifestation when the world see the manifestation what the prophet said about [Music] the then the critic's mouth will be closed so that's why we we we we need a manifestation it will take your faith the word is right the seven promises are right and God is dy bound to his word to manifest it God is under obligation to his word to manifest it to his word to manifest it God's word can never fail Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away shall be fulfilled fear is the greatest robber of our blessings fear is the greatest fear is the greatest plague fear is the greatest hindrance the word is right but we are afraid to take God at why blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah you can be seated so God is God is waiting on us the Dynamics is here the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics but God is waiting on us to get started and the Lord will do the rest blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah you can be seated I want to read another quote here blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah listen to this you know when I came in I came in with my tablet [Music] but yesterday he just stopped working so I'm using one which I'm not very much used to brother brother brother Johny got me one that I'm using so I'm trying to tr for my quotes here I know them I can speak them but you know when you read them then people know you are not making them out you are exonerated bless the name of the Lord so there's a quotation here it is in Hebrews part three Hebrews part 3 the prophet was speaking about the power the bride has and he was saying he was saying oh if the church only recognize its power to do the things Matthew chapter 18 whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and what whatsoever you lose on Earth shall be loed in heaven so that is the quote I'm looking for if the church recognizes to do these things it says but instead there's so much fear and so much doubt and so much trembling they are wondering if these things can be which things the promises PR they look at the promises but they wondering can they be and there's too much faith in the bride and trembling and doubt it's l it is Hebrews chapter 7 part 3 that's the state the bride is [Music] in but I wanted to read it because it is very powerful but I'm failing to operate this thing man blessed be the name of the Lord I'm failing to operate it it's a very powerful quotation see so the point that brother is bringing out of that quotation is talking about the potential the power The Authority the blessings the Privileges that we as Believers have and at the same time he's wondering that instead of the Bride recognizing the power that she has there so much fear and doubt and trembling and wondering whether these things can happen and then he says as long as that exist as long as what exist fear doubts and trembling as long as it exist in the brain it say the chur will never stand upright we will never stand upright then he goes on and says when all talk of fear is gone spirit is in full control of the church said that's when we shall have power and he says all Heaven is behind [Music] us all what heaven owns is behind us why do we sit torment blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah God bless you brother Elijah it says here all powers of Heaven and Earth is given into my hand go and I will go with you whatever you bind on Earth are bind in heaven and what you lose on Earth I will lose in heaven then he says oh the Great church if oh if the great holy church only realize it power to do these things but there is so much doubt Mark The Prophet's words he never said there is a doubt he never said there is a little doubt he never said is some doubt but he says but oh if the great holy church only realiz it power to do but there is so much doubt and fear and trembling and wondering if it will could it could it happen as long as that exists as long as what exist much doubt and fear and trembling and wondering if it will if it will could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when every talk of is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that and and that church has the power why they have everything that heaven owns behind it ambassadors of the throne absolutely ABS an ambassador of Christ has the authority and anything that Christ owns belongs to that Ambassador and he said go into all the world you are my Witnesses after the Holy Ghost is come on you and what is a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something all powers of heaven right in your hands why do you set and the church is bar and and we sit Tor it's because that we don't recognize these things oh blessed be the name of so you see fear doubts trembling and being afraid to take God at his word blessed be the name of the Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah so that's why my inspiration is fear is the greatest robber of our blessings amen the power has been given to us but we are pushing it to the Future to the Future because of fear doubts and trembling and being afraid to take God at his word we have no more time and remember that we have to begin with the small punches before we can be able to knock out our opponents am let us not think manifestation of these promises would drop like a bomb boom and it will start shaking the world with the power of God no we have to we have to grow into [Music] it we have to keep growing from glory to glory from Power the name of the Lord that's the way has to be from glory to glory from power to power hallelujah hallelujah the manifestations of the seven Thunder promises have to start slowly and then they begin growing and growing and growing time will come too much power and we shall shake it world the dead will be raised bless be the name of the Lord but when we are still halfway to act on the word of God forget it P 3757 Church ages listen listen what the prophet says here the last paragraph is talking about our time it is it says it is the harest time the time we are living in this is a harvest [Music] time there then must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat the bride to maturity and those who will bring the tears to maturity then he says he begins with the tears those that deny the word it says the tears are already maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people from the world and the word in our day is Malachi for message because seven Church 34 brother says again there is another people in the land under their messenger they are the final voice to the final age Hallelujah Hallelujah so thats those that reject what Mali for saying it says they are maturing very fast under corrupt teachers who turn the people away from the word now let's go to the bride the it says but the we also must mature and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with the Vindicated Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church had and she will grow it's talking about the bride the whe it says the to the whe he's sending a prophet messenger with a Vindicated Ministry that he might be acceptable by accepted by the elect they will hear him as the first church had PA and she the we the bride in the word until becoming a word bride the mighty Works will be found in her that are always attendant upon the pure word and [Music] Faith so he's talking about the the bride matur not remaining in one position we have to mature the manifestations have to begin as our faith grows the manifestation grows as our faith grows the manifestation grows until it will hit a climate when the world will see the spoken word creation power great works science wonders and miracles it's not a one day Affair it is a growth glory to glory to glory blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that's why my brother my sister the power is present but faith is absent to move the power that's where the problem is blessed be the name of the Lord now in that in that me because of time so many I'm going to speak them ver the name of the Lord now in the message God called man brother said and brother touched it slightly yesterday God can send a Revival he has to get men prepared to pack it and he calls them raed men of faith rged men of Faith men and women who don't care whether it happens [Music] or hallelujah hallelujah rugged men of Faith Like sadrach is deliv us and even if he does not deliver us we shall not bow downed of Faith whether it fails or it happens they will stand whe walk all they don't walk whether the sick are healed they not of our God is able to deliver us if it does not deliver us we shall not bow down oh blessed be the of Lord like like in the old test she took the word of God and stood on the promise fasted for three days and after fasting standing on the promise she stepped out and went into the king and said if I perish I perish because you are standing on the word of God Be The Name Of The Lord whether it happens it doesn't she went in if I perish I perish hallelujah hallelujah raed men of Faith Like Elijah Elijah stood and say let the god that answer with fire be God hallelujah hallelujah let the god that answer that's what God is demanding for [Applause] God men of faith God be God let God be God God be God blessed be the name of the Lord then listen you can be seated in this message God called man I have all the quotes here but I failed to operate it it says he he says this is what he says it says people are crying for [Music] Revival and and surely we in the Thunders we are crying for Revival and don't forget churches a Revival is a move of God in power blessed be the name of the Lord and he says people are crying for Revival and he said I wonder whether their prayers are not just blocking The Fountains of blessings they praying for Revival they crying for Revival instead of their prayers losing the Fountain of bless their prayer just closes the fountain why because they are afraid to take his word they crying for Revival but to take God at his word yet the scriptures de that Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday it's the same today and it's the same forever so however much we cry for Revival if we remain scared and Afraid and doubting and trembling We Fear to take God at his word those prayers just close the fountain do you see where the problem is fear the word is right God is Duty bound to his word obligation to his [Music] word to his word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday forever the problem is we are afid we are afraid to take at his word on the word of the Living God Be The Name Of The Lord yet the scriptures Jesus Christ is the oh blessed be the name of the Lord so it is the fear that's where the problem is we are not lacking power we have power in that message the ever water from the [Music] rock the everes water from the Rock brother in that message the ever present water from the it speaks about any believer that is born [Music] again any believer that is born again and how are you born again by receiving the Holy Ghost it says every believer that is Born Again In you you have enough power to create another world in you you have enough power to raise the dead to heal the sick because he says in God there is no two parts there's no weak little part and there is no strong powerful part so Brothers there is no excuse sister there is no excuse once you are born again you have God in you the holy spirit in you and that is enough power in you to create a new world to put stars in the Orit to raise the dead to heal the sick but he said even if you just have a shadow of God in you even if it is just a shadow of God in you that is enough power in you bless be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah but it takes your faith Tak your fath it takes your fa bless Lord that's why Jesus say all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible to them that believe it is your faith you can be seated God bless you hallelujah oh Hallelujah and the scripture we read in James James 1 verse 5 it says if anyone of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God who will he hold not but gives Liber to all but with a caution let him ask in faith nothing wavering because the person that wavers is like a wave d by the wind on the sea is a double minded person in his ways then he says let not that person think he will get anything from the Lord let him ask in faith if the world is ever going to see the god of Elijah we have to wake up somebody has to wake up and take promises take God at his word proclaim that the word is Right Proclaim that God does exist that the message the Bible is true and that Mal message is Right blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah so fear is the greatest robber that has robbed us of our blessing blessed be the name of the Lord and in that message perfect faith brother when he preached that message in his court the pocket of his court he had a shell a bullet he took time to go out and get the r material that makes a bullet the prophet took time to look for the material that they use to make bullets he got the explosives he got the shell and he got the projectile that pointed the part of the bullet and he took time to study the science of ballistics which is the science of bullets and firearms in order to know the power of that bullet he [Music] made and he put it together and made that bullet and the day he preached the perfect fa he came with it in his pocket and that message perfect faith has many highlights in it so when he touched the highlight of the power being present in the church to demonstrate what he was saying he took that bullet out of his pocket and raised it up to the congregation and he says here in my hand I have a shell which I hand loed myself and by ballistics I know what it can [Applause] do and he went on and said but it cannot do anything until the Fire gets to the [Applause] powder and explodes it out and then he said it's the same thing with the church the Bride of Jesus Christ he said the power is present the holy spirit is present in the church but there is no faith to fire it and send it off in order that we can see great works that's where it is and he says the disciples had the power but they did not have faith to move the power there is theam Tabernacle today in that same condition with the power but without the faith to move the power church today in that condition the power without faith to move the power and my brothers ever since I came to the sth th inspiration in [Music] 1991 if there are people on Earth that have the Holy Ghost it is the Believers of the seven Thunder inspiration because it is our cure almost in every meeting to cry out for the Holy Ghost refering of the ho ghost wave after wave of the Holy Ghost but what are we using it for is there the power is present but there is no faith to move the power instead there's too much fear doubts and trembling we are afraid we are scared to take God at his word be the name of the Lord that's where the problem is and we are pushing it to the Future pushing it to the future we have to start now blessed be the name of the Lord we have to start now we want to see a manifestation of the seven Thunder promises we have to start now the power is present the word is here God cannot deceive blessed be the name of the Lord and listen to just two quotes and I [Music] finish seven Church ages 300 huu listen what the prophet said here P 301 he says who dare to deny the mighty minister of Philip who dare to deny the mighty ministries of Iranians Patrick the Patrick andoun andoun scores of others who have had God's anointing upon them yes the Bible Way is the real way of the open door and I want to add my testimony to that the reason I have to do that because I can always speak with assurance concerning what God has done in my own life so if you will excuse a person not here I will tell you how I know for that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and that the power of God is still available to those who will believe and receive Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the power of God still available to those that will believe and receive and P 302 listen what he said he was preaching to the Muslims in South Africa South Africa I began to speak to her and to all those thousands through the interpreters I said is it not so that the missionaries have told you over Jesus who came to save you you should have seen the people look at each other when when I said that then when they had answered that that was correct I went on and said but did the missionaries to you out of this book and I I held my Bible up for them to see that this same Jesus was a mighty healer now listen get this did I read it to you out of this book and I held my Bible a LOF for them to see that this same Jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down Through the Ages until he came again to receive them unto himself did you get it it's telling them Jesus was a mighty healer and that he would live in his people down Through the Ages until he will come to receive them unto him say did they tell you that because of that same spirit in them that was Ines Jesus that they would be able to do Mighty works even as Jesus did did they tell you that you can be healed even as you can be saved how many of you would like to see the same Jesus come down Among Us and do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth long ago they all wanted that that is one thing they Sur agreed on and then P 303 it says now the muhammadans are descendants of Abraham they believe in one God but they they reject Jesus Jesus as the Son of God and instead they take Muhammad as his Prophet they say that Jesus never died and rose again they are taught that by their priest and they believe it but I said but Jesus did die and Rise Again he sent his Spirit back upon the church that spirit that was in him is the very same spirit in the church now and it can and will produce what Jesus produced so we are not lacking power but the problem fear is the greatest robber let me finish with this testimony one day I went to a certain Town certain in ugandauganda that is just one among the many testimonies because I've broken the barrier of fear and that town had many Witch Doctors I know which is in developed countries it's no longer something you you know [Music] about but in Africa they are everywhere and the the first two days those witches those witches ganged together against our meetings and they really brought down the power of Satan until we couldn't preach for two days dark clouds could just come from nowhere and the terrible powerful wind blow the dust until the whole place du up and then it was followed by heaving the first day it was like that and the second day and when the Lord revealed to us what was going on we took the promise Jesus said whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you lose on Earth lose in heaven we are not going to use that Authority at the mar supper Jesus said as the father sent me soend I you the Lord Jesus say works I do shall you do also Jesus was not playing with words he meant what he [Applause] said in Luke chapter 18 no Luke chapter 10 Jesus said I beheld Satan fall from Heaven as but behold I give you power trle over serpents and over pois scorpions and over all the powers of the nothing shall in any wise hurt you Jesus said these sign shall follow them that believe in my name shall cast out the devil adoption P one and P two brother said we are God's ambassadors and all Heaven is behind us all God's power is behind us all God's angels are behind us God himself is standing right behind us Jesus said this Rock I build my church of Hell shall not Prevail against those are our promises and we are not going to use them in heaven in heaven there will be no devil to bind in heaven there will be no devil to cast out in heaven there will be no Satan to fight there will be no sick people to heal we have to use them here so we went into prayer and intercession until God give us the victory until we f a breakthrough in the spirit and that day many people gathered because they saw what happened the two days they came to witness what is going to happen on the third little did they know we already had the victory so I took the Bible and stood on the pit in the open air and I said this Bible is either the truth or it is false god that the churches preach about and the preach about exist or he does not exist and today we want to see it's not my duty to prove that the Bible is God's word I was born in 1965 I found the Bible here I found the churches and the MOs I found them talking about God but if it is God's word it God's Duty God responsibility to come forth and manifest it God does exist God is alive it is his duty today to prove it and everybody was looking at me and then I said anybody that is Dea come forward and we began singing a song as those who were de were coming for 12 people came forth 12 people 11 were deaf in one ear and one was deaf in both ears a girl of about 12 14 years old so she came with the mother and the mother stood behind her and I I started building their faith why do I use deaf people particular those who are in one I'm demonstrating to them Mark 9:23 all things are possible to them that believe that's why the angel told Brother take the gift of Divine Healing to the whole world but the healer is Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today forever but your duty your duty is to get the people to believe if you can get the people to believe no will stand before you because Mark 9:23 all things are possible to them that and then how does faith come Romans 10 verse 17 Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God that's why listen that's why in that message diseases and affliction brother took the pit he told the sick people give me your undivided attention because if you lose what if you lose what I'm going to say you have as well lost your healing give me your undivided attention because if you lose what I'm going to say you have as well lost your healing why because the faith comes by healing the word of God once the people get to the faith once the people get to the faith the people get to the Fai no sickness can stand no demon can because all things are possible to them that believe so now those people one ear could hear one ear was death so so with one here with one ear they heard the word because faith comes by hearing they got the faith and the faith opened the second ear and the other the other girl who was de in both ears the mother stood in the gap for her and when she heard about the promises how God Alone is the Healer and how that our healing is already finished work of car and she got the faith God to open the ears of her daughter the the second thing we did I told them to put their fingers in the DEA ear so these 11 people because they were deaf in one ear they put the finger in the deaf ear but the other girl because she was not hearing the mother had the word and got the she was convinced my daughter is going to hear so the mother put both fingers in her ear brothers sisters sir don't lose what I'm bringing to you fear is the greatest robber of the blessings if we can master that Master that fear and cast it out and we take the pr we are going to begin to see a man so we called on the name of the Lord and at the end of the prayers I as them to check their ears our God is a big God it's not by our righteousness God is D bound to his word God is under obligation to his word under to his word is not your word in the message perfect Faith somebody asked him brother are you not afraid when you see the sick people everywhere before this was answer I'm not afraid because if I was afraid I would not walk into that door to get in the auditorium when where the sick people are number two if I was afraid I would have no business Behind The Bu number three the reason I'm not afraid because it is not my word God's word it's not my word God's word God isound to his word to fulfill it God is under obligation to his [Music] word is under auth to his word to fulfill it and do you know what happened all of the tra of God open their ears all of them received their hearing
