Lord are you happy to be the house of the Lord this morning amen amen you may be seated for a few minutes God bless you church I'm just here to greet you this morning before the pastor comes to minister to us this morning certainly it's good to be back home in the house of the Lord and back here in our in our country and uh certainly a great privilege to see all of you here and to see you still pressing the battle and uh identifying whose side you're on we know we're on the Lord's Side and you know brother Ram said one time if if you lose your teeth you got to gum the devil you know so you got to keep standing so certainly a great privilege I bring greetings from many Believers from far and wide they send their love and appreciation to The Headstone Tabernacle amen and I was out for three weeks so bov just asked me to bring a greeting and to give a trip report so uh the first meeting was about three weeks ago I was at brother stephanus K Brena in Germany so greetings from brother stefanus from his wife from the Coen Brena family from the ch Church there and there were Believers that came from Brother jeano's church and brother Gerard Perez from LCA London was there brother Zoe Thompson so they all send their love and their greetings and we had a tremendous time in the Lord uh brother jarard would have opened up uh the meeting that we had and it was a truly a tremendous uh blessing speaking about the names in the book and such an encouragement to the people of God and then uh the next day there was a a youth meeting question and answers and then I preached that night about Divine connections and being connected to God and the Holy Spirit moved among the people and then Sunday morning a man after God's Own Heart and truly God is doing something all over the world the spirit of God is moving and uh we see God uniting from the east from the West so there were Believers from different places there and truly the Lord blessed and then uh brother stepan stephanus and I uh flew from Germany over to the Nai convention in Nigeria it was my first time being in nawi I've been to Nigeria in different meetings but first time in nawi and what a time we had in that naway meeting I tell you the worship the fire the inspiration there were eight services and the worship in the first service and the last service was the same worship the shouting and praising in the first service and the last service was the same there was one day that you know you had to ask the question on the third service is is this the same day that we are in because the energy in the third service in the evening is just as strong as the first service in the morning but is a joy in the people's heart to serve the Lord It's a joy to know where you come from it's a joy to know where you're going amen so um eight services and a tremendous time so I bring greetings from Brother Isaac of who is the host Pastor there in the Navy convention and all of the ministers and that were there um brother Isaac he spoke as well as brother stephanus brother Gideon from Uganda brother kamita brother Olu um brother ekek and all the churches that are that were represented in that meeting many many I think there were over 50 or 60 Pastors in the convention so it was quite a meeting I think maybe close to Six 700 Believers in the meeting so we had a tremendous time and uh it's a joy it's a refreshing to know that you're not standing alone and that there are many others who have not bowed to the things of this world and they under expectation for the manifestation of the the sons of God and the burden and inspiration of the meeting was the unity of the faith the unity of the spirit and we know that God is doing the uniting it will not be a uniting under man but it will be uniting under the headship of the Holy Ghost and we are looking for God to unite us not by man and you know as you see the world is uniting and the world is coming together and how technology is being used and I think I I I ministered some weeks ago and speak about the spirit of nimrod that's on the earth now that when God looked down there in Genesis Genesis is the seed of everything to see how through the unity of man they were trying to build a tower to get to God and God said I have to destroy this thing and he did it by breaking up their language and by destroying their language he broke it completely and he said if he did not do that the unity of man was going to accomplish whatever they set their hearts to that's how powerful Unity is and the only time we saw a reversal of that is back there uh around the day of Pentecost when they preach and everyone heard in their own language and now we see with technology trying to break down the language barrier so that with AI and all these things man could be one again and if God did it that way the first time he's obligated to do it again to destroy the man-made system if God treated with Sodom and gomorra a certain way the first time he has toed Sodom and Gomorrah a second time so all of these things to show that there's going to be a Unity that where God is head of this Unity where Christ is head of his church and it will not be man on display it willn't be man's ideas but it will be God himself have calling from the east from the west from the north from the south and the sovereignty of God means he doesn't need anybody permission to call you to pick you to choose you to heal you to redeem you to bless you to transform you to restore your joy your peace your worship your Victory the seed in your soul wasn't placed there by man but the God who plac the seed in you is more than able to bring that seed to life and he's going to do whatever he's going to do and he's speaking to individuals so I'm under great expectation for what God is about to do can the church say Amen so after the the meeting in Germany and Nigeria I ended up in Lagos afterwards and then I preached from the de's church so that was a tremendous blessing as well so it was just back to back we're trying to do as much as we can one brother said to me if the Lord causes you to die here you need to die empty whatever you do give it all to the Lord you know so from meeting after meeting service after service so we had a tremendous time brother DA's church and the last service which was last Sunday I preached about the U's church so um greetings from mother da and the church there in his portion of uh Lagos and of course greetings from Brother Olu and the church in Lagos brother hu Church they send their love they send their appreciation they send their greetings so I'm here this morning to thank you for your prayers for your support for the encouragement and I was saying to brother ID every message message uh so was six messages I preached I said every message came from here because under the atmosphere the inspiration the church is pulling and sometimes you prepare something but something is said under inspiration and you realize that that it it is God doing something amongst us and allowing that to be used in a way to be a blessing to others we have no agenda of our own we have no Mission I didn't invite myself to these these different conventions that took place but the Lord is doing something and we are so grateful to be a part of this body this mystical body this bride buddy and I said it in the Navy convention when we get on the other side it will not be a Nigeria group over there or a German group over there or a Trinidadian group over there it's one body it's one Lord It's one Faith it's one baptism Hallelujah and I said to them that the problems of the elders the problems that were in the wilderness we younger generation have nothing to do with that so we are not continuing the wars of 40 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago we have one Mission the Promised Land we have one desire of the Holy Ghost we have one passion to see God move on the scene I said I'm one preacher who's tired of church Hallelujah I'm looking for a manifestation of God I'm looking for a reality I'm looking to see the sick heal backsliders restored I'm looking to see the lame walk I'm looking to see the old become young again I'm looking to see the tears that have been shed be wrapped up into the joy of the Lord because the joy of the Lord is our strength and weeping me endure for a night but joy comes in the morning so I'm looking to see Souls on fire for God hallelujah it will not be man doing the work but it'll be the Holy Ghost I thank God that you are not even the believer that I am not even the believer but the prophet of God said the word in you that seed in your soul that's the believer that's who responds to the word of God even when you backslide that word in you is still a Believer even when you make mistakes that word in you is still a Believer when you feel sick you feel tired you feel frustrated that word speaks better for you oh hallelujah amen as we get ready to change out of the service I want to encourage you friends your sins and your mistakes would be one thing if it wasn't for the blood Hallelujah if God wanted to hold your sins against you there'd be no need for blood but because he knew you'd make mistakes and because he knew you would struggle he put blood there so that when he looks through the blood he sees you different there'd be no reason for blood if God didn't know there'll be a need for blood oh come on now somebody preach back to me if God didn't think about your mistake think about your failures think about your ups and downs he wouldn't put blood there but he put blood and when he sees that blood he could pass over you can the church say Amen Give the Lord a shout of Praise there's two things I love God for it's the blood and the sea of forgetfulness it's only in church people remember what you did but thank God there's a sea of forgetfulness that he wants to forget your mistakes he wants to forget your failures because when he looks at you he sees you in just two ways the way you are in his thoughts and the way you're going to be he does not look at your present condition because he knows you rotated off of God so may the Lord richly bless you it's good to be home we are closing in the end of this year and before we leave this place we're going to give the devil a knockout punch we are not leaving this world barely making it we are leaving this world with a shout with a joy with a praise and as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we will bring our families I don't care where your son is I don't care where your daughter is I don't care where your husband your wife your family as for me and my house he said the promise is unto you and to your children so may the Lord richly bless you brother Anthony you can sing a song as we prepare for the pastor God bless you [Music] richly oh hallelujah hallelujah you appreciate that greeting this morning do you appreciate the assistant pastor

depending on you in Jesus name I ask it amen amen God bless you have your seat a minute praise God God bless you and Welcome to our Sunday morning certainly appreciate the um the greetings and the update from overseas pray for brother Isaac I think some was Dean of God we're looking to see what the Lord will do yesterday we had our last uh things plac into life and godliness Andrew took that to share something on financial breakthrough very interesting session they had and he read the scripture from Second Kings about this with woman and this part was really striking go borrow these vessels abroad from all th neighbors and empty vessels borrow not a few and he went through some stuff there was quite interesting I told him that it remind me when I was doing literature and um when you have the exam papers and they give you one little line and you they have six pages from that little line I us ask myself how Shakespeare didn't know Shakespeare mean all of that from one to line the amount of stuff you're explaining of all that and this was really something else and he was talking about networking and how if you're bad talking your neighbor you're fighting up or whatnot you can't go on borrow nothing you can't ma for anything but this year say borrow a vessel is not a few to do what to get the oil the last part was very interesting I'm not want to tell you everything because we recorded this first one we recorded we had it upstairs here and we're going to put it up uh maybe to tomorrow we're going to put up on the on the YouTube channel and she came and told the man of God and said go and and he said go sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest so it was quite interesting talk about um look written personal audit recognize potential borrow vessels even empty vessels not a few in other words don't limit what you could access that you could get God's blessing shut the door and pour the mystery of the oil sell the oil pay your debt and live under rest very very interesting session I feel it is necessary as I tell them especially of Christmas coming up now and all those jingle bells ringing and all those and the spirit of spending and so on like that and um you know God want you to be diligent and applying yourself and can't repeat the same Mystics you paint last year painting again this year yeah I wouldn't go down with that and so you can't repeat the same Mystics and then you have no money to do this no money to do that but we are grateful to God for his time and the season we're living in right now before I read the scripture I just want to say that President Putin launched what he call an experimental missile in Ukraine this missile he said the West doesn't have any answer to it it is 10 time the speed of song that mean before you hear it it kill you you hear what I say before you hear my voice you're dead it is 10 times the speed of song this missile I think it go up as far as outer space almost and come down and that last part that comes in inside of that have about six or S little fellas inside that that that pinpoint to go to areas and the live of what happened in Ukraine is like fire falling from the sky there's no response to that what they have now could reach any part of the earth in 30 minutes I repeat that they have missiles that could go any part of the earth in 30 minutes and the West have no response for that and brother brandham preached a message called the invasion of the USA I think it is in that message he was talking about when the voice says you have to surrender and what not what else will you just do he was implying that there will come a time when they have no challenge to what is coming to them because the Judgment of USA is set now you could think it doesn't affect us it does whatever happen in This Global Community will affect the entire world and that's why you have to strengthen yourself and stop complaining hush your mouth and stop complaining about the petty things you go through because a tough time still lays ahead so you have to have faith in God for this season here to push forward not faith in yourself self but faith in God and you'll find out on the message this morning just let me find let's all stand we want to turn to John chapter 6 want to read from verse 51 to 5 thank you musician thank you so much and but thank youy for the song service this morning and Judges 7 we want to read 1 to7 so all I have this morning is 13 Pages this is not much 12 pages about judges St John chapter 6 and we want to read from verse 51 my son keep telling me that I speak so softly when I'm reading scriptures people complain see but yes I'm hoping that I'm proven it I don't know what happens they didn't know I was a soft spoken person see I don't know why you're laughing St John chapter 6 my wife knows that St John chapter 6 verse 51 I am the living bread which come down from heaven if a man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves said how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them ver very unto you except he eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh drink it my blood had eternal life I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father had sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and a dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever let's continue these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum and many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if he shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that would betray him and who would betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except that was given unto him of my father and here this verse 66 from that time many of the disciples went back and walked no more with him Judges chapter 7 reading 1 to7 then J then zerubba who is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and Pitch beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Mor in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are okay all right the people that are with the are too many for me to give the medit into their hands lest Israel VA themselves against me saying my own hand had saved me now therefore go to Proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early from millad and the return of the people 20 and 2,000 and they remained 10,000 and the Lord said unto Gideon the People Are Young too many bring them down into the water and I will try them for thee dear and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people unto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon everyone that lath of the water with his tongue as a dog laped him shall thou set by himself likewise everyone that Bowe it down upon his knees to drink and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bow down upon their knees to drink water and the Lord said unto Gideon by the 300 men that laed will I save you and deliver the midnight into and into thine hand and let all the other people go every man into his place let us pray father we thank you for your word may you

you're not here to get information you're not here to get knowledge you're here to get Revelation and to get Revelation you have to get it by the spirit and to get it by the spirit you must be in the spirit you must want to be in the spirit if you're tired you're weary you have to shake that off and get in the spirit because in the spirit the spirit of God can come and reveal things to you if if you just sit it ordinary sit back and relax like if you're in some some some room or something so it wouldn't work Hallelujah you have got to want to be in the spirit that's why the devil fight worship fight Praises fight the anointing fight the fire but we fighting right back the hour coming know when the true worshippers that's you have to see yourself as a worshipper not as a Observer a participator a worshipper in spirit and in truth oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah Hal hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah there's the place to shout you know not Carnival this is the place to shout this's the place to praise God people have to go to fat to get excited they have to go to to to Cricket to get excited with they where all the all the all the drinks and what to get excited and to see a ball Pelt and knock the Wicket off and what not and they get or goal goal goal but we come here to get excited because the end of the world is come oh praise God Amen you may seated hallelujah praise God Amen God said in the beginning what what was was gross Darkness cover the Earth and God said what let there be light and there was light isn't that right and God fin the light was good God had no problems with the light and he called the light day the darkness he called night he named the light he named The Darkness God has named things isn't that right Luther message was justification rest message was sanctification the Pentecostal message the Holy Ghost and the bright message is seven Thunders that going to take the bride off the exclusive Bridal promise is those seven Thunders that come out Christ m in Revelation chap 10 them tus is are gathered the right together them T get the right fith we not afraid to name our message we not afraid to name our light we're not afraid to name what leing taking us out of here the devil can't handle that because in every is that a thunder that shock the devil and God live for hour hour to get seven tunders to shake the whole Kingdom of the devil up oh God we rocking this morning hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus all right let's go you may be seated the Pharisees and the leaders of that day Hallelujah always tried to belittle him before the people that's right that was just a way that the devil had a working all the Pharisees and teachers of his day constantly try to be little Jesus they all to throw off they could give to him they done it they watched him constantly to find where they could find a fault they never spoke of his good things they always finding something that they could belittle him about you see look at here if he was a man of God he wouldn't do this way if he was a man of God he wouldn't do that way they were trying to cast a shadow upon him to get the people to disbelieve him that's the work of the devil that old scheme never ceased there's many times a minister will make a mistake and if he comes into a neighborhood a precious brother who's trying to do what's right to lead people right everything the devil can point to the unbeliever or the so-called Christian in that neighborhood to throw off on the man he will do it you know the re Christian ways to hide everything you can from a brother don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell you what you know about him that is good if anything is bad let it alone the poor fellow has enough against him anyhow don't try to take a pole and show a man for further into the ditch the Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch you have Wicked Christians you know or I should say the wicked so-called Christians somebody in Dish the Chen eat it e itlu they want you to stay there but you know what in their mind they down there they want to bring you down to where they are because some body who is higher will pull you up oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout in the house the Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch don't never try to shove him down Never Shout Out never don't never try to shove him down he's done already try to help him up amen and too many of us today too many people today I might say try to do that if they could just get something and another that was real bad so you see and and that's why in the pray prayer prayer meeting on Friday I talk about the the the moat and the beam and the Bible talk about somebody seeing a little m a little splint in somebody eye and they look it take it out and they have a big beam a big wood in front the they can't see good Jesus said take out the beam out your eye you hypocrite and then you can see clearly to take out the moat out of your brother eye some people they don't want to take out no moat out your eye know they want to show people their MO look look mo mo mo mo mo them feel they come the Bo identifier fault identifier sin identifier all your faults they want to point out the object of getting your beam out that's why the question was do you see clearly to get the beam out mean you could see clearly to effectively help your brother he said th hypocrite you so loud are talking now hypocrite I not s hypocrite hallelujah hallelujah first get that beam out then see clearly set of people talking and criticizing and whatnot and man my God and the same condition he mo oh my for instance if you Brethren and and I read the scripture where the Bible says if somebody's at a fault you with wisdom you who have a restore that one in gentleness in meekness because you and all could get trapped so you can't you can't restore somebody in arrogance or like you on top or you Superior or you're more and that's not the approach Hallelujah watch for instance if one of your bre make a mistake do something wrong which you subject to do it I am too every one of us as we go along let us remember we are brothers we are brothers if we got any fighting let's fight one another bring it together bring it before our Breen and settle it so God don't want this un this this this continuous fight husband fighting with wife wife husband brother against brother and this one God don't want interest in fighting the devil when the devil see people fighting internally home thing the devil say they fixed he touch them you know he pass next all them demons just keep keep moving forward they fighting one another they have time with know they help it assisting Satan then said they they are my assistants you see how they moving all right let's go Matthew 13 Jesus speaks in verse 24 another Parable he put forth saying the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man that swed good seed in his field while men slept they sleeping while they coming while you're awake you know while men slept his enemy came and so tears among the wheat and went his way and when the blade was sprung up brought forth fruit there appeared tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said sir does that now so good seed in th for you who when are the tears he said them an enemy has done this the servant said un him will thou then that we go and gather them up he said no least while you GA up the tears you root up also the wheat with themall hear the words now let both grow together until the Harvest one two and in the time of harvest until the Harvest one two in the time of the Harvest I will say unto the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my band the title of my message this morning is tinning the ranks for this play of God God's power that's the titled message this morning tinning the ranks for this play of God's power so note there's a mystery inside of there Harvest Time time of harvest but the mystery inside there is a shock that is just wheat and tears but inside the day have a shock and that shock is the church member Spirit the wheat the seed is the bride Spirit but Bram says notice he could not depend upon some certain Church to separate them Methodist Baptist Pentecostals he sent his angels to separate them an Angel is coming to bring the separation the segregation between right and wrong and no one can do that but the angel of the Lord he is the one is going to tell which is right and which is wrong God said he will send his angels at the last times praise God to make that separation do you believe that we find out that the church spirit is is is in 2 Timothy 3 this know verse one that in the last days perilous time shall come for men this is church folks now you know we keep saying this but we keep thinking that if it's outside you know for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers Disobedience to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers we not talking about them Sinners and them drunkards and them people outside of there false accusers in continent F despises of those that are good traitors hey highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof this power is this power to change you know because these people are in church but they're not changing amen they don't want to change amen

called them you know they was there until certain words were said but those words was to Tin down they get throw off then Jesus now Jesus wasn't a pastor or teacher or a prophet you know he was the Living Word you see this this is God in print this is the text but he was the text with flesh on [Music] [Applause] it he said he say sech the scriptures which is the text in them you think you have eternal life but they are they this text that's speaking about me because I am the living text or I am the Living Word they claim to have the books and tapes the text but when the word become flesh they reject it this bride will be rejected right in this message because God will vindicate who you are okay give the Lord of praise God V getting the church you know he V getting his wife he

ministers forget they have to serve God they get blessed they have church they have deacons they have elders and what that and next now they figure they're above a lot of things he say I to stay humble and con to serve God am if they don't they get ruined eventually am men who are called men who are gifted becomes ruined by their own self by their own flesh and a good example is Samson Samson didn't want no sister from in his own church he went and hanging around the Philistines that was bad enough but you know what's worse when he said to lie every time with thing lose my strength and she t with a little thing and Samson break that hey he's lying God tell him don't let your hair cut one line small lie afterward you get AC normal normal is a normal thing Hallelujah because the anointing still with you you're anointed liar that's right don't say Amen it doesn't cancel what I'm saying not because God blessing you as you are you have remain as you are you know God giving Grace don't miss not because God blessing you as you are you're going to stay as you are God is hoping you repent God is hoping you get it right God is hoping you get back on track it's not that God ignoring things you know God is watching what's going on with you because you see the ability of God is to be longsuffering we don't have that God have that when we suffer light we just get we quarrel and F and get Vex or frustrated Hallelujah you don't suffer long we don't suffer long enough we just suffer light let me repeat that again we the suffer light look Peter look Peter when his wife didn't cook

bit left was 32,000 all you the first pass all frighten 22,000 leave that's more than half leave they say service over for me and 10,000 remain and God tell Gideon like too much I will try them for the note it wasn't as if he going to tell them the negative part he said listen who I tell you to stay just send them by the water we call it the water [Music] test all who just go and say water Hallelujah and bow down and drink the water normal normal let's put them one side and all lap like a dog they're drinking water so they're attentive Hallelujah they're looking these are the kind of men you want not men bury like they take a swimming pool they dive into the water they're swimming in the water they enemy could take them out but these water lappers they Laing s the eye open they drinking water they drinking the word but they're attentive they're looking at their life they attentive they're playing close attention because you know the devil War about like a enemy to steal to Rob and Destroy so they can't bury their head like if nothing happening don't be foolish Putin preparing the bums for America Rome oh give the Lord a shout famine coming an next virus coming sickness coming earthquakes coming Oh Glory floods coming look two rainfall in Trinidad yesterday and you see what happen almost had a paddle in the US ital when them places they say one year rain falling one day and you see the accidents see how terrible it is you know what happened if rain had to pour down in TR that here do you understand the Bible just as the blessings is there the promise of Destruction is also there when you shall when you shall hear about wars and rumors of wars Jesus said the end is not yet but Nations shall rise against Nation there will be earthquakes there'll be famines there'll be I'm not saying things to frighten get frightened go and read go and read Matthew 24 frighten yourself read your Bible read what Jesus say I didn't say that you I preaching what Jesus say oh praise God praise God praise God and the Lord tell gide them the people are too many bring them down to the water I will try them for the de hallelujah praise God and you know the story by these 300 oh G by this bride not by the church members oh praise God so listen to this part he is cutting you out now cutting you down to his word only self have to cut off this foolishness like if it's a carnival band your trips and dancing down the road going into the Rapture it's not working like that it have a word requirement that God requires of us that we have to press onto that's why you have no time to gossip you have no time to waste you have time to somebody else business you have time to see what the word requirement demands of you you said cutting all the Crees and dogmas everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another Masterpiece part of the word Jesus couldn't take the place remember when they read that day in the book he read just part of the prophecy left the rest of it for the last day we are supposed to take that part what part is that to declare the day of Vengeance of our God but God say vengeance is mine I'll repay we not in a position to take Vengeance it has to be the ministry of Jesus Christ it can't be man taking Vengeance it's God veiled in a people a bride that will pick up that scripture see let's go are you with me he has to cut he wants to cut the church out some people can't even even get rebuke you rebuke them they disappear you correct them woo we they take a time off from church nobody can tell them nothing and that's why I keep telling young people years ago if your parents don't straighten you out and correct you life will put licks on you so we not doing our children a favor by not correct them and straighten them out you are helping them a long life journey by correcting them and disciplining them that's what you're supposed to do and you like a one young man want to leave like his father his father this his father that I say listen if your father failed you you must not fail your children you still have to get empowered because someday you might be a parent and if you don't get self discipline what you discipline and tell the child if you don't get this straightened out how you straighten out your own child we have to start somewhere all right so you see he has to cut he wants to cut the church out just like he did the son out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride here we go you must be part of him watch this part not part of a Creed I believe this our church believe this no not part of that not part of the church I Bel l in this Tabernacle I Bel to this Tabernacle this my pastor not that not part of denomination but part of him am do you get that and if you are part of him you could live anywhere to you in France to in Germany to you in Italy you don't have to be in Trinidad God could put you anywhere anytime any place under any condition you would live a Christian life because you are part of him could we give the Lord some [Applause] Praises so your location doesn't make you a Christian not because something in a garage is a car it could be a lawn m not because a man in the castle he's a king it could be a joker man say living in the castle he'll be comedian inside the place do you understand that so not because somebody in church they a Christian they get it this time they get it this time all right so watch this now not part of a Creed not part of the church not part of the nomination but part of him am HED out of any other kind of form won't work I like that I see some ministers making the church in their own image and likeness not God like they have a vision of their what is wanted and the church show and the church Spirit church and the church devil to touch a church because dead already not heed from a kind of form you have got to be heed from the word that's why you can't look at somebody say oh she does do that I could do it too how come the P talk about she and they want to talk about me like that's something against me next minute she gone she was never part of it and you're looking at she and following she and she off right so you can't watch she or he you have to watch this you see I get TI to this very early as I told young men Proverbs was my key script that fathered me that guid me as a young man this was me kept you from the perverse woman everything this Proverbs inside everything out of here I get TI to this this what kept me this what give me the commitment the dedication devotion this this this book he out of any kind of form would work you got to be he from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the word only to live in you the great sculpure is counting on you I wish I'll just go these words are so precious I don't know what you think about it the great sculpture is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirements that his word requires in the last days I pour my spirit upon All Flesh your son and daughter shall prophesy Christ is the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be a masterpiece for the bride now Brethren God has a masterpiece then to present to the world now he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my Christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for Christ no matter what the world say they say you lost your mind you're gone crazy you went and joined that bunch of Holy Rollers don't pay attention to that if you are truly saved and in that body and the word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you brother sister don't you take that chance I don't care what you are what experience you have let that word reflect through you each day because God in his last day is taking a bride for his son Jesus Christ could you give the Lord some Praises so this story of Gideon is a reflection of how God called for separation in order to get into battle get out the ones who are afraid get out the ones who just drinking out of 10,000 9,000 700 people was rejected and there's 300 remain and God says by this by this separated bunch in other words put a mark upon those who laughing like dogs put something on them mark them could you imagine God marking You Now by your attitude to prepare you for the battle Oh Glory to God these men don't even know they are being watched these men don't even know they're being marked hallu but God said I will test them there for you because Gideon you to take them out of battle and you want to have the right kind of men before you you know the Bible talk about traitors in the last days Jesus said Breen shall betray you when they start to come and knock on wait message person yeah boy you look like you to go to I thought youed to goac no not at all not at all all of a sudden people said oh there's go Church up there you know you look like one not at all not at all not at all make a spin hey I think I see you up there no no no the third time that when had a c he said he can't be one of them them Christians do like that they say really we make a mistake sorry Peter Peter feel bad because Peter said a lose some language day when he was a fisherman three and a half years ago he use the

there a revelation I bring to them and the brother in washing don't count Jesus told the men the lepers Go and show yourself to the priest do you come for prayer do come me Hallelujah just go and show yourself priest on their way they were healed obedience one came back and worshiped he said where are the other nine he said th Faith they see the others get healed by obedience but this one had something more he had faith faith is what going to make you worship because faith means you are thanking God in advance for healing for deliverance for breakthrough faith is what giv your the praise

going to be healed you know you're going to be free and you could give God worship right now give God praise Oh Glory to God hallelujah my my my my my glory to God oh glory to God let's the home stretch here now Satan knew he could couldn't dig up the seeds in the Garden of Eden he could not destroy them but he spray them with a poison and it deformed the seed it deformed the original seed that was some Minister spraying spraying on next they twisting these words some of a brother tell me now the some of these brothers not even quoting the prophet they quoting one another they gone so far now so off the Beaten Track they saying this brother say this and is God talking is only one Prophet only one Moses you know plenty D and but be the pillar of Fire on the Mountain is Moses came down with that you when the mountains start to rock they say don't let God speak let Moses speak you know because that mountain rumbling there we can handle that and God said okay I will send Messengers and from those Messengers there are other Echoes fful Ministry ministers that could Echo what a man say I am not my own messenger Hallelujah I preaching another man's message that's what I'm authorized to do say what the tape say I'm not try to preach my own ideas I here to you to know what the tape say you said that's what the pro programs with religion they are still Sons and Daughters of God but it's deformed they go to church want to do right a none never enter the N to be a mean woman a minister never go through school to be a bad man you never join a church and shake hands and put your name on the book whatever you to be a bad person you do that to be a good person but it's a decep it's the deformity that does it Satan prayed it God never had an organization oh my praise be to God so as long as God's seed stay in the channel it will come true and manifest itself isn't that right because in the seed have the power to transform itself so you don't know if there's a watermelon seed or a pumpkin seed plant it and then when the life begin to unfold Hallelujah it reveals watermelon hallelujah or it reveal pumpkin am a watermelon vine or pumpkin vine you can't just say run a Vine what kind of plant you looking for do you get it now so for for so the church ages what we call the seven Church ages is ready to Seed Life being unfolded right that's do you get that God put a seed and the seed life unfolds and that is the church ages the unfolding of the life but at the end of it the seed that began is the seed that will finish so in the corn the corn you plant the seed and the life unfolds at the end you get back a whole air of corn and you originally come back in multiplied form that one seed give you a air of corn multiplied seeds and that is what we are Hallelujah we are to be a reproduction of the original grain that was planted on the day of Pentecost oh give the Lord I shout in the house do you see it this morning that is what this bright supposed to be represent nothing less than that silver and gold have on such as I have I give it unto you I cannot give what I don't have what I have I can give oh give the Lord a shout he I had it he could give it if you have it you could give it you cannot give what you don't have you got to get to get it you got to get it to give [Music] [Applause] it God has never changed God is determined to do something he will do it nothing going to stop him am God's power to transformo some years ago on patrol going up a corn field I would he said there some some a limb blew off a tree and fell over a stalk and the stalk was trying its best to get up straight a stick fall on it it was deformed because something happened to it we find out a wild creeper in the field which many of you in Kentucky and I skip and the creeper would grab over and grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself gradually so easy so slightly that what sin does that what little lie does that what little things does a little small little Vine and it get ticker and ticker and next minute you're held bondage and that corn wrap itself so gradually easily so slightly you could hadly tell it was wrapping and finally get stronger and stronger it pulled the corn till it's deformed it pulled it against itself wrap it around its own Vine deforming it it's a corn it's a Believer message people but deformed yes we are still in the image of God but some are so deformed as sons of God that walk contrary to his word that he had us and provide for us to walk the world twist us out of way and pull us close to it sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God the deformer I know this seems strange to speak of it to deform but that's what he is he's deformed or perverted or change over or made something different yes it is the same seed but it's deformed a deformed seed instead of having love have hate a deformed seed still packing jealousy a seed packing jealousy green green Green Eyes Of Jealousy are we find out this deformer had the same amount of time to deform as God has to transform oh praise God all right so let's hit the one night I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write I grasp the pent to right his Spirit gave me a message to the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the wood and the bride here what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings after its own kind ACC to Genesis 16 111 you said whatever the seed started in the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it's the same seed in these last days the True by Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone amen so The Headstone is a destination for the true seed they must come to The Headstone where is the headstone at the bottom or at the top at the top so you have to climb from the bottom to the top to get to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church prophecy not a dead church not a backs church not a formal church he call it a super Church she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him oh glory to God they in the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image brother brandham was so much like Jesus they thought he was Jesus oh give the Lord a shout glory to God hallelujah they in the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one are you ready Church there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God when they quot in the books they quot in you hey Hallelujah then they're reading the Bible they're reading about you because you will be the word manifested Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when Isaiah virgin shall conceive nobody knew who that was for 400 years that flying over the Earth looking for that virgin to conceive right and when Mary come that ver had a hang over Mary Mary herself can't see it but it's there am no other Mary amen no other woman not Jane not Joe not whatever name you can think about is Mary is the person when Mary come like come and talk to Mary when Mar's a baby she has to be of the age the time the season when she of aged of Hail Mary that highly favored Isaiah prophecies have to come down upon Mary she only have one question how shall this be Oh Glory to God he she said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost how shall this bright Revival be the Holy Ghost how shall this super race be the Holy Ghost how shall this super Church be the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord a shout glory to God the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this bum from a little group of the true seed of the word the reason is a true seed they have false seed the messages have false seed I want to say this again everybody that Buri and go in the Box not going to heaven may he rest in peace for everybody the people do every funeral he rested that was resting in peace is not so you know that criminal in the Box terrorize people all the life kick the bucket and now inside that box there from a little group of the true seat of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she's a virgin because because she knows no mind Creeds and dogmas here we go by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promise of God to be manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfill his own word so we don't have to manufacture anything we don't have to prove anything to anybody we have to show off to PR no card Apostle this and Apostle this and Prophet this and Prophet that no no no no no no card Ministry he will manifest and fulfill his work at that time the members of the Bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him so when you connect with your head the power comes down and flow through their body oh give the Lord some Praises right now it's not connected but it will be Christ is the head of the body called the Church Oh Glory to God remember there's one Lord there was one feet there was one body and there was one Spirit notice the harmony between Father and Son he shows her his word she receives it she Nevers doubt it therefore nothing can Hammer not even Deb here is the secret the word is in the bride question how did the word get into you by the promises said by these promises by the ministry by the ministers preaching these promises if they preach the Nancy story and the long story Rebeca the camel going down to see Isaac is promising that you know that's a story some long Mor tale they telling some water down M stretching stretching stretching and Abraham up the mountain down the valley and he was in a camel riding to Isaac and half the service is is re me not a single promise talk about Ukraine talk about Russia and talk for hours hours hours and this happen that happen and where is that are no promising that that information do you understand that information and Revelation are the same thing you know when Jesus was invited Simon house sit down there they leaving with dirty feet everybody coming to the door they wash the feet and so on all the messing on the streets and so on there have somebody to wash your feet nobody washing the feet prostitute woman look and see Jesus feet so God now she in a bad St but she tell she them men were Wicked boy how they have the master she know the man man a righteous man how you man Master like that so she take the back door and sneaking she wasn't invited and she start to cry and tears and start to wipe the WIP wipe his feet with a hear dri with a he and all them fell just stand watching whispering in the mind if he was a true Prophet must know that everybody in the village know that woman what kind of man is that and Jesus said nothing just silent Hallelujah hallu sometime God does that he let you do you do and keep silent he's not ready to speak he's not ready to break his silence all of a sudden he broke his silence he says Simon have a wa for you you know I came in here and never washed my feet you never welcome me you want to be little me that that's what we read every opportunity they want to be little Jesus and that woman was embarrassing them by doing what she did he said that woman who sins are many she is Forgiven if I was that woman I run I run to the front door if she come to the back door front door r i running through the front door shouting Glory Hallelujah you know he said that woman sins are many I ain't talk about your sins I talking about her sinsu he busted them he's showing them he knew her condition he knew her scenario but because of what she did because God seen her heart Hallelujah she have an impure body but she had a pure heart what God saw in her heart God come and bless oh give the Lord some praises [Applause] how can you tell the spirits apart give them the word test if they don't speak that word there of the evil one I have plenty explanations over there know boy BL he brother the preaching Bo forget it I said my goodness nothing with the prophet saying you know but the explanation who we you know man he make your mind just spin but it's not the message but the last will appear at God's appointed time he repeats the truth as did Elijah many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they considered truth when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers but this Prophet will come and so on oh praise God so many true ministers will misunderstand and they will be off track amen amenah brother Bram almost done oh 14 pages we page 11 all right just about maybe 10 minutes again and we close so M can get ready but I'm talk about today so many people are listening to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they in the world they are demons they go out into places they get among men ministers they get among church members they get among good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that are contrary to the word of God Amen you said what is it is enticing Spirits coming down trying to substitute something for the word of God God has no substitute for his word it is eternal and forever hear this one God has nothing to substitute faith faith has no substitute hope will never take the place of faith faith is alone Faith stands alone faith is one thing hope is another thing hopes hopes for it faith has got it oh give the Lord a shout faith is the substance of the things that you're hoping for hallelujah praise God one is intellectual faith and the others that direct Revelation from God it will never takes its place amongst a lot of people where emotions and so forth there come tatling backbiting all kind of ungodly thing he said somebody saying this is not right that's not right if you chase it down nine times out of 10 the very person making that St is not right God hates Discord among Brethren be reverent be holy love God and stand by him my Hallelujah watch so you don't know you do know you're not right with God when you're still backbiting lying doing everything you can't be right with God I don't care how much churches you belong to until your soul becomes converted he said now watch he said when he gets into God he watches his life with God's word and realize he is lined up with every bit of it watch something his thoughts is pure his intention are pure his alternative is right and he knows he's line up with the God's word all hell can't move him he's lined up with the word of God he's got Divine love Purity in his heart for every man and woman he's abstained from the things of the world oh praise the name of the Lord and B he's talking about when Jesus talk about uh uh Eat My Flesh and drink my blood he say he never explained it too many parasites yet so he wanted these parasites of ministers to get rid of them so he throw the bum accept it my my blood them parasites you say too many parasites parasites got up and walk away no more but Abraham says he says watch this now God has been trying to get over to the church without seeing it right out it's a thing something you ready almost done sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might tin down it might bring some to go out some to leave some to ponder over but that is done purposely it must be done that way then it might be some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did he does that yet he said one day when he had thousands around him begin a play when you're thousand around him he said except you eat the Flesh and drink my life um drink the Flesh and and something like that what kind of statement do you think the medical doctor or nurse or any intellectual person eat his flesh he cannibal and his whole audience walk away from him friends butam prophesied there'll be a persecution of the church the church will be closed down and I'm thinking about it what persecution does during the Dark Ages the real Christians were those who died during the Dark Ages they were torn aunder they were head were cut off they were burned at the stake they did them all kind of even wickedness but they were the real Christians the other church members who saw that they said no no no no no I out of that persecution brings a separation from those who are sincere and true and committed so this persecution is like going to be like a final separation a separation to separate those who really believe from those who don't believe friends this message is real this message is true but the bandam says that if these things doesn't happen he's a false prophet he's not a false prophet Los Angel could sink at any time do you know that changes everything Russia lose a weapon that's why I bring the news I'll bring it to you I wanted to get a little video clip to show you what it looked like but I didn't get you with that but the thing about it we are going through treacherous Waters and I want you to take
