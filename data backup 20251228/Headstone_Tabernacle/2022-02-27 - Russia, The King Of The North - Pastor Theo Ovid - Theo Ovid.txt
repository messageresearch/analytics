here this morning and if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to daniel chapter 11. we want to read from verse 15 to 24 daniel chapter 12. we want to read one and two revelation 7 when we read from verse 1 to 4. read in daniel 11 reading from verse 15. so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any strength to withstand but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the glorious land by which his hand shall be consumed he shall also set up face his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he shall give him the daughter of woman corrupt in her but she shall not stand on his side neither before him after this shall he turn his face onto the isles and shall take many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him then he shall turn his face towards the forth of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and not be found then shall stand up in his estate eraser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom but within a few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battle but in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries and with the arms of a flood shall they be overthrown from before him and shall be broken ye also the prince of the covenant and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people he shall enter peaceably even with the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done for his father's father nor his father's fathers he shall scatter among them the pray and spoil and riches ye he shall forecast his devices against the strongholds even for a time and he shall still up his power and his courage against the king of the salt with a great army and the king of the soul shall be stood up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall not stand for they shall forecast devices against him he they shall feed the portion of his meat shall destroy him let me read again yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain and both these king's hearts shall be to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet the end shall be at the time appointed then shall we turn into his land with great riches and his heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits and return to his own land at the time appointed he shall return and come towards the salt but it shall not be as deformer or as the latter for as the ships of chittim shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and returned have indignation against the holy covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall make place the abomination that make it desolate and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupted by flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits and they that understand among the people shall instruct many yet they shall fall by the sword by the flame by captivity by spoiled amenities now when they shall fall they shall be halted with a little help but many shall cleave to them with flatteries some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge and to make them white even to the time of the end because it is yet for time appointed and the king shall do according to his will he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvelous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that is determined shall be done neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of woman nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all but in his estate shall he honor the god of forces and a god whom his fathers knew not shall be honored with gold silver pressure stone unpleasant things thus shall he do in the most strongholds but strange god whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many shall divide the lamp again and at the time of the end shall the king of the salt push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots with horsemen with many ships he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over he shall enter into the glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but thee shall escape out of his hand even edem and moore and the chief of the churn of ammon he shall stretch forth his hand upon the countries and the land of egypt shall escape but he shall have power over treasures of gold of silver over all the pressure of things of egypt and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps but tidings out of the east out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with fury to destroy and utterly to make away many he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas and the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the churn of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that is found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life something everlasting shame and everlasting contempt final scripture revelation chapter 7 1-4 after these things i saw four angels standing in the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor any tree and i saw another angel sailing from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a lord voice to the four angels to whom it was given to her the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the tree still we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and i hear the number of them which was sealed and they were sealed a hundred and forty four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel may god bless this word you may be seated praise god thank you again for being here oh blessed be the name of the lord well i have a title this morning russia the king of the north praise god that's the title of this morning i'd have an inspiration to compliment that the seal in time praise the name of the lord russia the king of the north praise god you know guess by now all the lord the news about russia invading ukraine praise be to jesus so we're not talking about putin we're not on him we're talking about russia amen that that that that king now of russia all right so just want to share this with you and we're going to head straight into the way your obedience to god proves your spirit whenever the word comes it's not just come to hear you could hear it and you know a lot of people hear the word but they're not possessing it the same way you know like you tell a child you could tell you have your own children and you can tell the child um you can't make it and those same words you can't make it have two different effects on two different type of children the one child that hears that they can't make it that that that's just flow them another child will prove that they could make it just because you said you coming it's the same words but how it is processed you see same words same gospel but how which is received how it is applied amen isn't that right because if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe it so the word just come forward that is not a story book the word always come for you to apply and only in your application it could become effective that's why jesus said describing pharisees they preach the word of god of no effect they make the word of god of no effect whatever they do they're playing game with words but it's not effective so when the word come the way it's supposed to come it's supposed to have an effect upon your life it's supposed to shake you make you tremble praise be to jesus right now in ukraine a 44 all elected president who never had any political experience standing there as a war president and people admire him for his courage because mighty russia thought they was going to overrun him a long time ago and he's still standing but isaac was telling me biden offered him to get out to extract he and his family out and he said no i don't need that lift i need more weapons to fight i like that kind of thing praise god you have courage who are you fighting in russia russia have all the arms and things and think of this man fighting and the question we have to ask what are you fighting for you're fighting for anything praise god we need a war in trinidad praise god and a war going on right now praise god some of you comatose award the devil knock you out you have to fight but as i was telling my woman who never hold gun before holding gun people protect a known family i'll fight for my family i carry no enemy come in my land and run me out i go fight praise god what about the bride praise whatever you're going to try to fight fight for your healing fight for your breakthrough fight free deliverance missile pelting every night walking at demons attacking you all kind of spirits but you have to fight on what i want to show you have to fight back oh give the lord some praises this morning hallelujah praise god hallelujah glory to god the angels was told to hold back hold your hand hallelujah don't move hoping i know full destruction until the people be sealed there's going to be a ceiling time i'll revelation 7 talk about a cell 144 000 seal those are jews to be sealed but before those jews are sealed there's a gentile bride to be sealed nobody could take that out not a gentile book sitting with books and tapes a gentile bride to be sealed with the same holy ghost they were sealed within their pentecost what give the lord our prayers glory though god here come the pump information i come to pump revelation that you are going to be sealed and there is going to be a ceiling time oh get ready get ready get ready oh glory to god if russia make a move that bright making a move through okay the lord i shout hallelujah replace your put your foot is yours every place you put your foot is yours oh god if you want to stay as you are that is your business but there's going to be a lady she is elected to fight she's elected to contend she's elected to press away i look at what your family say but your neighbors say what church members say forget about them what god said about you the people that know their god shall be strong and do great exploits may be seated praise god praise god so those angels holding back that'll hold back putin hand out the way back biden hand that hold back germany and china and every big shot they have there to hold back all their hand because the bride have to come into position to receive a sign the receiver mark to receive oh god have mercy the income writer have to ride again don't sit there and look at me like i don't know what i'm talking about god have promised me no church pew glory no good you think i'm trying to stay all the time sharing words sharing word oh god we're coming to get ready to leave

tumor over kidney disease over diabetes over blindness over every manner of sickness or give the lord a shout over depression over frustration although all kind of filthy demons [Applause] hallelujah brother branham from three can i believe is i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a song from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her off the earth i see no fightful day you know i see no man please myself there you know there'll come a song from where from the pulpit no from heaven that will bring a baptism into that bride you have to get a baptism say it out loud i have to get a baptism say it again i have to get a baptism one more time i have to get a baptism that's what you have to get a baptism of god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god praise god i feel fire in the building this morning [Applause] all right russia only recognized a place in the world no more than 40 years ago they were a bunch of ignoramuses big old siberians would bear over their face and did no right hand from left russia and she recognized her place she had to do it to fulfill the scripture you know my prophecies of what i said what happened how all of them would gather in communism now she leads the world in science we are way back behind her all the rest of the world is behind her she leaves her place she just recognized she had some brains too the reason russia came to herself she had to just like israel had to get to the homeland god had to drive israel back to the homeland for the trumpets oh glory to god and god had to drive the bride back to the homeland for the thunders the god of the bride together to give the right feet to show them how to prepare oh give the lord a shout i feel a rumbling inside of here this is the word we are preaching we're not telling you something new we tell you something that is fresh for the hour so did god have to drive russia up there in communism to do exactly what being prophesied to do why did russia wake up why did the nations wake up and i asked a question what about the bride right hannah and they were sleeping you said we'll take them seven thunders to break up the bride oh god it will take them seven unknown thunders gonna be he will send it he promised it he said the people would forget their queens and dogmas and play the promised god you promise it you can't lie you promise that you've got to send it you've got to sign it today war is coming [Applause] whoa wars rumors of what jesus prophesied we're living in the end time hallelujah watch the past 25 years israel just recognized that they were in the homeland for something it was prophesied they'll be gathered together who's here said so at the same time the bride has recognized the evening light just begin to recognize the hungry pentecost remember the last quote we read to share with you about it shall be like the preaching the word but no manifestation and then even time it shall be light the light is when the word becomes vindicated and manifested it is light to vindicate the word so it can't just be word word word would it have to be a manifestation and you see that your man don't want to go to because you see you'll take god to do that you see man could come with brains and explain and teach it for four or five hours but you see when the fire fall when you know hours when you go to the scripture it rests like it really like this when the day of pentecost was fully come fully come they were in one man and one accord all of a sudden some bishop walking to explain some mysteries no the mysteries came long as fire all of a sudden there was a sound from heaven like a russian mighty rim and tongues of fire licking every one of them and they were filled with the holy ghost that nothing to do with stopping drinking stopping smoking stopping going here no they were filled with the holy ghost fire came and burned the demon out fire came and busted the snake out fire came and break every desire it was fire from the altar it was fire from god it was fire from heaven it could take that same fire to come down the same fire that came out of mount sinai the same fire that knocked paul the same fire that was in the holy church that same fire has to come back to anoint the sons of god in the last days we'll give the lord a shout glory to god do you understand that man in in ukraine he said putin wanted to kill him he and his family he on the top of the list he get an opportunity to get out he said no send more weapons i want to leave here let me tell you something i don't want to leave here right now i don't want no coronavirus take me out sickness cancer i want to stay right here give the devil some jamming praise god praise god come on oh come on saints of god i want to leave you and go up you're not right now but tall it'd have too much of drama down here oh glory to god god raised up a bride the challenge yet i mean this last days oh glory to god come on there's more land to be taken there is more land to possess oh don't be tired don't be wary oh gloria rise and shine for thy light has come yeah this bomb god has recognized that there's a people on earth that he has predestinated the life god can't leave you god can't abandon you god can't give up on you oh god have mercy on glory to god you're hanging there for years oh glory gloria don't give up now don't let go now he knows the other people on the earth oh glory to god amen sister helen hallelujah he knows there are people on the earth that he has predestinated the life glory of god glory national force put israel in the homeland national force will put the church in the world congress churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride not this tabernacle not this minister not this pastor but the power of god going to put you power into the bride how many want to be in the bride if you missed the bride you're hitting tribulation you know whole glory to god do all the bombs and nuclear things for them [Music] oh i've got to put the people in the bride the world forces this way the wolf force is that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and light so if you find yourself groveling on the ground you need the spirit because the spirit has pushed you upwards if you're growing into your flesh because you're fresh and your human spirit is growing you know it'll keep you down it takes us force that was you said no man can come except the father draw you can just come just so who says so try it now you can just come you have to be ordained to come who all the father had given me shall come oh give the lord i shout you shall rejoice just to get the opportunity to sit here to hear the word of god or you won't listen out there to hear this word a divine calling [Music] glory holy glory church you're living in the best day you ever will live in now until jesus come it will get rapidly worse and worse when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do we are ready for it then i wonder what it is oh glory to god when russia began to make its move the bride have to make a move too oh glory to god what do you think i'm talking about this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to god let's continue but abraham at that time michael just stand up the great prince would stand up for the churning of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since the nation until that time you say aren't you glad your name is on his book and when daniel saw him he come to the ancient of days whose hair was white as well he opened the books and they would judge every man out of the books the great white shone judgment now dania is given this assurance at the end time of the gentile dispensation at the end of the gentile dispensation read the 11th chapter of ezekiel you can see how the king of the north is coming down which is nothing else but russia coming down to press against it like a whirlwind and the great battle of armageddon will be fought right there at the gates of jerusalem oh glory to god how many in here remember i tell you watch russia watch russia the king of the lord watch russia king of the lord king of the lord how many heard me say that watch russia the king of the north see every isn't going to heap up into russia oh glory to god why russia has nothing to do with the antichrist nothing that's communism the falsely of protestants and catholicism has produced communism the reason russia had drawn them out of there because they had all the money all the prayers to them saints they build the biggest buildings had all the wealth and bundle it up and they lived no different and was not different from the rest of the world so russia throw them out and not make russia form communism because of catholicism criticism i'll prove to you that communism is working straight in the hands of almighty god to destroy the roman system remember i say this as god's profit you ready the russian empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the vatican city and destroy it in one hour thus saith the lord this is not feel this is not a prediction this is thus saith the lord it's going to happen oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah praise be to jesus give him some praises [Applause] [Music] oh glory to god let me read it for you in revelation 18 i'll read it from you i said as free from the kings of the earth who are committed fornication live deliciously with her shall be wheeled her alarm and for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning [Music] standing up for her for fear of atonement seeing alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come oh hallelujah and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man by the merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver pressure stones pearls fine linen and purple silks colored wood all manner versus of ivory precious wood brass iron marbles cinnamon all those ointments frankincense wine oil fine flour wheat beast sheep horses chariots slaves souls of men and the fruits of thy soul lusted after are departed from there the merchants these things were made rich by her saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and deck with gold and pressure stones and pills for in one hour so great riches has come to note and they cried when they saw the smoke of a burn and say what city is like unto this great city and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wheeling saying alas alas the great city wherein we all miss rich but he said rejoice over her thou heaven and he holy prophets and apostles for god had a venge you of her and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it in the sea saying those seered violence that shall great city babylon be overthrown down shall be found no more at all and the voice of the harpers and the musicians and the pipers and the trumpeters shall be heard no more one hour oh hallelujah it's already fixed nothing will change it god can't cancel it it is written and it is prophesied oh give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god amen hear the prophet now and i read done in revelation 13 chapter talk about america now another beast come out of the earth out of the thickness and moldy jews and people in water talking about america two was like a lamb and then afterwards he spoke like a dragon took one america now and he exercised all the power the first beast had before him the red dragon and caused all that was on the earth that dwell upon the earth to worship the beast and he does great wonders to make fire come down from heaven the atomic bomb hydrogen smart intelligence the united states will come to a time that church and state will unite together that way you get this religious right and this so-called conservative group in america that want to see what uh what things are and how it's supposed to be and so on the plane straight into god's hand church and state has been a part but listen to the prophecy the united states will come to a time that church and state we unite together how else could they close this down if it's neutral everybody see me but they're bible religious you know and whatnot but when they state and church then they say we are fanatics we little bit cuckoo because we say they're off we say that as the image unto the beast so then they have no choice but to close us down it's coming you know do you just watch me like if it's not coming it's coming you know it is coming watch let me say again the united states will come to a time that church and state will unite together and the protestant and catholic will throw their things together to fight communism fighting putin and god anointed putin but the commentary to fight that this is what the prophet says and it's exactly plain in the hands of what god said right here and you pentecostals protestants sung asleep reading love story magazine instead of your bible instead of a prayer meeting somewhere fasting at one another about little old petty things that don't matter much you should be on your knees somewhere oh glory to god when i see these things happen i kind of wonder you know if i was there what it like you have so much these have no so much african study in there and the embassy they take everybody running for

bull a shame of itself or send jesus right quick that's the end is here lord there's there's only two things left to be done we must eat right away for we know it's at the end either we see a mighty something rise out of the way or see the coming of the lord all prophecies is fulfilled the last thing before the church is resurrected was the coming fought to the messenger to the laodicean to church and he shall turn the hearts of the people back to the early fathers and listen to these words get them back to the regular pentecost what they claim to have there was thousands time thousands like it wasn't these are noah lord that would be lost many of them would be lost we see it already fulfilled father come lord jesus catch away your church and if it be your will lord just before the rapture may the rise power oh god fill these vessels raise them up shake the world once more we know it will be past time there'll be no more repentance then it will be too far for them but show your power lord tell those vessels and shake the world like it's never been shut before take a church then leave the world in this chaos how will they struggle just day before afternoon one of the greatest evangelical men in the world will set my room crying and receive the baptism of the holy ghost to make arrangements with billy graham to come to my house as soon as he come to louisville i got his name and thing to come over to seek and talk about the baptism of the holy ghost and its power not quoting this billy said in one place a woman standing crying with a big quaiter he said something struck him and he rushed forward to pray for i said what happened to me oh my god in the last days is going to draw true hearts from everywhere no matter how much counterfeit and chaff the devil has god will rise his church right out of it it will be a ceiling for sure as i'm standing in this platform you're going to rise this is how it going to be a ceiling for sure you mean this ceiling is really promised yes even if the businesses don't want to preach about it this is what is promised this is what you have to look for this is what you have to look to the hour is at hand the coal and formula is wearing away watch the evangelical and the social gospel and all these things are gone the fantastic side is going in such radical financing anybody blind could see it watch so is the church of the living god that's been borne down in the middle of fantasism and chaos but she found how she won the way through the grime until she's on top of the thing now spelling for the wings many shall run to and fro the people that know their god shall do great exploits in this day god's revelation to his church sets the little flock since the great jesus is saying keep holding on don't worry god is waiting trying pressing to get the mystery of god revealed to his church that is what is holding back the coming of christ now this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church because but around seven the poor begin to manifest it can't last more than 30 40 days the power among the people sleeping sins began to rise and appear the earth can't hold that anointing so go ahead and take it and take it away and leave the world without the holy spirit then people could do whatever in their heart whatever they want to do you have no spirit to restrain them oh my many man standing in the pulpit this morning preaching social gospel but dong in his heart he really believes and brother he has the power to preach it but what he wants to see is to put in its power in its beauty so glad to see it being made manifest the revelation of jesus christ you hear those words it's so glad to see it manifest the revelation of jesus christ not talking faith manifest hallelujah oh my it's just watch so he said the church is going to rise it will be a ceiling for sure almost done please watch the other kind heavenly father he's praying rude heart preaching of the word oh father god i'm so tired of listening to little hollywood baby-fied kid glove sermons that don't go down into the people's heart kind of coach it over come and join church god we want old fashioned repentance we want men and women to be rise and come to the lord we god we want to see this thing settled for this will be the last time that we'll ever be able to be mortal these are powerful words these are profound words this is the only time you'll be mortal this will be the last time and maybe the last chance that men and women here tonight will ever have have ever come into you this may be the ceiling time that's the one i want to underline so he said it would be a ceiling time for sure then he come and say you know this may be the ceiling time there may not be a mall tomorrow for many he's praying here then at that day i have to stand when this great night here it will be on the record of heaven i'll have to give an account for what i said and the people have to give account for how they responded lord tonight dozens hands or more went up seeking salvation god the word christ we pray that you'll receive them tonight and bless them save them from sin just now and in their heart that the purpose that they go to is building oh he says out into a modern babylon where someday she's got to be shook the and awaiting the means of persians are waiting in the gate he said our weight in the balance and from wanting when we hear tonight that a powerful nation that got more bombs and more planes and thousand times more men ready an ungodly nation who knows not god and they are ready to come from the to the east to the west and are capable of doing it and here we sit waiting in sin with a drunken party with whiskey and beer joints open drinking corrosion and the church being made fun of that's trying to get their garments washed in the blood of the lamb but making fun of it but the gifts of god have returned back great signs and wonders you said would follow the believer these signs shall fall and believe oh god he said wake up every unbeliever tonight to realize them so salvation oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise the name of the lord o glory to god hallelujah blessed be the lord here we go you say god bless you i love you if you want to see real genuine gifts not impersonation if you want to see where you started christians walking and so salty tell the person to be like that they all go down the street they act the same they talk the same all the time cracking jokes he said the first thing you know the time will come when god will give a message and you will be sealed in or sealed out the kingdom of god and i think i reach almost done to the final quote by the brown you see and today that's what the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come in the people's heart they don't recognize what it is they think it's still joining but that is the god of heaven living in you given you all the powers you are in possession of anything that he had so it is in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil the fruit of righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strife envy so forth turn away from it for that will take him from your heart if you will receive him embrace him love him hold him in your heart love him i can tell you the church together in that kind of power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the blind eyes and the death speak dumb speak the death here cripples walk blind see it is god in you it is deity and then they begin to sing amazing grace and they begin to pray this is the final quote you're gonna please something dear brother and sister remember he say the church could be lifted up right and there'll be a ceiling for sure isn't that right then he talked about it maybe the ceiling time listen to these words now dear brother and sister if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost this morning run into the kingdom of god as quick as you can the ceiling time is on stealing for sure time of ceiling and the ceiling time is on could it be on nor that the king of the naught has made that move the whole he
