praise lord the psalmist david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord and lord we thank you for waking us up this morning and lord making it possible through all our struggles our trials our ups and downs our situations that lord only by your grace we are here this morning lord we are not here to see or to be seen but father we are here to get a word from you father a word to speak to our situations or word to address our problems a word to minister to our conditions and to break the bands of wickedness and lord break the bands of evil and to show us where we need to go and what we need to do and what we need to say and how we ought to act and how we must live father me you anoint the word this morning anoint the reading of the word may you anoint the hearing of the word the speaking of the word may you take me out of the way and may you speak to your sons and your daughters lord may you straighten us up where we need straightening may you touch our bodies lord those that are sick and afflicted or those who are under pressure lord may you minister to us as the word goes forth may healing rain pour out in this sanctuary healing wayne pour out downstairs lord and those who are connected on the internet may the healing power of god minister to them wherever they are in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and the church says amen and amen and amen so i greet you this morning in the precious name of jesus christ and if you have your bibles you just want to read from one portion of scripture reading from revelation chapter 3 and reading from verse 11 revelation 3 and verse 11 behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown him that overcome it will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit say it unto the churches and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou would called or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and noah is not that wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning it's certainly a great privilege to be able to come to the house of the lord this morning it is what we do it is what motivates us it is what inspires us it's where we get encouragement is where we get a battle plan to face the week to face the month to face challenges it's where we get a word from the lord to deal with our situation because every answer for our lives is in the word of almighty god every answer to every situation can be found in the word of the lord the psychologist could try the psychiatrist could try counselors could try but in the word of the lord is the answer to every problem that you could ever find on this journey you could find the answer in the word of the lord amen and how blessed have we been in the midweek services there comes a time when your energy is not as strong as it was and then many people look back and say i wish i had done more i wish i had done more and that living with that regret of having the opportunity to do more and not doing more puts us in a very precarious position because one day we all have to give an account and we don't want to be found standing and saying i wish i had done more i wish i had prayed more i wish i had sacrificed more i wish i had done more so while there was strength and life in us we want to do all that we can do for the kingdom of god because heaven and earth will pass away but this kingdom of which we preach will never pass away it is from eternity it is eternal and if there's a seed germ in your soul there is something in you that will pulsate no matter what you did last week last year last month once you come in contact with the spirit and the word that seed in you has no choice but to respond because you have no control over the seed in you that's why the prophet said we are not even the believers but the word in us that we didn't put there that's the believer and that believing seed in our souls is programmed to respond a certain way because once you come in contact with the presence of almighty god and with the word of almighty god it does something to the seed in your soul you could try to cover it up you could try to hide it you could try to put the fire out with your work schedule and with family issues and drown yourself with problems but five minutes in the presence of god is all it takes for that seat to let you know i'm still there i've been waiting for a long time to be reminded and to remind you that you are called for a higher purpose you are not called to be defeated you are not called to be a church member you are not called just to be a message believer but you are called to be a participator and a partaker of his divine nature there's a nature that we are born to enjoy there's a life that we are born to enjoy and the devil's job is to try to keep us from that and he does a good job of that but we also have a job to do we have a job to worship we have a job to press we have a job to fight we have a job to achieve we have a job to succeed we have a job to overcome we have a job to contend for the fate we have a job to fight for our lives because the devil wants our lives but we have a job to fight for our lives you could choose to give up or you could choose to fight you could choose to worship or you could choose to have a pity party and i'd seen nobody know the trouble i've seen there's times to talk about the trouble but the bible tells us that the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the sufferings of not being able to pay the bills is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the sufferings in your marriage is not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us the sufferings on your job they are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us these sufferings are temporary pain is temporary sadness is temporary sickness is temporary being defeated is temporary having an identity crisis is temporary spiritual amnesia is temporary being down and out is temporary not knowing who you are is temporary [Applause] you may be seated had it not been for the fall of adam we would have been spoken into existence and we would have been spoken into existence with authority to speak to our situations but we bypassed our theophany and we came to this earth as a proving ground so that in satan's eden which he has had over 6 000 years to perfect god could deploy some secret agents who look like the world they go to work just like everybody else they go eat in places like restaurants with everybody else but there's something different about them there's a white light on the inside and there's an invisible light on the outside of so when you woke up this morning the devil's radar went crazy oh hallelujah when you woke up this morning before you even got off the bed the devil said he's up let's see what he's gonna do let's let's hope he stays defeated let's hope he worries about his pills let's hope he worries about his problems but but when you begin to say thank you lord for waking me up the devil say oh boy oh boy today looks like it's going to be a problem every move you do gives the devil a headache i say let us give the devil the biggest migraine he has ever had since jesus was in the wilderness let's confuse the devil let's confuse the devil this morning how do you confuse the devil by doing what he doesn't expect he may be seated that's how you confuse the devil by doing what he does not expect understand this the devil has one objective to keep you blind to your purpose because mr branham taught us the moment the bride gets to know who she is she's invincible that's very powerful because it means you are already something else than you could even see i'll say that again you are already something else that you cannot even see you got up this morning and looked in the mirror and you saw yourself but when god looked he didn't see what you saw oh you don't hear me this morning and when you got up this morning and the devil looked at you he didn't see what you saw because the devil understands the spiritual realm and when you're in the realm of the natural you see your pills you see your problems you see what happened and you're looking in the natural eye and the devil is saying don't open his eyes don't open his eyes don't let them see that he's a king don't let her see that she's a princess don't let them see that their sins are under the blood let them think that they are still tired like johnny crow let them keep walking around in circles but this morning no more circles this morning no more being defeated this morning no more wondering who you are come the church say man hallelujah hallelujah i'm just talking to you a little bit is that okay i'm inside of this service here but i can't we just having a conversation this morning just having a conversation with life and the struggles of life but the brandon preacher might say why are we so tossed about why why we have all these ups and downs and we go through this and all of that is is to try to keep us in this natural realm that is going to fade away one day and the boss that puts pressure on you he's anointed to put pressure the friends in your school they are anointed to do what they do your neighbor is anointed to make noise early in the morning your name is anointed to put on carnival music the maxi you go into is anointed a mac driver has a choice and he's operating under a law to do everything to influence you cause they're only two influences you either influence from above or your influence from below so everywhere you go it's not about family and friends and work and job it's about influence because you have been marked for a destination the devil un doesn't understand the full specification that defines your existence because the devil dealt with david and david made a mistake the devil dealt with moses and moses made a mistake it's just when jesus came it was an experience that the devil could never forget because this man suffered he wept he was hungry he went and suffered just as we as a man but the bible said he didn't sin and then jesus placed a seed in terms of some predestinated people and said because i live you are going to live also but he didn't tell you he did it because when you were born and you were going to school and you were going to work and you were in the bar and you were drinking you didn't even know that you were carrying a present that there was something locked up in you you didn't even know when you did what you did there was something in you so we come to service to find out what god put in us can the church say amen and every time you come to church and you hear the word is the seed in your soul saying that's me that sounds like they're talking about me wait a minute that's how i feel when i feel the anointing it makes me feel good it makes me feel satisfied if i could just have this all the time i'll be all right can the church say amen [Applause] oh hallelujah so i have a title this morning the rewards of the overcomers the rewards of the overcomers because when you overcome you ought to get something when you go to school and you overcome form one you cannot go to form two until you overcome form one if you don't overcome form one they will keep you in form one until at such time as you have overcome from one overcoming form one is required to experience form2 and when you overcome form two you're now ready for form three when i was in school they would keep people back if they didn't overcome the form because you have to pass a test to face another test but the objective of going to school is not to say i overcome form one overcome for you could produce your o-level passes and those passes represent the rewards of the overcomers [Music] now when people are in school there are many excuses and then the excuses disappear when you hear some people's story because there are people i remember when in school there were students who struggled with electricity but at the end of the five years they overcame some who had no electricity had more qualification than those who had electricity so electricity was not the differentiator or the lack of electricity was not a differentiator it was that those that overcame had a tenacity had a drive had a desire had a motivation there was something in them that said what my father went through i am not going to go through i heard somebody say a few days ago he said i grew up in abject poverty and i said to myself when my son drives a university he's gonna drive it on his first day in a mercedes-benz and he said what he said with his family they say he's talking to strappiness why are you talking so and he said i worked hard he's giving a testimony i worked hard and i lived to see the day my son went into university he drove it in a mercedes-benz and he was telling a group of people he said until you say it it could never happen he said the first step is saying it because when you say it it puts it out there and this man i don't know how much of a christian he is i don't know what his testimony is i'm saying but did he read the scriptures we read because my bible says if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it's going to do something and natural men break into spiritual principles about speaking into existence and walking into it what about the church of the living god when we know from the prophet's message that the spoken word is the original seed and we are commanded as sons and daughters to begin to speak i'm gonna make it i'm gonna overcome i'm gonna get the holy ghost my son is going to be delivered i could see him delivered i could see him jumping in the church that's how we ought to speak i could see him doing no more i can see nobody else doing normal like my son i can see nobody else shouting like my daughter i could see my wife walking into church one day and not knowing what put on to the house of god that's how we ought to speak that that's how christians speak that's how sons of god speak that's how daughters of god speak he may be seated so we talked about overcoming this morning life is a struggle that's a foundational fact of life it is designed to be a struggle it's a struggle for food if you study biology to say the strong survive so the lion who is slow and can't exhibit stealth he will need because as he moves through the jungle everybody hear him come in by tell me reach everybody go so depending on the situation that you have to overcome in you have to understand your terrain understand your challenge i would say to somebody recently that's why paul could say to the strong i became strong to the weak i became weak because you understood that to overcome in different situations you can't use the same tactic all the time bear in mind the end game is to get the o levels form one form two form three from four from five that's a journey but after the journey and their people the journey is different you know people who play sports in school i wasn't one of them the people who do different things and there's nothing wrong with that and the journey is great there are people at age 50 but real missed in primary school and it's almost like they wanted to go back to secondary school when they had no bills because they didn't take no bills no call from the bank to pay a credit card and they say school this was the best way to get best best but that was a stage in your journey because even all levels is a stage to prepare you for a job and life is about stages and god is also about stages see when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child when i became a man i want to go back to primary school when i became a man i put away the childish things when i become a man and listen age and getting older doesn't make you a man there's some 50 year old boy still in primary school because as you get older it should be you get more mature that's that's by design but that's not how everybody lives because we allow different situation and we and we try to preserve and change is what's hard we don't like interruption we don't like disruption we like to do things the same way so whenever change comes it makes us feel uncomfortable but god is a god of change you call abraham he say abraham leave your family leave your comfort zone and come follow me abraham had no idea where he was going he was being challenged to change and and coming into this walk i want to call it this walk not church coming into this walk it requires a mindset of change of growth of development of having to overcome and pause it this way i die daily so this overcoming we are speaking about is a daily overcoming [Music] it's overcoming when the pastor is not there to see you overcoming when the deacon is not around it's overcoming when nobody from church is there and you are confronted with decisions and you are challenged to overcome we're gonna we're gonna get to the deeper part i'm just i'm still talking to you this morning because people tell me i'm struggling and i'm struggling and they say it as if it's not supposed to be that way as if the alternative to struggling is is somehow not struggling and that doesn't exist struggling is a permanent state of existence for the believer you struggle to pray you you struggle to seek the lord you you struggle to because we are in a warfare [Applause] and until we put the devil firmly under our feet it will always be a battle every inch of ground you intend to take will be a struggle a struggle in your marriage a struggle in your finances or struggle in your prayer life a struggle to praise a struggle to worship that's why david said we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord sacrifice his struggle you have a choice to make to live or die to worship or stay dead to give god praise or stay where you were but to him that overcome it i have rewards for the overcomers hallelujah [Applause] he may be seated the challenge i have is people who look at those who study remember school he's a real nerd boy only books only books you need books i saw some young people buckle under that pressure i know i no no no i come in i come in and play and life is choice so when you're confronted with the situation if you leave your books because your friend's telling you you're the year you're a nerd and you don't want to be another when the end result come and there's some students who they play all day in school but at night the beaten book you have all kind of at night they've beaten a real book and when the results come and say well you was playing all the time how do you get nine ones i was studying that night no you can't get vex with somebody who put the time and effort into achieving it god told you shall meditate on the word day and night and you will have good success you can't convex with somebody who have good success because they meditate really good day and night see a man bless he is god ready like him that is why he getting a blessing and you don't know the hours here in the word when in his secret closet when he's not looking for attention and nobody there but he crying and holding on to the horns of the altar because the bible told us pray in secret so that the god that sees in secret will reward you openly all of that is a struggle but to make time to pray to make time to study to make time to be a christian you have to overcome how you manage your time you have to overcome the demands of your life your work your commitments i remember when i was in university soon the bell ringer i had no bell but soon class then i out i had no reason to stay to do what to do what and i saw young people go to university and when class done time the lime lime to do what after all these years what's the equal sign from that lime what is the end result what do you have to show for all the hours you spend lime in what is the equal sign of time not spent into what is eternal because when you spend time into what is temporal there will never be anything to show for it but when you spend time in the eternal there's an eternal house there's an eternal road with gold on it there's a there's an eternal testimony because you are investing in your in who you really are can the church say amen is this helping anybody this morning [Applause] in the message christ is revealed in his own word i'm going to take my time this morning so buckle your seat belts i wasn't feeling 100 good this morning but now i feel 100 good brother kangali there's some viruses going around he never thought he would have had me this morning but i really want to appreciate my wife with some ginger tea without sugar this morning and some warm water with apple cider vinegar and just what the doctor ordered to give the devil trouble so if you need to take apple cider and water if you need to ginger tea or green tea or whatever you take you make sure you come into the house of the lord to at least gum the devil if you have no teeth if you're walking on a cane use a cane as a weapon but whatever you got like shambler he just had an ox code and he used what he had because there was a cause there was a need there was a situation your heart palpitatin will take it easy but keep coming blood pressure low take it easy but keep coming back pressure high take it easy but keep coming but whatever you do keep on moving every day you're getting closer to your inheritance closer to your portion and when it looks like you're getting older every step you're really getting younger because there's another body waiting for you a spiritual body to hold the seed in your soul that you are temporarily carrying because these 16 elements one day there'll be no more but we are from another place another dimension a place where there's no sickness no sadness no depression no fear no confusion no mortgage no bills no ups and downs that's where we come from and david he's waiting for me joshua is waiting for me moses is waiting for me to find out how you made it over how did you survive 2018 how did you survive this internet age somebody preached back to me can we give the lord a shout out praise [Applause] and this is my inspiration here this morning from the message christ is revealed in his own word preaching jeffersonville august indiana 22nd 1965 knowing that what we say this morning we mustn't just say because we are gathered together to just haphazardly speak on anything but it is it's something that will help stabilize the people listen why we leave the stabilization for we are going to pass through dangerous treacherous waters we're already sailing through them and sometimes i guess it's with you like it is with me so the prophet is saying the what is he going through i don't know how it is for you but i can tell you what me is that it seems like so much of it it's such a scary so the prophet as a now this is 1965 this is after the see this is after numerous visitations of angels and the prophet is saying we want to say something this morning because we're gonna pass through some dangerous waters we're gonna pass through moments in our lives that we can't explain that we don't understand say lord why me why i have to go through this i've served you all these years why my children are struggling serve you all and god is saying those treacherous waters just keep on walking just keep on walking just keep on praying just keep on pressing because for all of your family that's not here you are the wave sheep you are who's holding on for your brother holding on to your sister all and on for your family and god has not forgotten you those things that i revealed belonging to us and to our children can the church say amen so you are born to overcome you are born to be successful i'm not just talking about natural success you are born to be successful brother branham said it like this you are ghost advertisement board so when people want to see jesus god already sent sons and daughters who are going to advertise if you are an advertisement board for god then you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth because the purpose of an advertisement is to bring people to buy the product that you are advertising and this product that we have has no price but it's a good product people just don't know how good it is people just don't know how good jesus is people don't know that there's a solution when you're sick you don't need to go by the doctor and people need to know so this morning i'm just somebody i'm nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody who could save anybody i want to be a good advertisement for jesus i want to be a good representative of the kingdom and for me to be a good representative i've got to be on fire i've got to have joy i've got to have the holy ghost i've got to have seven living voices [Music] can the church say amen so you are born to overcome overcoming is built in the fact that you are here already speaks of the fact that you're an overcomer because you couldn't just come to this church this morning unless god called you you couldn't be here this morning unless god spoke to your heart there are many churches you could go to but not this one for you to come to this church this morning there has to be something in you that's connected to your eternal destination this is not a catholic church not a methodist church not a pentecostal church these are a body of believers with three kinds of believers but i'm not speaking to the make believer this morning or the unbeliever to spawn him because only the true believers can overcome but the branham said god can only prove his word by true believers so there's got to be some true believers who believe in their hearts that deliverance will not come from man it will come from god himself up he will raise the winds he will bring the storms up he will bring the earthquakes up but he will have every sun every daughter every predestinated seed i don't care where they're at this morning they have got to come oh give the lord a shout or praise somebody give him praise this morning you are going to be healed you are going to be delivered you are going to overcome you are going to get the holy ghost the pillar of fire is gonna visit your house the pillar of fire is gonna visit your job the pillar of fire is gonna visit your son the pillar of fire will visit your daughter it's got to happen how do you know god said it the prophet spoke it that settles it for me this morning and this morning the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy we are saying what the tapes say [Applause] i'm not crazy i'm not crazy i've not lost it enough i want to lose it some more i want to lose myself in the love of god i want to lose myself in the goodness of jesus i want this thing to run over i want this cup to run over till everybody must know this person is different this young man is different this young woman is different can the church say amen you are going to overcome young brother young's sister i don't care what the world offers you it's built in in you to overcome the desires of this world you may be seated the fashions the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life it's built in you to overcome it's built-in don't tell me you can't do it don't tell me you can't dress like a christian don't tell me you cannot act like a christian don't tell me it is hard it's not hard for you because you are built to struggle it's hard for listen it's hard for a cat to fly ever punch it's hard for a car to fly it's not built to fly but do you know it's also hard for a plane to fly because when a plane takes off it must pass the sound barrier it must break out of gravity that's not easy it's hard the difference is the plane is built to fly let me say it another way if you look at a fish until you fish hey climb this tree the fish will always be a failure because the fish wasn't built to climb the tree but a young boy climb the tree it'll take a while for him to get comfortable without the climatry because if anything you don't know is difficult anything that's new it'll take some time some experience some experimentation some experiential learning for you to to be able to do it so the difficulty will always exist the difference is if you are built to do it and that's what we're seeing this morning you are built to overcome you are built to break past gravity you are built to break past like the lily who could press through the pond that lily is built for it so when it bounces it pushes through the mud it pushes through the mire it pushes through the filth and it breaks out and that's what we want to do this morning break out break free break past every limitation break past every obstacle now if you know your destination and you know what you're built to do and you what you are built for how could you get caught up in petty nonsense well i answer him back because he didn't tell me something and then i did really and then you look fat you know i say you didn't look fit but you are built for a higher purpose i said young people nobody nobody can make you do anything your actions are always your choice [Music] you ever seen people trying to fake fight or fight hold me back hold my back hold me back and half the time he's saying hold on the fright man hold me back just hold on why ate him he he he tell me he did you have to accept responsibility for every action every word you can't blame your wife you can't blame your husband you can't blame the boss you can't believe attack the driver you should vex your vex your vex you wish to church vex for this taxi driver this would have to do with your walk with god usually you vex somebody shake your hand and you they have the service they take you a whole half service to walmart all have you missed the whole half of the service because you just dealing with brothers so and so didn't greet you downstairs and for the whole half service usc and the preacher the song leader you seen this brother so and so pass you straight and it's a loop in your mind does it danger of your mind you know be transformative renewing of your mind just reboot reset say lord reset this computer be transformed by the renewing of your mind somebody to reboot your mind cast on reason cast down imagination cast it down and when you come to the house of god you're not coming to friends you're not going to see people you're coming for your inheritance you come for your portion [Applause] you come because your body and pain and the best place to be when he in pain is in the house of god because healing is a children's bread we eat healing for breakfast that's what we do it's our bread it's our food he is our shoe bread he is our god and if nobody wants to worship that's them that has nothing to do with me i was born to worship and the our commitment now is that the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth born to overcome born to worship want to put the devil under your feet hallelujah [Applause] it doesn't matter the situation in your job in your school it doesn't matter everywhere you go you have a testimony i said it in digo martin a couple months ago i said listen find out from your neighbors where's your testimony and if you don't have a testimony to your neighbors if they revisit it that's the money find out your testimony from your co-workers because if your co-workers not sure you're christian something wrong with your testimony listen don't don't have anybody guess who you are your neighbors must say listen that house right there that house is a christian house i tell you that holds a christian let it not be the day have a service in by your house you might say wait i didn't know there was christina i didn't even know i know you know you're singing really really and that's why some of us have a challenge inviting people to children because when you invite people now people who around here can now hold you more accountable i was i was already doing a commission of inquiry into the inviting ratio and for the source of the problem because if you have a testimony becomes easy because people are asking why you're so happy why there's trouble in the economy but yet still you're happy you see what the lord is my provider how do i come in contact with that lord who provided for you because all of us are in trouble but if he if you have somebody who could bribe you i want to meet him too inviting people to the house of god should be the easiest thing to do because this is the best product you could ever touch this is the only product that have healing salvation redemption adoption deliverance and even stuff that hasn't been displayed yet missing limbs being restored is part of our package that we got in this age only how hard is it and when you could tell somebody and the best spot get free you have to pay for it just come and worship just come and enjoy just come and dance just come and sing just come and shout let's come and give god praise there's no cost there's no price he died for you [Applause] give the lord a shout of praise i haven't even gotten to the message i was still having a conversation one day military will just break from the church into the eternal realm you might forget you say you know as brother raymond said last week he said enoch was walking with god and then one day his foot just hit the king's highway oh my oh what a thought he just walking and then one of your foot hit the king's highway one of these morning between six and nine you'll be on your road to the maxi on the taxi and your foot will hit the king's highway and we'll be gone i'm looking for that day is there anybody else looking for that day then can you come and go with me to my father's house where there's joy unspeakable and full of glory [Applause] all right you may be now let's go back to genesis god in his mind because you see the challenge is this when people get things easily you lose it easy i say that again when you get stuff easy you lose it easily so there are many stories of businessmen who started with nothing and their sacrifice and when he heard a story they say they eat bake and butter for 10 years 15 years to work to build something up they sacrifice but their children didn't understand or went through the sacrifice that they went through so when the time company children to take over the business there are many businesses that took 14 years to build up and two years to go down because there was no sacrifice to build there was no pain in growth so jesus and god himself rather when adam was put in a garden of eden adam didn't earn anything he didn't earn character from experience from pain but on the other side he had jesus blood obedience by the things that he suffered but adam it was handed to him on a platter with a george essay and because of how it was gotten it could have been easily lost and god pledged it will not be like that ever again for power to reach to anybody they must have character and to get character character comes by trials by by giving you exams by putting you under pressure to see how you would handle certain situations because if you don't prove how you will handle it so the promises of an overcomer that was built into scripture adam could have never enjoyed because he had never overcome anything just like the angels never had anything to overcome adam had no trials no tests no problems no sufferings no financial problems no problems in his marriage no all the animals listen to him none of the animals batchat when the mountains were spoken to the mountains moved adam had nothing to overcome adam could have never been called an overcomer because there was nothing to overcome everybody with me adam had a book of names and adam's mission was just a call from this book of names in the time and season and they were going to be made manifest but adam fell in sin before he had the chance to call one name can the church say man but in that book in the book that adam had but the branham said there's a category of that book which he tied to scripture he says in revelation 3 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raymond and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels so there's a section of the book that has do not remove that their names could never be blocked out because they overcome you know what it is to know that you overcome and god say listen you overcome that name could never come out because that type of overcoming god honors that type of overcoming somebody preach back to me so one of the rewards of the overcomers is to hear that overcome it the shame shall be clothed in white raymond and i will not plug out his name so am i preaching the overcomers this morning [Applause] and for those of you who have been low on the overcoming scale you try to overcome sometimes you want to overcome some things and you want to overcome the things that you want to overcome but the thing that you don't want to overcome you don't want to overcome you say life is about choice so things you want to overcome you want to anything to do that that you enjoy you want blessing with a nice car loader you know overcome and if i get the car deal everything together you're wonder overcome you overcome your driver's license your over you go by the bank and you say lord pray for me i want to get his bank loan to get the car you overcome that he's tangled and you overcome everything to do with what you like you happy to overcome it thank god for the victory the bank gave you a hard time but he's able to script to get any money to millions of dollars for the kanye getty car you overcome this the bank manager was saying you overcome the bank manager and once it's what you want you happy to overcome and i say you overcoming i overcome into agerica but the overcoming i'm talking about is overcoming in every area of your life overcoming when you don't feel like praying but you still pray anyhow overcoming when you want to answer back but you're overcome and you stay silent that's the overcoming we don't really want to do you know because it goes against our very nature you overcome when you want to feel like staying homeish but you overcome that and you press your way to come to the house of god that's overcoming you overcome when you open your wardrobe and you look at your clothes and recognize wait now this girl's a little too short i have to overcome and burn it finally amen after you're overcoming here dress under here just to tell you well let me just clip the ends or somebody preach back to me are we having church this morning and you overcome and see don't worry about them ends the lord will take care of the end of my oh come on somebody preached back to me this morning can we talk about overcoming overcoming when the boys come to the young sisters and say you're pretty and you're beautiful oh nobody never told you how good you look and you overcome and you walk away because you know you are a princess you born of a king and god has a prince for you you overcome born to overcome every temptation every desire every opportunity that the devil presents your way you overcome it because you are born to overcome overcome the music but it was a nice song it it is a nice song it's slow it it's it'll put you in what mood but you overcome overcome the music that's supposed to be christian music too that makes you want to dance not like a christian but the devil using all it is too to pull you down and you overcome that and say that's not what motivates me [Music] your appetite is changing your desires changing you don't want to look sexy that's not your objective you reject that you overcome that you're bigger than that you're more precious than man you overcome [Applause] do he see me yet still i trust him i'm an overcomer but they laugh at me in school you are an overcomer let them laugh it does not matter born to overcome [Applause] i said it to him and many youtubers that say young sisters you don't need to put on makeup or semi makeup or have makeup or quarter makeup god made you beautiful as you are if those worldly ladies need makeup to look good that's them that's not you feel sorry for them you need a drink to be a man smoke to be a man run woman to be a man that you overcome all of that and that's the baby stop because the privacy present your bodies a living sacrifice that's your reasonable service reasonable [Music] [Applause] having a testimony too many of us are too carnal we in the flesh too much and it's impossible to be in the flesh if you're in the world and you're praying and you're tyrion and seeking the lord it's impossible for you to get off your knees and say but where you touch my thing for if you were praying and that's your quick response from praying i don't know what anointing you was just praying but when you're praying are you getting on something they say they say i don't know lord is this a test right after praying this has to be a test can you go back and pray and he let god work it out say lord i leave this one to you because if i handle it i will handle it wrong so i want to get back and it's a different consciousness it's conscious that everywhere you go god goes with you when you walk into your job he is looking there for you and if everywhere you walk you know he's there how would we speak how would we live how would we act how would we dress what would we say the rewards of the overcomers so i'm speaking to overcomers because in every area of your life you must overcome hallelujah in the message how can i overcome but the man said i think that the church maybe should be taking this a step higher at this time and that's what i'm pushing for to go a little higher at this time and but ibrahim said in the same message how can i overcome now we're speaking on this overcoming word overcome of course you know what it means you've got to have something to overcome there is a goliath in all of our lives god set up stuff in our lives for us to overcome it will not be the same for you it will not be the same for you but there'll be stuff in your life some of us is gossip for some of us as self we just have so much self god waiting to break that self to pieces for some of us we just holy we in our minds we holy and we judge everybody by your standard not the word now by your standard i don't do this and that's why the upper room brought it equal and when we come to church there's no big you belittle me listen i am way nowhere above nobody you know i am here this morning preaching to myself so if you thought i was talking about you you're wrong i preaching to myself i want to be different i want to change i want to be a real christian in my heart i want to walk like him i want to talk like him i want to live like him i want to act like him i want to be like him when people see me they must not doubt that's a christian when they see me they must take note that i've been with jesus that's my desire is it your desire then if it's your desire may it be unto you according to your heart's desire i asked a question this morning if almighty god were to grant the desire of your heart right now what is that desire if right now we want to grant a heart desire what is your desire just this morning why did you come to church this morning is it to go back home is it to just be in church or is it to be changed to be transformed cut out the evil ways get closer to him to know who you are to want to change your appetite from the things of the world from your own desires and to say lord here i am here i lord send me lord i don't have much but i've given you all i have lord i'm in need this morning i've been coming a long time but i need something more this morning than yesterday [Music] i'm ready to overcome myself you know what the bible says when you lift your hand it's a sign of surrender when you surrender your efforts your activity lord i give up i've tried my own way but lord i surrender [Music] but abraham said you've got to have something to overcome and this church age that the holy spirit was speaking about here at the laodicean church age as we have been through it needed a rebuking laodicea had to be rebuked because it was different towards christ in other words the attitude towards christ was a little different it is not how it was supposed to be was not how it used to be but it was a little different and if you are here this morning and your attitude towards god is a little different then you need a rebuking it had put christ outside in their age and christ was on the outside trying to get back on the inside but the man said that's love and this morning he is he said if he said i stand at the door and knock and if any man here this morning open open his heart i will come in he's not trying to break down your heart he's had to break into your house into your family but he's there knocking on the door of your heart this morning so that you can overcome more than you've ever overcome before because greater is he that will be in you than he that's in the world is there anybody want to let him in this morning let him in every area of your heart he is still standing at the door this morning knocking on the doors of your heart young brother young sister father mother i don't care where you stand what you have done what you have achieved he wants to take over more of you than he has ever had before [Applause] don't reject him don't turn him away don't turn him away young sister don't turn him away young brother don't turn him away backslider don't turn him away unbeliever don't turn him away mama don't turn him away papa open up this morning he is knocking he wants to fill you with a wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost and fire [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i believe in my heart before this service is over healings will break forth i believe in my heart that before this service is over a backslider will be restored i believe in my heart before this service is over yes somebody could be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost on fire i ask is anything too hard for the lord this morning [Music] listen to the prophet he said that's love that's love people don't know what love is but he said that's love we were born for him to be there we are the ones who put him out but ibrahim said if you want to find god he said god is right wherever you left him because he will never leave you he said if you want to reconnect with god go back to where you walked away because it's not in god to walk away it's not his nature to walk away he's the one that goes after the one sheep he's the one that knocks on the door he's the one that oh come on somebody preach back to me it's not in his nature to abandon you he said i will never leave you i'll never forsake you so if you have lost your connection with god the prophet said walk back trace back your steps to where you left him because he will never leave you i don't feel the anointing anymore i don't feel i'm praying anymore i don't feel like don't blame god for that don't hold god accountable for that that's not on him that's on you reverse your steps walk back to the altar this morning and say lord i'm sorry for walking away i'm sorry for missing church i'm sorry for not praying and i'm coming back to the heart of worship i'm coming back i'm coming back to our heart of worship [Applause] we let our time get in the way we let our commitments get in the way and god is still there you still even when we walk away he is still knocking he is still knocking this morning he is still knocking this morning he is still knocking he's still knocking he's still knocking he's still knocking trying to get control control of your life because when he is in the control of your life the situations around you you can finally put it in your control when he is in control it gives you authority and power to be in control because he said i am the vine here the branches so when he is connected to you suddenly your world begins to change because you are connected to the source of power the source of authority the source of the spoken word is that what you came to church here this morning for or is it to go back home and live the same way you live last week let it not be another week living the same way no more walking around in circles doing the death walk as the prophet spoke about but this morning as for me and my house we will serve the lord i don't care if they are in the church this morning but as for me and my house we will serve the lord we will speak for our families we will call them names we will anoint deliverance we will apply the blood on our houses and they have to come because it's a promise the promise is unto you and to your children after them that are far off there's nobody that gone too far that god cannot pull back our god is a god of the impossible he's a god of deliverance he's a god of miracles this morning miracle working god supernatural healer mighty deliverer strong tower hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] he may be seated but the clarence we have the devil and the ropes and we're not gonna let up until he lets you go i'm sick and tired it has to come a point in your life that you are sick and tired of the way things are and the way things work and that drives you to change and it drives you to desperation stop accepting failure as your promise stop accepting defeat as your promise stop accepting it it's not yours your promises the holy ghost healing victory blessings bounty harvest that's your promise [Applause] he said i will be your god and you will be my people that's your promise hallelujah oh glory to god god bless you wherever you are this morning hallelujah our job is to make heaven high and to preach hell hot and to let you know that god has a day and a time and an appointment for you and if your name is on the book there is no devil there is no demon there is no past there is no situation that could stop you from coming to god he said my sheep they hear my voice my sheep they know my voice their sheep oh come on somebody preached back to me this morning hallelujah let us not be a tradition to you let us not be a routine for you let us not be something that you just do because you want to come to church and the road to hell is paved with good intentions people have good intentions plenty plans plenty things they want to do and good hearts good desires but god is not measuring heart and he's he's looking for that life if the desire the intention and the heart doesn't translate into a life it's not enough you have to overcome i want to continue but now notice his call here is not to just the church he that overcome it see not the church that would be she see the church body but it's he that overcome it and but the brand said overcome and keeps life in you so when you back up and backslide and say well because i'm under pressure that's why you're not seeing me and because under pressure i just going through something you're dying but overcoming keeps life in you overcoming keeps life in you overcoming keeps you alive the bible is a book of overcoming this message this morning is a message of overcoming when god in the beginning said let there be light that light had to overcome the darkness that was there the very first beginning of genesis and god said let there be light that's where overcoming started and the darkness had to back up because light and darkness cannot stay in the same house and if there's darkness in your house this morning we say let there be light in every house in every heart let there be light in every marriage let there be heart let there be light in every situation let there be light on your job let there be light in your school let there be light in your financial situation let there be light in your body and push back that darkness of sickness let there be light because light and tactics cannot stay in the same house if there's a darkness of doubt the tactics of unbelief the darkness of an identity crisis because you don't know who you are let there be light this morning [Applause] and see the darkness back up oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and when light comes darkness cannot stand a chance never never never stand a chance this morning may the light of the revealed word as brought by our prophet william branham shine in your life and push back the darkness the darkness of confusion the darkness of questions the tactics of wandering let the light of god shine in your family and bring healing to your house bring healing to your neighborhood bring healing to your situation he loves you he cares for you he wants to see you restored he wants to see you in power he wants to see you in authority he wants to
