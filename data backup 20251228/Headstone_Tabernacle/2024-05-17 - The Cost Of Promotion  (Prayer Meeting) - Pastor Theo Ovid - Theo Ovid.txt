waiting upon you Lord we feel like Shad Mish and abedo like Daniel apart from the rest of the world called by God Called to serve you in Babylon call to serve you amidst hell and the earth called to serve you amidst distresses and all sort of spirits raging and and running to and through and yet be are your people father in this world but not of this world may we find your Pavilion tonight may we find that resting place tonight in you in prayer and through prayer granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks so much for being here tonight I want to share something with you on the cost of promotion the cost of promotion and we just look at a one or two Bible characters and share some things uh we want to look at Genesis chapter 37 verse 28 Genesis 37 verse 28 you could find it or you don't have to find it but just just listen and this is and then we go to Genesis 4141 and this is Joseph um when he was sold and Joseph when he was placed over Egypt this is Genesis 37:28 then they they passed by the media it the merchant men and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt Genesis 4141 says and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt how come our is the cost of him being sold into slavy by his brothers to become second in command in Egypt we were Sinners and God gave us a promotion by justifying us and we were like dirty glasses and he picked us up by his own choosing and he chose to wash Us by the washing of the Water by the word and then choose to pour His Spirit upon us that he could fill us that is his objective to give you a promotion and when he was praying for Peter he didn't pray that he God take them out of the world but God will keep them in the world and one of the things he prayed for that their faith fail not because it will take Faith to go through these processes to get where you're supposed to be and many of times as Christians We complain too much we how I say it uh you know like yeah yeah yeah yeah complaining complaining every sickness every attack everything is a complaint but note Joseph is being sold to Egypt totally clueless of his Destiny in God in heading down to Egypt his brothers by jealousy think they're doing a great job by getting rid of this person who seem to like a torment to them love of the father being spiritual and here it is I wouldn't go in detail we know the story Joseph being sold Joseph uh being a gardener he get promoted uh head of the household of potifa Father wife make a move on him and he ran and he in prison and he's still had to wait could you do that could you know that your life is destined for let's say the this way greatness or blessings or or to be positionally placed and yet you have stuff to go through that may actually look abnormal because it's not the rhythm of how from a human perspective that you expect to be or you expect to go and you will think then because you're a Christian I'm not supposed to go to this I am not supposed to go to that maybe your husband maybe your wife maybe your father maybe your child and you tell yourself that but that's not true that's not true Joseph had to be promoted to be positionally placed in the vision that God gave him and the only way could have been done is his jealous Brothers to sell him out and then selling him out sell him out sell him selling him out he was able to get into that position of power to be second in command in Egypt okay so I don't want to say too long on that I want to go to the next character and this one is David 1 Samuel 161 12-13 David going from a Shepherd boy to becoming the king of Israel ad do just don't want you see a Bible text Mini Bible study tonight but I want you to see yourself verse 1st Samuel 16:12 and he sent and brought him talk David and he was Ruddy and with of a beautiful countenance goodly to look at and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so David Rose up and went to Ram now I don't think the Bible the Bible didn't say exactly what age he was maybe 16 17 young young lad but look at 2 Samuel 5 3-4 this is when he become king so you just hear how this young man has been anointed in 1st Samuel 16 and 2 Samuel 5 here he is coming King so all the Elders of Israel came to the king of to Hebron and King David made a league with them in heon before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel David was 30 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 40 years now we know the story of David he had was to serve under Saul King Saul playing the har he defeated golad he had to run in the wilderness he had to hide from Saul and eventually he became King David had it really hard and I want you to show if you have to go to the next level in God there's a cost for that and um there is no way WR it you would see it displayed as we said in Joseph we see it displayed in in David and David had it hard one time David had a play m know David hide in cave David had Camp yet he is Anointed I want to think about you now he's anointed to become king in other words you are predestinated unto something God can cancel that God can change that but if you don't get an attitude adjustment you could stay longer to get where God want you to go because what you're going through right now demands a certain attitude and a certain prayerfulness and a certain confidence and trust that The God Who listen carefully started the work in you is able to complete it because many times when we don't show God that trust we are almost saying we don't have confidence that you could take me through you thought you was going to be over in glory when your hair was black now your hair green but it's still of a glory to go on to and your hair green is only temporary because your hair going to be black so we cannot look with our eyes from the human perspective but we have to look and see from the human perspective what God takes us through to bring us to that place that he want us to be in so let's take we going quickly let's take another character Jesus Matthew 26 37-42 when he took with him Peter two sons of zebede began to be sorrowful and very heavy so in other words Jesus ministry from turning water into wine everybody happy feeding 5,000 feing 7,000 raising the dead and he said my hour is not yet come he's heading down now he's getting older and he's heading down to climax's Ministry he said my hour is come he's headed down to calino the way to Calvary is to Gethsemane did you get that the way to Calvary is Gethsemane geeman is not Calvary Gethsemane is a part to Calvary and when he said unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even went to death carry here and watch with me and he went a little further fell on his face prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I would will but as thou wil now I want to show you Jesus being promoted to the worthy lamb to become this worthy lamb what he had to go through and he cometh to his disciples and finded them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray this is Jesus word this is in R watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit is indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away the second time and prayed say oh my father if this cup may not be passed away from me except I drink it thy will be done the BR this is from the breach and there came a voice of of the one of the elders standing in the midst of the four beast and all the great host of Heaven said don't weep John oh my the grace of God don't be brokenhearted John don't weep for the land of the tribe of Judah the root and Offspring from David he had prevailed Prevail means means rle with and overcome oh my in the garden of Geth of Gethsemane here we go when his blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming the lion of the root of David has prevailed has overcome so it might look simple but Jesus in the intensity of his prayer with the weight of what he had to go through I mean it's not like if he did a crime it's not like if his conscience beaten him and he's guilty he know he's not guilty he know the price have to be paid Jesus can't go and hang himself on the cross he know that's the destination Man Hands have to put him there but man hands putting him there make him become the worthy lamb bleeding and bloody to take the book that we could have what we have here tonight to call our names so all this praying and travailing was for him to get into the position tooted position to be worthy to take the book now if Jesus had died at old age he couldn't take it his blood had to be shed the blood price and the cost had to be paid in order for us to get our Redemption this man by offering his blood once have perfected for them that are Sanctified so there's a cost Jesus had to pay that price David had to pay a price Joseph had a price to pay note that when Joseph Brothers came he said God send me ahead to preserve life Joseph by that time would have been more mature he would have been having a greater understanding of what the will of the Lord is and he would have seen how God hand has been upon him even though it was stressful distressful he was betrayed by his brother it was a terrible and disty thing to for them to do but at the end of it all he could thank God they did it because by doing it he could get into the process of the position where God want him to be all right let's continue I have I think the main one last one Jacob to Israel Genesis 25 294 and Jacob S potage and Esau came from the field he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee that thou the same red potage for I'm faint therefore his name was called Edom Jacob said sell me this day thy birth so Jacob was a business man he was a caror and Esau said behold I'm at the point to die what profit shall this birth do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and potage of lentils and did eat and drink rose up went his way thus God's interpretation Esau despite despise his birri okay Genesis 32:7 this is where Jacob was afraid then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed he divided the people that was at him so there's a blessed man now he have flocks wives houses land cattle you name it he's on people looking up to Jacob he's he's a man right and he's he's he have he have stuff and flu and hers and camels into two bands he split them up verse eight and said if Esau come to one company and smite it the other company which left shall Escape Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham this is where retire h to Road this is where the wealth money Health whatever you have as things that heaven doesn't even credit us for because heaven doesn't consist of things all right that we have here on Earth he said oh god of My Father Abraham he's praying God of my father Isaac the Lord which said unto me return unto thy country unto thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I pass over this Jordan and now I am become two bands deliver me is this your prayer tonight deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brotherr prayer of deliverance from the hand of Esau for I fear Him Le he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou sayest I will surely do the good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude note how Jacob is reminding god of what he promised you cannot just sit down there and no no no you have to remind god of what he promised on your behalf Jacob said listen I'm in trouble I'm frightened I'm afraid my brother going to kill me beat me whatever it is but remember what you told me you told me to come out you may come in this land it be a good land and Jacob is singing a song to God that God has to hear are you with me but he still have stuff to go through so let's Rite this tonight praise God and deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother and so on and thou has said I will surely do thee good and make thy seed in the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for a multitude and then Jacob went and get a hammock and he connected between two Tre trees and rocking it and said mind that breeze is feeling so good I'm waiting on the Lord no that is not on the Bible that is not happening and many times we pray and we pray and we expect it to just work out we don't expect us to burn our knees we don't expect us to go through tough times hard times and stressful times because we pray and you sit down now and you pray and you're waiting like an entitled Soul Waiting for God to work this thing out but it have more to it than meets the eye let's continue with this guy called Jacob Genesis 32:24 and Jacob was left alone Oh Glory see that part that's a tough part for some people now with all this social media and with all this kind of thing to to get people occupied and and fully fully awake with this world and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he reviled not against him he touched the Hall of his TI and the Hall of Jacob's TI was out of joint and he wrestled with him in other words Jacob was broken and he's still fighting Jacob was broken and he's still wrestling why because he was desperate why because he wanted deliverance and he said let me go for the day break it he said I will not let you go except you bless me this is Jacob though he really mean that he is sincere verse 27 he said unto him what is thy name is this important he said Jacob he's identifying his condition he said he's a Scamp he's a crook he's a deceiver he's a cheat and he said name shall be no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince thou has power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I praise thee thy name he said wherefore is it that thou ask me after my name and he blessed it and Jacob called the name of the place penel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and here in Genesis 3 334 is when he meet his brother Esau now you see when you have fear and you haven't met the Lord your fear does happening but here it is this man broke past because he met the Lord he no longer in fear and look what happened in verse 4 of Genesis to the tree and Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept when you please the Lord go let your enemy be at peace with you when you please the Lord when you so the issue is not the enemy you know the issue is us we have enemies you have enemies you have enemies whether you're conscious of it or not but don't bother with your enemies think about you think about what you have to overcome so when he expect his brother to be fear hard on him his brother actually embraced him fell on his neck and kissed him and they went okay and this here is such a powerful scripture Genesis 359 to12 this is very precious to my heart and I have this here by a new name Israel is established so Jacob name is now changed and Genesis 35 listen to these words and God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of pan and blessed him and God said unto him thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and he called his name Israel and God said unto him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of Nations shall be of thee and Kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which I give Abraham and to thee I will give it and to thy seed after thee will I give the land what a transformation what a transformation from Jacob to Israel and today a country is named Israel because a man wrestled with God have you ever thought about that we talk about Israel and Israel and Israel but this Israel is because a man prayed a man pray through until his life was changed so much that his name had to be changed and that is where you get the children of Israel question should we limit our prayer to only spiritual things question do you think that our world is unaffected by prayer well but Bram said because I know that prayer is what changes things prayer is what does things for us you have to believe this you have to believe this with all your heart because Philippians 4:6 says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication and Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God so whether it's natural things and God interested in natural things for you because you're living here on the earth whether it's spiritual things God interested in Spirit to you because you need to be connected to him be careful for nothing but in everything and he Amplified said do not fret or have anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition definite request with Thanksgiving continue to make your wants known to God so your promotion even natural promotion in your job you get a promotion what not that is of the Lord if you do see it so you wouldn't thank God for it you just take a promotion like the pig or like the animal the prophet said who apples fall in the head never look up to say thanks where coming from just eating apple grunting grunting all his mind and you're eating eating eating and God showering his blessing upon you because sometimes you can get promoted and lose it you could actually lose your promotion you could lose your promotion by your behavior by attitude like King Saul CH was chosen so was anointed but Saul fell into disobedience and God said I had enough of that man I fed up went the kingdom remove from him he's still in the post he's still on the throne but only a matter of time he remove from there so so people can get promoted and don't hold it people can get placed and lose their place or they get a crown and they lose their Crown to someone else do you see it now so when God blesses you when God empowers you when God surround your life with his grace and mercy he expect you to do something about it for to grow and expand of the mercy and Grace that God has blessed you with that you can even ex extend that same Grace and we see to others I rep tonight as I Look to close I some other things to say but I think I'm going to wrap up material successes are immaterial to God so whatever you achieve in life house Car Land plane boat rocket whatever money and wealth that carries no weight in heaven praying is what a man can do and must do success in business or life should be a side blessings of a Praying Soul Heaven don't need money but the success of man Heaven don't give credits for Earthly success God works through prayer how many understand that how many believe that but not aine praying is a man had to pray and Luke 18:1 said he said in a parable to them that men always men ought always to pray and not to fate so if God uses prayer and man have to pray for God to use that prayer as a prayer go like how Daniel Prayed and the angel had to come to Daniel then men had to pray so praying is God's business Matthew 213 as we close he said them it is written my house shall be called a House of Prayer but you have made it a den of teas and I close with this quote from Brother brandham here it is if I'm getting this right a man or a woman who really tries to live a Christian Life and have stain from the things of the world the world backs off and say they are fanatic every man that tries to trust God his fellow man will call him goody goody or or something like that I don't judge a man by the callous in his hands it's by hard work and labor it's by the bag of the knee in his pants that is where you pray whether he bows and prays or not man is not judged by Statue he is judged by character I have seen men that weighed 200 pound and didn't have a ounce of man in him ravish a mother with a baby in her arm a man is judged by character what he is on the inside let us bow our heads almighty God I thank you tonight to share these few words with your people and I pray it be a blessing and a help to them that they will realize to go to the next level in the Christian walk whether it's from Faith to Virtue virtue to knowledge knowledge to Temperance Temperance to patience patience to Godliness godliness of Godly kindness what is whatever station they are at to go to the next level to be promoted to the next level to climb to the next level have a price a cost a effort and may they see it tonight as a reality as the song said some to the waters some to the flood some to Great trials but all to the blood we here tonight as your blood bought children we're here tonight because we are needy we're here tonight because we know you walk through prayer and sometimes if some Grandmother Had prayed that's why we are here some grandparent pray and they're no longer on the Earth but the pray is holding up holding up for the grandchildren holding up for their great grandchildren we are so grateful and if we are praying that we could be praying parents we could be praying sons and daughters that we will never give up upon our loved ones but pray that they break through Lord oh God help us tonight break through in homes break through in marriages break through in relationships breakr with father and son mother and daughter breakr with husband and wife breakr in parents and children breakthrough with the young people in the church that they will have a heart after righteousness and a heart after you granted God as we look away to you there's a price of promotion you said you want us to be the head not the tail you want us to be like light that could stand on top that table a candle that not hid under a bushill but standing to sh light to you you said you want us to be like the salt of the earth God you want us to be not backwards but forward you want us to be promoted to be like light ligh houses like like a billboard that giv witness that you the same yesterday end forever father may you touch your sons tonight touch your daughters touch the Caleb in a special way touch the sick in our midst that your spirit will come upon them even as they pray they will see themselves as old Like These Old Testament characters and identify the with it to wrestle with the angel to be fervent in prayer to be passionate if they in sin father that they will connect with the Psalms of David where his prayer was a prayer of confession if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins you are faithful and just to forgive us of our sins father May there be SE cleansing tonight by your fire by Your Presence by your power Will you pour the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight in their homes in their lives in Jesus name I ask it amen amen so saints of God I pray that what we share tonight would be a help to you and that you would see that regardless of what you have to go through this great process so God be with you as they get on in prayer at this time
