finger the speaking of vanity if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy The Afflicted Soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy Darkness be as the known day and the Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make thy bones fat thy bones and thou shall be like the watered Garden like the spring of water whose Waters fail not and they I love this

Corinthians 148 amen God bless you on the internet praise God certainly hope that the Lord uh be a blessing to you today and so um Isaiah 40 and we want to read from um verse 26 in there praise God Isaiah 40 and: 26 says lift up your eyes on high and behold who ha created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them by all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why sayest thou Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching in his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint may God I bless ring of word there and we just want to turn over now to St John um in the New Testament now and um St John chapter 20 we want to turn to verse 19 or start from verse 19 amen so St John 20 and picking up from verse 19 and here is Christ appearing to this disciples after his resurrection and it says that then the same day this is chapter 20: 19 says then the same day at evening before the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fa of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the law then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he had breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins youit are remitted unto them and whosoever sins he retain are they are retained amen and now we want to turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 last reading amen 1 Corinthians 14 and we just want to read just one verse in there praise God uh for

this morning amen amen amen it's a good day it's a glorious day yes sir it's a day of opportunity isn't that right it's a day for God to do something for you amen every time you have breath in your body it's an opportunity to give God praise Hallelujah some of us oh God a big praise we don't praise him enough we don't worship him enough for what he has done for us some of you don't even know what God did for you this morning he woke you up this morning that's enough to praise God for there's some people dead in Bangladesh this morning and some are injured some explosion went off with some terrorist thing and and I could only imagine waking up to that but God woke you up to blessings and health and strength God broke you up to strength in your body you have something to praise God for this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah God provided oh God Made A Way where there seem to be no way oh God give you floor to walk upon God give you clothes on your back God give you shoes on your feet oh he's a provider he's a way maker oh Hallelujah this is God I'm talking about oh Hallelujah you can do it in yourself it took God to do it to step down in your situation and to do something for you that you couldn't do for your own self he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you oh how we thank God this morning to be chosen to be elected to be predestinated you are not just anybody this morning but you are predestinated by God to be right where you are this morning the devil tried to kill you the devil tried to take out some of you but Satan cannot take a hold of the Blood Washed ones this morning because who he for you he call and who he call he justified and who he just ified he has already glorified this morning oh somebody lift up your hands somebody worship him this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen so this is not a time to be sad this is not a time to be frustrated but this is a time to be looking into the promise that God has set before us this is a time to be looking to that day looking towards Pentecost another book of Acts oh Hal another anointing oh Hallelujah one more ride that the prophet prophesied oh I'll ride this Trail one more time that was a holy spirit veil in brother brandham speaking of Prophecy that that Angels going to come back around and do the same works that he did in Jesus that he did in brother Bram he do those same Works in a bride on the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you will stand undefeated you will stand Victorious you will stand triumphant over every devil over every lust over every power over everything that this world can ever throw in your direction oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen praise God so I have a title this morning my title is times of uncertainty times of uncertainty amen and amen do you love him this morning uncertainty and you know that word really means that you're not sure what's going to happen and you're not sure about your future or what anything holds for you and sometimes life is like that the prophet talked sometimes he said sometime you're going through a night time he called it and there seemed to be no no sunlight and there seemed to be no no way of Hope and there seemed to be as it was almost gross darkness in the situation it seemed to be like there's no answer sometimes you pray and you feel like your prayer hit on a wall somewhere sometimes you feel like God is silent God is not hearing you and it is in those times that the devil has a Revival because God has seemingly closed the door and you can't hear anything and you don't feel the spirit like you used to sometimes you don't feel like singing sometimes you're trying to find strength to pray sometimes you're trying to find something that could give you a promise for tomorrow I got news for you this morning the world is UNC the atmosphere is uncertain what you see around you may be uncertain but the only thing that is certain this morning is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today and the same forever oh somebody praise him this morning hallelujah hallelujah so this message this morning it's not to make you depressed but this is a message of hope I hope Beyond all hopes a hope that the world cannot see Jesus said a little while and the world will see me no more but he said you are going to see me you the individual you the believer you the one who stayed you the one who prayed you the one who fasted you the one who held on with all of your might don't you worry little sister there is a man this morning who could turn on the light that man is here this morning oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah so the doctors may tell you that there's no hope they'll say there's no healing they'll say there's nothing that we can do for you no more the doctors might give up on you but God doesn't give up on his Blood Washed sons and daughters there's a promise this morning for healing oh if you can forget about the dark clouds and just reach up and keep on pressing Beyond those dark clouds there is a sun out there that is always shining doesn't matter what depression what frustration what is in your way David said to a thand follow my right side don't 10,000 follow my left he said I shall not be moved oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen times of uncertainty speaks about life the part I love about that title is the first word says times for everything there's a time and a season but Isaac brought it out so massively last week speing on the scripture Ecclesiastes 3 isn't that right amen Time season for everything time to be born a time to die time for this time for that isn't that right and it's an encouragement to me because even though it's times of uncertainty that uncertainty is only for a time only for a time even though it's a time of of of of of mourning as it was or maybe a time of of of Sorrow as it was it's only for a time maybe a time of travail maybe a time of great burden maybe a time of great distress only you know what you going through in the night time oh you alone lying on the bed you alone crying out for your situation oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the bible says weep in andjoy it but for a night but joy cometh in the morning it's only for a Time oh what had a beginning will have an ending and your trial might have a beginning this morning but it will have an end your situation might have had a beginning but it will have an end this morning the devil had a beginning and he will have an end but you come from eternity and you go back to Eternity who can separate us from the love of God oh somebody preach back to me this morning oh oh hallelujah oh take heart this morning take courage this morning be bold this morning be strong for the Lord thy God is with thee Oh H God told Joshua meditate upon the word day and night and you will have good success doesn't matter how you feel meditate upon the word God promis the Holy Ghost God promis to deliver God promis to break the shackles he promised to pour out the spirit doesn't matter how I feel I'll praise God anyhow the devil might have took my money the devil might have took my joy he might have took my job but he haven't taken my praise my praise is still here let the devil take that praise God this morning I could still praise God I can still worship God I can still dance I can still Shout he turned my mour into dancing again he lifted my sorrow hallelujah praise God give him [Applause] [Applause] praise [Applause] Hallelujah times of uncertainty it's a natural part of life you need the rain you need the sun you need a night you need a day isn't that right when God created the Earth he set the moon and the stars and the sky and the planet and all these great things in the universe for days he said they set them for seasons and for years to calculate time to show the stretch of this dispensation to dispensation hallelujah hallelujah it's to manifest a certain thing sometimes God want to bring out something so he drop it in time and let it unfold and he let people laugh at it he let people mock it he let people say what they want to say but in the end God always has the final say and when that seed go to taking on life who could laugh now who could get on now say what you want to say can't say nothing God is manifesting something in your life and the devil can't say anything about it he just have to acknowledge and take note that you had been with Jesus Paul I know Peter I know and you I know also you got an experience I can't use you to hate anybody I can't use it to have pride anymore I can't use lust anymore it's not even there God take the fire bomb of the Holy Spirit and drop it into your heart out goes the snake and down come the Holy Spirit to dwell inside of you oh that's what we're looking for this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah am amen amen amen times of [Music] uncertainty can't help but thing but that f time of uncertainty when the world was in chaos God hadn't created anything yet and there was a world just spinning spinning spinning like that was without form and void the Bible says Darkness was upon the Deep Darkness over the waters you couldn't see anything God couldn't even make a start until he had uttered his first word which was let there be light Hallelujah and when he spoke that word the prophet said it didn't matter how long it took for that light to come that light had to come because God had already spoken it Hal he couldn't take it back Hallelujah it was already gone forth and what word God has spoken over your life this morning he cannot take it back oh he's done already spoken it he's done already made up his mind God don't change his mind about his decisions and when God elected you when God predestinated you when God chose you to be here in this day and in this season God didn't change his mind God said I love my choice I'm staying with my choice oh Hallelujah and I'll show the world who they are oh somebody praise them this morning God's going to identify himself with a bride on the earth oh Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah was a time of uncertainty the world was out form and void but when God began to Bro over it it became become more beautiful and more beautiful and More Beautiful until that war until that void chaotic world begin to take on the thing that was booing over it it begin to become beautified it began to see greens and and trees and plants and flowers and birds and bees it begin to take on life and I don't care how chaotic your life might seem it might be without form it might be without forid but if you let yourself go in The Potter's hands this morning it'll begin to take on another form God is in the transforming business he's not going to throw you away oh no that's what the devil would do but God has the ability to take something that might be use less and turn it into something beautiful that's what God can do and God could do that for you this morning you might seem looses you might seem frustrated you might seem broken but that's the kind of vessel that God is looking for this morning he's going to take you and reshape you mold you and break you praise God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen praise God great inspiration has come forth last few days there come down to The Potter's House hallelujah amen it's still going on amen amen and having been in art myself I had a privilege of actually using clay and um one of the things I noticed with with with Clay work is that if you doing it you can't do it from afar like you know you might be able to take a brush and paint it from afar you know trying not to get your hands dirty or something but if you're doing clay work you have to be in it yeah two hands you can't do clay one hand and be talking on your cell phone no you have to be completely without distractions and you have to be committed to this piece that you're working on can't have anybody talking around you just kind of quiet an noise focusing on what's going on inside of you sometimes it gets messy the forming and the shaping gets messy sometimes a Potter is up to his elbows and Clay but it's for a purpose because he wants to see this thing come to life he's looking to see this thing take on shape take on form take on Hallelujah take on a certain kind of thing so that could be used for the purpose that it was meant to be used for isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah amen so it's quite an experience we with clay and so on amen amen and I could only imagine that you can't uh change your vision you can't change what it is that uh you're trying to achieve once you've started it you have to follow through you can't change your mind in the middle amen isn't that right and change your desire or change your focus as it was but you have to stay on track with the target with what it is you're trying to achieve and that's what I love about God God don't get a Vikes or get some haphazard way and and he don't just get a vaps as it was and just decide to change his strategy or change this and oh Hal no no no no he's going to take that same old clay oh Hallelujah and mold it into something beautiful oh hallelujah hallelujah and you know the most amazing thing about clay it's a very um almost useless kind of soil yeah you know you can take top soil and maybe use that to grow some plants or get some vegetation or something in the backyard but you can't use clay for that matter of fact you'd have to dig out all the clay might replace it with some good soil or something cuz that can't grow plants it's almost a useless soil so there the clay sits doing nothing being useless to nobody and no one until all of a sudden a skillful Potter comes Alone says I could use this to do something and maybe the World cast you out maybe the world threw you out and maybe they said you was a nobody maybe they said you was an odd ball but God could use OD ball sometimes God could use clay sometimes God could use his people to do what he wants to do to do something in you that he cannot do with anyone else you are unique this morning you are special to God this morning you were created for his glory you were created for the glory and the honor of God don't you ever let the devil lie to you and tell you that you are useless that you are nothing when God take useless and put it in his hands it becomes something to the world then he says here is my beloved Son and Daughter in whom I am well pleased he ye him oh hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah times of uncertainty isn't that right Prophet said here now there's many things that give sounds this is on from uncertain sound 1955 he says and there's many uncertain sounds today there's an there's uncertainty on every hand everywhere you look in the National Affairs it's it's uncertainty yes sir he said a big four meeting he said they come together and they write out declarations and so on he said but there's an uncertainty whether the other side will keep their pledge or not there's uncertainty about whether it's going to rain tomorrow or whether it's going to be fair weather he said it's uncertainty in everything that you look at he said but one thing he said that's in Christ see that's one thing you can be sure that is certain oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can be about certain about many things this morning amen and I believe we live in a time of uncertainty amen if you look at the economy we look at how things going we look at the the uh the stress of the world and even on the island the crime and all this is happening people being abducted people's organs missing it's all kind of Cruelty and and satanic abomination upon the Earth people killing each other rape and murder and violence going on some people don't know if they leave the house this morning if they make it to work or if they make it to where they going unless somebody abduct them or somebody take uh take them away and ravish them or whatever it's an uncertain time that we are living in right now how the world is uncertain they don't know where the the the economy is going to get to they don't know what's going to happen next Hallelujah with all that Trump's do and nobody knows what's going on with America it's a time of uncertainty but G uh but brandom speaking in this message says that the only thing that is certain this morning is Jesus Christ the only thing that is certain this morning is the word of God the only absolute that we have this morning the only tyst that we have this morning is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today and the same forever he's the only one that could save he's the only one that could redeem he's the only one that could change he's the only one that could change our heart change our life oh Hallelujah isn't that [Applause] right societies create programs they try to help people to reform them to try to reform them back into society to try to educate them give them certificates give them scholarships oh hallelujah hallelujah all that has led to is a bunch of he highminded lovers are Pleasures more than lovers of God people oh Hallelujah education is all but puff them up oh make them proud and arrogant they don't need this one and they don't need that one living in a scientific age oh Hallelujah where they have need of nothing oh Hallelujah isn't that right and in the midst of all of that God Remains the Same and his word Remains the Same in the midst of all this uncertainty in the midst of all this space Oh Hallelujah Hal look like nothing's happening it look like nothing is moving oh hallelujah hallelujah but we don't go by feelings we don't walk by what we see in the natural that's not how a Christian walks a Christian walks by faith oh hallelujah hallelujah that's how we walk it's not about what you could see it's not about what you could smell it's not about what you could taste oh H it's about what God's word said concerning you and if God said he deliver you he's going to deliver you if God said he's going to seal you then he's going to seal you if God said he's going to bring your family out you better hang your soul on what God said because it shall come to pass oh hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah God is never uncertain that is not a word in his vocabulary oh he don't dwell in that atmosphere when God speaks oh it's got to materialize it's got to take place he said my word shall not return void but it shall accomplish the purpose that have sent for it to accomplish oh the devil can't stop it if he try you can't stop it if you try oh the arrow has already been shot from the pole oh once God spoke it it's got to happen oh Hallelujah that means California is as good as sunk that means America is as good as blown to bits and that means you are H going to receive the Holy Ghost you are going to be adopted that's how sure the word is this morning somebody give him a [Applause] out amen amen Prophet speaks on here he says and there's another thing that's absolutely sure to every person in here I want to leave that thought to you to begin with he said it's uncertain whether you're going to live to get out of this church or not he says it's uncertain whether you'll ever be back again or not it's uncertain whether you'll see another years of life he said but there's one thing certainly is sure he said that's death and the Judgment afterwards he said and you're just as sure to meet God uh to meet that God is in he uh you are just sure to meet that God as God is in heaven isn't that right he said you may make an appointment with your wife and say honey honey I might I will take you to a certain place or something something may arise and you can't do that you might not be able to keep that appointment you might tell your best friend brother I'm going to meet you I'm going to do a certain thing I'll let you have money or I'll let you have my car or whatever all kinds of uncertainty against that isn't that right he says so you're making your plans but God laughs at our plans because it's uncertain oh how we hope someday we hope that we can do this we hope that we can do that but if it's not the will of God then it's not the will of God because it is UNC what will happen tomorrow but we know who holds tomorrow and it is in his hands We Trust oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah but that's the spirit of man we get all caught up in ourselves in our abilities and our power to do it and we make promises that sometimes we don't even know if we could keep we make plans that we are not even sure half the time if we can fulfill but the one thing about God is that God keeps all of his promises the one thing about God is that he fulfills all of his word and he keeps all of his appointments oh H and you have an appointment this morning with the Supernatural and the Unseen and I believe there's a people in the land this morning God's going to keep his appointments with that people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh a rushing Sound Of A Mighty Wind that's what promised in this last day amen are you looking for it are you an expectation for it we need a Revival this morning oh we need a shaking this morning and that's the only thing that's certain amen amen glory glory glory say all kinds of uncertainty against that yeah but there's one thing to show is see that you're going to die and you're going to meet the Judgment so bear that in mind he said while now we're talking on in uncertainty amen isn't that right so the world is in a time of uncertainty the economy isn't that right unstable world is in crisis pick up the newspaper somebody's dead somebody's not here with us anymore on God's green earth isn't that right Hallelujah there's war all over Middle East and wherever every day there's some bad news to report that's why I love coming to church hallelujah hallelujah because I can hear the gospel and the gospel is the good news about how God is still able to do something for my family how God is still able to do something even now oh Hallelujah God could make a way where there seem to be no way you might have a situation home but if you stay in the right atmosphere God could do something right now to take care of that situation don't you worry God is in control of it oh he work it out right hallelujah hallelujah it was a time of uncertainty Abraham was promised a son and he walked with God 25 years Hallelujah and we know what happened he had his mistakes they went with higga and different things and different things happened that was not expected Hallelujah but God was in the midst of all of it God knew how it this thing would unfold God had already spoken and said is true Sarah I give the promise of of the son Isaac to be born and I don't care what interpretation you try to put it my word shall not return void and Abraham sometimes felt uncertain one time Abraham went out and spoke to God and he said how can I be the father of Nations seeing I go childless and God said why you looking at your circumstance why you looking at your situation forget about the things around you I want you to look up this morning and see a different picture Abraham look up at the stars tell me what you see oh Hallelujah so shall I see it be oh come on somebody sometimes you need to change your pictures if you change your pictures you could change your world you can forget about the natural plug into the supernatural plug into what God Said plug into the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is certain the power of God is certain the promise of God is certain the anointing of God is setting somebody say [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we in the Supernatural this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we in Supernatural times this morning it might look natural around you but you have to press beyond that one thing I love about the Supernatural is that the Supernatural is always there doesn't matter how you feel this morning you could have doubt this morning fear oh you could have be distress you could be depressed you could be frustrated you could be however but the Supernatural is eternal the supernatural Knows No Time restraints it has no time limits which means you could pray any time and talk to your court which means you could believe any time and talk to your C which means you could pick up the Bible any time and say I believe what's spoken in this book I believe every promise is for me I believe the words that are preach here you can forget about the natural forget about what's around you and reach up and grab something that is more real than what you are in right now I challenge you this morning lift up your hands lift up your hearts before God and begin to worship and get into the atmosphere the supernaturalist right next to you this morning Hallelujah somebody shout somebody worship somebody lift up your hands somebody break through this morning God is in this place the devil is a liar this morning oh Hallelujah he tried to tell you you couldn't make it but God is here now Jesus is here now and he is sitting the holy spirit is sitting the power of God is sitting it's a certain sound oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's in a time of the uncertainty where your faith is tested amen amen amen that's you know the disciples they when you read the scripture in St John 20 they were shut off shut off for fa of the Jews and it was a time of uncertainty because here it was that they were walking with Jesus they seen Miracles they seen revivals break out they seen the power of God they seen a sick heal they seen a Dey yes Gyro's daughter brought to life some of them were Witnesses of them isn't that right all these marvelous things isn't that right they were there in times of uncertainty when it was spoken about when Jesus was going on the other side and there come a storm to blow up and Jesus was asleep in the boat isn't that right Bible says he was asleep on a pillow in the hinder part of the ship he was so asleep that he didn't feel the boat rocking he didn't feel the boat shaking I don't know about you but a storm in a boat is a very scary thing is a very shaken kind of a thing yes sir it's one thing to be at home in a storm hidden away in a house under a safe roof or shelter but there's another thing entirely to be out in the in the ocean in the sea because there's no sh ground there's no sh footing what you are standing on is literally moving up and down 10ft waves the Bible said the water that was outside of the boat was coming inside of the boat the Bible said the ship was full the the disciples got very scared they got very frightened and I could totally understand why hallelujah hallelujah because they were in a situation that seemed uncertain there was nowhere for them to run there was nowhere for them to hide and if they had wait any longer the scripture might have been different but then they went somebody got the inspiration to go and wait Jesus we need Jesus right now we done all we can we hoisted the sails we man the decks we've done all we could do but this ship is going down brother if we don't call on Jesus somebody go get Jesus and I'm saying this morning somebody go wake Jesus we we need him in this hour we need him right now we need him in this situation oh we will not make it oh hallelujah hallelujah what a Blessed Assurance to know that they could go and wake Jesus they could go and wake the master I'm sure that wasn't the first ship that ever got caught out in a storm in the ocean many ships got battered destroyed there are stories of people who drowned at sea but here it was these disciples had an opportunity to gowake Jesus it takes something to gowake Jesus it means you have to put away Pride it means you have to put away what you know about sailing boats you don't know no more this situation is more than you you need somebody who could control the situation oh Hallelujah and that's what God like to do god like to put us in situations where we don't know no more where we not in control no more where we don't know it all where our education can help us where all certificates can't help us where all of our knowledge all know all Mysteries you can break scripture but if you don't have charity you don't have nothing so you better get up all inside of here oh Hallelujah and pray for charity because charity never fail oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen I want you to picture it picture somebody opening a Bible or rather not a Bible but some math book or something in the middle of a storm or maybe some kind of uh you know trying to preach some theological gospel in a storm that's not going to work you've got to get something that works brother you better get to praying you better go to calling out on God it is in those times of uncertainty where God's strength is proven more than your strength because in your weakness his strength is made perfect oh only when you are perfectly weak then he becomes perfectly strong oh not 99 and 910 but you are totally dead and then God comes to the rescue oh hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody praise him I know somebody know what I'm talking about this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah go and wake Jesus and he said to him Master don't you care that we perish Jesus what I love about Jesus is he doesn't let he never lets the atmosphere around him dictate his answer to every question he's always in the right atmosphere and I know there's going to come a day where there'll be sons of God on the earth Daughters of God on the earth who will be always in the right atmosphere oh it won't be you no more it be those rainbows around your soul putting you in the right atmosphere doesn't matter if there's a storm doesn't matter if the world is shaken down you are standing on the only thing that is certain that is a rock that is Jesus Christ oh somebody shout hallelujah take courage H oh Hallelujah there's a song that says arise this is the final hour arise We Are Soldiers of the king and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail so arise the spirit says arise oh and Shine the Bible says thy light has come cross Darkness cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the people some of them don't know what to preach anymore some of them don't know what to believe anymore anymore but my Bible doesn't give a promise for depression my Bible doesn't give a promise for frustration my Bible tells me arise and shine for thy light has come oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah we don't need a past light we need a present tense light we don't need a light of a past age we can't survive on the light of a past time we need a present tense gospel a present tense Redemption present tense promise of God to come upon the people once more Dynamics to our mechanics and activate the power that is laying in us that's what we need this morning in order to make it we cannot make it and what we have now we got to go with Jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hal I challenge you this morning this week go wake Jesus this week while you're in the Maxi gowake Jesus while you're on the job gowake Jesus while you're in school if ever you are in trouble you just scream out the name of Jesus and here he come here he come riding in on angel's wings he loves you this morning he'll do anything for his people he'll do anything for his sons he says ask anything in my name and it shall be given Hallelujah that's the word of [Applause] God reach up and grab it let your faith reach up and grab it and pull it down you have the power to do that this morning because God put something inside of you God put the faith inside of you to contact God isn't that right means you have the ability now to Glory Glory interact with God through faith not by what you could see not by what your senses tell you but you're walking by another sense another sense a sick sense Hallelujah a sense that has the ability to see God in every situation doesn't matter if your friends can't see it doesn't matter if your neighbors can't see it some of them say that you're messed up some of them say G through some of them write you off but your faith is telling you something else your faith is seeing God in your situation that's why I come to church and worship and lift up my hands I may not have money in my pocket but God is still in this situation God is still in this [Applause] circumstance I still have a reason to worship my God I still have a reason to praise is my God because he is my God and I will worship him forever through Sunshine through Shadow the devil is a liar he is always a liar my God is a deliverer my God is a way maker he's a restorer he is Satan [Applause] oh let me hurry along here now my God read something from the prophet here he said now it reminds me of another little story he said not going back to stories but he said A friend of mine was standing in car's bad New Mexico where he was holding a meeting up at carb and so forth there was a bunch of people and he said we went down into this cave and he said oh I never did like that stuff Prophet says down there where it's deep he said and about a mile down in the ground so it's quite a distance he said and he said I'm satisfied up here he said so they went down through and I wanted to go higher not lower so Prophet so he said they took this little fellow went down in there and he was a man friend and his little girl and a little boy went down with them so they all going down in this cave right and they went way down into a big basement oh I guess 100 hundred and hundreds of feet below the surface of the Earth went down there and a man there by the switch all at once brother brandom snaps his finger like this and he says a man by the switch he said turned off the switch he said and it was so black and dark till you couldn't even see your hand moving down in front of your face and a little girl a little thing was real scared she began to scream to the top of her voice oh it's dark it's dark it's dark hysterically screaming her little brother happened to be standing and he screamed out in the darkness and he said fear not little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light Hallelujah the prophet said he said what's the little church going to do he said don't you worry there is a man here today that can turn on the light he said that's the Lord Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah he said would you raise your hands and say God turn the light on in me this morning he said I believe the word and I believe the mechanics he said put the Dynamics in me Lord he said raise your hands out to him now and he said cry Lord turn the lights on in me there is a man in here who can turn on the light oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's a man in here his name is Jesus you can't see him with your natural eyes but if you reach out with faith you can touch him while he passes by oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen is that right oh my a man acquainted with grief he knows your situation he knows your circumstance he knows what you're going through sometime he grown with a headache while he was here on Earth but he was God all the time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah God has dwelt inside of him and there was a time of uncertainty when Lazarus was in the grave when Lazarus was in the Tomb oh H and he's been dead 4 days and nobody seemed to have the answer they sent for Jesus and Jesus purposely delayed his travel so that things could happen a certain way and he rose up one time and he said I go wake Lazarus he sleepeth isn't that right and when he came to the house there was wake happening there was coffee there was biscuits people was in there mour people is in a groaning atmosphere oh but here come a little sister and said even now something will happen even now Lord I know you are able to do something and Jesus Faith oh something activate Jesus and he said where have you laid him and he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live where have you laid him I don't care where you are laying this morning you might be laying in your spirit in your soul you might be dead along time you might not feel the presence of God a long time oh but God is coming to you this morning God is able to deliver oh hallelujah hallelujah the only certain thing a time of uncertainty is coming to your door this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh amen amen isn't that right Hallelujah so it behooves us to wait upon God isn't that right and I love the scripture we read in Isaiah 40 I'll say it back again Isaiah 40 it says uh uh it says has thou known hast thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth faint at not he doesn't get tired he doesn't get weary he doesn't get all messed up he doesn't get all confused he is always in control oh that's the God we serve not a god of confusion but he's a god of order he knows the time and the season you are waiting on the time he is wai wa on a time oh H there's an appointed time for your blessing there's an appointed time for your deliverance and God is waiting on the time for it to be fulfilled he and all can go ahead of it he just spoke it and he's waiting Hallelujah looking and watching looking at your attitude but it's going to materialize it's going to happen it's going to be God already said so oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he doesn't faint neither is he wary there is no searching of his understanding you can't figure this God out he's mysterious in his ways his wonders to perform isn't that right he said he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength and the verse goes on to say that even the youth shall faint and be wary oh Hallelujah young people feel like we have endless energy and we could go all night or we could do what we want to and aspire to anything and Achieve to anything not knowing or not aware sometimes that there's a time limit that you wouldn't always be young that you wouldn't always have all the time in the world oh H that you've got to do something about this gospel you are hearing right now the best time you have is right now not tomorrow not next week but right now is the best time right now to make a decision is the best time to make a change is the best time to make a clearcut decision to serve God to worship God to stand with God to stand for God to stay with the word and to stay with his promises all you have is right now because tomorrow is uncertain [Applause] over preaching many times you don't have all the time in the world one day time Runs Out Hallelujah isn't that right and it's in these times of uncertainty that I believe God gives us an opportunity to make a choice whether we going to stand or we going to fall to make a Choice whether we going to go all the way or we going to turn back and go back fishing Hallelujah isn't that right if we're going to go back to our selfish ideas if we're going to go back to our humanistic or if we're going to press on by faith and if we're going to believe God I know God put something inside of our hearts this morning to believe him in spite of the situation in spite of the circumstance in spite of what we could see around us that is not going to dictate this morning how we are going to worship how we believe God what God says concerning the scripture it's not going to dictate my atmosphere you can dictate your own atmosphere this morning you could create your own atmosphere of worship your own atmosphere of Faith your own atmosphere of belief throw doubt out the door throw fear out the door oh fair and faith cannot occupy the same space choose this day this morning whom you are going to serve either it's Faith or doubt oh I choose to have faith this morning I choose to say the devil is a liar this morning I choose to defy gravity and to stand up and to put my hands in the air and to worship God I choose to defy Satan and worship God in my sadness worship God in my circumstance worship God in my situation because I know God going to come through for me oh he comes through every time I know he'll come through for me oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he came through on Calvary he paid the debt for me I know he'll come through for me he took a cross upon his back and he screamed and cried out but he did it for you and if he conquered you are going to conquer also for greater as he is in you than he is in the world give him a shout of [Applause] Praise they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength oh hallelujah oh they shall Mount over the wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint oh they're going to have a Revival they're going to be filled with the Holy Ghost they're going to be demon Chasers they're going to be demon Running Oh h hallelujah what a kind of people that's coming upon the earth oh amen glory to [Applause] God sometimes you have no choice but to wait wait on God wait for God you run ahead out of God's program and you end up messing things up isn't that right it happened that time the prophet had that that vision of the the baby is supposed to be healed I think and uh he ran ahead of the vision God showed him a certain certain thing that's supposed to happen the glasses the person coming in and it's supposed to happen in certain order and the prophet went ahead he was a human being I guess he was anticipated he was excited maybe he felt in his own ability that he could do something about the situation ahead of God's vision and then the situation got worse and he had to wait he had no choice in that moment his prayer didn't work he had to wait for God he had to wait for the time and sometimes we want things to work out right now and God say no wait sometimes we want things to work out right away we feel frustrated we feel oh God I can't take it I feel like giving up I feel my soul tearing apart yes in that time of uncertainty you are forced to do nothing else but wait upon God and wait for God he gave strength to the weary even the you shall faint but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint if you could only wait upon him and Trust in his name he'll give you strength this morning like you never knew you had oh h hallelujah hallelujah God wants something to break out inside of [Applause] you sometimes he's got you there holding waiting and the devil is playing his run too look what happened here look what happened there there was a time of uncertainty when the prophet lost his child lost his wife lost everything time of uncertainty he wanted to kill himself picked up the gun it wouldn't go off said oh God what is this but then our faith rose up inside of him though he slain me yet I trust him oh Hallelujah the devil was playing with his mind playing with his emotions slowly breaking him down and he was a prophet yet he was a human being just like you and me he was driven almost to the brink of insanity yet in that moment in that time of uncertainty God proed himself strong he had the anchor that would hold amidst the storm oh the storm is Raging though the winds are battering though the wind blow contrary though the waves try to take you over the anchors got to hold oh don't you be afraid this morning let your anchor grip the solid rock this morning forget about what you can't see forget about what you can't hear I might be able to hear from God but the devil cannot move me this morning I'm standing on a solid rock oh upon which I stand all of the ground is sinking sand nothing else will save us in the end but Jesus the same yesterday the same today the same forever oh [Applause] hallelujah oh [Applause] my let your anchor grip the solid rock oh hallelujah hallelujah when you drop an anchor from a ship it doesn't hold right away sometimes you have to wait a little bit it drags along the surface looking for a rock looking for a stronghold looking for something to hold to then when it hangs there oh glory to God sometimes you have to wait the an is dragging is only sand there the devil trying to lie to you but then all of a sudden Wang it hits the anchor oh Hallelujah God's Got all of you now doesn't matter what the winds say doesn't matter what the storm say I've got an anchor that holds I thank God for an anchor this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah oh give him praise this morning Hall oh Hallelujah some keep holding me the storms of life blow something held me something kept me oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh do you feel like way this morning amen amen so let me to get back to my scripture real quick and then we rounds up here that's be it that'll be about it but here was the church in St John 20 Jesus gone and they had shut up the door because of fear they were scared they were leaderless they were powerless what a position to be in this is God's people they were call out from from the world call out from the church separated walking with an anointed Messiah isn't that right signs wonders Miracles accompanying his ministry what a glorious Church to be in oh hallelujah hallelujah you need something to eat tastes bread and fish he multiplies it this happened that happened there's an answer for every situation oh are such a wonderful thing to walk with Jesus until all of a sudden they were found naked amen he's gone his precious little church that he called out about 3 and 1 half years or so they've been walking with him some of them didn't know who he was some of them were just glad to be along for the ride but all all of a sudden the ride was finally over they found themselves alone shut off afraid scared without a leader no power no visible evidence of any presence that is with them no strength to go on no strength for tomorrow that was probably the worst service to ever be in am what do you say in a service like that my and in that atmosphere they realized that something was missing isn't that right that they needed God they needed that atmosphere that was Upon Jesus they realized that they needed more than just Jesus being with them they needed that same spirit in them it wasn't good enough for him to be in front of them it wasn't good enough for him to be around them and for him to say nice words but what they needed was that Blessed Assurance what they needed in that situation was an anchor to hold but there was nothing to hold to oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right they had forgotten all he had told them isn't that right they needed their own witness of power amen amen hallelujah so Jesus being absent in that moment in that time of uncertainty it exposed the truth of what their real situation was isn't that right and the Bible said the doors were shut for faar of the Jews isn't that right the doors were closed and they were so afraid but then all of a sudden Jesus steps into the room and I love that kind of a scripture because anytime Jesus comes something special always happens anytime Jesus comes on the scene something always takes place you could have a crowd of people sitting here but if the presence of God is not here then this is just a crowd of people but once the presence of God steps into the atmosphere the scene changes the Devils get scared things begin to happen because Jesus is more than a man he is God made flesh he is a Vindication of God upon the Earth and manifestation of a present tense God and God always wanted to be with his people and he found a way to do it through Jesus oh isn't that right and here his power come here his glory come hallu and this to me is one of Jesus's greatest displays of power isn't that right since ever he was on the earth he had rose from the dead and you had already given a witness to the sister earlier that morning he told them go and tell my disciples I am not dead but I am alive and he told them go and meet me I'm coming to get you oh and they came with a good report oh Hallelujah but those Brothers weren't there for that service that morning so they came for the evening service and they didn't have a witness they were looking for a witness But Here Come Jesus into the building oh Hallelujah here come the presence of God the Bible says they were glad when they saw the Lord and the most lovely part I love about it is that the Bible said that the doors were shut they closed the doors yet Jesus found a way inside and I don't care this morning what door you close you could shut your doors this morning you could close up your doors this morning if God want to get inside he's going to find a way to get in inside but he's coming in there's no shut door that could keep Jesus out this morning oh if God want to deliver he's going to deliver if God want to heal he's going to heal if God going to seal with the Holy Ghost he's going to do it oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no closed door could stop God roll away the stone this morning God Is Bigger Than That Door God Is Bigger than that circumstance God Is Bigger Than That situation God Is Bigger Than That mind he'll throw you in a sick bed if you have to he'll throw you in a bed of Affliction he'll break your legs if you have to but if God wants to get in your life he will break down any door to get inside but he's coming inside oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free this morning I'm so glad he broke my chains I'm so glad he broke my circumstance I'm so glad he broke everything around me to set me free oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah resurrection power is on display Hallelujah h Hallelujah isn't that right I'm getting ready to close mus could come this is one of Jesus greatest displays of power he raised from the dead oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah death couldn't hold him he told them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up myself that's not any kind of power no Prophet was able to do this before no Sage was able to do this before no priest could do this no Bishop could do this no no no this is more than man power this is Supernatural power this is a power to heal the sick power to raise the dead power to cast out Devils power to push back sickness power to push back Darkness power to push back deadness I don't care how dead you feel this morning the devil is a liar resurrection power is here to defy death death where is your sting grave where is your Victory you have no power this morning over the Blood Washed ones oh hallelujah hallelujah you could play something softly he speaks to them peace be unto you he said as my father had sent me even so send I you amen amen he gives them a commission here it is you have heard the word long enough you held the word on long unbelieving oh but now the time has come to be made manifest The Life of Christ in you isn't that right and he breathe upon them receive you the Holy Ghost oh what a joy in their hearts the Bible said he opened their understanding to the scriptures so that they could understand what he had said to them that they could understand the word for their day the word for their hour the word for their season oh what a joy had come even in a time of uncertainty here come Jesus and I believe Jesus is here right now I believe Jesus is in this place I believe Jesus is in this building I believe Jesus is in this house I believe Jesus is in your circumstance I believe Jesus is able to make a way even now even so the right word could be spoken this morning in the midst of your circumstance in the midst of your situation doesn't matter what the devil told you doesn't matter how much he lied to you doesn't matter how much he lied to your family how much is Li to your situation oh Hallelujah the devil stands powerless this morning oh Hallelujah Jesus is here and he's the only thing that is certain his power is certain his anointing is certain his presence is certain when he speaks it is certain and his voice says something else this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah I'll read this quote and I'll finish he says I know that there's a big Dark Door set before me and it's called Death every time my heart beats I get one beat closer to that door some of these days I go to go into it but I don't want to go in like a coward screaming and hollering I want to go in this wrapping myself in his Robes of his righteousness knowing this that I know him in the power of his resurrection that someday when he calls I'll come out from among the dead and when he summons me to appear High when the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in cry shall rise he said B BR said if I'm alive I'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and shall go to rest with them up to meet the Lord in the air that trumpet voice sounding clear and loud oh it will be the same the same at is coming he said there's no uncertain sound about it there was nothing uncertain to John when he heard voice say come up come up hither and he come amen he said when Lazarus was dead in the grave and his so for days journeying somewhere he said I don't know where it was at I don't think any of us else does but he said wherever it was it does not make a bit of a difference he just made one summons to a man that the skin worms that was eating his body up stinking in the grave he said that clear sounding trumpet said Lazarus come forth and there a man dead and rotten shook himself and come out of the Grave walking but Bram said nothing uncertain about that is there Brethren he said no uncertainty there he said it's the same thing tonight let's all stand he said in a clear sounding voice say sinner repent I'll give you eternal life repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost brother Bram says that's the summons nothing uncertain about it brother Bram says I'm a witness that it's true there's other Millions Witnesses of them throughout the world today that are witness that that's the truth that when the Bible comes the word of God every word of God is a trumpet the sound of the word is a trumpet a gospel trumpet and when it sounds it's the truth and when it said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there's nothing uncertain about it he's the same yes sir oh I'm finished this morning why don't you lift up your hands why don't you lift up your heads and close your eyes and begin to worship him
