forget about yourself forget about what you think and get that religious straight or for you and to come to worship God worship I'm nothing what you have what you don't have enough to do what be who he is he is gone he is God and he deserves the worship it is a when you're sick many of your Bibles I have got nothing to do it worshiping God when your failure exam or your passing exam where they get promoted or get hired that's nothing to do with you when they got in an accident and your roof blew off nothing dude was a God we worship anyhow he said woman the our comin now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth we worship God any harm [Applause] well today you wanna go into the word return your Bibles of first Corinthians chapter 14 Thank You musicians Thank You Bella Anthony for the blessing last Sunday please go in there we want to look at first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 6 to 8 we want to look at just shut up to 17 verse 14 to 18 and Joshua chapter 19 verse 47 this is an important message keeping Bibles close to you sit down the edge of your seat don't miss a word so let's look at Corinthians first Fiskars chapter 14 when I read from verse 6 to eat no bread Reina if I come on to you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine an even thing below life given song where the pipe or harp to accept the give a distinction in the songs how shall we be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle let's go cross to Joshua 17 reading from verse 14 and the children of Joseph speak unto Joshua seen why has thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing I am a great people for as much as the Lord had blessed me either to that's a question isn't the answer and Joshua answered them if there'll be a great people then get the up to the wood country and cut down for thyself deer in the land of the parasites and of the Giants if mount ephraim between narrow fizzy and the children of Joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the killa nights the burning land of the valley have chariots of iron but they who are the chiyan and the towns and they who are of the valley of Jezreel and Joshua speak unto the house of Joseph even to every and the man assessing daughter greet people and thou have great power all those shall not have one Ludd only but the mountain shall be dying for it is a wood and thou shall cut it down and and the old goings of it shall be dying for for for thou shall drive out the Canaanites though they have iron of chariots and though they be strong he put it right back into their hands you're great you're mighty cut it down stop the old talk possess your land take your mountain spread your borders we're too small for your take more all right let's go to Joshua chapter 90 now one verse verse 47 you know is the favorite loser man and the course of the cheering I've done went out too little for them therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Liam and took it and smooth it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and murder in and call a sham dam after the name of Dan their father miss ball has father we thank you for your word and we just by reason that we feel inspired already father because we're your children we are sons and daughters gathered here today to hear from heaven father may heaven drop down this morning with your Norton that breaks every you come upon me Jesus and speak life to your people use these lips of clay and speak spirit spoken word may there be Devils cast out victory granted Lord God people set free people be healed and delivered even while the wood is going forward granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen praise God for title you may be seated war in heaven and that Israeli for my inspiration which is from revelation 2:12 and it says with seven there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels the subject preparation for war for your inheritance and my inspiration is war in heaven so we see what the Lord will do for us the word seer CSW r which is profit it means it's the one that has the divine revelation of the written word that's what we talked about Goss and a prophet we not seeing that just to say quartz and a prophet it was prophesied that he will send Elijah the prophet this book we call the Bible that we wrestle of faith and poop on is the book of the prophets this is the book that that the Prophet spoke so when Jesus a man suddenly by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth amount of God that mount is his prophets so the motive was not in the sky somewhere looking between the clothes the Mount of God are his prophets which I his servants that bring divine revelation to the people the day is a move trying to get people to play by the banner message in the churches like if that is the Ministry of the brain the mistake for the Branham for like some faithful prophet he is not he is a he's a major prophet and he William Branham represented son of man because the promise was true that Elijah the son of man would be revealed the disciples represent the fight for ministry so Jesus had a ministry which was son of man ministry but the disciples had a ministry also which was passed the Prophet teacher evangelist to bring clarity to what the Son of man has unfolded so even when Jesus said go into all the world and teach them and baptize them in the name of the Father in the numerous Sun and even the holy oh that's what Jesus said but when Peter came he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said that to bring clarity to what it meant by in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost because father is not a name son is not a name almost none amine but the Lord Jesus Christ is the name Loreena God so caught have an anointed faithful ministry to bring clarity to the words of the Son of Man he said because the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say what I've already been said in the world have known you mystery that God never spoke to a prophet because a seer is a divine revealer of the written word Oh could we give the Lord a shout in the house so normal is asking atomic criticism made no difference to know how many criticized he was the light of the day he was the word manifested for that day Moses a great highly polished theologian great man bought to be a prophet yet in all his theology his book knowledge of God here we go could not deliver the journal Israel by knowledge so the information of the message defended in Verne's he said he could not deliver that journal Israelite knowledge you see the Prophet cannot go by knowledge he has got to go by inspiration hallelujah so then he went in the wilderness you know burning bush and then God revealed to him the words he spoke to Abraham I am the God of thy father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I told Abraham the sand the sand us I am the court atole Bram that and I come down to confirm what I spoke to Abraham so then God said in light upon the world so in other words he's not missing anything he's bringing clarity to what he spoke to Abraham God come on the back Abraham off but I spoke that to him that's why I'm here to tell you I told Abraham I people shall sojourn for 400 years and with a mighty and I bring them out I come to let you know you at that hand that I'm going to use to bring them out and all your experiences as the come to this part that you could be energized that you could be inspired that you could be anointed because I have a work for you to do and your head knowledge and book knowledge could accomplish it but the fire that I have released and Boram says what does it so mysteriously he says the carnal mind plumb out of its orbit I love that what is the confer the intellect all trained in mind all them people who could be the people can any good thing come out and lazarette you had them confuzzled enemy when they feel nothing happened all of a sudden there's such a noise we say Grandia slowly goes wherever Jesus they have a lotta noise I said I noise an annulment coming on a donkey and a ball ha ha ha behave yourself behave what self what's up King common law in a donkey in all humility Oh Prince got any passion and branches [Applause] the Bible said way worse though when I lay the foundation of the earth listen I am finish yet and the morning satsangh together and all the sons of God not some all shouted for joy before you will granule shoten before you had that problem you will shouted before you had an issue in Allah he was shooting he was in silent it wasn't quiet he was choking and I got shouted back there don't get me started this morning don't get me started this morning if you shouted back here you're gonna shut down here this is the blazer show this show that basketball the show that's football the show the political meeting this shelter baseball why we can't show here when we are the sons of God they're gonna journalists coming the Prophet said the bride but leave your show [Applause] this is the place the lid off the pressure husband giving a pressure database' let it off the only pressure woman come and bring pressure here they let it off here three is going your husband CMS ago you got very true you must see here I'll give the loss of braces let me see your dad Richie he say yes brick you know what don't fight this battle keep a the wall okay the law some princes it's boring the house it's more on the job it's war on the street it's warning to church for cloning is war with family come on there's war with friends oh you didn't hear me [Applause] you want to know anyway somebody's thinking oh ho look at that bad boy here you go finally just know you'll get you'll get to that hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so therefore when the people in Sami all-time mark Samuel make us a king do what a king give us a king because we look around we see them a kingdom a kingdom our King aside a king with a king we're a king some take your money how do I tell you something wrong by your one King for God tell them they have not rejected you they reject me Hawking until their voice give them King walking ticking and go get them soul see hold that hold that temporary King until my king I will choose comfort holder you're walking looking there one manatee our whole manatee our your flesh and but hold that whatever you want what will give you that's why you have to want the will of God that's why you have to be a peculiar because if you don't know what to fight in an open fight you will get likk up in this matter my mom says the people has never want to go to lead them they want their own way of leadership and when you go down to a home he said read a book the book true consider in that scripture the people had come to a place where they wanted to change his program they had looked upon the Philistines and Amalekites the amorite sit tight and the other nations of the world and this scene there a king that ruling govern them and guide them for their battles and they see their lies sickening when I hear somebody doing some kind of kooky thing and you see Anna she does do it he does do it so that because he does do it and she'll do it that gives you a license to do it to your consort God or you're watching others what they do it's not what others do is what you would see don't ever see what somebody else do always find out what the words say hope they do it today I shot in the house but I am this brother doing that that brother doing that that's just supposed as a church member supporters are spies on the enemy camp suppose they then send them to do just for you to see to do live a follow that you are called to follow the word if I go on off run for your life don't stare with me stay where the world [Applause] so they have they saw Kings that ruled them and govern them and guided them for him but and so forth and this seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these Kings these are the people but it has never been in any age God's intention for his people to act I the people of the world or be governed or control like the people of the world God's people has always been a peculiar people if you were wearing a red node or combat no erecting every world he is so and so and so the coming that they would have out it don't bring it here that's what they have out there now what kind of clothes cloth material that is what they have that is not what you want to get that is not what you want you are supposed to be a peculiar people different people people must see a different from a distance they must be a different the walk must speak something must see something hallelujah everybody always when we're errands you can't be caught in that yeah religious like you can't be caught in that that Minister you can't be caught in that that what part you can be caught with that because you are different your color on this different no inheritance is different [Applause] this is not racial prejudice needed Ettinger the detentions okay Doce as you have money sectors Doce asked you is a boss and God is no respecter of persons [Applause] whatever I'm give the drama and Moses time when I see the blood he said you can be a priest if you didn't apply the blood you died if you were first born because the words think when I see the blood never nice to have when I hear a testimony that is that is right for a long time and your long-standing church member I born in this thing oh yeah well if you're born in this thing he said the blood who's speaking God speaking apply the blood who's speaking God speakin in the past who's speaking God speakin boozes just stop it Moses they're blocked the danger Musa stop push it back homeowner call me back somebody did you get that the priest castevet nothing won't stop it [Applause] he's someone you a wake up yet to come into here from going something you still coming to church come into church and coming to hear from God is two different things in them if you come to church you see somebody and see somewhere you say me honey I said young that's coming to church but when you come to hear from God that's different because the fire is here pushing out the word [Applause] we want a king we want a man we want a man that we can say this is our guide it's so mean I say that's my past there is none like him in all of him listen that has never been the will of God it never was the will of God it never will be the will of God for man to rule over one another God rules man could we say Amen that's like a fivefold ministry is on till we all come not permanent it's till we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man [Applause] I could push it deeper y'know in Christ has need a man or female or you ready this morning I could push a deeper you know [Applause] but we are one in Christ Jesus [Applause] so when you come to a perfect man you don't need no next man to leave you is the Holy Ghost leading the sons and daughters of God they can't sell me at Manta you know I admire your celadon the colleton thing they can't sell me that Pope thing they can't sell me after what the group after what this minister the bonus man after me the angel because I watch Joshua have to meet come on hallelujah those men couldn't tell Joshua hope that Jericho walls that was war hallelujah that was some big walls around that condition yeah some big walls from your family no man can tell you take that the captain of the host come on please not to me somebody let the captain of the horse for you to understand by revelation when when bar mom say the creation is drawing for the manifestation of the sons of God whenever I push back hands and push back diseases because it plays will be coming on I with assumption about the push them back does not just plain words if it has to be so you can't shake no court no play you can't shake look at the cancer look I say cancel it tossing our prophet last is canceled not hearing that chance I want the force of God when there's at the speech answer how to respond [Applause] The Voice present and spice lizard voice listen word not that letter let me see that some of you don't know you're in a war somebody always affecting you and you don't know something affecting you but make you see somebody affecting you you don't understand us at war let's continue free is gone God or God is our ruler King what the people today seems to have that same idea I'm so on they don't seem to able to grasp that God still rules man instead of man ruling man the truth is have a man in soul sonic Kish reputable man another man not a bad guy nice guy when he got annoying to me feeling like a victim so you feel well good started off good you going off after a while listen to this and he's true to the people right he was great tall noble statue of a man the scripture said he was head and shoulders above any man in Israel he was kingly looking he was handsome in the face he was brilliant extraordinary man they say no like there's no like wait this is soul no that's the kind of man people like to choose today the people does not seem to be satisfied with the way that God placed his church to be government controlled by the Holy Spirit they want somebody some man some denomination certain people to govern the church that they will not be able to show themselves completely into the hands of God you see this is what happens because they go onto Twitter 70 hands of God dr. Phylis ever the hands of a man and after backup the man will no be like that back underdog when they feel somebody gonna fight back in that church but it on the dog is that if anybody on the door you won't come out and after 20 years 20 years is still a criminal back on the door back you wait what a quarterback Matthew wood are you with me so watch so watch they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody to tell them just how to do it all about it so this man's in the suit and it's the whole luck today we like to choose such people to control our churches the cultural district God nothing I have against it but merely to make a point that it is not it was not it will never will be the will of God for such to be God is to rule the people that govern each individual are you with me let me find out his son of Kish his stature you seem to sue the people is roll up when I look great the crown on his head we have of the people green I said to the king of Israel for the other kings where our nation will think look at that land right know how they would point the thing I said look here what a great thing we got look what a great man that Rovers sad to see it's true today with the church they love to see overpasses now minded is the Greek man is a graduate from Harvard visuality ology he has four degrees out of sausage on the place is a very good mix among the people all that would be right but God's Way for his church is to be led by the Holy Ghost and by the spirit but they like to say we have this great denomination or we belong to we are started back in the early parodies we're in a minority very few people and small no we have grown until the place we have is it largest denomination there is we have the best schools the best educated ministers we have the best Rest crowds the most intellectual people and so forth God forbidden I should speak one word against that for that is all good but still it isn't the will of God that man should rule of a man here we go God sent on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost the rule in man's hawks and rule in his lives it was not meant for man to rule over them so if God gives you the Holy Ghost your Holy Ghost will respond to this word that coming from the horrible you will agree with what the word is preaching because their spirit in you will be a record that is the spirit speaking expressly the word Oh Loreena God in men Oh glory hallelujah back to the word wife you have to find your spirit in the world sister you have to get your spirit in the world you can do like a most pray to be a husband because you come in the church that way you're running away now he wouldn't want to come to church because you forgot you super spiritual he's a sinner he was never a sinner but he is a big sinner he is a big-time sin but you have no life the conflict that sinner because if it is it right you could you be so salty you get thirsty to want to be like you but when you're cuckoo he said that that means some help that need deliverance that need a breakthrough my god help me Jesus praise God hallelujah help me Jesus I am free to tell you the truth if you don't like it and I want to leave we said bye-bye this church destiny it's not becoming my who left or who would leave this just destiny is determined one of us and have the lost son praises people via homily revival anyhow we do not have rain to prophesy it we laugh top so they don't get much Sun oh dear it's Wolverine God said so he was in my bones killed in my hands I'll just stick it in here and then I read these two scriptures in Joshua I'll go to Orion for purpose I'll show you different attitudes so we are complaining spirit Allah give me one lakh will not too small we have great people God just for dividing land inheritance not too small my Joshua said let me read it back again and Israel I general Joe they speak their justice saying why also giving me but one lot one portion to inherit I'm a great people I like that I

they've done their religion that is not the will of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit here we go are you ready Holy Spirit wants you to live godly every day in the week and every night separating yourself from the teeth of the world but I just don't want that they want our man who can interpret the Bible the way they want to hear it they won't listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit he can chew the bible scripture will never say that we brethren as Isaac was at the cheerin of the promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so the chairman of the freewoman have a different inheritance altogether isn't that right so Balram said that's the reason I so firmly the nomes organized religion it cannot be heir with the original program of God because organization is not of God it's of man because the organized system separates Brotherhood so instead of people asking are you a Christian that actually what church you go to and depend upon what you say they pull the

because you compete in with the rest of the world my the reason what God God put you here are nothing new today because you are both best I know I know someone you are I believe that yet yet Samson was was personal Samson was caught this seminal curry looks and the only thing come upon him and he liked the light like like somebody outside a church or sorry I was for everything else and it Deborah saw a channel he could use because once I'm gonna surrender to God Deborah could use them so he moving now to use the light to get Samson from old are the anointing that's like no she doesn't know that yet she likes Samson he finds that nice man she don't understand what's upon him she doesn't connect to the anointing upon him she don't know the Covenant that is with him but she loves him he loves her and she gonna lead him to lose his eyes she's gonna leave him plumb off but God is with Samson we know the story Samson collapse he granary milk and then they bring home all the entertainment not go to like that it's one thing for a man to fall and crash but do currently that they're going to go and make a parade I'll make a carnival or Awards people you interfere with the Most High [Applause] certain things God does work with uncertain things gotta say no no no no no touch not my anointed do my prophets no don't do that don't do that not my no don't touch that you

hearing losses power was the anointed here in the depression mode frustration mo Bahia greenback please like but but but profits and and men of God no go by site that's not how we just walk so you think of me I associate I see any possibility one Sampson wasn't looking at this he was looking with this he saw the possibility that his sheep are anointed to come back upon him no he fell you know I feel God but that is not the issue because he had a connection he was son of God wants a son always a son once an eagle always a hill he is an RVer chicken [Applause] don't mess with God's people don't fool with God's people don't do it [Applause] here's some snow a black man's diamond looking for sure I'm not going to bring all this time one time one time servant one time anointed one time

in position I have to be positionally please before these dynamics to my mechanic it's coming it's coming it's coming an Ortolan but I want to be in position [Applause] let me see them what if Samson's one in milady feel before I've already grown that wasn't Pisa nzm ever them look at him speaking in tongues on the ground rule anything after that is taught him back off nothing happened and he stories what Sampson got any floor speaking in tongues and they took him back out the finish in sentencing that was my story Sampson placed between she was sacrificed years tears of sincerity wasn't playing a game this was B P etter die with the Philistines this is prepared to pay the price no because God's objective for him was to destroy the Philistines and God dropping behind the enemy lines God dropped Samson a means that you see you see you see is he God Delilah didn't even know what use does God use Delilah that get Samson in position to destroy most insane it is dead then he did in his life in this morning according to use anybody to get you into your position stop complainin you are quick hallelujah notice Moctezuma receded not a certain prayer he's a lord not failure if he starts to he finish if he starts - hello faith another because he going back in their sins and transgression of book hey Dina God or give me some more time to pray Samson had enough or that he wasn't going dear my two eyes you give them to me those eyes then Phyllis I'll take it out you give them to me it's wrong Singapore once more Sam Sam you there was a restoration of the world by the Covenant

friendship you don't want the encouragement you don't want some of them go to speak and blue you have the blues and speaking it and they want you to get it loose too then they could clink glasses together you know depression like company so it's frustration also misery love company sometime they like garbage truck to look in to offload you're overloaded and when they see you to see and if you get to collect all that garbage coming on you then the bullet hole it this is not the dump this is nothing to take your truck and go are not receiving a glass of take it and go not wanna get not interested in it thank you but no thanks keep on driving keep on walking and you protect yourself yeah you know that it off looters let us collect and then deposit one time around preaching I won't go in that round she didn't touch me tonight burns me blast a beleaguered bus disabled ramyun who rises he said no is that a basic business the biggest customer in town the only need in here tonight was gossiping and she proudly she didn't touch me tonight she's a collector of gossip and spread of rumors and gossip and sometimes he sings a mind I'll show you why hallelujah one time and deep hole the deep a woman come up there and all kind of minding Bram said that nothing against you isn't in mind somebody something bad about you and she think is this I'm thinking that it's just a mind thing in Saturday people speak it off thank you the your family affect your world and everything else this don't need for that oh praise God so the first battle ever fought begin in heaven and Michael okay it was true don't even write okay no before any battle can put an array they first have to choose a meeting ground a place where the battles we fought okay and the great battle that Saturday on earth there has to be a neutral meeting place there had to be a splay selected for the battle to begin begin and will batter to reach and the path aground begin in the human mind there is where it starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle now I know you notice a new here especially Ennis intellectually you understand this a lot at most time in the lecture could you know what human mind but what are you doing about it because all the men that achieve in the natural is because they went past the human mind you hear they saw you in mind we like but how much mystics in Muhammad may thousand so my time he tried his Towson's upon chosen and every time he he ain't get true he final not only hold not to do it that's how he was interpreting it they made 976 try and know not to read so not to do it soon and he keep doing until he did it light bulb the right aeroplane them fellows when the first tired of people want to leave the plane bird how they go fly how they go take off from what not there a lot of criticism my mother story you must plane crash no madam flying wouldn't think the running we even walk on different things but eventually it took off not for fun but it was a start so you have to take off maybe not something listen either get some cuff some Phyllis time I guess I'm spawn and I just order to be from you and as a weird is the first one it has to the first one even if you bring ten order Phyllis nice to fight you you still get one true goal right now dole back know you're half this not to get victory you have to begin to fight if you're praying for the sick yesterday go on pray again today they are going to be healed because God said so isn't that right here's why there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the battle the Bliss of the battle because decisions are made from the mind the head therefore organization can never do the work of God because the batarangs you have to go to meet your enemies in the mind you've got to make a choice that meets you decisions are made in the mind and tears where sit and mix you decisions are made because God has made it that way I love decisions I love mechanisms I like the choice of leadership I like the fruit it brings because sometimes after the decisions that that look like you have no bearing and religion on sometimes make wrong decisions right decisions but peace upon decisions you see the fruit of Italy turn on the road all because you want to choose God's plan and God's program and if you choose it and you have got intent and purpose god bless you if you're falling on you get back up if you make a mistake what will encourage you and pull you out because you have the right objective and you have the right motive and God will always honor that so when Jesus tells Peter calm and be just at a walk because you just wanted to come then he looked around he look on what the storms is and then he began to sink and he said lord help me and God helped him because he was in a will of God walking and he slipped he fell nothing wrong with slip and falling nice part that he walked to know our baby to just stop and say alright mommy I'm finished creep a comment true that doesn't work so not even nature the baby does say well I finished my creeping stage you know a commoner what we do okay mommy and he said how could we not know I live in yokes I could walk no baby we have to hold on startup and rock a little bit and then it's a big clap because it's done up first step I'll hop this duffel when I run but we clapping for a footstep because she loved it everybody one step when you see the first word one word man when rara rara rara forever after that rejoicing because we hear one word that's what borders feel too speaking the word the cheering speaking feat the prison me anyhow there was sickness and worship this happened is still giving glory God definitely angel you still you see that they actin just like me Oh glory to God look at David David know he was anointed to be king Saul after his life man give a little run and fight and tuck and pop and we play mathlete Chris you're nodding but you know here individual what did it say what I'm fed up yes this is this thing not for me all of the Scriptures read differently British of discipline but not David he was a warrior like Joshua he was a fighter that's how you have to become that spunk in the fight back get that spoke not to give up bullet he doctors have a more word upon your life than them than the gospel don't let the doctors putting on smoke over your life have more prominence than what the cost per pronounced the woman was winning died with a son one last meal and Elijah Warren man comes a big meal kick first that woman went in obedience to be cocky for that man and then he had to toss here the Lord you're gonna have when you have need of it oh my god Isaiah 14:12 216 said how I'd fallen from heaven Oh Lucifer us on the morning however cut down to the ground though with weaken the nation for that was said in that hat I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend under the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet long shall be brought down to hell to the size of the pit and here is bunk I'm dead that CD shall now look upon you and consider the saying is this the man that made it the tremble that making them that did shake the kingdom is this the man and wherever I'm said here when God created me are you ready everybody arrived Azaria if anybody dead stand up alright alright just testing to see if anybody didn't select nobody's dead inside a everybody's alive all right here we go when God created me okay now the first man he made in His image and we are now returning back to that image the foolish created image could we say Amen on that you see what we're going back to the first created image the image that God said let us make man in our image and likeness we going back to Docs and the Prophet was said to reveal an image say virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness that's the image coming back into you this is what around when God created me William Branham I was before the foundation of the world he made my bein my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know Paul said he chose us in him before the world began though there was some part of me and the rest of all you hear that's in Christ Jesus before the world began here to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this spirit or the spirit is a part of these angelic beings spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's like two-thirds of the IRS's and sin and putin's of the angel were kicked out and those demon spirits come into people and happy did their body they are demons that was once angels but because they fell they transform the demons it's not just demons it was angelic beings that fell and because they fell the major change come demons are you ready for some more coming a shout right with me I have a word from the Lord for you this morning okay so two tales of the ordinance it and those demons where it's coming to people inhabited the bodies they were once existed and they commented the people and give them Anita huh we'll go deeper give them a what Jesus cast several of them out of Mary Magdalene let me call some of them pride I got one even on that demon no even in our boast big people see unclean demon filthy demon for clarity demon and Malaysia strike without a man like the fighter we don't want fighter for go on a Frightened Rabbit they fight ish if there's nobody fighter will big some in the fight they'll make a fighter to be laden with the spirit behind them were spirits that was made a bath dear when God began to make man off he and his own image created a serpent shall be no spirits I went put man in a dust of the earth which is the first Adam that man was made after the image uh-huh so the first man was spirit man so what you're seeing here is not first man what you sitting down next to is not first man here what you sitting on next to the first and that man was made in His image this human man here which is seen right now is made after the image of an animal these human bodies are made in the image of an animal 20% semen did you believe that we got a hand like a monkey and a foot like a beer take a look cover and beer and strip him down pull his skin over him put up the side of a baby girl and look at the difference brother you have to show look loose the whole diaphragm the makeup is the same is the same form it's in the image of animal life because he was mean something in the order of the animal to lead the animal the man was to be like he hires animal to DVR the animals so course that I would fish and go right up on the monkey until you know and then they try this a monk man come a monkey my neck of a monkey gonna make in the order so don't mix us up at home monk eating butter madam says you take the holy spit off of a man he is lower than that animal he is worse than an animal that's a hard thing to say but you take up man is only generating his mind without the Holy Spirit that he records talks he will choke a baby out of a mother's arm and ravish off a beastly lust he's an old dog her morals are for her puppies the hog for piggies but an ordinary noble a con woman is filt all the time remember without Christ your moral can drop down to below a dog that is why I say when the spirit leave the earth what will happen to unhook Oh glory to God are you with me now so there are two spirits Lucifer and Michael isn't that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so you have that seed in your soul then live a sanctified life because the war is coming against Matthew 24:24 in second Timothy praise God three spirits isn't that right praise God brother Branham says watch okay any person any Church any organization any individual that reasons against one politician of God's Word is your enemy it takes the word to defeat the enemy it takes what it takes what the word to defeat the enemy so we want a church and a people that is on the word Oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus okay let's go a little further now my my time running in last year now here is the plan the first thing happened there's an announcement in the heavens what happened a scene is open what is that are mysteries unfolded when the mystery unfolds our trumpet songs it declares war a plague falls our churches open to each whooping what is the war for the Angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed and when he does he catches this mystery of God he calls for to the people after the missions given to him and what he does it begins to proclaim a message what does it start a war a spiritual war and another worries about is that Oh glory to God real war hallelujah real dynamics real battles hear what the Prophet said when they got the Holy Ghost in you approved the devil didn't move when that crippled man walk the devil said he called a meeting and said we have to stop this because this is Jesus but again no he gets singed with Jesus he gets some electric shocks but Jesus
