Glory Glory Hallelujah praise God praise God praise God Oh Glory Hallelujah praise God may be see that never in an age never in an hour has Satan encountered a people like this last day people he

that God see as the elect on the earth nothing could stop her nothing could interrupt her nothing could interfere with her she is the elect she is the predestinated she's the called out she's the forn

not the preacher this morning but I feel inspired this morning I feel on fire this morning I want to if the churches on fire May God put fire in your seat Oh Glory you may be seated now for the good manners I want to welcome AJ Roberts invited by sister Vivian God bless you Welcome to The Headstone Tabernacle praise the name of the Lord amen we just stand for a scripture just a few words before the preacher come but Isa going to preach you this morning blessed be the name of the Lord he going to bless you this morning Matthew 15 reading from 21 to 28 then Jesus went then and departed on the coast of tha and sidon and behold a woman of Canan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil yes and he answered her not a word no response no reply and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the Lord sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord get the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour let us pray father we thank you for these few scriptures being read just before the minister to come to minister us the engrafted word of God we pray that Lord this thought would engrave in the people's heart and may they be blessed and made whole in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated this morning just for tour before the minister come I want to speak about the right attitude amen I want to share some things with you that would help you trust will bless you and encourage you in your approach to God prayer service word word whatever station whatever comes to you in life it truly pays to have the right attitude amen the wrong attitude will get you would not get you the right results I'll say it that way the wrong attitude will not get you the results you would like this is Brother brand 1950 he said all right are you the patient speaking to somebody before I take a hold of your hand I want to talk to you a little bit course you're just a little nervous kind of upset like I want to get you in the right attitude of God mentally speaking towards god promise before I pray for you wanted to pray for her but he wanted to have a certain attitude listen to this one next one I watch him on the platform sometime in a healing service I watch the attitude they come in the other night remember the lady come with enough why didn't have enough Faith har to get to the platform she'd been in prayer line after prayer line I know the woman wasn't going to get well I seen her coming up here I knew it wasn't she didn't have the right attitude when she come up to get well she can't do it I said Lord Jesus bless your sister go may he heal you that's all I could say but it's not here she she's been here and there and everywhere but you got to take God at his word oh Hallelujah so he could see people attitude he could see how they come into church he could see it so making appearance is not good enough amen amen think brother Anthony struck that last Sunday making appearance a church member they appear in church pop that's not good enough now that you are here what next I'm not hearing you now that you are here what next because the woman she made her appearance and said Lord my daughter is vexed with the devil that's good he said he didn't answer a word disciples said send her away please because she harassing us she's crying after us then she come and worship Hallelujah she trying something she's worshiping amen Lord help me and Jesus response was it's not fit to take the Chan's bread and cast it to dogs am now if that woman didn't have a real substance didn't have something real she take off after that and make a whole big RAB tell the neighbors get newspapers Twitter it tweet it Whatever It Is put it on Facebook she name it she was going to have a lot of problem but that woman stood at Ground she stood right there I'm not moving I'm not moving praise God say it to I'm not moving say I'm not tell somebody I'm not moving tell them I'm not moving oh praise God she stood her grounds her Grounds was the word she knew that that man standing there was the right man she knew he had the power to do what she wanted done she know her daughter was vexed with a devil her daughter didn't have a two dick the dentist could see about that the doctor didn't have a headache Panadol and cfol or whatever that could take care of that but this daughter was vexed with the devil that's Spirit business that that needs more than than some medical discernment that that need more that needs something more you see when the devil start a ride it needs power it needs virtue it needs something more than you prepar to deal with praise God and when that comes on the seam you may as well have the right attitude because the right attitude will produce the right result and we want the right result this morning God expect results God expect to be de ding with his people he expect to people that to know their God to be strong and do great exploits God expect us to be delivering people setting people free breaking the bands of wickedness healing the sick raising the dead causing a Revival God expects something from his people not sitting on the premises but Standing on the Promises cuz somebody say Amen not grumpy and all kind of upset and mean and nasty that's not what God want God want the right attitude and the right attitude towards any promise that God has made will bring it to pass you can't sit there and not be healed when you have the right attitude for your healing God is obligated because he's the same yesterday today and forever we not preaching no fairy tale gospel we are preaching a living gospel a gospel that could deliver you and free you and set you free amen Oh Glory you may be seated look at next one here Jesus Christ here Jesus Christ heal the woman she can go home and be happy see why you're going to be because you come in the right attitude no one ever come to Christ in the right attitude but won't went away for what they ask for oh praise God the word is a SE seed the seed won't grow unless it's placed in the right kind of a ground and no matter how much seed you got if you afraid if the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of God is a seed and every promise of God will come to pass if you will receive it and don't doubt it and can place it in your heart and believe it come from God and water with faith it will bring forth half this kind don't never forget this statement I make this on my heart the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass listen that woman was so good with her words she chose the right words when Jesus said I not fit to take the ter bread and cast it the dog she B truth Lord in other words amen all of you do want to say Amen you have to say Amen to the word once the word speak to you say Amen praise God H you may not even understand just say Amen she B truth Lord but even the doors get the crowns of the master's table that was the right words she said the right thing she had the right attitude he said woman is your faith that fith knocked heaven and Heaven knocked that demon Thumb off of a daughter you hear what I said Jesus didn't even have to pray the woman's Faith hit heaven and Heaven pow Hallelujah pow knock the devil off a daughter he said for the sin your daughter is made whole is there anybody here who want to be made whole praise God you're messed up psycholog psychologically you're messed up in your mind you're messed stop in your spirit but God want to make you whole it's great to be whole you feel good about who you are you feel good about what God say you are you feel great about the promises of God you feel good about God's people they are the best people to be [Applause] among you feel great about coming to [Applause] church anytime I fight to come to CH I fight a fighting to come to church no fight did devil start yet that's why I say reach then what what you going to get from when you come amen are you going to waste this time because you got to be doing something else this morning you could be fishing you could be going to Market this morning you could be washing clothes this morning or going for a long drive to relax your mind but you come to church this morning no you just want to come to come to church you want to come to church to get something you want to make a withdraw from the bank all this money here all this money here and you come and talking to the teller all the teller need is a signature come on anything you ask in my name you didn't hear me this morning everybody should be screaming that one you hear [Applause] that anything you ask sign the form in my name shall be given unto to you I'm not hearing you this morning oh I'm about to get out of here but anything you ask am that's the position God wants the church to be in to ask anything so your wife half crack you ask anything you have crack you ask anything something wrong with your family you ask anything something wrong with your body you ask anything some the doctors give up but you can ask anything because all things are possible to [Applause] them Glory Hallelujah not some things are possible but all things are possible Jesus demonstrated it you may be seated demonstrated it to a crowd of 5,000 was hungry and all he have is five loads and two fishes and he didn't make no big fuss and said oh fish hear me Lo divide and multiply as my words say it no no drama just took them bless them believe in what he was blessing believe in the power you see that's the problem we we we lost the faith to believe you want to see everything first you want this you want that but faith is the substance of what you're hoping for faith is the evidence of what your ey have not seen it challenge you to believe believe things that you never thought was possible Oh Glory to God you know what I'm believing for this morning a dynamic Holy Ghost Revival I'm believing this morning for God to take the minister into such an atmosphere like he has never been in there before I'm believing for the glory of God to fill this church got the minister won't be able to minister because of the glory of [Applause] God hallelujah Glory he said the attitude is what brings the results say after me the attitude atud is what brings the results say it again the attitude attitude is what brings the results oh Hallelujah people touching Jesus and getting nothing but one woman said if I could just touch not him just the Hem of His Garment Hallelujah I'll be made whole money ran out she had a blood issue I mean this I mean when you have your money you pay your money but when the money run out you have no more money so she's desperate now she told herself she was speaking to herself some of you don't even talk to yourself but the devil talking to [Music] you talk to yourself going from the mirror and talk to yourself tell yourself in the mirica you're going to make it tell yourself in the mirica you going to be delivered you I'm looking at you yes you you know I feel people doubting that look in the mirror and talk to the man that you see tell that man that he's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost tell that man in the mirror that he's going to be [Applause] free I'm about finish the woman told herself told if I could just touch the H of His Garment I be made home now I know who people are they want to see Jesus with the Garment on waiting for you to touch there's nobody else around that's what you dreamed last night that's what you're praying for that when you come just you and Jesus alone I'll be standing on the platform there'll be nobody wrong you just walk up and touch and you'll be healed now that's good but that dream wasn't right that was only a dream forget it and all dreams are right when she came to this Jesus you looking for was a crowd around him that's right she a choice boy pressure boy traffic jam too much of people on the road too much of people around him I'm going back home no she came for a purpose that was in her heart nobody was going to stop her from that she told herself not her husband told her not she had a personal revelation inspiration and Fai that she was going to be healed amen and these guys who just watching wondering and just looking they have nothing to do with with what was in her heart so she said excuse me the first man give her room woman already excuse me what the second man say where I looking to but that wasn't stopping her she pushed she crawled under the legs she was pushing because she had to get you can't say if I could touch and like is that kind of virtual touch you know I mean this not this this not this kind of touch you know you have to literally touch this not no um computer touch thing you know this is you have to get there and when you have to get somewhere you begin the journey so she began to push and press God set it up that way God love it that way he wants you to go against the tide he wants you to believe something and and have the power to move past your circumstance and move past your situation and move past your your your family and move pass your natural environment you pass all your hurdle you pass all of that and get to where you're going guess what when she touch him Jesus say I just felt a withdrawal I just felt virtue left me who who touched me [Applause] closed disciples but everybody touching you he said no no no no this one touch was different I felt a power left me that's the ministry of Jesus Christ that is what these ministers don't have that is what is promised it have to have a power moving out a power oozing out a power leaking out a power getting out that's the power of Christ in the church could somebody give a big shout on that [Applause] one H notice what Jesus didn't say a mystery leave me a hidden one a teaching now unfold from me a feeling talkish that helping any woman you know Jesus talk you know she just draw from the bank she come with a already sign and he tell her have to stamp it ah let's release virtue my God it's Faith talking it's Faith asking it's Faith releasing virtue P power once Faith ah once Faith One Faith is presented power have to Ah that's what we talking about you're signing a signature with faith in it then you

is there a people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age can the church say amen amen so I feel so privileged it's a real honor to stand before you this morning

Deliverance in your house this morning Father may you set the captives free if there's anyone sick this morning may you heal this morning if there's a backslider here this morning may you restore this morning if there's unsaved in the house Lord may they be saved this morning if there's anyone Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire may this be that kind of a service father may as the word Goes Forth father Lord may it cut with a bone and the marrow and bring such Liberty to your people to forget about a world forget about the distraction and to focus on Calvary may you bless the word and the reading of the word today in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says am amen so if you have your Bibles this morning will you turn to me to one portion of scripture reading from The Book of Revelation chapter 22 certainly appreciate the worship service this morning brother Gideon may the Lord bless you amen amen tremendous So reading Revelation chapter 22 and reading from verse 10 and the Bible says and he saith unto me seal not the things of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter into through the Gates into the city for without or outside are dogs and Sorcerers and hor mongers and murderers and idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear it say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of this from the words of the book of this prophecy go God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things sayith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning hallelujah hallelujah I have a title this morning the identification of the True Believers the identification of the True Believers amen and my subject separating the word bride from the church members and my inspiration only the elect have the ability to hear from God Amen and before I get to my text this morning we are here this morning to hear truth we are not here to play games we are not here to just gather we are here to hear the truth because only the truth will set you free the truth makes you free we're not here this morning to entertain we are not here this morning to make you feel nice or to to get you to feel so excited about your future but you are here to hear the whole truth because you need all of the truth to know where you are standing ending and as we draw nearer to the closing chapters of time and as we get nearer to the convention and we get nearer to judgment you have to know where you stand tonight amen you must know where you stand this morning and I believe the time has come for the True Believers to be identified Hallelujah a lot of people believe that they are True Believers and that is the problem a lot of people believe they are True Believers and that is not the case because brother brandham taught us in every Church are three kinds of Believers and brother Brandon in preaching three kinds of Believers he said he preached a message so that people could assess themselves to see where they stand am I'm not here to assess you but you have to assess Yourself by the word to see where you stand because only the True Believers going to make it only the True Believers are going to go into the Rapture only the True Believers are going to get the holy ghosten can the church say amen amen sometime ago when I was preaching the message rapturing condition a brother called me up after the service and said he had a problem with something I said because I made a statement not everybody in here is going to the Rapture and he was troubled by it but that's what brother brandham taught us I can't lie to you and make you feel nice and say if you come to church you're going to go to the Rapture the criteria is not coming to church going to the Rapture is not based on attendance going to the Raptor is not based on Whose Church you in going to the Raptor is not based on who your pastor is going to the Raptor is based on you living the word can the church say Amen so I want to get down to some brass TX this morning get down on the inside of the Machinery this morning so that when you leave this service you're going to know exactly where you standing you're going to know the truth and the truth will set you free so that if you are on the edge this morning you won't be on the edge no more I'm putting you on guard this morning because the word is coming harder and harder and harder can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm laying the background the Bible says and brother bham used this scripture when he preached a message three kinds of Believers he referred to John chapter 6 and John chapter 6 starts off with Jesus looking around him and the people are hungry and he asks if anybody has anything and brov spoke about that a young boy comes up with Five Loaves and two fishes that's John 6 and Jesus blesses it and he breaks it and he feeds the people later in John 6 he starts to say well this food you're eating is I come for a different purpose I am the bread of life and a little lower down Jesus comes and begins to drill deeper he says except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part you are not part of me amen amen huh John 6:6 it says and many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a high who can hear it and people like to come to church and hear nice say but this morning we come to do some hard say and not everybody could hear it but it's for a reason because as Jesus stood there he stood for a purpose because his church was too big and God wanted to separate the church members from the word bride oh you don't hear me this morning God was starting a separation in his church in Jesus church had 82 people and when Jesus said these words 70 70 walked away but the brandom typed those who walked away as the unbelievers they in the church and he said the unbelievers are those who have problems when the word comes forth they can't accept [Music] everything so when you have a problem accepting the word of God you know where you standing this morning because the True Believer accepts every word and acts on every word even if you don't understand it because the revelation of what Jesus was speaking about was not made clear to them yet but the unbeliever say n that's too much for us we're going to walk [Applause] away we're going to drill down and T we're going to get deep friends this morning because you got to know exactly where you're standing if you cannot take the word by definition you are an unbeliever not some of the word but every [Applause] word 70 walked away and Jesus turned to his remaining 12 disciples and ask the question will you go also and brother Peter say where can we go because you alone have the words you alone have this message you alone have this gospel you alone have signs and wonders you alone are rightly dividing the scriptures you alone are bringing spiritual food in due season you alone are raising the dead you alone are Healing The Sick you alone could call my name I thought my name was Peter but I recognize I have a different name you don't hear me this morning you may be seated three kinds of Believers were standing there on that day the 70 who had a problem when the word came forth the 70 who don't want to obey the word the 70 who want to come to church when they want to come to church the 70 who don't want to read their Bible because brother Brandon brought out the unbelievers and those who were not taking all the word so they come to church when they want they read when they want they pray when they want they don't reverence their husband it could be anything that you don't obey no wonder brother Bram could say full obedience to the word will entitle you to the Token so there are people sitting down in Message Church around the world today and the one thing they're not doing qualifies him as an unbeliever because they're using their own reasoning and their own thoughts and their own assessment this is a hard thinging you want to get an easy sing it's all right do this dress this way if you left the world you can't be looking like the world if you left the world you can't be talking like the world if you left the world you can't be acting like the world we want to make the church uncomfortable this morning for the unbelievers [Applause] because there must be a separation of the word pride with the church members because the unbelievers can't go into the upper room the make Believers cannot go into the upper [Applause] room can the church say Amen so what are you saying with Isaac yeah this is not the kind of shout for Joy service a couple of weeks ago when brother preached a DAT I wait upon the Lord that was a fiery service he came behind it the next week and say every service it's got be fire fire fire fire is the word this morning is about the hard says about taking the word because the word comes to shape you to cut you to take on all the pieces that you may even realize is there until all that's left is the word image not your idea not your interpretation all that's left is the word image all that's left is Jesus Christ all that's left is a living faith living virtue living knowledge living outside of that but the brandom said you're wasting your time you may be seated it's one thing if you are living in Alaska or you living on a mountain and you have no transport and you can't make it to church and you decide to connect on the internet but anybody who has accessed to fellowship and doesn't come to church unbeliever I home listening to tapes reading books that's all right do that on your time but this year is God [Applause] name hide sins dressing one way for church and dressing another way for work hard SS but God will have a perfect Church acting nice with the neighbors but acting like a rascal in your house with your family H sing but it's the word there will be a separation of the word pride from the church members and God will force the issue because only the True Believers can take the word and stand the test and God will turn the heat up turn the heat up turn the heat up turn the heat up until all the all all that other stuff comes off of you can the church say Amen it's easy listen you may be seated if you want to go and just jump and Shout the Pentecostal church has that Hallelujah but this is the age of the Overcomer this is the age of the True Believer who can take the word wait till their seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who could take the word that's true believers and hand it there it'll slice and cut you may be seated don't shout manifestation until you can take the word and hand it there there will be no manifestation until you could take the word and hand it there until you could take correction until you could hear the word and say Lord that's me cut me I've been guilty I've been loow I've been doing nonsense but this morning I'm coming back to God I'm getting away from unbelief I'm separating [Applause] myself you are going to know the truth this morning and the truth is going to set you free that's what we came here you thought this was not you thought this was just another ordinary service but the truth is this is a different kind of service you thought you were going to come here and leave the same but the truth is you're either going to get closer to God or further away from God but something's going to happen this morning you thought things in your life uh would never change but the truth is the Holy Ghost is here to bring change uh to bring change in your life uh you thought you'd always be sick but the truth is this morning healing is here you talk hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated you thought you need that friend in the world but the truth is once you have God you don't need nothing else because the test will come to see where you stand this morning can the church say Amen friends I'm not from the world I come from God and I'm going back to God I'm not here to have church I am tired of having church I'm looking to go to the Rapture but only one group will make the Rapture and that's the True Believers no unbeliever will be there no make believer will be there only the True Believers will be there the hour now come that the True Believers the true worshippers could worship the father in spirit and in truth I'm not talking about your past I'm not talking about your mistakes Peter made mistakes but he made it to the upper room Peter was a True Believer can the church say amen and okay if you fall down the True Believers will be identified because they're going to get back up again can the church say Amen don't just look at me say amen the True Believers respond to the word I'm not speaking to how you feel I'm not speaking to what you did yesterday I'm speaking to the True Believer the word he inside of your soul the devil could watch you but he cannot touch you because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you are not the believer but the word seed in you that's the believer you couldn't miss this if you wanted to you had to be here because the True Believers will be identified in this season hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God a shout of Praise uh I'm not talking about the church I'm talking about the True Believers uh we're going to get to the courot but brother Bram said God could only prove his word by Believers are there any believers in the house you believe with all your heart you believe with all your soul but the pram said if you really believe God will give you the Holy Ghost do we have any True Believers uh any real Believers this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] H hallelujah hallu hallelujah huj hallelujah heart SS this morning God had to get the church and track and 70 walked away and there was still a devil yes in the church it takes a revelation to rightly divide the unbeliever Now understand this this unbeliever is not the world we're talking about you know this is people in the church in the church we not talking about Marshall Montano and Nicki Minaj and these demonic people amen we are talking about in the church in the message three kinds of Believers in the message people who still want to cut their hair still want to wear makeup still want to wear pants still want to listen to worldly music compromise on the word still put Sports over God still put friendship over God still put their life and money over God those are the unbeliever in the [Applause] church in the church with no testimony that's why I said sometime over this week here that's why I said some some you can't testify to anybody go you don't even have a testimony how could you tell somebody about Jesus when you look like them talk like them act like them curse like them listen and you would tell them come to church they don't want to hear you you must do something different to have the ability to say you want to know why I am this way it's because Jesus touched me it's when you live a life you have the opportunity to say yeah I don't smoke I don't drink I don't do [Applause] it the unbelievers are the easy ones to spot but you see the make Believers Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part for me and Judah said hey amen amen and Judas was a devil in the church make believer coming to every service paying his tithes the day before he get paidy can find a fault with his testimony always in church an hour before the service no argument with nobody no you can't put a finger on him but you know what brother Bram said the make believer is when they compromise on one word they sit in the church reasoning analyzing they believe they are untracked to where they're supposed to go but they miss just one word and brother brandom said the make Believers will show themselves because they cannot make it to the upper room but the brandom said it was just when the break was to take place Judas had to expose himself so we are preaching a message this morning to begin to expose the unbelievers and the make Believers because there must be a separation of the word bride from the church members amen come on somebody say Amen brother bam in the message the Queen of Sheba said now some people look at their symptoms my pastor prayed for me last night but my hands know better that has nothing to do with it if you are really a Believer you don't even look at that it's already settled forever God healed you what if Abraham would have looked that next month to see if Sarah was going to have the baby he never noticed that he just noticed what God Said and any True Believer looks to the promise not what the symptoms are around them they look at what God Said So I don't care this morning what your symptoms are your symptoms could be your children it could be your coworker it could be your boss it could be your sickness it could be anything don't look at the symptoms don't look at the problem look to what God said that's what differentiates the True Believers from the make believer and the unbeliever they only look to what God [Applause] said you may be seated in praying brother brandham said and we know Lord in the message who is this that thy church is not in the majority this morning the True Believers are in the minority but someday Lord you will take that Minority it to yourself is that's my prayer this morning that that Minority could be taken up this morning can the church say Amen in the message Mah the prophet brother bam said all true prophets all true Christians all True Believers stay with that word no matter what anybody says you stay right with the word they say the days of Miracles is passed don't you believe it for the Bible said he's the same yesterday he is the same today he is the same forever amen and this is this I mentioned it before improving his word but said notice it was by his Believers that he proves his word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much of the rest of them claim to be oh I believe see if you do God will prove it see it's by True Believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but by those who who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word so God is looking for some True Believers this morning and he don't need much of them because one will put a th000 to flight two will put 10,000 to flight listen I'm not preaching to the church this morning I'm preaching to the True Believers you could have walked in this morning for the first time but if there's a true believing seed in your soul and you could take all this word then God could use you God could fill you God can change [Applause] [Music] you Hallelujah but Brandon went on speaking about Moses and Caleb and Joshua he said now he had Believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish every one of them but the Believers in other words God allowed the unbelievers to die out because he couldn't use them God not using your unbelief in we couldn't take it he let every one of them perish why every one of them but the Believers who was left Moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and there people they have already perished they in church you know but they already perished perished in the wilderness and this was their children who were going over they were the only two that crossed over and that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they was the Believers they was the one who crossed over it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that his Believers was the one that do it and it's the only way that God could do it is to find some Believers so God is looking for somebody who could take all the word and believe all the word and can live all the word then he has somebody to work through are you getting it this morning I want to nail down a few things and then we're going to be out of here from The Message sman Church age listen carefully brother Bram said now those children of Israel left Egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same Miracles all partook of the same manner and water from the smitten rock all followed the same Cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night but only two reach the promised land only two were true or real Believers that's the prophet everybody coming to church everybody in the prayer meeting everybody reading the books everybody listening to the tapes 2 million people walked out of the world and head to the promised land but only two were real Believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because unbelief could not enter in then sins that is so but brandom and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stay with the word two stayed with the word when the hearts of the T spies failed at kades Baria Joshua and Caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more unable to take the land they knew they could because God had said it I have given you the land and all those Israelites saw the power and the goodness and deliverance of God they did not enter into rest listen which is a type of the Holy Ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of God I'll say that again but the brandham is now just speak about believing he's talking about believing all the way to receiving the spirit of God and he typed it as the Holy Ghost so people have to believe all the way to receive the Holy Ghost and brother Bram said any man supposed able to say when you had an encounter with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because brother Bram when he was speaking about Acts 19 he said it was literally translated as you after having believed did you get the Holy Ghost so you have to believe until something happens and Don't Stop Believing until something happens believe until something happens but the problem is a lot of people they don't want to wait they want to ask for it and when God says not yet because you don't have the character yet there are still some issues in life listen you could cry for the Holy Ghost all you want until you clean up the areas of your life that's messed up you have no Holy Ghost to get because full obedience to the word to the full word entitles you to the Holy Ghost so people all over us screaming Lord F me and God is saying you have the word why are you not in church on time why are you forsaking the assembling of yourselves together why are you not reading the Bible why are you not praying until something happens [Applause] then then then you going to get the Holy Ghost God is obligated if you stay with the word to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may be seated God is no respector of persons he doesn't respect pastors Apostles he respects no person God only respects his [Applause] word I hope this service brings you to a rock solid Revelation that playing games is [Applause] over you know disobeying one word could stop you from getting the Holy Ghost you don't reverence your parents the Bible says honor your father and your mother that's a word so you're doing everything else and you're disrespecting your father disrespecting your mother no holy ghost coming in [Applause] that and the word that God gives you is word that you could live on because you have a choice you always have a choice God doesn't take that choice away from you on Wednesday in Deo Martin I spoke on the valley of decision from The Book of Joel multitudes In the Valley of decision yes life is about choices you have a choice who your friends are you have a choice who you associate with you have a choice of what you make important in your life and you must be prepared to accept the consequences of your choices you sitting dead or worshiping is a choice because worshiping is not based upon you worship is based upon God being who he is worship is not based on how your day was yesterday and what happened last week worship is because he is Alpha he is Omega he is beginning he is the Ender he is El Shi he is Jehovah he is Jehovah there is none like him I searched all over couldn't find nobody nobody like Jesus search high and low still can't find nobody I may not have money in my pocket but I searched all over and I couldn't find [Applause] nobody everybody in here have have a reason to give God a praise offering you have no excuse what shall separate us from the love of God forget your back pain forget your arthritis forget your diabetes what shall separate us we are True Believers this [Applause] morning I hope this settles in your soul I said in Deo Martin the battle is not a weak battle or a month battle it's a daily battle every single day you have to accept responsibility for your actions amen the real test and only the True Believers can take the real test the test is all about your response we shared this in De Martin but spoke about that woman who said my daughter is vexed with the devil God wasn't testing what church he went to it was her response and in the midst of her trial she said the right [Music] thing job job's test wasn't about what he lost the discussion between God and Satan was what Satan's was is was was was what job's response was expected to be that's right right come on so all of the situations in job's life his children his property his animals it was not about the animals it was not about the children it was not about the property it was about his response because the wager was that if you oppress him he will have a negative response he will say the wrong thing he will curse God and even his wife said why don't you curse God and die she played into the devil's program but job looked at his situation he looked at his son he looked at his daughter he looked at what he lost and he said though the skin worms destroy my body I'm not going to say the wrong thing yet in my flesh I'm going to see God I might be able to put my hand all the way up but yet in my flesh there's a resurrection power that's got to come if I have the right attitude I could still say the right thing it could be bad but I could still have the right response is this reaching anybody this morning no matter what the situation is you could say the right thing you may be seated sister hatti Wright sitting with the prophet talking with the Prophet The Prophet is sharing an experience and she said that's nothing but the truth she didn't come to brother Bram and said brother brandham my sons are giving trouble no Jus said that's nothing but the truth and brother brandham said you said the right thing and for this saying what do you want let that settle down a little bit so only the True Believers will believe all the way to receiving the spirit of of God Amen and listen when Peter received the Holy Ghost he didn't have to wonder if he got it you know come on that's why I always say when at Mount Transfiguration when the voice said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased hear him and you hear the hear him part you didn't have to wonder if Jesus was adopted it wasn't a discussion it wasn't a speculation his life manifested something and when God's power is moving in your life that's why brother BR said it will speak for itself yes because there's a voice that's speaking and that voice doesn't give an uncertain sound we shouldn't have to discuss if Jesus was adopted if this one was adopted if this one has that it should not be a discussion because it's supposed to speak for itself and when it speaks the evidence or the manifestation is 100% clear it doesn't need interpretation because God doesn't need an [Applause] interpreter we're saying some things this morning from the message spoken word is your original seed can you take some more the True Believers can take some [Applause] more from the spoken word is the original se but the B says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over and that's not a man Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church now notice brother Bram said God did not not move Israel until his own appointed time now listen brother bam is speaking he said now listen this is going to mean something and brother Bram was speaking about us now he said this is going to mean something so I'm telling you this but really this is going to mean something to you Joshua waited for that time no matter how much people might have said God gave us the land let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to know thus say the Lord in a moment and what was the will of God listen but this wise godsent Prophet knew the promise of God but also knew to wait amen for that promise a clearcut decision from God for his time in other words nothing would happen before it's time these Parables now watch but bam said and when the time come God gave it to Joshua who had stayed with him by the word for he could not trust others he could trust him so will it repeat so God is waiting on somebody who will believe but also wait until God's time you can tell God s it right now God has his timing his timing for everything just as he told them wait in Jerusalem T until you be endued with power from on high but Lord I already you know I wait 10 days I wait 3 days I wait 2 days I pray 20 hours and God say time is not yet and god holds time to wait for the right people to be here Amen to wait for the unbelievers to show colors and to make Believers to show the because there must be a separation of the word bride from the church members because the True Believers must be identified can the church say Amen could you take some more from a message proving his word brother said now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method and that's why I say friends this gospel is not rocket science he said I am the Lord and I change n same yesterday today and forever he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers and then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age brother Bram said did it get you did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated did it to this by his for knowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinate anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestinate anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time but Bram said he predestinated a bride she's going to be there there's going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestines it by his for knowledge so there's nothing going to stop him glory he may be seated but B they reject the king but listen you True Believers in Christ you true Christians that believe in God and the supernatural all the time Saul was training his big army and all those intellectuals coming up God had a little David out there somewhere feeding his father's sheep on sheep food amen amen amen the word that's what brother BR call it sheep food the word not on theological weeds he happened to be standing by when that happened when Goliath screamed out David just happened to be standed by and brother brandham said they wanted to give David a seminary experience Saul came and said try my armor try my sword try my shield try my Doctrine try my idea try my Revelation try my dream try my prophecy but David said I'm not comfortable with that I'm used to the same word the same signs the same message when the bear came when the lion came I use the same word and I want to go with the same word it doesn't look like a sword it doesn't look like a shield I don't need an armor because the word is my defense and the word is my offense I'm not here to defend I'm here to attack because this word must bring results and I'm a True Believer I don't believe in the sword I don't believe in the spear but I believe in the god of Israel I believe in the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I don't need what you got once I got the word I got everything somebody give God a shout of Praise You may be seated the whole of Israel bed down in defeat in unbelief listen they didn't believe God could deliver them and God had to take some money outside of the army somebody who wasn't preaching somebody who wasn't teaching somebody who was off the scene but all he had was the word he was just practicing the word seven tunders give fi the pride is going to have a Revival my son is coming back my daughter is coming listen it was no accident when David hit the bear and the lion he had been practicing there's going to be a Revival seven tunders gathered up right together charity is about to come down I see a cloud like a man's

trying to show off he wasn't coming to make an impression he was by himself praying in the closet I'm praying for my mama I'm praying for my papa I'm praying for my son I'm praying for my daughter you may be seated that's what it means you may be seated to take the word and hand it there so when the lion come the lion picked the wrong day the wrong time the wrong flock the wrong Shepherd because David had been practicing for a long time and for 40 plus years we have been practicing for a long time and while Saul built his intellectual ministers with all their fancy ideas all I need is there's going to be a Revival there's going to be a manifestation seven tunders give Faith seven tunders is the all I'm doing is practicing every Sunday every Monday every Tuesday every Wednesday when I'm in church when I'm in work when I'm walking the street I'm going to be filled I'm going to be healed I'm going to be delivered and the lion Pi the wrong thing the wrong time the wrong Minister the wrong

the same again I'm putting you on notice you no longer have any excuse I'm taking it off of Min of the ministry this morning to put it in your lap this morning to live this word to be in this word to stay in the word to stay in the presence to stay in the books to stay in the tapes and separate yourself from all unbelief separate yourself from anything that takes you away from your promise whether I maintain my family let me maintain Christ but I need the Holy Ghost listen Hall when they give the emergency instructions for an aircraft they tell you if we lose cabin pressure the oxygen masks will drop down if you have any children make sure put your mask on first before you put theirs on because if you struggle to put theirs on and you don't have yours on you might both die but make sure and put your mask on then you could help anybody once your mask is on and friends the mask is the Holy Ghost because the world is losing cabin pressure this world is about to implode judgment has already been spoken and those angels are being held back because there are some people who need to be sealed with the Holy Ghost before the Judgment strikes so it's coming it's pressing on every corner and the oxygen Mass are dropping this morning so you can put it on and ask for me and my house Lord ask for me and my family Lord they might be out there but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord they may not understand but put on your mask and they're going to feel the pressure and they're going to say give me Jesus Give Me Jesus and the only Jesus they will see is Christ in you the hope of [Applause] glory Hall [Applause] hallu you may be [Music] seated in the message Fellowship brother Brandon was dramatizing the of Jesus going to Calvary and he was bringing out his drama because he said this was the only way God can make a provision for the True Believers and brother Brandon was dramatizing he said let's look at him a few minutes and I'm asking you this morning just give us a few minutes brother BR said the world's in darkness the church in its intellectual standpoint has fell to the ground has tled the nation itself is in captivity it's a dark morning first the sun rises pretty and then smoke begin to gather in the earth we're standing in the upper room in Jerusalem 1900 years ago and let's take a little trip now and look where our fellowship what happened the reason we could have Fellowship let's watch it a few minutes and see if it isn't on the basis of the shed blood and brother bam is dramatizing and you can see this Elijah Eagle Prophet is he's seeing it in front of his eyes he said I see him that's how he said I see him I hear noise outside the window what is it some of them say what has he done I see a little woman run out in front say what has he done he's only healed the sick and comforted the poor and brought life hope of life to us some man smacks her off the street said would you hear her instead of your own Pastor your priest away with her some someone else raises up and say I had a leg and he healed me take him to the Gallows but is seeing it but said I'm listening to something bumping let's pull up the shade and look out I see coming down the street a sight that would break the heart of any Iron Man a one that was innocent of any sin but yet taken the sin of all the world upon him never knowed no sin he never one time displeased God his father there would never was one time he did anything that was wrong he was the perfect and the only perfect man in the world and the imperfect Church condemned him to death talk about a place they wanted their own organizations their own fellowships and so forth but God was making a way for the True Believer for the real sincere the honest [Music] Believers but theam said as said last night every time the devil produces a Goliath God's got a David somewhere just always remembered that now God was making a way for the True Believer as Jesus had said he said I hear it bumping that's the cross bumping on the street I look down and see a little bitty frail fellow he's got a little white robe laying over his shoulders wo throughout without a seam as he goes down dragging the cross it's bumping on the street hitting against his head Thorns blood running over his face as he starts up the hill I noticed some little red dots on his coat it's question what are those what are those little red dots on the back of his coat as he goes up the hill as farther he goes the brighter those little DTS get and The Wider they spread spreading father and father and the first thing you know all of them go into one great big red splot and the Bloods are beating across the legs like that what was it God making a provision for Fellowship Hallelujah friends I'm read that quote because the True Believers is not based on your Merit it's based on the blood don't ever forget the blood people know the message and they have forgotten about the blood arguing about church and politics and fellowship and this church again and they have forgotten about the blood amen a blood that will never lose its power Hallelujah a blood price that was paid so you could be here that I could be here I'm not here by my own strength my own Merit I'm on nobody Hallelujah trying to tell everybody about somebody who took our sins who took our mistakes and you don't want to thank God and you don't want to worship and you don't want to give your whole heart to himall May the Holy Spirit touch you this morning hallu in the message and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy but the said that's the reason we find our organizations failing Falling by the wayside it's because when it come to the test what test God's word there's the test God's word is the test and listen to how but Bram put the test he said will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what God says do he said that's the difference yes sir will we do what a bunch of men says do or will we do what God says do that's the difference there he come the days of Dwight Moody the days of finny sankin nox Calvin pgeon all the rest of them those spiritual men their organizations followed after them they've got a bunch of men back there that's cut their ways into it I'm saying this for a reason Church because we cannot be ignorant anymore of of these of these things we can't just come to church and jump and go home and don't know anything so I charge you to listen to this tape again because we're saying a lot of things this morning for a specific reason amen we're not playing games because life and death is hanging in the balance amen I don't care what your position is your office your station is irrelevant what's important is the word and whether or not we measure up to the word but the man said they've got a bunch of men back there that's cut their ways into it each one believing this and that and adding a little here and taking a little away there and adding a little here until finally they made an organization out of it and when they do the real True Believer God comes right around and picks up some little humble person and breaks that thing to Pieces amen always done it God doesn't change just tears that thing up to Pieces some spiritually minded person people who will stay right with that word amen yes amen wonder I'm heading to the home stretch now from the message of sperian church age I want you to listen carefully now we under home stretch but bam said you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the nation Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to [Applause] it so who is the head of this church the Holy Ghost must be the head of the church because brother brandham said put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it listen brother Ram goes on he said the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference brother B say it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do [Music] that the point is listen whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are reprobate and that word reprobate means Rascal it means no good it means Troublemaker it means good for nothing so let me read it again anyone can call themselves a Christian the point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you for without that Spirit you are reprobate or you are a rascal or you are no good or you are a troublemaker good for nothing brother bam said you are none of his and then brother B says Amen to make sure the picture is caught listen to The Prophet not too long ago I asked a lady if she were a Christian she said to me I will have you know sir that I burn a candle every night but theom said what in the world has that got to do with it I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal that hasn't a thing to do with it listen to The Prophet it is the holy ghost or Parish [Applause] so it's not just I believe the Thunders don't believe the Thunders I believe the voice I believe the Trump I believe it's the holy ghost or perish in other words after the equation 2 + 2 + 5 / 3 is the equal sign God is interested in jump high jump low let the equal sign equal the Holy Ghost inside of you if the equal sign if the results is not the Holy Ghost then it doesn't matter what you have in the [Applause] equation I'm almost done listen but continues the same quote and I have to read it because a lot of people don't read these quotes with the B said well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on God the Deeds of the nians began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the word and listen all it takes is just one word changed and that little leav then Levens the whole lump he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all that's the word that's why brother Brandon can say full obedience to the entire word will entitle you to the Token so you know everything but you still can't forgive you still can't shake my hand you have no Holy Ghost to get you have no Rapture to go to you can't forgive your husband you can't forgive your wife you can't forgive and you're going into which Rapture which heaven but there are places named Heaven Hotel Heaven restaurant Heaven buses name Rapture maybe it's a bus listen but the B said eve just changed one word but the B said that will do it so I'm challenging you Church recently a brother said to me a lot of people say say what he tape Say Say Say and why we need preachers I said well brother it is not just the preachers have their role to rightly divide what brother brandham said because he said there will come men who will make more sense to it so you have to take what brother brandham said and he was telling me he was in a message Church where the minister just preach his own ideas preach his own ideas I said that's why we say say what the tape say and people say say what the tape say and then sit home and listen to tapes and forsake the assembling to justify their own issues God is not interested in your issues right God is respecting his word you want to get God's blessing become serious with God sometime ago I saw a a woman preacher I said not only is it a woman preaching but her head is cut wearing earrings wearing makeup I say no you just compounding the issue and when you read this brother B say just one word off and people stacking this wrong this wrong this strong and they saying we all going to heaven which Heaven why would God s a prophet for us to be doing the stuff that the Pentecostal Church does we have to climb higher friends amen amen let me continue reading I'm almost done the musician can get ready to come up and when that listen to how B describe it when that Satan centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the True Believers insisting that they call the aliens were the Church of God so the persecution sets in now listen notice how organization breathes hatred yes it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness that is what m means that is what Smyrna was full of bitterness a root of bitterness defiles many so more and more defilement was coming in and every age will feel its SC but said the sman church had drifted far from the original it had become hybrid it had hybridized itself the way Eve did you know what a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is a mongr how you expect to mix this with the world and get a perfect result it's impossible amen I'll skip down some of this but the B said the church has departed from what she originally was I'm a Baptist is wasn't so in the beginning I'm a Methodist is wasn't so in the beginning I'm with this Minister I'm with this group I'm with this in the message it wasn't so in the beginning instead of the straight word of God instead of the Spirit-filled men in the church who were led by Spirit given revelation they are now Creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of Revelation reason has replaced fith programs have replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the beginning the whole species has changed it is a hybrid Church listen to what brother B asked now when the church becomes hybridized will it produce pure Christians it can't the life or seed that brings Christians to the birth is not in them like brings forth like the Baptist bring more Baptist the Methodist bring Methodist not one is known by the power of God they are known by their worship and their Creeds and the original word will produce the original life so church let us get to the original word and every one of the words the musician could come up getting ready to close out here now let's touch on my scripture Revelation 2218 for I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book for If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy of this of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life this is a serious admonition this is how the Bible ends friends out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book but the BAM said in Ephesian Church age it is the changing of even just one word by taking away or adding to it it is the original trick of Satan in the Garden of Eden he just added one little word to what God Said and that did it it brought death and destruction and in Ephesus it was just the same just a word added just a word taken away and the antiw word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish and the B said the Antichrist doesn't deny the word but the B said the Antichrist believes the word just not how it's written we really in the word this morning amen Amen brother Bram said did you get it now now there are those twins again there are those two trees growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same nourishment they come to church drinking in the same rain and benefiting from the same Sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the sea that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock brother Bram said stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of Satan amen can the church say Amen am brother brandom says these Ephesian I'm going to skip some of it these Ephesians were Christians they bore a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them which was a which was one of the threefold names of God but B said these Believers weren't laboring for Paul or for an organization they weren't committed to programs and institutions whereby they built up H Holdings of value they worked for the Lord they were were his servants not the porns of the organization they didn't go to church on Sunday and talk about that name and then forget it on the rest of the week they didn't give live service to that name no sir it was their lives that were given those are the True Believers all they did they did in that name in that name they acted but if they could act in that name then they refrain from acting these were Heavenly placed Christians whose Behavior was in the Lord amen but the bandom said but that false Vine group that wanted to defile that name hung like skulking woles in the dark waiting to get in and tear down but the Saints stood the test and kept the word and the nameall amen amen so that's what we are kneeling down here this morning friends the True Believers will keep every word will defend the word not the church defend the word fight for the word content for the word fight for the word content for the word give me the word I don't want nothing else but the word because the word is the conductor of the spirit and if I live the word the spirit must flow the spirit must move the spirit must [Applause] operate you could begin to play something softly in the message Christianity versus idolatry but the BAM said that's right you have got to know the word stay on the word see the great battle is at hand amen amen now we have played church for years and years this it brother random but the hour comes now when Janice and jambres will withstand Moses as the Bible said they would and it's going to be spiritual battle conflict amen there'll be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into denomination and go on the way it goes but I mean the real True Believer is coming to that Battlefield and you'd better be Versed and know what you're doing or you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word young people the word says stay away from Shady places a shady place is a place without light a place that's unsure a place you're not supposed to be him because you're not sure you're supposed to be there but the brandom said if you're not sure don't do it that's the word if you stay behind the word the devil can't touch [Music] you so I charge you Church clean out your houses clean out your lives clean out your associations make time to read the Bible make time to read the message make time to be in [Music] service where your priorities look in the mirror of the word I'm not coming to check where you at you have to answer for yourself the Bible says judge yourself so you wouldn't be [Music] judged you judge yourself by the word so you wouldn't be judged and the word is coming clear this morning so that you can know where you stand are you a unbeliever you can't take the word you can't take rebuke you can't take it are you a make believer you want some of the word you want the you want to twist this or are you a True Believer Hall and your identification is how you stay with that word not how you stay with the church not how you stay with the pastor how you stay with the word because each of us have to make our calling and election sure because there's a Rapture coming and there's judgment coming this is reality friends more real than elections coming more real than the earthquake coming this is reality friends I'll close with this recognize the call of God's word in the E seal and it's an eagle to an eagle it's the scream of an eagle there was something inside a little fellow that he knowed he was an eagle and brother Ram said the same thing is with every True Believer when the preaching of God's word comes forth and is Vindicated and proved that it's God God's word for this hour then there's something within the believer I don't care how loyal his father was to the church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there's something in him that screams out he will leave that Bard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day day but this is Eagle hour it's different there's something he must leave the old coup and fly away Into the Blue then this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to The Obedience of God's word now when this Holy Spirit represented as the eagle flying over the land finds the believer no man can come unless the father draws him and this is where I got my inspiration from the message God's word called for a total separation from unbelief it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in she is separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she is separated only to God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride that's how that's her credential that's her identification may the Lord richly bless you this morning brother Gideon let's stand to our feet hallelujah hallelujah
