come tonight in manifestation come tonight in confirmation come tonight in vindication confirm your word signs and wonders and miracles may your power flow out this morning may you come and confirm your word may you come and vindicate your word May the fire of God fall here tonight may you baptize your people with the Holy Ghost and Fire send on the baptism of the Holy Ghost send on refilling sealings deliverances breakthroughs Victory upon Victory faith on top of Faith Revelation on to of Revelation manifestation on top of manifestation granted God we ask in Jesus name bless your word as we read it bless the hearers of your word and take not to the way and speak to your children in Jesus name we ask it amen Give the Lord some Praises tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord we feel his presence we feel the anointing God bless you thank for coming out tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Ephesians 6 1 verse there verse 12 John 1 want to read from 11 to 14 and acts 1 verse 8 read in Ephesians 6 verse2 and it says here for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and we want to go to John chapter 1 praise the Lord and reading from verse 11 he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them give give he power to become the sons of God even to them which believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we go to Acts chapter 1 one verse there verse 8 Jesus speaks but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be Witnesses unto me both Jerusalem in all Judea in Samaria and in the uttermost part of the earth may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise God it's so glad to be here tonight always a blessing opportunity praise God to be in the house of God where we could hear present tense where inspiration could drop down and give unction to the word not just letter because if you play back Moses tapes right now is the word Elijah tapes is the word the scripture of Paul is the word but what we have here now is present tense when the spirit comes down to minister the word itself and make it alive and Quicken it praise God so tonight have a title you shall receive power and have inspiration who can tame that devil who can tame that devil the devil is on a rampage the devil is roaring the devil is doing whatever he wants to do like if he's in charge but who can tame that devil and remember the battle is not against flesh and blood the battle against principalities and po so you are not in a natural flesh battle in a battle for your soul in a battle for your spirit in a battle to keep the atmosphere you better to fight for the faith even the church IM man right where Jesus just not too long afterwards he said contend for the fith fight for the Fate because that's some ungodly men that come in and screw up things and mess up things fight for the original fight for what was brought to you praise God praise God praise God in the church itself you see things falling away and the prophecy was they're going to fall away but fight for it fight for the faith right down to this age God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith that he was fighting for and we still fighting tonight glory to God hallelujah we still fighting for that Faith because that Faith brings it more than a revelation but I'm say faith is prevailing power right Divine prevailing power but he we have a promise of power here now acts 18 that's not Revelation power that's the power of the Holy Ghost after Dynamics come upon you after the Holy Ghost come upon you something have to come upon you not upon your head but upon you something had to cover you like a robe like you drop down rain Joseph rainbow caught upon you oh glory to God something have to come upon you bride Church something have to come upon you not to your head upon you oh give the Lord some Praises upon you not to intellect upon you praise God I get what the other ministers say it has to come upon you this is a thing has to come upon you they were in the upper room they were under expectation because Jesus gave them Revelation he open the understanding to the scripture they had prevailing power nobody could take them from that anointing nobody could take them from that Faith but that was not enough oh the Lord I shout knowing a message is not enough having a book is not enough you have to receive power Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house and Jesus the Bible said he came to his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him who is him the word to them give you power to become the sons of God you don't come Sons by books you don't come Sons by tapes you come Sons by power oh give the Lord I shout let me say it again good you're not coming Son by books you're not coming Son by tapes you're coming Son by Power and Jesus said you shall receive PowerAll that's not man saying that that's not a prophet saying that that is word made flesh that is God Almighty that put the Breath of God upon the church and say receive the Holy Ghost he put the breath on top the church to put the church on the expectation of Dynamics to the mechanics the Lord have praise he is talking about men who preach men who win souls men who cast out Devils men who heal the sick he said Don't Preach until you get this thing from heaven amen Oh Glory to Lord men who the word open up to them who understanding open who have Revelation Hallelujah who have the knowledge and he tell them sit down Hallelujah don't go out there wait wait wait until you be endued with power from on high not power from a bishop from America not power from a bishop from Europe or Africa or s America or Trinidad no Bishop whatsoever this power must come from somewhere it have a source of this power it have all kind of powers you know it a poers from below it a PO from hell it's a poers of R doctors and all kind of man and OB and all kind of wicked people but they have power from on high oh give the Lord a shout there's something called power from on high it's coming from on high it not coming from this Tabernacle or that Tabernacle well give the Lord a shout it not comeing from this church or that church oh give the Lord a shout it not comeing from this minister or that Minister it's coming from on high Give the Lord a praise in the house power from on high oh glory to God ior under promise tonight I am walking under a promise tonight let's go you may be seated my my my my my watch this we are like Abraham Abraham received the word and anything was contrary to the word he called it as if it wasn't and any true Born Again child of God receives the word of God I don't care what anybody say what the systems speak against the word the word is true anyhow then he said this God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off from him so every Minister every Pastor every Bishop preacher that move away from the promises of God they can cut off amen they preaching their own thing they get cut off they preaching their own Revelation they get cut off my duty is to watch what God promised I told this a minister he got shocked I said I'm not watching Jesus I'm watching what Jesus prophesied I watching the prophets prophecy the Bible never say Jesus stagger the Bible never said Jesus speak in tongues the never never said Jesus walk like a drunk man but the prophecy said they would speak in tongues the prophecy said they would stagger so if you watching Jesus say Jesus stagger you're not staggering J speak in Tong speaking in Tong that is you is what he prophesied guys why don't talk with brother he went here or that he went to son and he went Arizona and he went here and he went here and I do go there you because the promises not what bam do and where he went they not the promises you and you know I never see it so oh that's why he went up Arizona and he talk to this man here and this man here and he reading this book and I always want to know why you in there what you want to know for you going on there that your promise this happened to brother that happened to brother like one time B tell a woman she said um go and stand by the road and you somebody cross the street and got take her to a doctor to do the operation your daughter will be healed and next person he said when your husband get the epilepsy jump on him take off his shirt and throw his shirt in the fire and said this I do in the name of Jesus Christ he will never EP again you want to jump on your husband and off a you see what you see what I'm talking about we don't see see the present tense God and I see it in nature it have all kind of different Tomatoes all kind of different cucumbers go and make one cucumber one apple type of apple different apples different oranges different GP fruit that is God the god of variety and just he want one color man one kind of man that's God we serve and he doesn't have one way healen people one way delivering people they have all kind of ways you tell spit on a man and put in the G wash you spit on somebody and go tell him go that's not what you had to do Jesus did that am is what God tell you to do the lepers come he say Go and show the priest you tell somebody go and show yourself which cathic priest you you what I'm saying so you have to go in the flow of the spirit and that's why we need present tense not history not historical stuff present tense she said God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises so tonight we're releasing a promise the promise of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he's saying God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises God promised you you can say God you promised me the Holy Ghost I want it I want it tonight I can't wait for suay I want it tonight I want it now I'm under expectation for Revival oh

press you could show God that you want a reality you want a Deliverance that man was naked in the cave nobody could hold him nobody could dress him nobody could do nothing like that when Jesus finished with him all them Devils run into the pigs who can tame them Devils oh give the Lord a shout and the prophet said there came a voice one time that could tame them Devils that voice coming back who can tame them Devils let me say this to you when Co hit 5 years ago some Minister hiding you yes all time then power power and up in that's so much of power some of them even thought it was adopted and all into hiding you know you know why they want to get Co because Co represent death and they have zero power to deal with that men went to cast out Co and get kill theel men want to display the power and what what kind of foolishness who can contain them devils and yet the prophet said disease coming and sons of God going to stop it we are pressing to get into the kingdom of God before these plagues strike we're going to push back cancer push back tumor push back diseases push back plague plague Co was a rehearsal you know something else coming I don't have the name for I don't I'm not a prophet but something coming devil is stopping at leaving at Co he have to add something on top of that and God leave us at Faith he had to start something on top of that you shall receive power you shall receive virtue okay the Lord I shout God leaving us on faith it's a virtue to come on top of that is that power to come on top of that it have Holy Ghost to come upon that Hall faith is a revelation but virtuous power woo I have a revelation message that is good but on top of it on top of a revelation on top what you have as understanding and your vision and the knowledge and the open of the word to you on top of that you had the power and that power is what Jesus had that power is what left him he said when that woman touched him he said I felt a power Left Me Oh Glory to it was in him come on now preach back to me somebody that virtue was not mouth talk that wasn't wasn't mystery talk that virtue was in him it was resident power it was permanent power it wasn't temporary power it was power from God and that's the power he told them they will get from on high come on preach back to me somebody Oh Glory to God when they were going around preaching Jerusalem all over was temporary power was the anointing given to them to work with Jesus but they were not yet converted they was in big Ministry rejoicing because Devil's running and cast out from them that was a certain level that wasn't the devil that they could tame but when the season changed Jes Peter and was trying to cast devil and devil say devil said look at all you Jesus told all c not one of you could do it you see how bold that devil is who contain them Devils that devil was challenging those disciples that was given power to cast them out this one stand up and challenge them he not one of you could cast me out and here come Jesus off the mountain he didn't even speak no words had to come out his mouth no mystery had to come out his mouth no explanation had to come his mouth when he had to see it so and I had talk it so I spend for hour so no just walk and them Devils want to know where to go and how fast to go they're waiting for the order upon because something coming now it's a live voice it's voice voices it's Thunders the Thunder that shake the devil who can tame them Devils there's coming forth a bride in Trinidad that going to be devil Tamers there's coming a bide in Trinidad that going to push back against the enemy when the enemy coming like a flood the spirit of God raised a standard against the enemy oh give the Lord some Praises there is coming a bride on this island and around the world oh glory to God going to be demon Chasers devil Tamers who can tame them Devils hallelujah praise God but the bandam says we see the Mechanicals thing taken place now the spirit and he's going to identify it the Dynamics of that promised word oh we have promised word but it have the Dynamics of it that's right see what the spirit is now the spirit the Dynamics of the promised word into his church and drive them to Calvary and to the Rapture how you going to Rapture no Calvary so how come no killing this message everybody when he press come down triple then how come what your Calvary then to the Cross duck in the cross up to the Cross The Old Rugged Cross Jesus passed there before he enter into Resurrection Ministry he had to hit the cross you know no death no Resurrection you know we have to hit the cross that's why the the spirit itself have to drive us to Calvary because you not going Calvary those say Amen already let me say it again now the spirit the Dynamics of the promise word word word word word word what the Dynamics of it to drive them into the Cal under and RT one to Jesus when he got the Holy Ghost fullness he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness he was led to go on face CNN and explain what Ministry is about no he explain to the BR you know you know I'm the man of the hour not Jesus you know Spirit hit him when the spirit hit him Wilderness who led him there his father to do what deal with Lucifer the chief officer that led the overthrowing heaven deal with his source and over coming by the word that's the captain you know that's Lu th be the Son of God do this he it's written so the devil not sure if thou be the Son of God do this he said it is written so when Satan recognize this man is on the written he going on written too this is the devil quoting word is that God speaking it's God's word he's quoting but it's not God speaking the devil preaching Yes to Jesus opening text and breaking scripture the devil opening of the word he said Jesus the word said now you can't you can't deny that that if you jump down he will send his angels to God over you Jesus it is also there's a next quote listen to it you can't just Flo on that one quot it is also written and he lock him right there thou sh say the Lord thy God him only sh so the devil saw a man overcome by the word without any Display of Power whatsoever and he had the fullness of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily it was in him bodily now with the fullness of the Holy Ghost he goes to the temple pick up the scripture the spirit is upon me for he ha anointed me and he read the scripture read what the scripture will do that was the text they thought he was expounding a text that night that day but he was the living text he was the Living Word the very word they were reading was now made flesh oh give the Lord a praise I this is this is this is too much for me tonight the very word they were reading for years the very word was laid in the book was now flesh in front of them and they were blind they couldn't see it because the word now was become flesh and the word will become flesh in you oh give the Lord I shout you I want you to say Amen on that tonight the word will become your flesh you will be the word made flesh the very prophecy that the prophet spoke will live itself through you oh that's why God sent a prophet that this world will live in a bunch of people called The Bride that's why he come to SW a seed that that seed may take root and go and drop into the good soil and produce fruit so don't bother what all the devil has been telling you pointing you at your Fe failur and your shortcomings and your mistakes and your ins and your outs and your up and your down look at what God promised and take a hold of it look at what God say about you that's why I tell you there's power in the word and the devil trying to make you see like there's no power in the word because nothing happening that's how I see it only thing nothing happening it has to start with you it have to start with you holding on to the word tonight holding on to the word to now and believe in what God Said Jesus said you shall receive power not a man say that you know so you could look for that anytime yes you could expect that anytime power coming to you power coming upon you Jesus said the spirit is upon me he couldn't see that before before he come upon him he couldn't say that it came upon Him John saw the dove oh give the Lord a shout he saw the Spirit descending upon him as a do and he said God told him the one that is see the Spirit come upon and remain and remain some just hit and fly but when the H Spirit hit them they see that wolf inside they just take off can't by no wolf you're playing sheep playing sheep l so when he do recognize what going on so I do you you see what I'm saying so we have to understand our Behavior our attitude our spirit our words what will that attract because we attracting something yeah either attract the Holy Ghost you're attracting Devils never made that statement ever but be saying it tonight you're either attracting Devils or you're attracting the Holy Ghost what are you attracting by what you read by what you say by what you think by what you speak You're attracting something something is attracted to you you're attracting Devils or attracting the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some Praises let me say it again either attracting Devils or you're attracting the Holy Ghost stop attracting Devils start to attract the Holy Ghost Give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how but I'm talking about to get sem conference get sem conference when one time God and his son had to get together there was no one else could die for the sins of the world there was nobody would to die no man every man in the world was born sexual desire and that is what caused it to moil at the beginning that is what done it made it a hybrid creature we are born of sex human desire it's hybrid and that's the reason that God's DET in it he he said when God made his first man he never asked woman and man to get together he created him out of the earth he was a genuine plant his sin is what brought him into hybrid that's what the matter today the reason we getting so much hybrid Pentecostals you are listening to reasoning instead of the word come back there's a Gethsemane conference and the only one that could die come up to the hour and when that great time come he had to make his final decision what do we see about conferences conference come up with a decision if you have a conference with God and no decision is made something wrong yeah no conference a conference produces a decision and Jesus had a conference the father conference with his son concerning paying the price that was the offer on the table isn't that right and watch he had to make his final decision no doubt the father said are you still ready to go through it son he said it is possible father is there some other man you could find somewhere I love my people I love the Brethren you give me is it is it possible that some other man could no you the only one can do it you're the only one that's virgin born you're the only one that's born without sex no other man Bishop Pope no Cardinal no nothing can help you you are the one you are the only one that can do it then the Conference was held Satan was standing there conference going on Satan listening Satan standing there ready to claim the human race he said he had rights because they had sinned that's a big one punch Satan saying listen they you know I have rights to claim them oh God my you know there too much for me this is too much for me tonight Satan standing there looking at his rights he have rights to you know oh you didn't know that right when you s you all right he said he had rights because they had sinned so he had rights to claim the human whole human race because them Spirits is like them as spirit being without no bodies that's why they wer humans I was thinking about that today you know that these Devils could only really manifest through our next body then that why from the man with all them demons they went into the pig to do more Havoc so they they have to manifest their attributes and their behavior to human beings that's why they want the human race that's why they want to invade marriages and lives and homes and people and bodies they want that and the Holy Ghost looking to express through humans also that's why the Holy Ghost want you so you are special to God to be called aside and Sanctified to receive his spirit so you want to know God want to fill you more and you want to filling God want to step into your 16 element more than you want it Hallelujah because by and through the bride will be fulfill all Oh Glory to God God have to get in and buy through that person he

goodness I I I could sit down you could sit down at their feet he them for was explaining and you finish your mind SW so what did they do they waited and they waited and they wasn't satisfied they waited until there came a song from heaven like a Russian wind it fill all the house where they were sitting clothing Tong set upon them like fire and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit give them utterance a bunch of cowards that was afraid of evangelism a bunch of cowards that was afraid to face the dignity and the celebrity of the city and the religious critics out in the street testifying this is that that was God's decision Oh Glory to God to step out and say this is that that the prophet Joel speak of all the time they shut the door and they Clos the windows waiting inside there for power but when power hit them show no embarrassment no shame they had the anointing of the Lion of the tribe of Judah oh give the Lord some

this message has see nothing yet wait till the power of God strike the Church of the Living God the sick will be healed the blind would see I know we keep prophesying but we prophesy till it come the death will hear and the power of God will take over the church oh give the Lord some Praises right [Music] nowo go B let me see my where am I at where am I at actually this one of the shortest message ever had of eight pages eight nor have 10 11 this is eight pages and P three so we so we we pressing on so but listen a few days after that Samaritans Philip went down preach unto them baptize in the name of Jesus Christ though the Holy Ghost hadn't Fallen upon none of them yet so this holy ghost thing we're talking about is not talked about much in the message it's a real move of God coming upon people listen to these words Philip preached to them baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ though the Holy Ghost hadn't Fallen upon none of them yet they sent up to Peter and brought him down they know they had great joy they were happy rejoicing had a great time and so on but they didn't have the Holy Ghost yet hearing isn't it Joy isn't it it's the experience you want the Holy Ghost sensation we get to that not not so fast it's the experience you see they don't want to experience make them emotional they want to take dry in the message you want to be a Catholic in the message really dry cathol dry get dry standard now watch it's the experience it's the Holy Spirit it is Christ himself coming into you as a person and then he spoke about acts 10:49 we find Peter while he was speaking to the Gentiles while Peter yet spake these words the holy ghost or the Dynamics or the power we're not talking about Revelation now we talk about while he's speaking we not talking about Revelation coming on them or coming to them we talking about Holy Ghost fell on them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost not the pastor spirit am some people f with the doing so too all normal normal but the and all them hand going when he Spirit the pastor on on the people watch the pastor watch the spirit in the church and you see the Same Spirit while Peter SP this word fell on them for they heard them speak in tongues and magnify God and Peter said can we forbid water seeing they have received the Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning amen so that experience that the Cornelius had was the same thing Peter had amen it was no different but this time it came out the mouth of a GTI son it came out the mouth of a son that was in the body so it wasn't Peter's voice God it wasn't just words come out a man's mouth human it was a different voice it was what was in Peter was bringing out the words isn't that right but Bram oh this big ecclesiastical machine we got the big church machines has carboned up but punch will know with that mechanic it's got a spiritual knock in them that say pun said before read it pun said knocking carbon up that and the engine not performing well it carbon up a spiritual knock I think the crankshaft is bad somebody tell that somebody said but something going wrong they use the wrong kind of gasoline she all carbon up they use Seminary experiences of the Holy Ghost a great rev the land or a great man Heen campaign has failed he said everywhere it's getting Wicked all the time because it's all back to of God a great easic machine and it's full of carbon pump pump pump a little bit here she's done the gasoline run out your pour water in it everything is gone tires flat on both sides we in a terrible shape the eastic machine has stopped I'm still preacher and then he said this brother the lid of Hell come off hell the lid is come of hell and streams of demon powers is pour from everywhere it conquered the Nations it conquered politics it's rot to the core it conquered the churches until they only know nothing but denomination now there there's my Tabernacle our Tabernacle we better than that Tabernacle and all them kind of foolishness have Minister for the people with nonsense you say I'm a Christian I'm a Methodist are you a Christian I'm Pentecostal that don't mean no more as I said the day than being a pig or a hug or horse or something that has nothing to do with it you are Christian when you are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost not until that and you are yielded completely to the spirit if you are not yaling to the spirit you're not born again and you don't have the Holy Ghost you might speak in tongues and shiver and jump up and down and do all kind of things Paul said so he given scripture for it though I can move mountain with faith I can heal the sick I can have knowledge of the Bible I can go to Seminary and stuff I am nothing yet then he said oh my you talk about the lid off the kettle demons going around powers of devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men who is strong enough let's go who is wise enough who is powerful enough to tame this Legion stripping the clothes off a woman in the name of preachers Methodist Baptist even Pentecostal pain in their face like Jezebel bobbing the here wearing pants just like men our preachers not enough get about them to tell them about it devil possess it is Legion that toys close off who is this roaring devil this is Brother Bram on the anointed now who is strong enough what kind of denomination able to conquer him walking up and down to the tombstone ofation crying the days of Miracles pass and we don't need the Holy Ghost who can teame that devil that is where I get inspiration from who can teame that devil that challenge in the reality of what was prophesied by this end time Prophet messenger who can tame them Devils these intellectual Devils intellectual Giants in the message pting the people down like Goliath who can tame those Devils Oh Glory to God hallelujah who is strong enough who can tame that devil we can't do it by denomination we can't do it by ecle astical forces but there was a voice one time that did it that Tamed them devils and put them in the right man and put clothes on them that same voice give us a promise The Works that I do Hallelujah shall you do also oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah there's a next promise being placed over you you will never do it under ecle AAL gasoline in a carbon struck car you will never do it in the whole in an organization you will do it when you empty up and become weak and pour out all of yourself and let the Holy Ghost come in and flood over every part of you and saturate every lid of your body that's the only you can do it we we don't need an organization let's go we're in the home stretch what we need oh God I feel it pouring around here right now so brother is the anointing he's in the atmosphere what we need is a prophet of God to rise up with a thunderbolt of God spiritual lightning that will shake the world to shame empty vessels is what he needs what does he need in this message but you know what happened the message the vessel is full they're full of knowledge the message don't have empty vessels no more because people sit down and message so long that they full I seen it so I see it so why say so and kind of why and he promises still laying there that why Mary when that hey Mary I highly favor Mary one question how shall this thing be in know and all he said the holy ghost or the power or Dynamics going to overshadow you and that said she ran she didn't walk she ran to Elizabeth and said I'm going to have a child amen and all the God tell her is the Holy Ghost going to come upon you so you can't leave here tonight believing that the Holy Ghost will come upon you that your flesh self your trainer self your original birth self go get arrested God will come upon that watch empty vessel what he needs a call out church a little minority that receive God's power and blessing and his message Hallelujah get weak so you can get strong it will conquer every devil it will put the learner to shame it will bring men and women who God has called and that only remember as it one days a Noah so be come a son of man eight Souls when John came up a little church was certainly in the minority but there was empty vessels to pour the oil in get empty friends get weak here we go deny your own ability you out in radio not that and hear these tapes wherever they come empty yourselves out so this word empty out is for everybody who claim to believe this prophet he said all tape all you hearing empty yourself up out pour yourself out upon God's altar as a sacrifice let the angel come with a coal of fire and fill that vessel with the power of allmighty God and then he begin to pray he said let us bow our heads oh Lord Another Sunday Morning has passed we have been sitting solemnly in the assembly where your spirit dwells within their hearts there are some here this morning that has emptied themselves up since we started speaking and has realized that they have trusted too much in their own thoughts in their own ability trusting in the shrewdness of their own simple human mind which is nothing but filthiness before God may they empty themselves out humbly submit themselves and come for the filling of the spirit granted Lord there's only one thing left father that I can see that either you rise up somewhere with some empty vessels and make this world ashame of itself or send Jesus right quick the end is here Lord there are only two things left to be done we must see it right away for we know it's at the end either we see a mighty something rise right away or we will see the coming of the Lord come Lord Jesus he's praying catch away your church and if it Be Your Will Lord just before that church is raptured May their rise power oh God fill these vessels raise them up Lord shake this world once more we know it will be past time there'll be no repentance it'll be too far for them but show your power Lord fill those vessels and shake this world like they have never been shook before take your church then leave the world in its chaos as she sets in oh God they struggle and if ever there was a time that this world is in chaos is now you have a Chaos Agent up nor oh praise the name of the Lord praise God brother Bram the voice of the throne nothing in this Throne Before the Throne was Seven Stars and out of the throne proceed lightning Thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it is the voice of God to reject it it's the M Candlestick voices the voice of 7 chages the voice is speaking with thunder and lightning nowadays well they don't believe in s hell in the Pulpit he said we need men of God men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice you can't preach the people if you can't preach the people a sermon now everybody can be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you call to the pit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher amen but live the people of Simon let your Simon be lived and it's the voice of God oh a live sermon is the voice of God uhuh and it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them rejected they would say no one can put a finger on his his his or her life they're sweet if there ever was a man of God is that man or that woman they live their sermon see live your sermon don't try to preach it if you're not called to be a preacher you get mixed up messed up you get people Tangled he said you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and to live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons then he said oh oh we need in jville thousands of live voices the Thunder of God turning out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lies walking around the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy that's the Thunder against the enemy not mystery talk not knowledge talk real Christians he said the devil don't care how loud you holler the devil don't care how much you jump up and down how much you can shout or do this what hurts the devil What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on my that chose them away that's the Thunder that shake the devil we want seven of that one we don't want Thunders that door Shake we want the Thunders that shake the devil you see Jesus oh God in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God that was logos word and if I get it tonight that's living word it's not just text people getting misunderstand what that why he has telling them you have the Tex but you wouldn't come to me that you might have life now the text is the word the text is God in print but he was the Living Word he was the text made flesh yes sir and when the text made flesh it brings light on the text of the word so you say all the time you're in the light but when I come you reject me you go in darkness because I am the Fulfillment of what you reading in the book The text you are reading I am that and you could see how the bride will be rejected in this message because people have their own interpretation of how this would fulfill when the bride begin to Manifest this word they they reject her because the church have to reject the bride before the Press comes that's a hidden Mystery the Believers The Scribe and Pharisees rejected Jesus you know before pilot and the boys and them take over to press them down you the church World rejected the Christ in know well the church world will reject the bride in this message first am have to come against it I when to come against it the spirit to go outside now you say if I could preach like Billy Graham or Roberts or a great influential speaker some sometime the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention than that like nothing you could get all the theology you want all the Seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life look at those disciples come down here that Maniac child with with epilepsy saying come out of heav devil come out of him come out of him the devil sitting there said no aren't you making a pretty shame of yourself you see what you're doing Jesus told you he commissioned you to cast me out I'm not one of you can do it so the devil was challenging them but here come Jesus here come a life Here Come Those voices here come some thunders walk from off the mountain devil had to pack up and Shop so therefore this word is active it's spoken it's a Living Word isn't that right so therefore in the beginning that word logos was made flesh and dwelt Among Us isn't that right for the word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword so B used to quote this word and then go into the discernment showing the word is alive the word is God it's not how you say it uh the men mental telepathy it wasn't something he doing some kind of funny business it was God the word Discerning and telling people he could go back in your life and see where you make mistakes what happened and where you live and whatnot it had a one experience when somebody when tell him where somebody live and somebody thought it was a lie because they know the person somebody else and when they query it she said oh I forget to tell you a movie on her but God know where every fly B his ey God know the P present future he the one could only scope that the devil can't go back there he could go right back isn't that right praise the name of the Lord so the Bible talk about in Luke 4 they were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power it wasn't just the teaching you understand he is preaching and them guys being a paron and open up the roof and lower him down Jesus say oh God oh God give me some books here um you know load him up with some books and tapes no Jesus didn't talk that he come to manifest the word thy sins be forgiven thee Oh God that that they can't handle that now that's the word he presenting forgiveness to the man he say which one is easier he said man just pick up a bed and walk you understand what I'm saying then and the man pick up his bed and walk walk and God was vindicating what Jesus was preaching that coming back every service every service they will see the word being Vindicated the word word being confirmed brother had that we will have that as I were with Malachi 4 so will I with Ephesians 4 do you believe that you see if deep call to deep B say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting Angel of the Lord you don't know if you'll come sudden say he is here if he is here there must be evidence he is here we can't just B he is here they talk you understand that we can't just B he is here and there's no evidence of that when the prophet said he is here he is here to do a work he is here to cast out devils he's here to show himself alive oh give the Lord some Praises because he is here we coming back to that give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah all of a sudden because bam no Angelic backings is with him he said I take every Spirit under my control because he has a son have dominion on the earth oh give the Lord a shout in the house he gets an authorization from Heaven as a son he have dominion on the earth he said I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God and that son is now in charge Give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God mus come up please hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God this word is not letter this word is not just text this word is alive and living while Peter speak these words that Peter that I don't know him you know chist but pet is a chang man God is sitting on the throne of his heart you understand I'm saying he is so important for the kingdom that the angel have to tell Cornelius send for Peter because Peter have a channel open up that he could bring Heaven down oh give the Lord a shout in the house do you understand that you mean that going to return that will return send for Peter send for you give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God but even get ready close Hallelujah brother brandham talk about the people who took revelation God became the living epis of all men the word was lost for organization tend to watch dogma and Creeds are not simple word they could no longer speak for God G Wesley he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles watch this the people who took wesle Revelation became the living epistle read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others so it has gone through the years until the last day there's again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age that mean the tape will not be press play will not be the books will not be a people will be the final voice I want to repeat that not press play not tape not books because people will not need the books when we have to identify Messiah the woman at the well tell Jesus she said we know when Mah this thing he said I speak he don't talk no book and texting and Jerusalem don't talk about that talk I talk the father seeketh such to worship Him in spirit and in truth this is the reality now so when the seeds open it brings a reality the Bible itself becomes a new book as Isaac says are you with me now yes sir so there's a people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final verse to the final age yes sir the church in the message is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece that why ministers preaching all kind of crazy Revelation and sprinkling with a like it's salt but it's really their message they preaching right so go because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing amen you have to be able to hear back what you are hearing back in the message I can come and tell dream last night and unfold the dream and this mean this and this mean that and I have no dreams to dream last night watch so God is turning on her people in the church he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for here we go the voice of God will be in her sir do you get that the voice of God was in Peter the voice of God was in Paul the voice of God was in the early church the voice of God will not be in the books it will be in the bride amen because the bride has to be given a voice to fulfill Revelation 227 the spirit and the bride say for the bride to say she has to have a voice oh give the Lord some Praises then he said this he quot it right here he quote ration 17 the spirit right say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at the Pentecost at Pentecost they didn't play a tape they didn't make out a scroll Peter said this is the stone you Builders refuse and a bride will identify this is the seven Thunders rejected as the Cornerstone which is the Bap Holy Ghost it has returned now as The Headstone and the stone the B refuse is what become The Headstone of the corner Oh Glory to God because the seven tunders is more than just a revelation he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival that they could say the seven T being manifested so the seven tund is supposed to produce a manifestation of what of mysteries what Mysteries oh give the Lord a praise hallu once more the world will hear direct from God I'm going to skip down there are so much voices today in the earth I watch it causes the voice of God to be pushed back begin to play something and the voice of God they say how will we know it's the voice of God today then it wasn't the Vindicated Prophet today how will we know is the voice of God because it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word this is God's prophet and the true voice of God will only bring back that real living Supernatural god with the supernatural word and Supernatural manifestation of through it amen so friends what I'm saying the manifestation will be the interpretation when we wait upon God God will surely answer oh my let's all stand [Music]
