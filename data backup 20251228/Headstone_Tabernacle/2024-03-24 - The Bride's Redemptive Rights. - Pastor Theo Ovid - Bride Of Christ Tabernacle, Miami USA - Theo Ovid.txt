and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy we don't have enough tongues to praise you for waking us up this morning and giving us health and strength that we could thank you and worship you in the last days of the last days that's like that's like that's why I like the phrase it the last days of the last days father we thank you for sending us evening light for sending us this end time message that we can know where to place our feet in this hour Lord the prophet prophesy about rough times ahead and we feel it in spirit and we know there are tougher times ahead but we come here to be edified to be strengthened to be built up in Jesus name we ask it amen amen just before I take a seats just want to read one scripture I read two scriptures from Colossians chapter 3:17 whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him and from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 31 and 32 says whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God give none offense neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of God you may be seated oh praise God so this morning we I have a a spoke in Miami in a in uh in bride of Christ Church and I want to play back that message I I don't think I ever spoke that uh here uh about the bride Redemptive rights and I want to share that with you this morning um but before that I have something upon my heart I'd like to share from this scripture here and in the Amplified in 1 Corinthians 10 it says so whether ye eat or drink whatever you may do do all for the honor and glory of God and this was striking me and then it said the verse 32 sayso not let yourselves be hindrances by giving an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the Church of God In other words do not lead others into sin by your mode of life that's a harsh judgment in other words you better watch how you live you name the name of Christ then you want to live and act right and I have been contending that people have turned on the volume on life and turn up the volume on Mysteries and Revelations and information and stuff you see but what I want to get to you this morning before that tip comes on is that whatever you do you must seek to do it for God's honor and God glory you can't cuss for God's honor and God's glory you can't be angry and mean and wicked for God's on and Glory you cannot treat the Saints bad for God's on and God's glory you have to begin to do things for God's on and God's glory and if you begin to see that picture you would see your whole life transform where everything you want to do does god get Glory from this does God glory from that my attitude towards my wife my attitude towards my husband my attitude towards my neighbors the attitude towards the postman or Jehovah Witness in front of my gate does God get honor and Glory from what I do and how I live and if God is not getting unglory stop it cut it out because whatever you do whatever you do whatever you do whatever you do do for his honor and His glory oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God and the prophet said here he talking about my name that has labored and has not fainted for my name did you notice they had patience labor for what his name that name holding in that church now watch it when we get down to the weak how that Fades out and goes into another name to keep the name of Jesus Christ above any church above anything else let it be first the Bible said whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ you can't smoke in the name of Jesus you can't go in the back in the name of Jesus you can't come in fornication adultery in the name of Jesus you can't lie in the name of Jesus whatever you doing word or deed you do all in the name of praise God you see you could do that as a church member but you cannot do that in in the name of Jesus Christ oh pray whatever you're doing word or deed if you marry marry a person if you can't if they all scrupled up in their marriage don't marry them at all you can't freely say I pronounce you husband and wife in the name of Jesus Christ let them go if you want to baptize baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ if you have to do something that you can't do in Jesus name let it alone somebody said take a little drink you can't do that in Jesus name let it alone somebody said play a little CS you can't do it in Jesus name let it alone a little dirty smutty joke at your Bridge party you can't tell that in Jesus name let it alone you can't wear shorts in Jesus name let it alone whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ so whatever we begin to examine our lives and to see our attitude and our behavior and how it reflects with giving honor and glory to God and I'm telling you if you begin to look at it through those lens your whole life your whole picture your whole Vision going to change because you are living for Jesus Christ because one of these days you still have to answer whether you're dead or alive you're still have to answer oh to this living God we start talking about oh glory to God Amen and you hear me preach about it people have the god of their own imagination they have their good thoughts they have their own mind what they think God is but God is the word he's no respect of persons he don't respect somebody's pastor Pastor child Elder elder child Deacon Deacon child he don't he respect his word he cannot break his word to give you an excuse as we see in local parant he g a BL he can't do that as is you no as is you this is the word it has nothing do with me you know if you hate me doesn't change his word you know I didn't put this word here you know Hallelujah he said praise God and we read it in in prayer meeting he said he talk about after he get blessed and so on and then afterward you start to talk about like is your own strength get this and your own strength get that and your own power get that REM me the man a woman come from a train and and and her daughter and she came and the first was all burn and and bloody and different things and the daughter turned ah head from her mother's face and somebody rebuked the daughter and said you know what happened you you the house had caught a fire and your mother take all the Burns in the face for you and now you're turning your face away from her and she the baby could have died but the mother made a sacrifice and put her all to protect the baby that's why her face are scarred and everything else and the baby want and his mother and and the daughter want to turn she face making kind of I we sayy because she feel she somebody God warn them you know think about it now they're in Egypt I'm finish yeah God warned them you know here they are in Egypt and he's warning them D Jor he's warning them when you get in the land a land that you did not provide a line that that you didn't give yourself you didn't work for it they didn't earn it some of you sitting here because of the prayers of your grandparents not even your own prayer some of you sitting here because somebody prayed we back there praying for you that's how you're here because God had done with that prayer yet Hallelujah prayer is multigenerational Oh Glory to God hallelujah you hear what I said prayer is multigenerational when God ready to drop that prayer and answer that prayer upon your children upon your grandchildren upon your house that way to tell Rebecca may be the mother of millions and may your seed possess the cas of them [Applause] that Hallelujah this is not a game it's not a play thing it's real sometime I come here and I hold and B it how how to make it how to bring it how to unfold how to express it then the the the reality of this God that he's not in your dimension in your emotion and you're feeling and you're feeling this and you want somebody to feel sorry for you and you're in your own emotional trauma God nothing to that you know that's why PR trials and testings is normal stop complaining stop having a frog on your face praise God as we said the man who complained he had no shoes stop complaining when he saw somebody with no feet there is always somebody in a worse condition than you and that alone should Bas to make you praise God and shout let me say it again there's always somebody in a worse condition than you you have homeless people in California it have people living for miles and miles living on that tent you don't see that in Trinidad and that is the land of the braen and they suffering there and you sit here and glorious sunshine and take things for granted and some of you still fighting with this entitlement thing what you entitled to I hate that because when you're entitled you don't fight when you're entitled you be them complacency because you say you just tell yourself it's supposed to work out because you feel that you are entitled to it entitle means no pressing mommy will be

from my wife s here we consider this a privilege to be here so if you have your Bibles i' like you to turn to three portion of scripture Revelation chapter 5yp Revelation chapter 8 AP and Revelation chapter 10 reading from Revelation chapter 5 I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man of strong to open and to read the book looked there and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the land of tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seeds thereof and I beheld andone the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and of the midst of the elders to the lamb as had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them HPS and golden vs full of os which are the prayers of the Saints and they sng a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou has slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people nation and has made unto us unto Our God made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour our last scripture from Revelation 10 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven CL with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was with his Sun his feet as pill as the fire 10 verse1 and he had in his right hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice as when a land Roar it and when he had cried seven Thunders utter the voices but when the seven tunders had utter their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which your seven ters uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that live forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the seene and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel Ang said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongs and Kings let's bow our head with a prayer Heavenly Father thank you for your word your word is truth Lord your word is life may you come Among Us in a special way and speak to our hearts just one word from you will make all the difference granted father bless your people bless the pastor and his wife and family Bless The church here Lord bless the hearers of your word in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God God bless you thanks for coming out thanks for being here this morning and you walk with your fire you walk with your fire I could feel your fire oh praise God so this morning have a title the bride's Redemptive rights of an inspiration claiming or Redemptive rights that was lost by Adam claiming your Redemptive rights that was lost by Adam oh praise the Lord and this is the prophet from he that is in you he said while the Harvest is r and the laborers are few there might be someone that's tonight might change the whole cause it means that one service we don't know could be diservice we don't know could be a service just like this that one person walk into this place and everything changes what is is he talking about he said remember there is a Time coming that might close the books remember there will not be one more come in when them names are redeemed so in other words one day the last name will step in somewhere part of the world and when that name is [Music] redeemed this book is closed this book that you're hearing every Sunday every service you're hearing from this book this book will be closed all that ever would be redeemed God put their name on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world so God is not scratching his head wondering if to redeem you he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life Before world oh praise God let's go now when that last name has been redeemed his work is finished and he comes forth to claim what he has redeemed note he's not talking about when the last one is saved he is not talking about salvation he's talking about Redemption and to redeem be redeemed is to go back to where it was first in other words redeem means to bring you back to your first standing and in the beginning God said let us make man in our image and likeness let that man have dominion and God plac Adam to be that son that will produce other Sons just like him because every seed must bring forth after its kind but we know the story the devil came in interrupted the program of God and Adam fell and we fell with Adam but God has purposed that his sons and daughters will be restored and that is what caught you today you are going to be restored whether you feel like it or you don't feel like it God cannot lie you are going to be restored and there isn't have it doesn't have enough devils in hell to stop that restoration God call you out a Catholic God call you out Baptist God called out of this world and the one who started the work will complete the work glory to God amen hallelujah amen when Adam fell the book or the deed or the authority that was given to Adam he lost it it slip out of his hands Satan who was kicked to heaven and fell on the earth he thought he could grab it but his greasy hands of unbelief couldn't hold a book this book that Adam had your name in itam was to call your name Adam had the book and when Adam fell the book went back into the hands of the original owner God held the book God held your name God held your Redemption God H you coming back oh blessed be the Lord so all the years and generations the prophecy Al is coming a lamb is coming a lamb is coming before the lamb came was bulls and goats and natural lambs and offerings but it was prophesying of a lamb coming which will be God himself veiled as a man to pay the price not for your salvation not only for your salvation but to pay the price for your Redemption do you understand that now do you understand that now Jesus didn't die just to save us Jesus died to get the book amen hallelujah amen Jesus died to get the book this book is not a normal book it's not an ordinary book this book have God thoughts in it because a book has words in it and before it come words it has to be thought so God was thinking about you and put his thoughts in a book which is your name and you sit here as if you don't know what I'm talking about but you know what I'm talking about you didn't call you you didn't call you he said I have chosen you I have called you oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so this book was sealed so the devil don't know what's in that b the devil don't know who you are the devil don't know where you come from and the devil don't know where you're going give the Lord Give the Lord a do you get it this book was sealed now when Jesus came three wise men gold frankincense go frankincense and the three gifts that God in service to die God in service to die I I learn when I'm finished so Jesus he came and died to do what Jesus died for our sins that's Pentecostals but Jesus died because there was no man who found worthy hallelujah amen who is worthy who is worth who isth to take the book Oh Glory to God I look under the Earth no man was worthy no message man no Pope man no Bishop of but here come bleeding bloody bleeding bloody the God hallelujah amen what did he do he didn't ask for he took it he took the book and loose the seals when John saw it John said all in heaven all under the Earth heard I praise God John began to praise God never before and when you begin to understand that you are won in a million won in a million yes they may have trouble yes they go through depressions and frustrations we are not talking about that this morning we are talking about Jehovah about God put your name in that book and you are going to be redeemed because if you're not redeemed the book can close once the bride is redeem the book is closed and the angel in Revelation 10 already said time no longer time itself will be finished we are living in the last days of the last days some Praises do you understand when that Mighty angel came on the he swore time runs [Applause] out so you sit here and the

Pride have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with Brethren brothers and sisters you cannot fight what you don't know is your own [Applause] amen listen again you canot fight for what you

be a time of manifestation Revelation it's for you to understand with Clarity what is your inheritance and what is your possession and what is your [Applause] rights as a sinner you have no rights except the right to repent and get baptized in Jesus name and get your heart right with God as a Believer come whose name is in the book that God has called you have rights you have something the devil cannot have never had could never have hallelujah amen listen the prodal son when he understood his sonship he was he was backd he wasted his father's money which was inheritance given to him

name has been redeemed we are not talking about saved not talking about a nice church member in church talking about that talking about you understanding by Revelation the mystery of God is to take you back to Eden to get back to Eden the lamb had to pay the price it was a blood price it wasn't the US dollar or the money of a billionaire a blood price not any blood but the blood of God that's what Jesus had so when Satan offer Jesus all the kingdom of this world Jesus could have said okay so I don't have to die then that if he didn't do that if he didn't die we would be lost and Satan would be Jesus boss but Jesus said no I love those people in the bride of Christ Tabernacle I love those people for the last days I will die for them I will pay the price for them and I will come myself the mighty Angel not with a closed book but an open book and from that book I'm going to call their names by the word so when you hear the word and you receive the word you are hearing your name and receiving the revelation of what God say you are not your feelings not your emotions is not a black man God is not a white man God is Not culture God is the word God Is Not An American God is not a European God is the word if you hear it receive it believe it and act upon it it will become flesh in you give the Lord some Praises I Glory this morning I'm not preaching to your feelings I am not preaching to your emotions I am preaching to the seed your soul glory to God glory because to be a word to be the word you have to be a thought first that's why Jesus could find the woman at the well even though she was living a contrary life she had a seed in her that she did not know so they take the word to Reve that woman that she's more than a prostitute she's more than a slacker she's more what everybody thinks about her so you cannot bother you cannot bother with what people think about you that is De thought that is not God thought I don't care what others think about me what does God think about and if God my son nothing could stop that if God you are my daughter nothing could stop that oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah glory

concerned I am a son all these are God's son why are you pin down why are you heavy why are you not show in the victory why are you heavy laden David said I'll cut his head off without a sword so I

not hearing you I am not hearing you I am not hearing you you have been protected more than you think you are stronger than you think Oh Glory to God you have more faith than you think Oh Glory to God glory my God Is by very strange circumstance I am here this morning I told my wife I said what if what happened was to cause me to be here being in Miami at this point in time wasn't part of my plan so God set up certain things to make this possible so when I'm coming here I'm coming here believing this is not natural this is Supernatural and there is something the Lord want to get to his people this morning because you have to understand that when you see who you are you could then claim your [Applause] rights if there's a land in a house you can't go and say that is mind I claim it if you see some land on house you say I'm a Believer I claim that land hopes in Jesus name are you crazy you buy that you pay for that you watching somebody El land and claiming it it doesn't work so doesn't work like that when your father or your grandfather or somebody leave you inheritance and you didn't know because you was small and but as you grow up some an uncle come and tell you this is yours this is yours this is yours then you have a document which is the evidence Authority that that is yours squatters are on that land smokers and marijuana smokers on that land with that document you can come and say get up I giving you one notice this is the first notice get out of my land not could you please [Applause] get am and Jesus he died to reveal our promises that we could know what we have a right to access to oh my God Amen all the preach this morning hallelujah amen glory to God so redeem doesn't mean to be Sav redeem means you have brought brought from Faith straight up to charity that has been redeemed to first God redeem your soul saved then redeem your spirit by replacing your spirit with that spirit then you have a perfect man inside of you the last part the last part is to redeem your body by a fire baptism of the Holy Ghost then your soul is redeemed your spirit is redeemed and then your body is redeemed the Earth can't hold you no more you have to leave here oh glory to God amen hallelujah amen oh my amen so listen to this part for the BR and this is from Revelation 5 part 2 and uh you can put up this quote for me and this the part I want to get here now for it is the holy spirit okay ra saying here okay now over in Ephesians we have the earnest of our salvation and the earnest of our Redemption you could so in EP we have the earnest of salvation for it is the holy spirit that is the earnest our Redemption and then he said the next few weeks of teaching the next few weeks of teaching will be all based upon Redemption not justification not the medial work of office of intercession so brother br was bringing the word about Redemption which takes you completely out from Pentecostal or completely out of the denominational real because not Redemption you have to go back to your inheritance you understand that so you then before God are not a sinner mercy God Mercy Jesus this Redemption is the placement of sons that God wants to get back inheritance okay let's let me just back up a little bit now josa and Ephesians is the same book but now Redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into so come out a Baptist Catholic but some some of you just come out but you have to go in now Moses brought them out of Egypt Joshua took them into the land and Joshua had three things to do crossed over Jordan fight and then divide inheritance now theing of The Inheritance you cannot ask for inheritance talk about I am not worthy that I am not worthy story doesn't count so we not talking about I am not worthy if you go to I am not worthy you at the level of The Sinner when when when Caleb came to his portion Caleb said I'm not talking for Judah I'm not talking for ephra I'm not talking for Benjamin I'm not talking for no give me my Mountain soale had a revelation Oh Glory to God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and I preaching my brother B and sharing some about Mary how Mary was in service and she was hearing the scriptures preach shall conceive like all the sisters there they know it has to happen but that was a general belief promised that it will happen because God said so but when the angel appeared to Mary and said Heil Mary you were highly favored when the angel finished with Mary Mary didn't say this is where everybody am she said be it done unto me according to Thy Word and when you get a revelation of your Redemptive rights you going to make claims you going to make your claim for your healing for your deliverance for the Holy Ghost for your husband for your wife for your children for your future for your finances whatever it is you want to make your claim glory to God oh my my myen Hallelujah you make a claim in your mind you know thinking it no no Hallelujah I don't know if I get time but but God had to speak the word before the word come to so first is a thought have to speak it so when of Angel Hallelujah the voice oh my God Amen Revelation 10 this have everything in it Revelation 101 is your husband is your husband that's Christ himself Revelation 103 seven tunders that's your message exclusive bright promise exclusive only for the bride 10 that's the messenger of this age but Revelation 10 the voice say go to the angel the book and ask him for the book you the bride John represented the bride you have to go to the angel because in that book have your Redemptive rights don't let no man stop you possessing your rights have a right to be healed I have a right to be free right to walk anointed hallelujah amen that is my right do you know your right my God praise the Lord praise the Lord listen to this if Christ died at Calvary he finished everything that was in the Redemptive plan everything was completed when he died at Calvary price was paid for so God had a Redemptive plan the plan means how do I get back my son's back but remember church is not original church is a means by which God connects to his people but in the beginning was a man and his wife not church and we are returning back to God turning back to Eden praise the Lord hallelujah am so Jesus had a Redemptive work to do now watch so the lamb here's the plan of it skip a seal is open a Myster is unfolded and when the mystery unfolds a trumpet song it declares war a plague fall and our church is he begins to proclaim the message and what does it start a spiritual war and then those who reject it a plague Falls and that keep going over and over it's a great plan until it comes to that last Angel he has no certain mystery but he guards them all up that have been lost to the ages he takes the book of seals and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel notice Revelation 10 1-7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by by the messenger of Lan Church there is no man to come after the prophet and reveal new Mysteries this is what I'm reading here now all the Mysteries not some all all the Mysteries will be revealed to the bride by the messenger of loud and glory to God hallelujah someone said well brother Bram them will reveal in the last days some great mystery how to get closer to God I said no sir it is to reveal what has already been written because you cannot take one word or add one oh praise God at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive a messenger that will take the Loose Ends and the reveal and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rtion of the church so all the Mysteries was to be revealed purpose the purpose was the rting of the church and there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that are not even written at all and I believe that through those seven tunders will be revealed in the last days had the purpose now in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got now we won't be able to do it something got to step further we we hardly have faith for Divine Healing we hardly have enough faith for Divine Healing we have got have enough Faith to be changed and we will find afterward find where it is written so first he say it's not written after a while going to find where it's written here is the Plan of Redemption here is the only way you'll ever be [Music] redeemed for is the title Redemption of the whole Heaven and Earth so he was he was saying that and just before that he was he was dramatizing about who is worthy to take book so in this book have the Plan of Redemption so don't say it like seals sages all these books no no don't see it that way see this as the book of redemption the book that have your name and today the book that have your Redemptive rights Oh Glory to God Amen so then the angel called for kings of Redeemer to step forward and we know but talk about nobody else was worthy but the lamb was worthy now hear this bum but you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his monitorial seat until he had thally redeemed just go with me now go with me now he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the L's Book of Life he had to stay on there to make intercession until that last person was before you were born God is waiting on you give the Lord do you get that hallelujah amen your life is not a mistake God knew you were coming God knew you were deled God knew you would receive this message put your name on the book Oh Glory to amen so listen look at jacobob jacobob when they was in the womb God said Jacob I love I

didn't have his tablet he was all alone and then he held on to the angel I got hallelujah thank you Jesus he wasn't into that he want a change he want a new walk he want a new talk he said I will not let you go till you bless me when you talk like that the angel tried to get away to see if you serious if you go hold on I will not let you go all night long all night long Jacob wrestling Angel say I

I have become man and I did this in order to get that church back again the one that I fora before the foundation of the world now he has the title the Redemption he has it in his hand now the title the Redemption of all creation is in his hand and he come to claim it back for the human race not claim it back to Angels but to claim it back to the human race I hear this key here which was given to make Sons and Daughters of again so this book is what has the key to make Sons and Daughters of God glory to God Amen So Adam was supposed to speak for his son the spoken word so his son supposed to be a reflection of the father in God's image and likeness so because man fell it fell into sex but when Jesus came he said you must be born again of the word and of the spirit and that brings us back to Adam again word and spirit again we are going back to Eden much fancy cars they have here fancy house fancy bridge and fancy whatever we are going back to hallelujah amen this America is not your home this is temporary oh Hallelujah we going back back to Eden oh praise the name of the Lord praise God now what something he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights for who but these are not my

can I be without him glory to God hallelujah amen praise God so God watch the needs note when Abraham uh got the lamb instead of offering Isaac he said Jehovah Gyra he put a name on this Jehovah God because this name was ministering to a need so you have a need there is a revelation to come to minister to that need so God have seven compound Redemptive names Jehovah I am bner Jehovah Shalom shom I am th peace Jehovah you I am thy righteousness Jehovah I am your provider Jehovah Raa I am your healing Jehovah I am the shepherd Jehovah sh I am present Oh Glory to Hallelujah so when you need him to be present he reveals himself as Jehovah sh when you need him to be a Healer he reveals himself Oh Glory to God what do you have need of and all these seven compound names wrapped up in Jesus Christ and in John 14:1 Jesus said whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son and in the Amplified it says this whatever you ask in my name as presenting all that I am Oh Glory to God so that my father may be glorified whatever you ask in my name presenting all that I am glory to God and this brother Bram presented five things Resurrection he said little fishy I give you back your life and a dead fish was resurrected that Jehovah in Resurrection isn't that right he presented creation I want a squirrel on that tree there and a squirrel was created so he presented God as a Creator then he said salvation I give you your two boys he was presenting Hallelujah then he talk about his wife healing by the spoken word he said before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down isn't that right and the last one was power over the element when he said sun come out and Shine for days God that was with Joshua when Joshua says son stand still move hang over aelon Oh Glory to God so brother Bram presented these five things creation spoken word healing resurrection power the element praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus all right we going good must what are those seven spirits question them seven Messengers St colba Arenas there were seven spirits which are seven men seven angels which are seven messages could you imagine that seven spirits seven men seven men seven angels and seven angels is seven messages for the Seven Seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns praise God the seven and last one of these seals watch this since 1961 the 18th of June in Revelation 2 5 2 was talk about the seventh seal he said the seventh and last one of seal when it is open now we read the scripture when he opened the seven seal there was silence half an all so the prophet saying when when the last one of the seat was open it is found in Revelation the 10th chapter soam con Revelation 81 open the seventh seal with Revelation 10 and on the deer ver 10 you get those seven Thunders oh praise the name of the Lord then he said now seven manifestation what's those seven lamps seven manifestation of seven spirits oh praise the name of the Lord then he said the jewel Christ God bruised him and mashed him he was wounded for our transgression and he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flash upon me there is your seven rainbow colors the seven spirits of God are seven fruits of the spirit that would reflect back in his people now remember the Book of Revelation is a book of amen amen so the seven spirits are seven fruits of the spirit what is he talking about second Peter 1 427 your faith virtue and knowledge these are the and so on these are the seven fruits that's supposed to be in us then he said there are seven qualifications to make the statue of God there are seven Church ages that God brought the church to disqualification and he had seven Messengers to do with all right I'm going to skip down [Applause] now all right here we go Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has not claimed his possession yet you might different with that but hold on AIT it he hasn't claimed it he he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had everything that he lost Christ redeems back he already redeemed us but he hasn't took his possession yet he cannot until the time appointed and then will come a resurrection and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he will take possession he's got when he redeemed us he will do it at his appointed time so we are redeemed now but not yet claimed so it come like you buy a Furniture in the store and you have the evidence of purchase which is the receipt but you haven't picked it up as so Christ coming to pick you up but at Calvary he paid the price so he has evidence of purchase which is the book which is his he has the evidence that you belong to him when Satan accuses of you he did this she did this accuser stop accusing one another you are not the devil the devil is the accuser of the Brethren when he accuses about you Jesus said I died for them I pay the price for what are you talking about that doesn't count I Dro your charges I Dro their charges Jesus dropped the charges Jesus dropped their charges Jesus dismissed your case he dismissed your case [Applause] dismiss you see how Donald Trump Donald Trump want his case to be dismissed Donald Trump he want his case dismissed Donald TR but Jesus dismiss your case not guilty Sav by Grace Oh Glory to God hallelujah am I'm going to [Applause] finish okay all right listen to this now before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created God told become creation when it is spoke by a word this is deep now first he presented to you as a thought his thought and it's revealed to you but it's still a thought until you speak it so you have to come from thinking to speaking you have speak it I claim my husband I claim the Holy Ghost I claim my healing don't just think it speak it glory to God amen hallelujah amen what said this now the reason Moses went out to pray the pillar fire around him God said go and hold your stick towards the east and call for flies no flies as yet God thought has been spoken God tell Moses call for flies thinking about it Fly will come until the word come so when God tell Moses call for flies then Moses said the thought God said the god thought was spoken speak it it's the word it's got to happen so that your revelation of your Redemptive rights give you the authority to speak and to make claims so Mary when she heard the angel she knew it wasn't about any other sister it was no but no other woman it was no other virgin that scripture was talking about me glory to God amen hallelujah amen final quote from this is against organ religion just to the end you can put up that qu last quote the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because the holy spirit will only V the word so the voice said go to the angel say give me that book take it and eat it and just think about it no didn't say that must prophesy again that means it must come out your mouth and the spirit of Prophecy is the testimony of Jesus we have had the testimony of Jesus for all these years because we are

atmosphere oh what a presence friends you could see every service we are getting closer and closer breaking from this humanistic realm into divine revelation into Vision into the presence of the Lord wanting to make himself known to you as an individual in your home in your life in your situation and what an authority today in the service you appreciate the service and the authority in ministering the word and it was something else I I touched with the Clarence I said it something to see the change of the faces of the people and to see the word itself beginning to break chains change your perspective change your outlook and and that's what you want to see not a work up but the word itself coming to you as an individual and you beginning to see yourself in the word because that's what the prophet taught us that's that's who you are your name written in the word is the mystery of who you are it's not the literal name not Clarence Clark but the mystery of who you are a virgin shall conceive and then Mary one day say that's me be it unto me according to that word because that's me in the word there and once you see your name in the word then the devil is finished doubt is finished depression is finished you'll still have your ups and your downs but you know your name is written in the book and once your name is written in the book nothing can stop you from coming into manifestation can the church say amen and that's our confidence that's our Assurance that's our position when the doctor's report say one thing you look in the word and see I'm the god that heals you written in the word and you place yourself there and say that's me and count this contrary to whatever the doctor says can the church say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah wonderful so as we prepare to close out this service we have a few things taking place here firstly we have a note of Praise good morning Saints I'd like to give a high note of praise for my sister-in-law sister nairon who was prayed for last Sunday for abdominal pain she's feeling much better thank God thank you for your pray this is from sister Vivian we thank God for his healing and his grace also I see here a note for sister Judith Samuel God bless you Happy Birthday sister Judith may God bless you I not of praise also from Brother Andrew and sister Candice thanking God for 12 years of marriage may the Lord bless brother Andrew and sister Candice as well and as we approach the Lord for prayer if there's a request this morning that you want takeen to the Lord you want to show by raise of hands as we take it to the Lord this morning there are many hands many needs many requests for those who are here for those who are online and for the request in your heart for your family for your loved ones in this season we need him more than we have ever needed him before shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we are so grateful to be in your presence this morning to be in your house of worship your house of encouragement your house Lord where we could look into the mirror of the word and we could begin to self-correct as you told us to make our calling and election sure and Lord to to search in our hearts to see how we lining up with the word what a refreshing encouragement Lord to see that we have access Divine access to Redemptive rights that Lord you put in place for us nothing we could have ever earned nothing we could have ever have worked for but Lord through your Sovereign Grace and Mercy Lord you forne new us you you said Lord all those you forew you called you call you're Justified those who Justified you heart already glorified all written in the past tense Lord because in your mind is already finished father we are walking through what's already finished we are living through what's already spoken we are manifesting what has already been prophesied father God we thank you for words of eternal life this morning Father and to see the flow of the holy spirit in the service that was preached just last Sunday in Miami to see the anointing come off of the tape and to see the atmosphere Lord that you created after the message went forth father we pray there God that you would touch and anoint our pastor in a mighty way you would strengthen him from the crown of his head to the Salt of his feet may you anoint him a new may you inspire him a new may you refill him with the Holy Ghost may you Crown his ministry father may you adopt him into your kingdom may you place him into position father you said perfect faith is based on our position father may we find our ranks may we find our places may all be in order for that Holy Spirit can move freely in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and father God we pray for every hand that was raised in the sanctuary raised on the internet and that may be raised as Lord this tape is played back father you know every need every cry every plea every cry and Lord every situation that needs a resolution father Lord you are Jehovah gy we heard about it on the T you are Jehovah shama you are Jehovah n you are our Banner our sealer our provider our Rock our peace our reward our comfort father we can hide ourselves into oh Hallelujah in the CFT of the rock this morning knowing as the psalmist David said my help comes from you oh God we are dependent on you we are leaning on you we are trusting on you we cannot do it on our own the very best of our efforts will always fail but father in you do we put our trust is morning so father we commit Our Lives into your hands we commit our families into your hands we commit our homes into your hands we commit our jobs into your hands our businesses the natural the spiritual Lord you said through your word you have given us all things pertaining to life and godliness and father We Lay it at your feet Lord in this week Lord where the world has a superficial understanding of what Easter means but father by direct and divine revelation we could see behind the scenes Lord Lord from Palm Sunday into the death and the burial and the resurrection of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Lord it was beyond just salvation but it was divine access to the Redemptive rights and taking us all the way back to Eden father this is the best time we could ever live in Lord when the completion Lord of everything that was prophesied Through the Ages this being made manifest as the Pastor said in the last days of the last days so father may you bless your people may you anoint your church may you anoint your people may you be with each one Lord may you bless Lord the upcoming Lord meetings this weekend May the Holy Ghost pour out May lives be changed and transformed May the south of the king be in the camp may you break shackles may you heal the sick may you perform Miracles may you pour out the baptism of the Holy Ghost may you seal Sons and Daughters into the kingdom of God that's my expectation that is my desire that is our expectation that is our desire so father may you grant traveling mercies Lord to brother stephanus as he prepares to travel here to Trinidad father Lord and may you bless our pastor as he prepares to travel out as well father to I Coast father Lord we see you moving things around shifting things around Lord the same the Holy Ghost the prophet said the angels on the earth now setting things in order for the coming of the Lord may you bless us as we wait on you Grand traveling mercies we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements so I'm going to do this in two parts brother Ian Paul I'm going to make some announcements and then I'm going to hand over for a internal meeting uh with Brother Thompson going to share a few words with the church yes is it okay so uh that's fine all right so just for a few [Music] announcements so this coming Wednesday there will be no physical service here at at the Tabernacle we will have a live stream service only this coming Wednesday so once again this coming Wednesday there will be no physical service here at the Tabernacle there'll be a live streaming service only this coming Wednesday as we prepare for our Easter weekend services and we really want to encourage you to make a real effort to not only be here but encourage somebody to come out reach out to our backslider reach out to somebody haven't seen and say we're going to church this weekend so we have services this coming Friday at 5:00 p.m. Saturday at 5:00 p.m. and Easter Sunday at 8:00 a.m. so Friday Saturday Sunday Friday at 5:00 p.m. Saturday at 5:00 p.m. and then Sunday at 8:00 a.m. three services uh so be under great expectation be in prayer our brother stephanus calling Bren from Germany will be here for the meeting with us uh he'll be speaking two of the services and I'll be the support to take the third service so remember me in prayer as well I also want to encourage the church to also remember our pastor in prayer as he leaves uh this week to go to Ivory Coast Convention as brother Paul unan jaka's convention over in a CO so uh pray for him as he prepares to minister there this Easter weekend and that the Lord will give him strength I know he's tired but we're looking for God to touch him and as he renews the Eagle that he would renew the strength of the eagle of this church can the church say amen amen so and we need all hands on deck all soldiers Ready for War because I believe time is short and I believe God has something special in store for us this weekend I it'll be a great honor to have brother stephanus here to minister to us I've seen how the Lord has used him and has worked with him and I had a privilege like I would have said before to minister in the Germany convention last last year and just a few weeks ago to the youth convention that he hosted and to see how the Lord has continued to use him with a burden he has a true burden and I see the Lord really upon his life and I know that the services that we're going to have this weekend will be a tremendous time not just of the word and the moving of the spirit but a time for deliverance I want to encourage you encouraging young people to make an extra effort to be here shake up the backsliders those who have not seen in a while call them say we having a special time this weekend on Friday and Saturday and on this Easter Sunday and of course I would have raised uh the brunch last week we have the brunch uh scheduled for Easter Sunday quite an extensive menu um adults 75 years old children under 1045 uh so if you have not already registered please get on the registration list uh for the branch maintainance team group five please meet with brother Blackman after the service and of course we welcome any support and assistance over this Easter weekend with respect to Preparing and and you know taking care of the place uh after each Service as well and on next Sunday brother the malons group would be responsible for the final uh cleaning up after the convention um next Sunday so may the Lord richly bless you there will be a brief meeting after service a small change there'll be a brief meeting after service of those who are part of the post convention planning team you know who you are and in preparation for um the upcoming convention I want to remind the church that we are in preparation for our UPC coment our upcoming convention in July and we really solicit your support we do have quite a bit of various expenses that we need to be able to take care of so it is not a matter of we would we would like your support we really need your support so we want to encourage you we have this month of of March April May June and even into July whatever you can do to support and you can commit to that level of support um via the team downstairs who would be taking um that information so we could have clear visibility on what we are able to do as we pull together for the glory of the Lord and for this convention one more time we don't know how many more conventions we'll have we see what's happening in the world and I if you saw the news just a couple days ago in Russia somebody just got in there and shot over a hundred people killed and and you imagine as you going on in the natural Street and something like that happening you see that the that the lid of hell is uncovered and streams of demon powers just just moving around the earth so and the Bible said that if God don't cut the work short not even the elect would make it so God has to intervene in the situation and we see the lead of hell is uncovered at the same time Sons and Daughters of God are coming into true realization and a revelation that time is short and we need to get ready to leave here so I want to encourage you to balance your life between the natural and the spiritual I know there are a lot of natural things your school your career your job and these things are really things that take up your time and effort but make sure in this you don't lose your identity your spiritual identity in God as a son and a daughter of God because this heaven and this earth and the paper and the certification will pass away the bank account will pass away the house will pass away the car will pass away but this word of God will not pass away and our promise is not to live in heaven we shall reain on the earth so we need to come into a full realization so I want to encourage you young people don't take it for granted don't take it lightly come under expectation you're going to get what you expect so once more no physical service on Wednesday this weekend special weekend all are welcome invite someone Friday at 5:00 p.m. Saturday at 5:00 p.m. Sunday at 8: a.m. brunch afterwards please get your registration in for the brunch and uh like like I said maintenance group five meet with brother Blackman after the service and next Sunday we'll be uh group four which is brother maron's group remember brother stephanus in prayer as he's coming in it's a big sacrifice for him to be here as well and also remember our pastor in prayer who is also preparing to fly out to Ivory Coast for the convention over there so it's a lot to keep track of but in all of these things we go to the Lord in prayer so that he will have control knowing that God is in control and everything is in order and God moving things around as a prophet said the Angel of the Lord has that responsibility to move things around for the coming of the Lord and we really want to be under great expectation come on time come pray up come looking for God to do something wonderful and last and certainly not least those who are part of the postmortem SL planning team for the convention um we do have a brief meeting after the service so may the Lord richly bless you amen so as your just come and justmiss you out bless the Lord oh my soul oh my soul and worship
