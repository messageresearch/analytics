morning but I everyone after the gift of Jesus Christ in his heart and so we are different but one thing brother open I appreciate this this morning it was like a fresh wind came in when you said I'm not in South Africa I'm in heavenly places that was said was from your heart and I like this this is where we are where we should be we should be in a place where there's no sin no sickness no trouble no filthiness and God sees this world like this and he should see it the same way it's this few is called say kingdom of God and then Aparna gave me our inner brother branham said I'm since 33 years I'm in heavenly places and I never came out listen that I never came out I checked myself and I have to do some repentance because this is something is that I never come out and have the confidence I've said I will never come out in my life so he lived in that in that realm and Peter and all of them first disciples say live in that realm no demon could come into this realm where they lived there was a presence of God with them all the time so praise the Lord and I also enjoy it my son was showing me a video clip where I've said all the pastors came in front and and identified themselves missus let me read the scripture my title is Lord prepare me and the scripture is found in chain st. John 17 24 and revelation 20 22 20 cents on 17 verse 24 and she and here Jesus says he is praying and remember you shouldn't even pray when you don't believe what you pray and just pray Lord prepare me you shouldn't do this it's a prayer we pray we sing it and we believe in the Paris and so Jesus he believes what he is praying listen what he is praying father I will that they all also whom thou has given me be wispy and where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world and just before he said it is not only for them for this my disciples but also for Sam said well here's a verb through them for them it is also and he prayed also for you and for me and his prayer will be fulfilled hallelujah and and if you get catch the inspiration this is not when the doctor says it's all finished this is for right now for this life to be with him all the time to have him with us all the time so we don't have to be scared and fear anything in Jesus name God bless you you may be seated so praise praise the Lord my remembrance goes back to 1981 in December we were I think it was Pretoria first Pretoria first and I have a special remembrance here brother Coleman preached a message sales speak to the rock and we have a quote also said I will mention after from speak to the rock and but what really touched me what I have in my remembrance was a song says the gale was singing as special and she was singing that was 37 years ago on the platform this song it sounds like this if I really have it in my remembers make me pure make me clean this is a prayer so that you might be seen make me a blessing Lord wherever I would be this is some part that I remember us together now eight weeks later I was in the hospital in intensive care this is diagnosed heart attack for three days laying there this song always the invited day and night been through me all the machines around me resistor whenever you sing a special sing from your experience you may not know what will happen what will be happening to these believers said are listening to the voice of an experienced we have to become more sincere because this hair-pull has to do something with sincerity and with your heart it was sister Hetty right she spoke from the heart it was this brother Luke and this prophecy fishes you know where the fish was come back to life they spoke to one another that we should go to this lady and tell her that we became Christians and brother Brennan many Herod's you see that was spoken from the heart and it it started something so it's so important to speak from the heart the truth and God does something it does something in these meetings this is very important brother Coleman in Port Elizabeth 1981 is present when I'm here is he is he still here you he was here I don't see him but who was there in 81 in Port Elizabeth oh oh we have good remembrance we have good remembrance brother Coleman was standing behind the platform and it was a real quiet auditorium he wasn't useless because it was a complaint there that people made too much noise and so brother Roscoe said to his church people stay in the back and no clapping no amens this time brother Coleman came in the in the pulpit and sent before a real quiet congregation and then he is he talks a quote from Daniel where Daniel was had a division of the man standing on the water and you remember this and he compared it to a revelation 10 to revelation 10 the angel coming down having his phone is first put on the water and one on the on the land and he compared it and he said I'm standing now before real quiet congregation and he said but if you don't want it then stand on me and proclaim time no longer and he said when Shopp got such a revelation he fell on his face but you go out and say it was a nice sermon and send the Holy Ghost in the people in the pack couldn't keep it any longer they couldn't keep it any longer say I'm screaming in front and we had an outpouring of the Holy Ghost for about one hour you were several Dovan and yeah you were saying and brother Peter Chandler was on the platform yeah he was he was here and and down you went brother Peter in the glory of God was poured all over over the place now he spoke our Comment spoke from his heart he said what he felt and he remembered but it is not right said we react like this when the revelation comes like this in the Holy Ghost in the people also made some - something real from their heart nobody had to tell them come come in front coming from - this jump or whatever it worked by itself it works by itself hallelujah and it specially works in your home the needs the same anointing behind the pulpit we need in our living room then our children will be filled with Holy Ghost in the living room hallelujah not only in church we have to become more sincere so this just a little preparation for tonight then prophet Kanta come singer brother chant allah azza for the wonderful message emperor Robledo you are here I enjoyed it very much thank you we know each other and we appreciated so much the clear voice a clear clear voice you understand what he is saying and all the same we're very clear and in a special way so thank you it was so enjoyed so and also thank you brother vesco for for the testimony I still remembers his glorious time in New York I got its home so many so many many things it fells my lot to stand here and the gap said was given to our precious brother hulu actually and can we stand for for two minutes and just pray for the church there and for preserve a couch over that couldn't be here Lord Jesus here I stand and they may see this video whatever father and C's are our special friends Rosa Olo and brother ho Jovi that they could say couldn't make it to be here but father in spirit we are say and we pray a special blessing over some father for for their health for the situations in their life for their families for their churches father all great angel of God Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost may may you come down father and overshadows him and gives him a special day in Jesus name Amen be seated so as I said my tightness Lord prepare me and and I want to mention again the spirit of Priscilla kindness on the pastor's that came to the platform at the end of your message proverb brother of it could that be a sign for a beginning healing of the sickest bodies the body of Jesus Christ healing comes to this body by two things the Prophet set by brotherly kindness and by the word the word is restored and brotherly love is our part and if you don't know where you find it you find it at Calvary all these glorious things to find it Calvary hallelujah there's a prophecy of brother Branham as brother Thompson mentioned in one of his messages brother Branham is crying out he gets into a vision he says I see something say will be one of these days don't feel a little preacher they will be one why Jesus Christ prayed he said say maybe one and his prayer will be fulfilled no devil can't change this hallelujah praise the Lord and there is a prayer of Jesus Christ in st. change 1:17 set will be fulfilled amen so the glory said Jesus had with a father this is John 17:5 22 26 I don't read it do you you know his prayer the prayer of our Lord Jesus in John's st. John 17 so he said so zyk Lord excuse me so the glory is that Jesus had with the father before the world was it's very important now in in st. John 17:17 he says he speaks about as he said father glorify myself with the glories that I had before you before this world came in their existence so you have your idea about what kind of glorious is is we would like to find out because there is an also promise in him in a message from brother Branham the glory of God this is a unspoken message only written out prepared for December 25 1965 he couldn't preach it anymore but in his notes he is here I got a copy from brother Coleman or actually he allowed us to make a photo picture he had it on his table in his living room and he allowed us and but I feel it's so important said we should share this for the ones had never heard it brother Branham had written out his glory came down to mosey on a range in Midian four thousand years ago his glory came down to Shepherds on a range in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago his glory came down on a range in Arizona three and a half years open to us seven seal mystery of his verbs said had he written out on one page in his notes hallelujah so his glory came down sick glory said Jesus said glorify me reset glories that I had before the foundation of the world with you his glory came down and did something now if he didn't did it one time two times three times in a special basis serve time so he can do it also for you and for me to do the same thing because we know and not a lot of quotes and of the message and of the word but to catch the life in the world for our soul that's what we want hallelujah now God's glory is his divine nature it's his nature his glory is his attributes did you ever see this pyramid what's written inside said this is God's glory you will appreciate that and this makes us one as process with different ideas coming from different churches brother Branham said the first 20 years or how it was in the first time after Pentecost everybody was satisfied with Jesus Christ and and the great atmosphere in the hearts of the people and it's ended since something started but became bigger and darker and darker all through the ages something started he said it started little fellowships somebody had a revelations on brother and they grouped around him his Sahab was very innocent said he said they were not satisfied with Jesus Christ she started to fellowship there this is obvious with that you see but the glory of Jesus Christ makes us one one again and this is what I want you know for my life I want this so I mean so we know as you see if he knows the trick of the devil we are careful because it something can start very innocent and then it goes it goes by and by in the more and more in the wrong direction so how by hearing hearing his voice world promises ceases away we become partakers of his divine nature the noses intellectually Luther Martin Luther had an experience and I say this because ii said to show something what in Luther has an experience he gave lessons to monks concerning Psalms and scriptures and letters in the New Testament and so he should speak to them about the Roman letter to Roman's that Paul was writing and so he got so nervous and angry with God and he said we as sinners we are so condemned and living this condition how can we beat such and you want us to be right righteous as you are and he was anger against God and then the grace of God dropped down on him in the same way as the grace of God dropped down on him he the same grace can drop down on you and will drop down on you if you believe severe and if you obey the words very simple send all these things coming to pass so it's a grace drop down on him and he realized said it when he believes his sis God gives him his own righteousness and God's righteousness will work in him this ice became open and and he surrendered himself he started to believe his righteousness and it worked it worked in him he told his friends he said it was like paradise was opening for me it was and it is it is paradise is opening for you if you start to believe the promise if you start to set your receives the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is for you if you started it is given to youth before the foundation of the earth is given and you start a praise him by face it will come down hallelujah whatever you ask it will happen unto you but you have to believe it since is a key hallelujah and Jesus gives the Peter to peel this is a key to Peter sorry Jesus gave him the key to open the kingdom hallelujah and he wrote it down he said by these promises you become partaker of his divine image of his glory hallelujah by these promises hearing and hearing comes Halloween you hear the word and you say Oh God so easy so easy unless you surrender to it and it comes upon you this is God's me doing it very simple if you try to understand it you can never understand it it says it is his realm you see it's not possible hallelujah it's not possible like like we have no no access otherwise this is a sea of forgetfulness as a prophet said so nature of man has no and not not access but if Jesus Christ is in you you go in that atmosphere said it's no more there it's forgiven lived in that atmosphere all the time he left all the time in the atmosphere when he came since atmosphere was coming miss him when brother Branham came this atmosphere was coming this him and the people stepped in this atmosphere and then you are coming since atmosphere is going miss you because you will experiment your face and will believe it and stop believing and oh god I never knew this glory see seven thunders these seven virtues this is your glory ceases your nature opener surrender and send this nature gets you hallelujah hallelujah don't have to think how shall I receive it and how shall I add and in all season this will not work this will not just surrender to Javert take me lord take me in let it become on me Lord Jesus so shall it be like Mary said it shall happen unto me it's a promise of God and you see try it try it once then you try it once and you see it works you you've got a lot of exploits and your family will be changed your face will be changed everything will be changed hallelujah around you hallelujah survival will become new all these things just believing the promises and praise it and say yes Lord Luther he experimented it experimented he said and it works to his reference it's the same is God's wisdom you see you just surrender it it starts working in you yeah hallelujah all its glorious and then and then in your living room it goes automatically hallelujah and your MA and your wife will join like sister come enjoy brother Coleman hallelujah we need this we need life we have to become more sincere we have to we have two quarters across you see for birth progress is it I have to just kept some skip something here it says there's a tremendous code you may be seated I hope I find it here in my inside different letters but but maybe I mean coming coming to it so let me see know if there was another one so so you become a partaker of course nature isn't that something for me this is this is gold hallelujah and if we are told if you make investment versus all things are possible in our life all six because this glory comes on us and controls us controls our family controls my mouse controls everything this wonderful you see people especially young people in this measure say say say give often up I say give up and say I cannot live it sure we can also not live it yeah yeah we are sinners saved by grace and make mistakes we cannot live but to have this insight that lifts it that lifts it and if you make a mistake quickly we say Lord Jesus I come again under your blood Here I am please Lord I talked about this problem forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I did sis here I I was angry say I didn't didn't behave in your glory Lord forgive me and then you grow that without repentance no growing without repentance no starting hallelujah this is the key this is the key hallelujah so God's nature because attributes are his glory being a savior salvation is a his glory comes down on your soul he saved me presence all these attributes he is my healer and is healing it's only evil our problem is we don't experiment enough in our personal life we think we go to church and send somehow we will get it somebody prays fast and ok and however we don't take it really sincere it should be so advanced so advanced there are there are promises laying before our before us said we have no idea in such a greatness but we have to start an experiment this is so and second Corinthians really give us a scripture but we always open face beholding as in a glass mirror the glory of the Lord in other words his glory is reflecting in us you go on your little chamber close the door and such a chamber in as Jesus said in Palestine doesn't have the window it is a it is a little chamber there's no window for for food to put food cellar to store foods here so it's a good example you go there no nothing from the outside you know you just be within your glory Lord I experiment this is for me your glory Father in heaven you made all this to do this I do this and it's tremendous it is so tremendous it changes me and I know some of my children that are doing this it changes us this is something real it's not something in the head you have to say we are changed into the same image in His image we are changed just let it let it down the channel here we are change if you say it for yourself I face Lord Jesus I am change this presence come down his glory come down save confirmation comes down that's the ceiling in this lamb like nature I want to speak something about it we have strangled it brother brother Branham spoke about this this glory we have killed when we were raised as children first lie so first stealing the first anger all this killed the lamb like nature it's not a literal damned brother Graham said but in his in his it's in your own heart see if you feel something tuck tingling at your heart that's what it is it's a attribute trying to declare itself if you feel I'm missing something in my life I believe so Lord Jesus I go to church right I need something this is stealing from the attribute and Heavenly Father he says take us now Lord let's a great Shepherd secretary deeming shepherds a great Shepherd who left glory listen knowing said some of the attributes was lost on them great valleys of sin where the wolves and the animals would soon divorce them devours him said little sheep but he left the golden corridors come down into the earth and was made one of us so he coulda clay as the love of God to us say he founds him some of same in them and denominations he found me there also some of them in a house of ill Fame some of same on the streets blind some of them in hedges and highway but he redeemed everyone that have father had ordained him Dorothy [Applause] so Jesus he loved sinners that's what the Pharisees hated on him say this had he had so much fellowship with his sinners that didn't even try to lift up their hand when they were praying said and and and felt condemned and the Pharisees in the back say look you see he doesn't even lift his hand so but he loves his kind of people and he still loves them he still loves us when we are falling he loves us so much and we are very stupid if we don't come to him when a child Falls it goes to mama or Papa if he's his clothes he knows he runs and and if we don't mistake we try to hide instead of quickly immediately like brother Bryan him he was used to do this he said I came in the plane and I was I got angry about child said always cried and got angry I said I thought Cannot some mother stops this child coming from India or somewhere and then he confesses to this church and said said if I go on like this I will lose a favour with God he said say little things if we do these little things in our families it will become heavenly confess it forgive me and say Calvary makes all the difference Sarris where we get the spark to our knowledge to the mechanic at Calvary I believe this I got my spark I did not know how to repent because I was raised as a child in a Christian home and didn't know really I prayed and believed you know many know my story and I had a problem I thought how can I get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I met some people that had this experience and I saw this is real I also met some that was imitating but I met some that was real and I wondered said and hits a problem but I I said I don't want to be a hypocrite and kneel down and say I'm such a bad guy I didn't feel that I am bad guy raised up in a Christian home praying and believing the world and all this but never had a real experience with repentance and then I confessed it in a group of Christian businessmen and in some some of them some of some of these people Oh sis is not a problem I said no problem I will I would rather be a drunkard on the street and have a really experience with the Lord and I had one helpers he said she said no no no it's not a problem if you really want it you pray Heavenly Father give it to me and even give it to you this is sis's it's all Pentecost hallelujah and be pizzas because we wanted said my wife and myself and we met Calvary hallelujah we prayed and God opened up and if you need anything just pray don't they pray and believe and remember this don't just pray without thinking God said he's doing this what you pray we should not all our singing also in we are praying in our singing we shouldn't just not not sing like this and but know when you've been missing thank you Lord you are doing this you are doing this it will be fulfilled in my life it is a continuous fellowship with the Lord our life Alleluia forgive me that's my vein that's how I built predominately you can drive it down brother Conte also when it comes to tonight I believe he will drive it down hallelujah but this may be and it works also hallelujah god bless you richly hallelujah brother Brian continues and he said but he left see : corridors came down into the errors and was made one of us he was made one of us is not something left his glory to be one of us and he said even father glorify me again and a voice came I have done it and will do it and the people heard asunder hallelujah we know this came down into the earth and made one of us so he could declare the love of God to us there he found some summoned emanation I read it already summoned the elf ill-famed how some streets and he redeemed them all is that something his attributes got lost in the valleys of sin but he redeems em and yeah praise the Lord we know so much scripture and how much do we practice it in our personal life there's another scripture says I really came over it jesus said no man put his a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise sent bows in you make us a rent it rains and and the peace said was taken out of the new areas not with old so it is a problem in our life if you just take one piece one revelation and lean on that and then don't come to the fullness in our time this fullness is glory is promised us in this glory will bring the adoption perfection the fulfillment of everything in the rapture I believe in this glory it is Jesus Christ his glory and there's where the power lays I believe sure lays in the world sure all his glory lays in the world but there's two things you see you can say all we have taken from his fullness everything we have in us free everything is true but did we receive it did we take it in this is a question brother branham said Jesus is coming I hope I have it baby thank you but here I want to read the real music the code he says confess you wrong bear Spain's God helps us if we come before him and confess it it's so pond it's so important he says confess you're wrong there's pains it's hard to die but I right now tie come out of your own unbelief and the devil wants to keep us with little things that we don't confess in in our unbelief and we confess it said we have an experience agains as this glory comes down in our soul and we are growing by that we become men and women in in in this in this in this message in this life come out of this conditions this is the Word of God made manifest just as it was when Jesus came on earth it is Jesus Christ again among you proven it is good to come to church on to praise Him and worship but also it's good to go in in a corner sometimes and say Lord Jesus you are living in me make fellowship with sincereness it is a serious thing it's not just polished up just trained it's a serious thing in the heart Sir Paul has to do with our hearts we will speak from the heart and things will happen either just three standings here and the love of God will drop down and take all the evil and roses we cannot afford to not love and I mean really love one another if we have this glory in our hearts so it makes us always won unless they shed blood it makes us always won and if you hear this pray about it pray about it it could change it could it could come to a revival it can bring a revival and here there is one thing before I close I want to read this brother Branham said in the message birth pains 65 he said and Jesus is coming again this is our subject will he find face there's a son of man find face is our subject of this convention now I read this here and she says is coming again brother Branham said that's his spirit thank you lord now you can do an experience with Jesus coming this my way some may know the grieves I may have a better idea I don't know but I take it for myself say this is Paris he is so close to the earth so close to coming said he is ready to receive you if you are ready to receive him if Martin Luther would live in our day I believe he would experiment with his experience concerning a rat the righteousness of God and and all his great characteristics of God he had experience here he hadn't we said the time wasn't so it wasn't a season it must always be also in the right season for him so but if he would be in our season I believe he would experiment with his experience concerning the righteousness of God said open paradise for him he would experiment with this quote he is so close to the earth so close to coming said he is ready to receive you if you are ready if you are ready to receive him at least you should say now hard Lord Jesus comes home comes home sees the spirit and the bride say speaks the same thing say up turning in the hearts together in the spirit and the bride say the same things come Lord Jesus comes home and it is it is a way a personal way to receive him president sisters God has given as a key in this little afternoon meeting if he uses it will change our life she is just believed said take it in your heart receive it yes so it shall happen to me and then wait and adore him and praise and the glory of God will come down and seal it in your heart and there's a new life god bless you for a Mightiest service tonight this was just a little preparation all these things you find at Calvary anyhow let me here I have it that's good yeah we know this is a message speak to the rock brother : preached in Pretoria here brother Branham says the gospel came to us not in word only but through power we all agree demonstration of the holy spirit we heard it this morning would come and demonstrate the gospel bringing the world to a living reality that's that's our theme brother with bringing the word to a living reality and then he continues this is what we want living reality and he continues if your chest receives the word so it's a different ways of receiving me if he said if you receive him he is ready to receive you it's a different way of receiving we must we must catch this now he said if you just resist severe pain knowing the word set doesn't you any good this is what we learn in Sunday school and go through the process and send we go on church and grow up like this and this this is not doing any good to you say let Achilles Suspiria give his life said you must be born again and then the Holy Spirit quicken swear to you yeah I know I must be born again but how can it happen to me you must be worrying saying Holy Spirit quickens severe to you in other words like a grain of corn if it's laying in my hand it is just a grain of corn it will never be no see else and here it comes but very it says why we died with him it's across buried with him and resurrect lose him but it is a process and it kills you and it it has it has pains in it tremendous pains but bury it it comes listen it comes contaminated weather-related did you know this code yeah he said Perry is is corn this seed Perry it it comes contaminated you know we don't want to see it being contaminated Jesus Christ the seed of God got contaminated it's a cross this bit on him say that everything with him with his body with his soul is everything he could contaminate it and same thing with us we cannot go around this but bury it it becomes contaminated molds tell all around and sin it brings up another grain of corn just like it you see be speaking about seed and the real seed and we once said because in the real seed there is it has a power the power working so enormous see it's the word see it has it in it but it's not working in us if we just know it it's it doesn't help so we must dive is our lamb and it's painful you have to tell him since I'm so wrong you have to fear personal experience all that all the time I'm so wrong father but you forgiving you are so great you're so close your glory is so great and you get a baptism you you get another baptism another baptism in another ceiling is another feeling and we have to go through this process Perry it becomes the minute with our stinking ago our stinking own self life what we are what we what we are self-righteous horses you know you know we know how we are so if we come out of our sis system God will help us this is our place where we all die with our lamb and there you get this power experience said he is the same for me so he was yesterday's same glory and you get an assurance said what what comes out of your mouth is from him you get an assurance what's come out of your face to your family is from him we need this let us be more sincere and let us prepare our hearts in this way god bless you [Applause] you may appreciate the words is that your desire to be a sanctuary for the glory of God to be living in you not just in church but at home when nobody's looking just to talk to the Lord just to have that eternal fellowship like the Prophet had for thirty-three years never left it I believe that's our desire and if as your desire let's just sing a song I'm vine Oh Lord I've heard thy voice [Music] and told hi love of to me but I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer your faith unlocks his glory in your life hold Rami
