brother Anthony for the worship and the singing amen we here to worship him we're here to praise him we're here to hear from him tonight amen at this time let's get straight to the word let's if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn with me to the Book of Mark reading from chapter nine a couple verses in there I hope you come under expectation tonight believe something good is about to happen and something great is in stored for us so reading from chapter 9 in The Book of Mark from vers 17 and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teerth him and he foth and Nash it with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should C him out and they could not so here we had a scenario in which he had a need he had a desire for his son to be healed and he asked the disciples and in his experience they were unable to do it in verse 19 it says he answer him and said oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straight away the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child so since childhood he's been suffering with this going through this this heartache for his child and in verse 22 it says and oftimes it had cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but thou C do anything have compassion on us and help us in verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straight away the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief when Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him so and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately in secret why could not we cast him out and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting may we just bow our heads as we open a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father Lord tonight we are so grateful we so thankful Lord Lord we love you so much for giving us this opportunity to gather together around your word Lord Lord we didn't come in vain we didn't come just to see and hear Lord but we came to cause something to happen Lord Lord we came under expectation with faith knowing that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord Lord we've come Lord knowing that our needs will be met Lord We've Come Together in this house to worship and to praise you and to exalt Your Name Lord Lord I pray that you will take me out of the way speak directly to your people tonight Lord Lord I pray that their faith be quickened Lord I pray that you will meet them wherever they are right now Lord those connected on the internet Lord those at home at work wherever they might be at this time lord may your presence and your Holy Spirit go out and meet them Lord Lord fill all the house Upstairs Downstairs wherever they are Lord Heal the sick and Afflicted Lord Lord restore Lord the the the tide and the down Trad Lord Lord I pray that you will reach out and and grab a hold of the backsliders lord lord that you will come down in a special way and have your perfect will tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you may have your seats amen you love him tonight for a title tonight is Against All Odds and inspiration levels of faith in this scripture we read it it is what I call a loaded scripture it highlighted a couple things in the verses we read here it highlighted in the first instance different types of Fai on display so when the father came with the son and said listen this is my son this is the case I brought him to the disciples and they were unable to what he was basically saying is that he found the fate of disciples were a bit weak because these are your disciples these are your followers these are the people that walk and talk with you and have a testimony these are the people that I believe could do something for me could do something for my son Jesus answered and said oh faithless generation so he addressed those that had zero faith faithless it didn't exist you could get nothing done without faith amen later on he went on and the father admitted that his faith wasn't where he thought it should be because when Jesus said if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth he said Lord listen I understand my position I believe but I want you to help me in my unbelief cuz there's a little doubt in my heart that are trying to get out so he was able to identify where he was later on when the spirit left that would have been perfect faith and display that could cast the demons out that could cast The Devil out and the disciples themselves KN they lacked something they asked him why we couldn't do it we walk with you we talk with you we line with you we hang out but we still couldn't do it he said listen this kind can come from CAU by nothing but by prayer and fasting so it will tell us that listen at the end of the day there are different levels of Faith there are different types of Faith there are faith that could pull certain buttons and sometimes you require a greater level of Faith to activate particular things amen so we want to just explore that for a few minutes I don't want to take you too long but I have some quotes that I want to run through and I feel God wants us to grab a whole of these quotes these are not not my quates God wants us to grab a whole of these quates by faith and watch them come to life if you allow him to work just water it with your praise and your worship and allow him to take over amen so for a title I said Against All Odds and there's a meaning to that Against All Odds it says when you do or achieve it although there were a lot of problems and you were not likely to succeed so that's the definition of Against All Odds it means you're not likely to succeed if they look at it they measure it they evaluate it science could check you're not likely to overcome you're not likely to be victorious but Against All Odds you do it anyway by God's grace you did it Anyway by the faith and belief you have in God he able to bring you through anyway amen so I want to run quickly here to a a quote and it's from perseverance 62 all right and from paragraph 72 it says Lord I'm wanting only crumbs and we know the story remember she'd never seen a miracle she was a Greek but she'd heard that there was a miracle that Jesus performed Miracles she only heard it or no she didn't see it and she know if he could perform miracles for one person God was the creator of all things and all people and he could do it for her she'd never seen a miracle but yet she was believing for one having not seen that is Faith she didn't even see a miracle herself but she believed enough to know that it could happen for her Hallelujah and we see them day after day night after night she'd never seen it she was like Rahab the hallot when the spies came over in Joshua time she never said now wait this was Rahab she never said wait a minute let me go see Joshua let me see how he wears his clothes let me see how coms is here perhaps I'll I'll catch a revelation no no no let me see him do some Miracles she never asked for that no that's the reason she was justified because she accepted it by faith she said I have heard amen I want that God to be my God she heard and when she heard it was God's moving she know it was God because she'd seen a sign of a God that could conquer all the kings so she too like this this woman she didn't experience it herself you know she didn't grow up in church and see the Miracles around her but she heard that listen the god of Joshua is a powerful man he's a terrible man he's a man that could bring you the victory and she had faith in what she heard amen she said listen she was ready to receive it oh my watch what that did to Jesus he said for this saying for this saying see she had the right approach to God's gift you got to approach it right when you're sitting out there when you're in church when you're at the altar wherever you are you've got to have the right approach to God you got to approach him in the right manner Faith always admits the truth Martha let's speak of her for a few minutes Mara we always think you know Mara is so dilatory about getting a house cleaned when she was going to entertain Jesus talking about Mary and Martha they had different personalities had different types of relationships with Jesus amen let's let's speak about her a little bit Mary a little lazy side just sat around and listened Jesus of course said she listened to the better things but Martha showed her colors what she was what was in her heart she know that Jesus was the son of God she had a revelation of Jesus so even though she listening like everybody else she had a special revelation of who he was no doubt she'd read many Bible stories she read about the shunamite woman and how the woman was past the age of bearing she had made a little chamber for the prophet amen because she said to her husband I perceive that's a holy man that passes by our way she perceive that spiritual woman she said let us I pray thee make a little chamber on the side even if we not home he could access it she want to do do that for the prophet he could just go in he can have a key to the door and she was showing kindness and Elijah gave her a blessing and told her she'll have a son amen when that son took sick at about 12 years old he must have had a sun stroke he cried my head my head his father had taken him in took him in set him on his mother's lap until noon and he died so once again a scenario brought the challenge or the trial or the test of your faith because there's one thing to talk it but faith is not a talk thing you know faith is an action thing Faith requires that you believe and you do something you don't just rock back and relax right so you say look at the fate of that woman she took him and laid him on the prophet's bed what a place to put him see she laid him on that bed and she said saddle a mule now and don't you stop until I tell you stop and so she took off to the mountain where she where to the cave where Elijah was God didn't tell His prophets everything just what he wants them to know and we know that amen Elijah looked up and said to jasi said Here Comes the shunamite and she's full of Sorrow I don't know what it is God kept it from me he said is all well with thee is all well with thy husband is all well with that child look at that shunamite woman all is well that is Fai all is well it doesn't matter this is against the odds it doesn't matter what the doctors say it does doesn't matter what the circumstance is all is well because you have faith and confidence in the word of God and the prophets of God and his word amen she was in the presence of a man the agent of God the man who could perform a miracle that take the woman at her age P bearing and a old man like a husband and bless them in the name of the Lord God and see a vision and tell her she'd Embrace her child and and she did it she knew then that was a man of God so she had Faith cuz she knew it was a man of God she said let me go to him and when she got to him she said all is well amen all is well and then she began to reveal and Elijah he told to jahaz he said take this staff cuz Elijah know that everything he touched was blessed this is the reaction to Faith now her faith told her listen quot to The Prophet do what he said listen have confidence in the word of God Amen so jahazi then with his staff Elijah know that everything he touched was blessed now whether the woman would believe that or not I don't know I think that's where Paul being fundamental got the idea of laying handkerchiefs and aprons he took from his body on the people and then Elijah said take the staff good up thy lungs if anybody speaks to you don't speak back go lay this upon the dead baby this was the instruction now go lay it but the woman's Faith wasn't in the stick it wasn't about the staff you know it wasn't the prophet the stick never told her so the prophet told her so and she was persistent as the Lord lives she said and as your soul never dies I'll never leave you oh I like that bless God if the people will take a hold of the Holy Ghost God's agent in the Earth tonight and hold on to it like that I'm not going to turn it loose might have to wrestle like Jacob all night but you will get your request maybe Martha had read that story and she knowed if God was in that prophet and Jesus was the man of the hour then and surely God was in his son if he was in his Prophet so she go out to meet him and when she met him could have abraded him now because she sent for him to come remember La Lazarus was sick she said go call Jesus and Jesus said listen it's for your sake I'm happy I wasn't there you know because I want to do something I want to show you something I want to test something amen and at this point he had been dead for 4 days and was stinking and she ran out to meet him she heard he was coming she was so persistent she left the funeral procession and ran out to meet Jesus though he done turn her down she went to meet him though she turned though Jesus turned on her request to come early she ran out to meet him because she still had this level of faith when you say listen Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you he say I like that see though he's dead though he stinks yet whatever you ask God God will give it to you that is the level of faith we talking about the even now Faith that's not I heard about it you know that's I know that I know because I know who I speaking to I have confidence in the word of God and the word of God never fails and if the word of God came through his Prophet it has to come to pass it cannot return void amen now that's the way to get something done that's the way you con congregation ought to be about your pastor see that's when God will answer that's right you got to approach God's gift in the right way with reverence and Ministry is Minister gifts there gifts in the body five spiritual gifts that predestinated and for ordained of God to the church I know there's nine local gifts in the body but these are God's office gifts the office Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists amen and we must respect them if we expect something from God she ran right up to him and she said Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you I like that although the doctor said this so Against All Odds Against advice against opinions against ideas it didn't matter although the doctor said this the doctor say I got cancer but even now Lord the doctor say I can't get well but even now Lord that's it even now whatever you ask God he's sitting on the right hand of the Majesty a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities ever living to make intercessions oh my own bloody clothes laying before the altar of God high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities your faith can touch him tonight he can be touched he can take an office in the church and speak right back through them lips and tell you exactly he do the same work he did when he was here on Earth he promised to do it he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's doing it amen Why Can't We Be persistent persistent willing to try time and time again when we think it fail certainly with such as that for more far more than she had noticed now Martha she said even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you look at that though he turned her down said only thing I want you to do is just ask prayer whatever you ask God God will give you so clearly the level of Faith you have is directly correlated to the response God will give because she was able to look at the scenario look at the the situation that was Bleak he was dead for 4 days and she could still say even now even now I never saw this happen before but you could do it for me I never saw it happen in Trinidad but you could do it for me I never saw it in my family but you could do it for me you could start with me even now I know my neighbor say I Ain going to make it but even now my boss may have ritten me off or my family but even now the faith I have can access the will of God Access the power of God Access the word of God and we could see a manifestation of that amen now I want to give a testimony a testimony I will break it down to make it a a little more palatable but I I want to testify here there's a message but a Brandon preach call a trial Amen in which as you might know in any trial in in a court of law you're allowed to bring witnesses witnesses on both sides the prosecution and the defense that's the only way you will get an outcome in the court so each side have to present their arguments so just ride with me a little bit and we want to go through a little bit of this I'll probably skip through a little bit but I think it's important that we understand the argument and what we are faced with so in paragraph 72 brother Braham said the defense witnessing now is going to call his first witness now you see the prosecution like I identified before called his witness Mr unbelief Mr skeptic Mr impatient those were the witnesses for the prosecution now the defense witness has a right to call a witness as well it's only fair it's only reasonable that both sides present their valid arguments their valid Witnesses amen so the Holy Spirit has a right to call it cuz he is the defense witness for God's word not you and me the Holy Ghost is the defense witness for God's word now these men claim they believe but the Holy Spirit know nothing about it and he's the only one that could Quicken it it's just like your body here see your body is dead without the spirit so is the word of God dead without the Holy Ghost to Quicken it so we could just read words but listen the moment the Holy Spirit drop upon that and Quicken that word all things are possible there's no hindrance there's nothing that could stop it your unbelief can't stop what going to happen you know Hallelujah the spirit quickens the body and the Holy Ghost quickens the word you get you you get you get it now he ought to know now he's going to going to call the first witness let's see who he's going to call Noah he's going to call Noah Noah would stand and say in the days that I live was a scientific age kind of like now yeah a scientific age and he said we smarter than they are in this day and the Lord God told me there was going to come rain down from heaven keep in mind it never rained before so this was Noah given his testimony as witness number one rain was was going to form it had never rained you remember on Earth it used to get wet through irrigation not not rain coming from the sky amen say it's going to rain and going to destroy the world there going to come a great flood all over the Earth that'll cover and destroy it he said yet I got orders from God to build an ark I went to work on the ark showing my faith cuz without faith you're not building anything you know imagine rain never existed yet God tell you to build an ark to escape the amount of water that he going to pour down on you it take a great level of Faith that's not normal Faith that's specialist faith I don't have the words to explain the degree or the level but I know that's a special unique level not not everybody is qualified to handle that it never happened before yet I got orders from God to build an ark he said I went to work showing my faith and I believed what God said was the truth regardless of what science had to say about it against all talk against all opinions against all professional discourse on the matter he believed that God's word was the truth and he had faith in that right no matter what anybody else said it was going to rain so if there's never been rain up there he can put rain up there alella act anyhow making ready for it although I had that fellow on a witness stand here a while ago Mr unbeliever he scuffed at me all along he made fun of me and I seen Mr skeptic he come around and he laughed at me Mr impatience all of them they laughed at me for believing in such a miracle but I waited so it it it used patience it wasn't immediate God didn't say it will rain now he say I waited he say for 120 years as we know before it come but it came amen he say sit down witness one that's a good testimony amen that's brilliant good testimony that's a good witness to have but let's continue with the father of Faith Abraham he say witness number two bring him up we just been talking about it also he say I heard the word of God you know so so it's very consistent faith comes by hearing he hear the word of God he said say when I was 75 years old tell me something that was absolutely against all reasoning all there's no doctor there's no scientific explanation for why God should talk to you at 75 and tell you you'll be a father of Nations it doesn't make logical sense but you know what God is not concerned about your logic his thoughts higher than your thoughts amen he said it would have to be a super time super miracle I don't think English have adjectives like this a super time super miracle for that to happen that I was going to have a wife 65 years old to produce a son to me when she was 65 years old we went down and we got everything ready you see the action remember faith is not talk faith is belief and action belief and movement belief and activity is something you could see it's something you reach out and grab something you touch because you believe and you're convinced enough to do something about it he said I told all of my friends that these things were going to happen after this had to take place because God said so he say I waited Patiently I wasn't in a rush he say I waited patiently the first man come along I asked my wife how you feeling no different all right I believe God anyhow Against All Odds his fate was still resting in on the word of God it was resting on that there was Mr unbeliever Mr scuffer Mr skeptic and all of them standing around they scuffed and they laughed at me father of Nations when I had no children and I kept believing every month every month month after month year after year de listen a decade passed and he was holding on still two decades pass and he's still holding on but he holding on stronger now because he know he much closer than when he started he said 25 years later God kept his word true it happened Abraham that's a good witness the word never said when he said he would he said I'll give you a child a son by Sarah not next month he never said next month he said he would not when they pray they shall lay hands on the sick and God shall raise them up T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you're endured with power on high not for one day not for two hours amen not 10 days 10 years but until the power comes so you still have to respond to the faith you have in the word of God in the instruction you still need to act according to that amen a real defense witness these fellows are that's two for two there's no rebuttal you can't respond to that this this is so real this is so true there's no response to it he say and all the time the odds was building up against me I like that the odds was against him he was older now 25 years older he say it was against me he said but I stayed steady because I didn't stagger at unbelief of the people I held right on and they say good Abraham sit down we can't win this case just with two witnesses you know I mean the witnesses solid you know but oh gosh let's give somebody else a chance we want to give somebody else a chance so he called Moses he said Moses listen I need to paraphrase this cuz I don't want to be too long he said Moses let's have another witness witness tree you come you share your testimony he say let's bring Moses and as you know he say he he met God a voice a pillar of fire back in the W in the wilderness it told me a scriptural voice that the hour was at hand and he heard the cries of his people remembered his promise and he was going down to deliver them and he was sending me for the job that was his mission that was his assignment now keep in mind he in the wilderness he not in the city he don't have an army he don't have bodyguards he not going in on a fighter jet right God told him this is my plan and I want you to execute it the level of Faith you need for that the kind of faith that that that may not be ARC building Fai you know that special Faith to go into Egypt which was his superpower at the time and say you're taking over and let my people go I go on he asked him for a sign and so on and he said listen when he went down he went down in the line of duty just as God told me to do Jehovah the I am told me to go down and do this sign and I took this sign down before Pastor pharaoh and I throw down my rod and you know what he tried to make it look Shady like it was some magic trick he had got some carnal impersonators to go out and mock it do the same thing but I know it was God's word and I had to come to take those children out of there no matter what taking place I still believe the word of God so I held steady with it so we see a consistent theme they all hear from God they all believe they all acted and they waited until the promise be manifested amen he said listen no matter what taking place I held steady Moses you're a real witness don't make any difference try to copy it and try you know they they they they try they try all they can they they say see it's some cheap trick it's it's bbob some mental telepathy or something I've got man here magicians can do the same that that that's that's Pharaoh's condition we could do that too we we could song like that we could preach like we could sing like that but God's word listen is eternal or no there reaches a point where you have to cause to you have a I have a reason to differentiate the wheat from from the Shao so in this case you say listen it didn't stop Moses it was the word of the Lord because it was a scriptural sign following it oh yes Mr unbelief Mr skeptic all of them H hung around my shoulders but I stayed right straight with that word knowing it was God that said the word it's God to take care of it not them he told me I was going to take those children to the promised land he told me I taken them out and I was going to come back to this mountain where it happened I don't know Pharaoh treatened my life and everything finally God overpower the enemy and I brought them through the Red Sea on a dry Ground God kept his promise and I come right straight to the mountain where he told me I would come to the same Mountain see he had believed that it was God and he held steady how much Witnesses we need we had three already let's bring witness for we will bring witness for let's look at Joshua Moses Minister listen he succeeded Moses as we know he said listen I went down there with spies I was sent out 12 of us were sent you know one out of every denomination and he said we went down there and we looked and here they come back scared and said well we look like grasshoppers up aside of them fellows you know they're greater than we are they are Mighty Men and he said at Kadesh ban I still the people said wait a minute you are looking at a giant and the opposition I'm looking at the promise of God God said I'll give you the land so once again when you hear the word of God and you know the promise for you the faith that now be churned inside allows you to act different than everybody else against the odds the level of faith is now magnified because you have confidence in the word of God you have confidence in what God said it doesn't matter how it looks to know it doesn't matter what people say and people think and they told Joshua at one point you know if you wait for the tide to change and adjust you could go over day and it'll be easy it didn't matter he said listen in three days we're going over because God said so and I believe it and I trust his word he looking at the promises of God he said there after day they come around and said where's the land where is the milk and honey Joshua they promise it too where is it at he said God will take care of it and he let them unbelievers died he kept me alive raised up another generation 40 years later we took the land because God said so amen God said I give you that land I'm promising that to to you the unbelievers could step aside because by faith you're still going to possess it amen he said and remember there was only two days journey away you know he held them back just for 40 years because of their unbelief so that that's that's the kind of faith we talking about you mean unbelief could hold you back 40 years 30 years 10 years set your back your unbelief will keep it away from you as long as you live got to believe it he's a real witness Joshua yes sir they took the land 40 years later amen I need to give you one more witness because in the 20th century there was a prophet named William manam Branham he is witness five he said listen I'd like to be his next witness I'd like to put myself up basically on the witness stand cuz when on the witness stand you have to give your testimony you have to give your experience amen he said I'm his witness I want to be next I want to be fifth how can God take a cockle be and make a grain of wheat out of it a sinner come from a sinful family all of them with guns and died with their boots on boot leggers and whatever more you have why I had nothing to do with it my mother that's in glory today said the hour when I was born the angel of the Lord came in the window and stood over the Cradle where I was at am they've got the picture of it in the scientific Halls of the art of religion today it's worldwide known God promised to do these things as a little boy a voice spoke to me we could pause right there we see a consistent theme the voice of God the word of God causing you to have faith in his word we're not believing in man you know not believing in systems believing in church no the faith is tied to the word of God amen say spoke to me said don't never smoke chew or drink defile your body in any way there will be a work for you to do when you get older scared me of course what did I know about religion my people formerly were catholic how did I know anything about these things I never was in a church in my life they both married out of church so the just mother and father both was Irish so they just married out of the church and we had no religion we just live like a bunch of dogs had a little old pull about like campers from post to post wherever we could find a little Shack we could pay the rent on for3 or $4 a month that's the way where we live talk about against the ODS a little old barefooted boy packing water to a whiskey still one day when God in his sovereignty still keeps his word come down in a whirlwind and stood there and said don't do these things he said it when I became from a young man Visions begin to break over my eyes from a little bitty boy it scared me I got saved and I joined the Baptist Church talk about when there's a deep there's got to be a deep to respond you know he say I asked I told my Baptist Brethren about I guess what's going on I didn't know what to call it a vision I call it a trance and I went and said to my brethren about that they said Billy have nothing to do with that that's the devil that's the devil don't you have nothing to do with that one night at a little Camp when I was fishing way back in the mountains I was laying back there about 3:00 in the morning I seen a light coming and it had just I had just been reading the Bible I thought it was somebody coming shining through the knob hole the nut hole a lantern or something it was way way in the wilderness and I thought somebody was coming up the light was on the floor it spread greater and greater I heard somebody walking when it did it was a man he was barefooted he had hair on his shoulders and he had on a robe and I was scared it it it scared me to death he said Don't Fear I am sent from the presence of the Lord God to tell you that your peculiar life don't try to get from these things that is your calling and God will be sending you to different places all over the world to pray for the sick and if you'll get the people to believe and be sincere nothing will stand before the prayer it scared me to death certainly it did I stood there and he kept talking I said sir I am here because of those transes and things like that he said there will be three things happen first you'll know by taking your hand to hold the people then it'll come to pass after that if you sincere that you'll know the very secret in their heart and I said that's what I'm here to talk about was I my my brethren told me that that was of the devil I'm a Christian I don't want to be nothing of the devil he said as it was back there so it is now when they were arguing on what kind of buttons they should wear on their coats and things like that and the minister saying that Paul and them Ste the world upside down what was it but it was a evil spirit that said that these man are Servants of God that turned the world upside down that Paul and them said and the evil spirit testified that they were the true Servants of God you say even the devil believes and trembles you know he told me don't you remember in the scripture that's a thing our Lord did and that's what he promised he said it would happen again in the last days thought well what can that be he said well it's a spirit of the Lord Jesus he is the word am and he's promised this in the last days now don't be afraid PR I went down then to baptize a bunch of people on the river when I was baptizing there were about 5,000 people standing on the bank right in the middle of the day 2:00 in the afternoon hot they hadn't had the rain for a week or two and standing on the bank here come that Pillar of Fire whirling out of the air coming down where I was standing and the voice said as John the Baptist was sent and to forrun the first coming of Christ your message will forun the second coming of Christ the newspapers packed it and it swept into Canada on the Associated Press around the world a local Minister Baptist Minister baptizing and said a Mystic light appears over him the very one that they CAU the picture of here down it in Germany and everywhere it's done my pastor said to me he said Billy what kind of a dream did you have why you didn't know you didn't see he said there were hundred standing there witness it am witnessed it and they had come down and said oh that's a mental delusion trying his best that old man unbelief and Mr skeptic trying to step in trying to stir up doubt and and and and unbelief and Discord among you he said listen Luke the 17th chapter he promised as it was in the days of Sodom as I seen the world heaping up as it was I knew something had to come to pass I see in Malachi four where they would restore back the faith to the word that they had scattered out from I know that he had to come to pass I stayed true to the word so he was patient he waited he waited on God knowing that was the word of God he say I find Jesus Christ today the same yesterday today and forever congregation is rainning I'll stop right here I want to say this I brought all these Witnesses and my own witness many of you Witnesses this week that thing is true the message how can I Dr Davis said to me a boy a grammar school education and so on in short you a going to make much of yourself you are go amount to anything but that's just Mr skeptic that just doubt and unbelief trying to stifle the faith that God want to to charge up in you that God want to expand that God want to develop that your faith wouldn't fail that you could reach out and AC the promises that he leave for you because he spoke to you through the prophet he spoke direct to you in the word he spoke to you and left promises that only you could access but you have to hold by faith you have to grab a hole and reach out by faith knowing his word is the same yesterday today and forever and it wouldn't fail amen they say every Jury has to make up his mind he say I'm closing the court you be the judge your mind is the jury and your actions from Hereafter we lay hands on the sick and that'll spell what your verdict is the way you act after you are prayed for that will tell you your intellectual mind has been made up what the jewelry of your mind has made up that'll tell you exactly your action from herea I declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I declare there is nothing can stand in his presence the men and women who believe it do do you believe it I could read the quote you could read it I could tell you where to find it and we will make no difference if you don't believe it if you don't have faith for yourself faith for your family faith for your children it wouldn't make a difference it'll just be reading words but if you could anoint that word to yourself my God nothing will stand in your way nothing will stand in the way of your prayer nothing will be impossible I'm about to wind up but I want to touch two two simple things we read the story all the time and we talk about David and and Goliad even children little children say David slay Goliath and Goliath was a giant but I I want to suggest it was a little more than that that story wasn't a a simple normal story you know it wasn't a simple normal story I'll tell you why but the brandom preach a message works his Fai expressed paragraph 1 169 it says but David now remember it was revealed to David So Revelation is important you can't deny that when it was revealed to Peter it was revealed to Peter so you need to ask God to reveal to you his word and his promises amen he said it was revealed to him he thought here is the armies of the Living God standing in their own land they're not doing anything strange and there's a boasting uncircumcised Philistine out there we call him cancer tonight we call him paralytic why David was no kind of match for him so I know we often dramatize and say you know he accustom killing bears and lions and he good with the with the slingshot and he come out and he slay Goliath but it wasn't as simple as that you know they say David was no kind of match it was against the odds that he went into battle as a matter of fact they say not with any kind of weapon he was no match so if you give him a a sword a spare I mean a harpoon whatever you try a gun he still wasn't a match against Goliath the man's shoulders was probably 10 12T across he was probably standing 14 15t High a spare like a Weaver's needle probably 20t long the blade on it maybe across 4 feet across a little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces of string tied to it but it was revealed to him so so he wasn't acting on somebody's idea perhaps you should go and try a thing you know it wasn't that it was revealed to him and Revelation struck him amen he said God that took me out of the pors of the bear that took me out of the pors of the lion how much more will he deliver that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand his brothers were more able to do it Saul Head and Shoulders above his his army Saul was a big man Saul Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them there it is they believe it could be done they belied that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David amen now that's a difference right there if it's absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you you're going to get it that's not your brother revelation or your mother think you might be healed but God absolutely revealed to you that the Holy Ghost is yours and healing is yours my my my my my he said listen you're going to get it I don't care what's wrong with you what the odds it might be worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you yes sir and notice when it's revealed David become Fearless he didn't try to put on extra body armor and and fancy gears and think well you know what perhaps I know I custom with the bear and the lion but I'll use a helmet this time because just in case I want to protect my head no he became Fearless he said today I'll cut your head off without a sword amen that's our God by grace in that crucial moment when decisions had to be made that same God that produced The Grace in that day and dropped the seed of faith in the little Hunchback looking boy being in his heart that same God in this crucial moment could take that woman from the wheelchair that man this woman the child that little grain of faith is revealed to you then I don't care how long it takes now notice the Giants on the other side the giant didn't believe it you know you see Mr skeptic will never believe it they will never believe that you have what it takes because it's against the odds you know your chance of success slim by yourself you know if you try in your own substance you wouldn't make it you will fail you will you're no much for for Satan you're no mat for the devil here born yesterday his device is real serious we have to trust in the word of God and the grace of God to bring us through the victory belongs to him he only use us you know you say listen the giant didn't believe it neither will he cancer he laughed he said am I a dog you send that kid out here to fight me said I'll pick you up on the end of my spare and let the birds eat your flesh why he had all everything for his side but you see that didn't Shake David at all that's what happen when you have a revelation when it absolutely revealed to you it doesn't matter what happened listen a thousand could fall on my right hand you know 10,000 could fall on the next side you know but you not moving because your faith listen is planted it's anchored it's solid he say it didn't Shake David at all why it was revealed to him he had faith in what he was doing he know he was going to do it and he did it because it was revealed to him and he knew where he was standing amen as we wind down this the last thought I just need to touch on this one shamba if if you're not familiar with with him there are just a couple verses in the Bible about him but there was a message brother Brandon preached called preparation where he spoke about shanga he said you know during the time of the judge judges a little old fellow named shanga he wasn't a judge he was just a little old you know not not very much was said about him a itty bitty spot but he was a special person the kind of Faith he had the kind of belief he had and this is what you call Against All Odds he wasn't a man trained in war he wasn't a mercenary he wasn't a high priest he wasn't special and say well you know what I went to military school and I came out and I'm going to use a strategic Advantage here to kill the enemy because their scenario was very unique he had a scenario in which they would plant and they would plow and they would reap and do the things that they thought they had to do and when was Harvest Time the Philistines will come and take their crops away you know how hard it is to to do that to do that once how about to do that twice imagine your plant and your weight your water your mold you watch it you fertilized I mean you you really take care of it and at Harvest time you're getting take that's not easy yeah he said listen he was just a little Israelite and he was no King he was a lay member he'd build up the crop and work hard Israel would and first thing you know when the crops got ripe they got all their wheat harvested and everything wrong come the Philistines take everything they had and go back that's the way the devil does it so even after we speak tonight you may feel inspired you may feel you know what I want to be drawn closer to God I want my faith to be strengthened I want to be able to do the things that I believe I need to do I want to hold on to God's word and accept the promises and really be able to get the victory all the time but sometimes the devil operates this way he comes and he tries to take it away just about time you get your church fixed to a place and you say well now I'm just getting along fine we're having a real oldtime Revival the devil will slip in some old crazy idea you know them people just about crazy all that stuff there's no such a thing to it cuz Dr so and so said that there's no such a thing as that but you see there came a time when shamah had enough he had enough it didn't matter that he wasn't a general or a man of war or a ranker or he didn't have a post opposition that didn't matter he had enough the position in which he was in he said listen today is the last day of tolerating this this not happening again not under my watch and in paragraph 69 he said little old shanga got his right indignation up he looked around he couldn't find nothing he wasn't a warrior but what was in his hand he couldn't find nothing but a ox go you know what a ox go is it's a old stick it's got a big old brass lump on it that push the dirt off the plow and sometimes and punch the cattle through the gate with it that's all he had but it didn't matter but brother he was sick and tired of the Philistines coming taking what he had musicians could get ready he said oh my aren't you tired mother aren't you sister sick and tired of the devil telling me that I can't walk and I can't do this and I can't do that God bless your heart all things are possible to them that believe that's it shamba said I'm sick and tired of it I'm not a warrior the odds are against me no matter how much odds are against me God's for you if you take his word he said there's one thing I know I am circumcised I am an Israelite that is an uncircumcised Philistine I know that I'm right I am a child of God tonight and I know diseases come from the devil I know God promised me Victory brother I wish you felt like I did right now yes sir I feel awfully good look it's my god-given privilege I'm still tonight in America he said he said where I can preach it enjoy it and I say in Trinidad tonight where I could preach it enjoy it thank the Lord for it his righteous indignation Rose he grabbed that o good and jumped through the window and he challenged 600 Philistines and stood there and beat their heads in right why not a warrior not at all but he was an Israelite he was circumcised and if tonight you circumcised with the Holy Ghost you don't have have to wait till you're trained to be a warrior God bless your heart claim your god-given privilege and be their heads in amen that's right say get out of the way Satan kick him out of the way I'm the guy that's taking over now I come in Jesus name watch him scatter brother when you use that kind of Fate on him that level of Faith he will back up against all the odds you will see him scatter he doesn't care at that point you can play he's there all the time Hallelujah the level of your faith is born and spurred on by Revelation it's powered by the word of God it's enhanced by prayer and fasting against
