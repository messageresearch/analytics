family represented here guarded here father may you hear every cry every request may you you your a be attentive to them tonight as they come in all sincerity to make a request known unto you you said Lord which man given thought that one Cub statue by our given thought we cannot change our own selves our own lives it take you to do that change and the transformation and we invite you tonight to come and transform and change our lives to be more like you oh God we are such a needy people father and we are not ashamed to confess how needy we are Lord nothing in our heart we bring but simply to thy cross we claing have your way tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and Welcome to our Zoom prayer meeting tonight and um if have your Bibles and keep the Bible close by I want to read two portion of scripture one from Matthew 21:12 to13 and acts 747 to 50 or take it from there Matthew 211 12-13 says and Jesus went into temple of God cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that so doves said unto them it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you have made it a den of Thieves acts 7 verse 47 to 50 reads but Solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayth the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol but what house will he build me sayth the Lord or what is the place of my rest had not my hand made all these things may God bless his word praise God and I have a thought I like to share with you what house will you build and I'm trying to see that house as a House of Prayer and we want to look at our bodies your bodies as the temple of God a little different tonight I sort of mini I'll run through some scriptures see what the Lord will do so he said Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stool what house will you build me say the Lord or what is the place of my rest and the prophet said and start perect man he said this morning we want to speak on a subject or teach rather if we can building the living Tabernacle building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the perfect man the living Tabernacle of the Living God where he dwell now this is beautiful even how it is phe the living Tabernacle so what that does that moves your mind away from the physical building the physical church that you attend to and it zooms in on a different light of this thing called the perfect man it's living tabernac then he was talking about the same way he brought his church up the same way he bringing his people up then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue C knowledge Temperance patience godliness Brotherly Love at brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost here we go Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues seal in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him so the object of God is not for you to be church ified it's for you to become a living Tabernacle now that kills all the excuses you may have against a deacon a Elder Minister Pastor the church that kills all of that and that's strips each person naked before God as to whether or not they are a tabernacle or becoming a tabernacle of the Living God Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot to what house will you build me I hope you see something here tonight let's continue 1 Corinthians 6 verse 13- 20 Paul speaks Meats for belly belly for Meats but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body note the Lord for the body and God had put raise up the Lord and will also raise us by his own power know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ see so so Paul is actually bringing them completely out of church completely out of location completely out of physical structure and look how he's presenting it now this is the the bodies know know ye not verse 15 that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of an halot God forbid what know ye not that he which is joined on harot is one body for two say he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that commit fornication sinth against his own body what Paul PA speaks KN ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which he have of God and he are not your own aha so now it come to ownership it comes to who really owns this house this house that we have as a tabernacle this house as we have we have as a as a building who really is in charge of that house and I wrote down something here tonight that this body or house is not your own and you were not part of the design team or part of the team that made it so we must be concerned with what we do with it look at verse 20 now for ye are bought with a price [Music] therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so this is a clear directive that we can glorify God in our physical bodies so in other words our life are not just like as a as a spiritual being because we on Earth we are subject to the senses of the earth that is why we have to be able to take a hold of this body that we have or this house that we have or this Tabernacle that we have that we did not design and we did not make let's continue Hebrews 10 verse 4-7 it says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goat should take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body H has thou prepared me in bir offerings and sacrifices for sin thou have no pleasure then I said no I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God so this sacrifice and offering which was figurative of a true sacrifice that was coming we talking about your body being prepared you being prepared your mind being prepared because what God really wants is your body your house your Tabernacle and the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is true Liberty what do you think Lucifer wants what do you think the devil wants he wants your house he wants your Tabernacle what does God want you want to use your eyes your ears your mouth your being you have to see it for what it is and the devil sees an opportunity God sees an opportunity but the opportunity of God is different because he put a seed in you before the foundation of the world and that seed is what is attracted to the word but because we are attract I uses that word in flesh meaning that we bypass our theophany so that we can be tempted and tried and tested it means that we have options as to the extent that we surrender as to the extent that we yield as the extent we give over our lives over to him and that is why in the par of Jesus when you talk about the seed fall on good ground you talk about some 30 some 60 some 100 all did not produce full yield so that means there are conditions that affects us from bringing forth full yield of the crop that God want from us he described it in John 15 as I am the vine you're the branches every branch that doesn't produce cut off and every brand I produce I purge to do what more fruit and here in is my father glorified what for much fruit so God is not in this dead beat thing as I said God don't want to break even he wants to know there's a productive a production of his word of his life and everything else let me see I can wrap up here now all right Romans [Music] 1 verse 18 I don't know if I ever read this scripture before to you but listen to this Romans 1:18 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which be known of God is Manifest in them for God had showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even as eternal power on godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imagination and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like the corruptible man to birds and foref footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God here we go God also give them up to uncleanness through the lust of the their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their woman did change the natural use into that which is against nature and like why also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burn in their lust one towards another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God give them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient they amplifi this verse 28 says and so since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or approve of him or consider him worth the knowing god give them over to a base and condemned mind to do things that are not proper and decent or decent but lome being filled with unrighteousness fornication wickedness courageousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit maginity Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventor of evil things Disobedience of parents without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knoweth the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of debt not only to do the same but have pleasure in them that do them so you can see here and all this men and men and women and woman and you could see is a perversion because God made man a certain way woman a certain way God made us a certain way this is his house what house are you going to build him and I use that scripture with Jesus running them and he said my house shall be called House of Prayer we cannot continue prayerless lives we cannot continue as if we have this sense of ownership and permanence as opposed to God give you like a rent or a lease with this Tabernacle that you have for a certain amount of time and sometime you have to sign off from this lease agreement and it's how you take care of that and God told the prophet when he was young don't smoke Don't drink don't defile yourself with woman because I have a work for you to do and if God said that it means that defilement is something that God takes very serious defilement is something God takes very very serious and and remember we are not God we have to follow through with his requirements there's a reason why God will speak about repentance there's a reason why God will say come and reason together do your sins be a scholet you shall be righteous know even if God wants to be merciful and and he is and pardon there's a way to get that pardon that he's looking for those who will ask for it if you want to be reconciled to God tonight you can be reconciled because you're not being reconciled to a man you're being reconciled to God people could be reconciled to church but still not to God people can come to church and still don't know anything about God because they see church as an end game they see church as an objective a place to go to a place to worship if you flip the script and see those that worship idols they go to a temple they go to a tabernacle they go to a house whatever it is and they worship the Creator the creature and when they leave from that worship they feel good they really think this is God and here it is the Living God wants to take you and I as Tabernacles that we could be living Tabernacles and this is where I'm going to close tonight from Romans chapter 12 so all that backdrop bring us to this scripture Romans 12 fam scripture verse one I besee you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable yes you could party yes you could go and take a line yes you could do with your friends yes you could do this and do that and do it's you your choice but Paul encouraging them to present their bodies a Living Sacrifice which is your reasonable service it is the base the bottom what it can give God that sacrifice watch now that you be not conformed to this world but be transformed by renewing of your mind that you may prove what is a good and acceptable will of God and this is the Amplified I appeal to you therefore Brethren and beg of you in view of all the mercies of God to make a decisive dedication of your bodies presenting all your members and faculties as a Living Sacrifice it come like if you present your body in service on a Sunday on a Wednesday but that is you presenting your physical body but from all the other days you taken in Hollywood or you just absorbing movies or whatever it is that means your mind which is part of your body your head or whatever your eyes and whatever you have that Focus somewhere else because if you take it from the scriptures Samson loved God Samson was really serving the lord and everything else but he end up now giving his strength to God part of his body and he gave his heart to a woman and that end up being a real downfall for him so here what the Bible talk about presenting all your members and faculties as a Living Sacrifice holy devoted consecrated and well pleasing to God which is your reasonable rational intelligence service and spiritual worship do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial Customs but be transformed Changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideas it New Attitudes so that you may prove for yourself what is the good and acceptable perfect will of God even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you so I'll close and I have one more scripture and that is it all right yes one more scripture so when you come to service when you come to pran you are hearing God's thoughts if we are presenting the word to you and these thoughts is what you have to embrace these thoughts and words is what you have to connect with what you have to repeat what you have to go and read over what you have to say Lord this is this is mind I claim it it is mind because your mind has to be changed and renewed you know come like somebody who go up in a vient uh environment mother have gone father have gone th stealing whatever whatever the child being raised in a violent it'll be normal for the child to be accustomed and this is just a normal environment the noise the cursing and the swearing for that child to get a new environment is a whole different thing all together a different experience you see and This Is Us born in sin shap iniquity our lives have been shap us with way and you're coming out and things hitting you things are convicting you things are almost like people might say pulling teeth right it's hard but the truth of it is this is what going to change and transform you this is what it is last scripture and we will close Paul in 1 Thessalonians 41-5 Paul says furthermore then I we beseech you Brethren and exalt you by the Lord Jesus that as he have receiv received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so you would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we give you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and this verse here verse four is such a powerful verse that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of cense even as the Gentile which know not God and this is the last quote this is the same text in the amplifi furthermore brethren we beg and admonish you in virtue of our Union with the Lord Jesus that you follow the instructions which you learn from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God as indeed you are doing that you do so even more and more abundantly attaining yet a greater perfection in living this life for you know what charges and precepts we give you on the authority and by the inspiration of the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God that you should be consecrated separated and set apart for pure and holy living that you should abstain and Shrink from all sexual vice that each one of you should know how to position control manage his own body in consecration Purity separated from things profane and honor not to be used in passion of lust like the Heathen who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of his will let's bow our heads father God I thank you it was such a blessing to be here tonight to share these words that have been right in me to share with them and I pray God that your spirit will just take a hold of it and speak to them and convict them and anoint them and Inspire them as they cry out unto you we can't do like him and just bring anything at the altar or bring whatever sacrifice we think that you will approve we have to come like Abel by Revelation and present this Blood this blood that speak on our behalf this blood has speak better things Lord Jesus we we thank you Lord there's nothing that we could do could have done what we have done but we and that's why the exhalation comes so direct that we can present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice receive these sacrifices tonight and confirm it with the fire of the Holy Ghost call upon your children as they cry out to you in prayer when you receive their faith and confirm it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight May there be breakthrough after breakthrough May there be healing May there be power May there be virtue go out into their homes into their hearts into their marriages into the
