hallelujah greetings in the name of Jesus this Precious Jesus in whom we preach about and talk about I greet you in that name because my name is not worthy amen the name Anthony your brand means absolutely nothing believe me but in Jesus name we cast all demons out in Jesus name we take power and authority over every sickness over every demonic satanic Lucifer and Spirits we take power over them to the shed blood of Jesus Christ that has made us join heirs to the kingdom of God oh and the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressed their way into it action is cause you're gonna find out tonight if you don't press your where you're not gonna get anything from God so I greet you again in the precious name of Jesus Christ tonight in a special way the church the purchase of the blood

Hallelujah you always somebody problem is you didn't know it in heaven you were white oh but down on Earth they called you black they called you this they call you that oh Hallelujah they called you defiled they call you sinful isn't that right you come to a sinful condition oh but take a revelation to break upon your soul to reveal to you who you really was because even you didn't know who you really was even the devil didn't know who you really was told Jesus if thou be the Son of God in other words I don't know who you are there's silence over your life there's mystery over your life there's promise over your life I don't know who you are but let me test you a little bit let me tempt you a little bit let me see what you're going to do when I hit you the word test but Jesus pass every test he said it is written he said it is written and he said it is all Soul written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God oh hallelujah hallelujah he didn't need power to do it he didn't need great signs and wonders to do it or while he hadn't broken into that Ministry yet but he showed by a simple example how the word of God could defeat the Devil anywhere anytime under any condition and tonight we have the most powerful thing on the planet what is it the word of God and we are going to defeat the Devil tonight anywhere anytime over any condition talk back to me somebody speak back to me some party if you know in this Jesus we're talking about tonight oh Hallelujah amen so I greet you once more in the precious name of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah I can't emphasize how precious he is

Coast and for the meetings amen and I heard they started off with a blast amen the people are already in Revival the place is already like the last two of it this feels like the last service and it's only the first service such as was the report so I know they're gonna have to hire some stone masons after to fix a place because they're already blowing the police off praise God but over and open the service and the fire is already in the building all the way over in Africa praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah that's the report I got whose report are you gonna believe

you watch and see if God don't do something for you I challenge you to believe it I challenge you to stay on that expectation I know God could do something tonight that no eye has seen that no air has heard oh Hallelujah to praise God so I thank God for all things tonight amen hallelujah praise God so let me let's stand tonight because you wanna uh turn to the scripture amen praise God so you want to greet those on the internet hook up who might be hooked up to us tonight we certainly greet you in a precious name of Jesus Christ amen we love you appreciate you we thank you for joining in fellowship with us praise God as we earnestly content for the Fate I just brought back my Malachi for is that right amen so Saint Luke uh book of Saint Luke I'm going to read from tonight Luke chapter 24 okay amen wondered from Luke chapter 24 and also for Mark you could find Saint John and the Book of Matthew also um for scripture readings or I don't know wait um let's go to Saint John for Saint John chapter 12 and verse 21 okay we'll read from their first that's where my text is from tonight John 12 and 20. amen Hallelujah Saint John 12 and verse 20 okay just find that you're quick and we got it remain seeing John chapter 12 and verse 20. and it says and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philip which was of bedside of Galilee and inside him these undesired him sorry seeing so we would see Jesus Philip cometh I tell it Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat should fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose him and he that hated his life in this world shall keep it until life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be If any man serve me him will my father honor and now is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour and we'll uh and we also we also took notice in a book of Luke chapter 24 and verse 1 um yeah Luke 24 verse 1 we want to read from one to eight inclusively amen Luke 24 1 says now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came into this bringing the spices which they had prepared and and certain others went with them and they found the stone rule away from usafaka and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed they about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the Dead he is not here but he is risen remember how he's speaking to you when he was yet in Galilee seeing the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and Lucy it says and they remembered his words and now turning lastly to Matthew Book of Matthew 24 and verse 35 we just read out one verse 10. amen amen Matthew 24 and verse 35 a man just had one verse there uh where is it oh I lost it all right 24 35 says shall pass away put my words shall not pass away may God blessing through his word let's just bow our heads and pray amen Heavenly Father we've read your word tonight and Lord how we thank you for your word Lord father let's give us power over the enemy Lord father Lord we're here tonight to mix all wood with Faith Lord that we could receive all blessing tonight Lord we receive whatever you have for us in the world tonight father Take Me Out to the way Lord father and may your bless your people Lord Inspire them not father may go through the midst of the camp tonight just like a walk through the midst of the people of god father that were at the pool of Messiah Lord and as you touch that lay man who was there 38 years waiting for his Blessing Lord there's somebody here tonight waiting for their blessing Lord Lord may I go through the pews and through the aisles tonight father and mayor visit them and touch them Lord father individuals as they were to press through father or into your presence Lord father Lord for them Lord father Inspire them break the shackles break the chains off of their feet tonight Lord father so that they could praise you and worship your lord father and see you in your glory and in your truth Lord grant it almighty God we pray these things in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats what happened many many men Hallelujah get a lot of Praise offering oh hallelujah hallelujah we had to praise him in him we had to give God glory praise God we shouldn't cease to give God priests we shouldn't cease to give God glory because he's done so much for us tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we're not worthy of but he did it anyway because he loved you isn't that right you couldn't love yourself when you saw your own condition you can love yourself when you saw your own situation and how lost we was and how messed up we were and how forgotten we was but he came and he found you in your condition and loved you just that way Hallelujah isn't that right just as you are he loved you messed up broken up shaken up Peter not but he loved you just the same and his desire for you is not for you to remain in that condition no no no no no no he's coming with a transforming power to transform you from that state into a perfect state from whatever condition you are to transform you into something glorious into something beautiful into something that the world could look upon and that he himself could say this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased to dwell in here here him here here what she has to say hear what she has to speak whatever they say will already be said in a word oh same and somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah he many many men so my title tonight is taken from our Texas in John 12. which says when it dies it bringeth for much fruit when it dies it bringeth forth much fruit my inspiration is taken from that sentence written of verse 8th of Luke 24 which says and they remembered his words amen isn't that right they remembered something something about what was spoken something about what was said concerning them see the word had been sown in their hearts for a year upon year they walked with him for three and a half years and many times the Bible said that he spoke unto them concerning the things that he had to suffer isn't that right he said the son of man will be offered up would be crucified to the hands of sinful men and on the third day rise again they heard this already before but they didn't know what he was talking about the Bible said they understood not his words he said it on more than one occasion yet somehow it just didn't take effect but yet it was soon he had to speak it he had to say it because a thought would only remain a thought unless you speak it isn't that right it remain just a thought in your mind but unless you speak something it wouldn't materialize unless you sow it Hallelujah it won't reap back of fruit and increase in its due season isn't that right so he was dropping off words to them dropping off things to them dropping off uh Hallelujah isn't that right the word of God to them the son of man shall do this and the son of man shall do that and Destroy This Temple but in three days I'll raise it back up again isn't that right Hallelujah he was speaking words to them and they thought it was only words but every word of God is a seed isn't that right it takes the form of a seed and a powerful thing about a seed is that a seed is not the end product a seed is not the fruit yet but it shall be so in the near future it's not right it's going to become a fruit in due process but it has to go through a process it has to go through a death it has to go through a certain kind of a thing step by step it has to go from one form to another until another until it comes to its final stage of progress from before the foundation of the world but what happened in the Garden of Eden calls the spiritual Amnesia to fall upon man isn't that right the prophet preached a message about spiritual Amnesia oh hallelujah hallelujah because you see we forgot who we were Jesus was born in Perfection he was born by the very spoken word of God at age 12 he knew that he was about his father's business there are not many 12 year olds I could say that today but he knew who he was at age 12 because he was not just anybody but he was a very word made flesh oh I say Amen somebody amen Hallelujah he was a very pillow of Fire turn into flesh oh Hallelujah isn't that right he said I was there with Moses when Moses opened the Red Sea I was there with Jacob when he wrestled all night long I am the wheel in the middle of the wheel I am the rock beneath the rock I am the one the voice that cried out in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord he told the disciples on the roads he missed he blasted them he said oh fools and flow of hats don't you know that the very prophets were prophesying of my coming didn't you know that those very prophets were living out something they didn't know what they were living out but it was Jesus all the time it was Jesus on two feet it was Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah if you can't pick up the Bible and read the Bible and not see Jesus in every scripture and there's something wrong with your Christian experience then there's something wrong with you you need to read it again because every verse every line every scripture oh Hallelujah even of the Old Testament prophesied of his coming oh isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so they remembered something they remembered his words hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right the word come to break the spiritual Amnesia off of you we walk like like like like like like parentless children sometimes we walk like we have no owner isn't that right oh Hallelujah holidays I think there's a poem that says we walk with with hop nail shoes Where Angels Fear to thread we walk in this world but we are not of this world there's so much evil and contamination in this Earthly atmosphere you're not even aware of it you are blind to it you walk in and looking with your natural eyes and you're not seeing how much dangers how much toils and how much snares that you have come through tonight it was God that kept you you thought you kept yourself you better wake up and recognize you are not in control as much as you think you are it is God that is in control kept next to yourself man get next to yourself young woman you can't keep yourself you cannot save yourself I can't save you nor can I give you the Holy Ghost it takes God to save you it takes the power of God to release the people in this hour foreign if you know what I'm talking about hallelujah oh I feel God in this place tonight I feel he's ready to break the plans of wickedness I feel like seeing Jesus who was slain and hung on a tree that seen Jesus with power and authority yet he humbled himself the prophet said if you want Power get next to God and unhumble yourself before God he said you'll have more power than the man screaming and jumping and praising and worshiping God you'll have more power than him because you could humble yourself before God this great King Of Who We Are huh the creator of Heaven and Earth humble himself and became sin and became filthy became wretched like we were to be wretched oh Hallelujah suffered many things for our sake he became man why so that man could once again become God because that was all original condition isn't that right oh he came to redeem us and to redeem means to bring back I know I'm taking my time tonight but I'm just waiting for God to drop down and bless you because I can't do it I know I can't do it now I'm just yielding to his presence are you with me this evening redeem means to bring back to bring back to a former condition because you see you are always in God's mind perfect is that right in God's mind you were something special in God's mind you are lovely and God's mind you are beautiful oh you always was isn't that right God spoke to job in a whirlwind and said where was thou when I lay the foundations of the Earth and the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouting for Joy who is he talking about he's talking about you in the front he was talking about you in the back he was talking about you on the side he was talking about you this evening where was thou when I lay the foundations of the earth when I created the Earth and I created the Earth and itself and the seeds of God were in itself in the earth he said where was thou job when I told the seeds every seed for you to bring forth after your own kind he said Job answer me he said good up your loins like a man he said pull up your socks job oh I love your wiggling around in your flesh you can't get nothing from me if you in that atmosphere you need to come up here this evening you need to get out of your sinking flesh get out of what you're in get up your humanistic get out of your carnal mind begin to put on your spiritual think and cap I want you to go way back back before there was a problem come on now back before there was a situation come on now back before there was a condition answer me tonight answer me tonight answer me tonight answer me tonight answer me tonight answer me tonight where was that same answer yeah oh somebody giving praise tonight somebody give him glory tonight somebody gave him honor tonight where was Tom when I lay the foundation of the world you were saying God's thinking you were then God's very programmed it's not right so the devil is only fooling you this evening the devil is only putting a facade in front of you this evening he's only hanging the dollar bills in front of you and have you chasing after the world and chasing after this chasing after money chasing after women chasing after boys and girls and the clubs thinking that that was satisfy but nothing can satisfy the longing in the souls and the hearts of the sons of God there is nothing that can satisfy your soul but Jesus I don't care what it is he said put no Idols before me or he wants all the worship or he wants all the praise he wants all the honor that is true to his name oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is worthy of it come on now he has flirty of all the glory he created you in His image how dare we think otherwise how dare we come in our own mind you begin to raise our hands you gotta forget about yourself concentrate on him and worship him and think about what he's done for you he's done so much for you you cannot tell it all you cannot understand it all just give God worship you just give God praise forget about yourself Hallelujah Hallelujah is something special about you there's something wonderful about you makes you think about that story about the African slave and he was in the slavery condition just like everybody else it's not right but he walked different he talked different from the other slaves he moved a little differently they might have all looked the same from the outside but you could see from his conduct and from his behavior that he was a little different from the other slaves isn't that right he spoke a little differently he was a more positive attitude kind of person when others was looking up he was looking down he was looking up when others were depressed he was always in High Spirits and one day a merchant came by and he wanted to buy one of those slaves but he had his eye on this special one and he told a slave master he said I want that slave because he recognized there was something special about him isn't that right the slave owner said he's not for sale I can't tell him I can't do it he's too precious he's too different from the rest the merchant said I noticed he's different but I want to know why why what makes him tick like that what makes him operate like that what makes him move like that oh hallelujah hallelujah that's not right and the slave owner said back in Africa I began to check up on him I began to do a background search on this one particular slave I began to ask some questions and it began to only realize that back in Africa he is the son of a king in a camp in Africa his father is a great Chieftain his blood is royalty he sees himself a certain way that is why he walks the way he walks that is why he talks the way he talks he's just different and there's something about you tonight there's something about the way you walk there's something about the way you talk your family can see it your wife could see it your husband could see it come on now or even the devil can see it praise God he knows there's something about you Hallelujah oh the devil is not afraid of who you are now but he is afraid of what you are going to become or Hallelujah because he knows if you could connect back to who you was before the beginning to who you was before there was a moon before there was a star before there was an action you wouldn't know who you are you will have authority in court to tell the devil pull right back oh they've got to praise tonight Hallelujah so put a smile on your face this evening put your shoulders back this evening you are not what the devil says you are oh come on now you are not what the enemy says you are you are not what your family says you are you are What God Says You Are this is who I am if anybody asks me just who I am Tell them I've been a team I've been bought with a price I am somebody inside of here tonight and if I want to be healed I could just go to this because this has my name all over it oh somebody answer me somebody answer me tonight answer me like a man where was how stop I feel him I feel him I feel him in this place tonight I feel him in his place right now the one with the nail prince in his hand he's moving through the aisles tonight there once was a film there once was a film think about David Wilkerson I think the cross on the switchblade that's right there was a young man in there who used to give a lot of trouble his name was Israel what a name for a man who gave a lot of trouble and the story David works I think was a true true story actually he actually in the end he started a church in Manhattan I think and um in New York but he was preaching to lost souls in New York trying to save these young kids from gangs and violence and this one particular young man is named Israel he was a gang leader and I think it was a Momos or something I can't remember the names gangs and so on but he was a gang leader and he was really high up in the ranks if you wanted to know what to do in the gang you had to go and ask Israel what to do because he was one of the hi Hitman trigger finger he was crazy he was um he had a bloodlust like never before and David Wilkerson would always go with his Bible and preach the word of God preach it to Israel Israel to laugh at it mock at it scuff at it he would do all kinds of things but there come a time when this preacher began to he held a convention and for all these young gang leaders and all these young people and the spirit of God dropped down began to save them begin to do something among the lives of these young people that they had never seen before or when God began to move in the camp I remember Israel he was saved something happened to him he got in contact with the same Jesus Christ he got in contact with the same God that we're talking about tonight and they were beginning to hand out Bibles after the service and Israel pick up the Bible and he opened the Bible so I think the Old Testament and he said wait a minute wait a minute he said look my name is all over this Bible he said look Israel is here he said look Israel here he said look Israel here he said I didn't know and I was part of this glorious day foreign when we were lost and undone without God or his son but then he reached down his hand for you you begin to see your name all over the power he promised you Joy come on now he promised you the Holy Ghost he promised you peace he promised you your children he promised you the baptism of fire he promised to be with you he said I'll never leave you he said I'll never forsake you who's he talking about he's talking about you when you begin to see yourself in the world hallelujah hallelujah what is it the word mixed with shakes it's a word mixed with faith he told kirian he said the sword of the Lord and of Gideon don't just say the sword of the Lord but put yourself in there too put yourself in the Bible put yourself in them promises if God was talking about the Holy Ghost he was talking about me if God was talking about Deliverance he was talking about me if God said be there for perfect he was talking about you oh answer me like a man answer me like a man and somebody like a man who will stop I can't hear you I can't hear Hallelujah Hallelujah can I take my time tonight it's important for you to see yourself in the world without a vision the people perish you'll be coming to church for years but if you don't have a vision you're not gonna get anywhere you're gonna just be coming to church there's millions of people on the island two and a half million people on this island a certain percentage of that they go to church a lot of people go to church there's no power in that but you see when you take this word and you begin to do something about it that's when the word has an effect on your life and that's when the devil goes on a rampage because he doesn't want you to do something about a word that you're hearing isn't that right isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the people at the pool of Bethesda isn't that right excuse me they were doing something about that angel that dropped by and stood the waters isn't that right he would drop down and Trouble the waters and you see God God God sets things up where he likes to struggle he likes for you to contend he likes for you to fight to press your way the Bible said since John come on the scene the kingdom of God is preached and every man not some man come on now not certain kind of man not people of low-class society of medium-class society or High Society people no no no no every man press their way into the kingdom the kingdom suffered violence and the violent taken by force and I can imagine how vile the scene would get at the pool of Bethesda when people were rushing to get their blessing when people were rushing to get their touch when people are rushing to get their healing to get their anointing but it wasn't a time for people to say sorry it wasn't a time for excuse me when the angel began to stir the pool when the angel began to trouble the water you had to do something about that angel or you would get nothing from God oh there is somebody with me tonight answer me tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah you had to do something for something that happened action is caused isn't that right praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my I haven't even got to my text yet praise God I'm just building a background here it's not right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but do you love him he loves the contest he loves the battle he loves the struggle because the struggle proves what is in you isn't that right it proves what is inside of your heart if you have a real desire because you see if your lackadaisical it will show on the outside it's not right if you if you're backward in your mind and thinking and slow to the to the promises of God if you if you're slow to the draw it'll show on the outside when the test comes come on now when when when when the Press comes down come on now it will show what's inside of you that's why God loves to give a test God loves to test his sons and daughters of God to see what is inside of them to see what hidden potential that is lying inside of you there is more to you tonight that meets the eye or answer me somebody there's more to you than the devil can see but the only way to prove that is true a test the only way to prove that is true and experience when something begins to happen then it begins to show up oh Hallelujah what's on the inside what desire you have inside of you isn't that right one time God called a man call Gideon he said I chose you because you're a mighty man of Valor of course Gideon didn't quite believe that I don't blame him because I wouldn't have believed it either because Gideon was said to be a kind of a short guy and he was said to be kind of look insignificant looking young guy but God called the Young because they are strong come on amen young people so it doesn't matter how young you are God could still use you oh hallelujah hallelujah to put the church on fire he could use you to put a devil on a run he could use you to knock Satan unconscious oh hallelujah hallelujah young people are very powerful people in the hands of God and anytime God gets you in his hands he could to create damage to the enemy he could do great damage to Satan that's why the enemy has been afflicting the young people so much but it's coming up power to break the chains off of them there's coming a power to defeat the Devil that's coming up power in the church now to break the curse of sin to pick the curse of the enemy off of our young people only hold them for our time but when God is ready for you you can't go nowhere but to Jesus you gotta drag yourself God will hold you by the neck where do you think you're going tying this up and God was ready for Gideon said the almighty man of hell answer me like a man oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah begin to talk to Gideon you're going to prove himself together now Gideon knows that God is real and he's for real this time he's for serious I heard about this God from the stories of Joshua and I heard about this chord from the stories of Moses but Kitty and saw God for himself and that's what need to happen to you in here tonight you need to see God for yourself otherwise you're just playing Church until you see God real in your home and in your heart and in your life oh answer me like a man somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah talk back to me somebody and he said call the man up thousands came and answered the call you're making a call to war and then all of a sudden God speaks to Gideon and tells Gideon to say a certain thing and get him he gets to talk to the people and keep beginning of giving my last chance you see if you have anything to do if you have anything that you need that is more important than this here right now feel free to go ahead and a large majority walked away a large majority thought it more important to go and see about other things see about their family and their cattle and their sheep so this smaller portion come down with giriana and God is beginning to filter them out and this small portion of people that come out after the call to war was made God took a smaller portion of that people and he said carry them down to the river carry them down to the water and they tell them to drink from that water he said let every man go and drink for themselves oh hallelujah hallelujah it's not right and they begin to go and drink at the water and God begins to speak to Gideon and he said Gideon don't call the ones that have too much pride to drink don't call the ones that kneeling with their knees and those one that don't want to get their dress dirty he said oh call the ones that that Freight to kneel down he said no no he said call the water laugh us he said call the ones that lay prostrate before the river he said call the water lapis God is looking for thirsty people God is looking for desperate people people who are water lappers people who are not afraid people who are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ people who are not ashamed to be identified with him God is calling for water lapis he said the hour common hours when the true worshipers Are Gonna Worship the father in spirits and in truth I need somebody to help me tonight somebody shout unto God tonight oh Hallelujah I need somebody who's not ashamed of him tonight to be identified with court tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the woman that brought her Allah backs the box to Jesus she was in a condition isn't that right the Bible said she was a prostitute woman Michael and here was the Pharisees having a social Gathering is not try and picture this a Pharisee is throwing a party that that went right over your head a Pharisee is throwing a party he's throwing a a good time that's kind of strange but so were they trying to trap Jesus they were so trying to trap Jesus and to get Jesus in a corner and to embarrass him and to make support of him that they decided to throw a party something that I don't think they really do because that's a kind of a boring party but here was this great party with all these official heads of the Pharisees and the sex and the scribes of the of the of the Sadducees and all these great esteemed men came to this so-called party but they knew what the plan was they knew what the plot was they were all in it because they provided no one at the tape at the door of the feast to wash Jesus's feet when he would come they gave him us gave Jesus a special invitation just to make fun of him just to mock him just to just to just to be cruel to him because he didn't like him at all but you see Jesus anytime he's invited he always comes anytime you invite Jesus I think that's a quote on our Facebook page anytime you make an invitation to Jesus he comes anyway no matter where it is no matter how it is he always comes the prophet preacher message called doors and doors he said you could open the door to your living room or they don't have to open the door to your bedroom Jesus will be let in as far as you let him to go in is that right some people Entertain You on the porch and that's as far as you could go with them they are not going to let you in the living room you got to be a little closer in friendship I guess to be led into the living room that's a special kind of place and then there's an even more private kind of a place for you to invite somebody into your bedroom into your personal space is that right and here was Jesus invited to a place where he was being mocked at scuffed that ridicule made fun of scrutinized heavily yet he was God in flesh and they failed to see it but yet was their attitude towards this man Jesus called the Christ but here was a woman with a condition here was a woman who had a need she needed something and she saw that Jesus had a need also and she saw that Jesus's need was greater than her own and she took the most expensive thing that she could find she ran home and got her Alabaster Box she ran home and got the most expensive kind of perfume it's not right she didn't buy this perfume at the ten dollar store no this is not the twenty dollar store perfume this is the kind of perfume we'll go to buy at the magic box or something this is the kind of perfume you would spend a lot of money on same and somebody oh Hallelujah isn't that right it was an expensive perfume it was a perfume of great price it cost something to her isn't that right and she took the most costly thing that she had the thing that valued the most to her and she was willing to present that to Jesus and some of us are so cheap with our praise some of us are so cheap with all worship we don't want to present something to God but God is looking for the most valuable thing he said what do you have what do you have this evening to give to Jesus what do you have to give to me oh come on now come on now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah where am I going she came into the presence of the feast a knelt down before Jesus she didn't look at the left she didn't look to the right she saw this man with dirty feet sitting in the corner ridiculed no one was talking to him they were laughing and having their own inside jokes what a condition and here was this woman she began to knee long before God and she began to cry and she began to cry and the tear ducts of her eyes begin to open up a little more than it should but it was for a purpose because his feet needed washing and God had a need of her tear ducts so he opened her tear ducts and they began to flow like a river and they began to wash the feet of Jesus they began to fleeing the feet of Jesus but there's a powerful thing about the story that I heard that she began to let her hair down to wipe his feet apparently in Jewish custom it is unseemingly for a woman to let her hair down in the presence of men if she was married her husband could have put her away for that act that she did but sometimes tonight I feel like letting my hair down and I feel like letting God know how much he really means to be you see when God means something to you you don't mind if you act unseemingly I don't care what people think about Jimmy if I have to lose my tie a little bit if I have to lose the buttons on my shirt if I have to get all sweaty and messed up I don't care if I have to act unsevenly but God means something to me tonight I don't mind letting my hair down in the presence of almighty God because he means something to me tonight Hallelujah oh what does he mean to you tonight does he mean something to you if he does then praise him if he does then worship Him if he does then thank him give him the glory that is due to his name oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah certain people come to Jesus certain Greeks isn't that right came to the feast and it's asked of him saying so we would see Jesus Jesus being led by the spirit of God begins to speak certain words to them is that right he says unless a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die alone isn't that right Hallelujah now this corn of wheat that Jesus is speaking about is a seed isn't that right and the word of God when spoken Goes Forth as a seed it's not right when he speaks it materializes it takes place it's not right oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah many many men could you live Lord Hannah praise this evening hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah many many many men thank you Jesus okay let me read this here from the spoken word is the Original Seed he said now the word of God is eternal he said God be an infinite cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else to a better decision because every decision of god is perfect it's not right so his decision to have you here in this age of all evil and this messed up society that we're living in his decision to have you here living in 2015 in this time now to be born into the family or born into to be come up through the way you come up his decision to do that was perfect is that right because he knew that there was something inside of you that despite the opposition that despite what was around you that you were going to make it anyhow he knew that he put something inside your soul that no matter what the devil throw in your direction he knew that you were going to make it anyhow oh answer me like a man somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah he smiled when he saw you in 2015 because he knew that the devil was in trouble and every time you wake up in the morning the devil gets a headache bigger than you even know because you just woke up this morning he oh Halal he began to Tremor he begins to shake because there's a power in you tonight the Bible said the devil believes and trembles when he sees the weakest Saints go to praying on their knees when you go to praying to your father when you go to pray to your father the devil begins to get a mind battle because he knows that the word says ask anything in my name and it shall be given unto you preach back to me somebody oh preach back to me somebody Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah said every decision of god is perfect he's not going to change his mind on it his mind is already made up David said I would O Lord is settled in heaven forever isn't that right once it's spoken it cannot come back for once it's spoken it cannot come back with nothing once that word is spoken it has to come into a manifestation of whatever the word is is that right said he cannot watch his word is spoken Prophet said it can never die it lives on and on and on and can never die because it is God and His word can no more die than he can die that's the reason we read in first John or Saint John first chapter he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh the same word that was spoken in the beginning with his eternal purpose come on over and was made flesh and twelvet Among Us he said that was God's word spoke something in the beginning and it had to comfort no matter what the obstacle was no matter what the situation around it the word of God once spoken cannot return but it shall accomplish the purpose that it was sent forth for it to accomplish it's not right and I shared something down in tickle Mountain Amen on Wednesday night going there Hallelujah about a special kind of a plant they are underwater plants isn't that right there are plants that actually have the ability to grow underwater most of the times we see plants growing above the water in the land bushy areas grass areas trees shrubs Hills Etc but there is a certain kind of grass called underwater grass or seagrass and sometimes because of the condition of the water it can hinder the growth of this underwater grass sometimes it could destroy this underwater vegetation is that right but there is a certain kind of plant called a Lily and a lily has the unique ability that despite the condition of the water that Lily will press through any muck that Lily will press through any Maya that Lily could press through any condition that it would find itself in and you could throw cabbage in the water you could throw all pails in the water you could throw a fridge in the water that won't stop the Lily from pressing through that Lily is on a mission that Lily will not stop growing that Lily is carrying within it a life form of a flower and that Lily has one mission to get to the top and a Christian on this Earth he and she has one Mission One mission to get to the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and there's nothing inside of you that is going to stop as long as you are a son of God tonight or answer me tonight as long as you are daughter of God if there's something inside your heart if there's something inside your soul if there's something God put inside of you you cannot stop you will Press Your Way press pass and more come on now press pass the Maya press pass a condition press pass what the devil throws in your direction into the glory of sunshine of the Holy Ghost That Fire Hallelujah nothing can stop you nothing can stop you from getting to that place Hallelujah where you know you belong nobody have to explain to Lily nobody have to carry a little school to find out how to be a Lily that is built into the Lily to press past the muck it is built into a fish to swim it is built into a bird to fly and then it's built into every Son of God to press past the enemy to stand having done all to stand stand and fight Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah sometimes children are born of parents I think scientists say it at 10 percent of the attributes of a child is almost innate it's built in and sometimes they'll have little children that are born and they don't know their parents but I have a certain kind of way that they behave I'm trying to say that part of that is actually given from the parents and sometimes a child may be born in a parent home and but they never knew their parents and when they reunite they begin to realize that they have like characteristics that they have like attributes that their eyes look a little bit like Daddy that their nose look a little bit like Daddy like their mouth look a little bit like their biological father or mother isn't that right each child carries the attribute of the parent that that brought them forth in the first place isn't that right scientists even goes past to say that some boys cross their legs like their father does some boys walk a little bit like their father does some boys Express themselves they never been with their father some of them may not know their father by Adam from Adam but they but just by their reuniting after all those long years sometimes children were adopted and sent away and they began to search for their real father come back to their real home to find out who their biological father was or who the biological mother was in the reunites and they begin to realize that they have similar attributes that they have similar things about them that they have similar books that they like to read they have similar music that they like to listen to and just like natural parents could put natural attributes in a natural son or daughter so that God puts Supernatural attributes Supernatural likenesses in his sons and daughters you are just like your father tonight you walk a little bit like him you talk a little bit like him some of you who may have never never met him or Hallelujah but you have some of his attributes tonight there's something inside of you tonight that has the ability to hear from God to connect back to your father Hallelujah Hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a many men 11 tonight oh my praise God is it here Hallelujah he said it's God's word isn't that right and he said the word of God continually goes on isn't that right Hallelujah amen isn't that right he said I'm tall this is from the spoken with real estate again says I'm told and if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it he said that a man's voice he said my voice that I speak today this is a prophet he said my voice that I speak today he said ten thousand years from now could still be picked up in the air like dropping a petal in the middle of a pond and the teeny little waves after they fail to be seen by the the eye by the naked eye continue on till it hits the bank and the airwaves of our voices he said continually travels around and around the world he said therefore then all voice what we say he said what we say will be our judgment Our Testimony would rise against us he said our own voices will echo in all heirs at the Judgment power of God when his great instrument catches every voice that's been spoke every word that has been muttered are you following me this evening so he says that the world is speaking right now even though you fail to hear them after a while he said they're still traveling throughout the Earth those waves are still bouncing around bouncing around in the Supernatural atmosphere he said and now there's only one way to stop that voice that is wrong he said that's repent he said that's repent God Alone can stop it he said if it he said if it doesn't it goes on and meets you up in the eternity oh is this a gospel he said therefore God being perfect and his voice Eternal his own voice would have to catch up with it therefore he must be perfect in every decision for once he says something it has to go all the way and come right back to the judgment can we see him as somebody so if a natural man's voice can speak something in a natural atmosphere and it will go on like that and go on and go on the only thing that could stop that is to repent is the blood of Jesus Christ the power of God to save that voice from meeting up for you in judgment some of the wrong things you said some of the things you said in your anger some of the things you said in your haste those words already went out the only thing to stop that the Bible the prophet said is to repent to make it wretch and the blood of God will go after that voice that's been spoken in the atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm kept and keep that thing from condemning you in the Judgment isn't that right and if a man's voice spoken in a natural has so much power then what about the voice of God when spoken in the Supernatural atmosphere oh somebody preached back to me when God speaks something it is not just for that time but it goes on forever and forever and forever when God spoke to Abraham and said thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy that word is over every Seed of Abraham somebody preached back to me therefore when Jesus died and reconnected on natural seed to that spiritual Seed of Abraham then that makes you chosen of the light then that makes you chosen of God that makes you the Royal Seed of Abraham to The Fellowship of Jesus Christ then that prophecy is over you tonight that every seed shall possess the king of his enemy oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah somebody praise God somebody praise God somebody praise God so if you recognize tonight that there's a power over your seed that same word seed that is in your heart from before the beginning before there was a moon before there was a star before there was the atom or molecule God put a word seed in your heart then there's certain promises that are hanging over that seed and in its time and in its season that seed must come to life it's got to comfort it's got to produce whatever a life of the sea is Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah many many men please Hallelujah see it's a seed you lay a seat down it doesn't look like much but in that seat is a potential to bring forth and produce something people might laugh at it people might call it names but that doesn't change the nature of the sea that doesn't change the power that is in the seed sometimes the seed is just in the wrong environment sometimes the seed is laying on a table somewhere sometimes the seed is laying on on a in a bedroom somewhere or or holiday is that right in the wrong environment sometimes that seed might be in a bar room sometimes that seed might be in effect sometimes I see it might be in a pub sometime that seed might be somewhere smoking weed something that seed might be somewhere snorting cocaine but that seed is just in the wrong environment but you take that seed and you put that seed in the right environment you watch if God don't do something because as long as it is in the right environment and as long as lights strike the seed inside of the soul of the Son of God life begins to pip out life begins to break out Hallelujah something begins to awaken inside of your heart inside of your soul oh Hallelujah you recognize you are not always what you thought you were but there's more to you than meets the eye oh Hallelujah hallelujah's more to you than you thought you was you thought you were the sinner only to find out that you are Son of God you thought you were messed up only to find out that you always was you thought you was always gonna be this or Hallelujah of a born slave to Satan only to find out that the blood of Jesus Christ was released on calvary's Cross to make you a son and daughter of God to give you Fellowship to give you access rights to the throne of court Hallelujah Hallelujah oh d11 tonight many many many men Hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus glory to God glory to God glory to God amen Hallelujah oh dear loving tonight Hallelujah he said many times man said well no man wrote this Bible he said no this is I'm from God's power to transform he said no the Bible says itself that God wrote the Bible said it is the word of God and it can never fail somebody Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never fail it cannot fail he said I'm being God because it is part of him and he said then you being a son and daughter he said you are a part of it and that makes you a part of him he said so that's why we come to Fellowship together where around the word of God why because you are part of it and it is a part of you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah a many many men praise God oh Hallelujah many men all right let me skip on down here now let me see this here now Hallelujah okay he said uh he said the first man is the image of God which is Spirit syndrome 4 says God is a spirit indeed I worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth he said but God is a spirit see and the first man he created was Spirit man and he was in the image and likeness of God who was the first man Spirit man before there was flesh man before there was failure before there was a mistake before there was the sin that committed in the garden the first man was the spirit man he was a perfect image of man isn't that right perfect likeness of God God said let us create man in our image and in our likeness and let that man have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth God gave that first man dominion and Power we are coming back to that original state and condition of spirit man oh Hallelujah before it was flesh before there was mistakes before there was failures coming back to that Spirit man condition oh Hollow coming back to fellowship with God like in the Garden of Eden where God could come down in the cool of the evening and have communion with God we are coming back to that condition oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said and then he put this man in flesh and then man fell so then said God came down and become in the image of man so that he might redeem that Fallen man he said that's the real gospel story to my opinion he said now in 6 000 years listen to this no this is amen he planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word it shall be this way this tree shall be this shall be he said everything was perfect he said it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of God had spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak if it was a power it was to bring forth a palm because the great Creator had just sent forth his word amen listen to this and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed I'll say it again he said the word see was there before the real seed was ever formed and he said and the word form the seed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah that's why Mary couldn't be anybody else but Mary because a word was already spoken a virgin shall conceive 400 years it took but the world was circling the world was about to create the seed of the promise the seed that was about to bring forth the miracle that was Christ that word circle circle circle looking for somebody to produce the miracle looking for a certain woman looking for a certain elect lady looking for a certain elect somebody to fulfill the word for that hour and when that word found Mary Mary had no choice but the answer to the word that was spoken by Isaiah 400 years ago didn't matter how long it was but God's word was already spoken and it had to come to pass and I don't care what condition you are in tonight's God's word has already been spoken God's word has already pronounced over your life and whatever's supposed to happen has to happen and cannot happen any other way you are not by accident come on now you are not by chance come on now your life is for a purpose and it will achieve God's purpose he said my word cannot return for it but it shall accomplish it shall accomplish the purpose I have sent forth for it to accomplish oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil says you're Mystic the devil says you're failure but he's a liar tonight because there's a purpose inside of you the devil says you won't make it the devil says you won't overcome the devil try to take your children away but he never oh Holly can't take away what God has put inside my soul what God has put inside my heart he can't touch that he can mess with your mind he can mess with your spirits but he cannot mess with that Holy thing in your heart that thing that God gave you before the foundation of the world oh hallelujah hallelujah oh before you ever made a mistake before you ever made a failure before you ever committed adultery before you ever committed fornication before you ever fell in sin he put us very wet and brown of Grace he slipped a wedding band of Grace on your finger you woke up with it you didn't even know what it was but it was always there it took a revelation to show you who you are and what this wedding band means foreign God speaks a word it's a seed it's a seed it's not what it should be yet but it's going to be Moses had to go through a process but he was a sea of God's miracle for that time Moses had to go through the Wilderness Moses had to suffer many things Moses Hallelujah to spend 40 years in the desert with snakes and scorpions but Bose's purpose was always coming Moses purpose was always coming to him Moses couldn't run from his purpose Moses couldn't hide from his purpose wherever Moses went the purpose of God was over Moses when Moses was in the desert his purpose was over him when Moses was in Egypt God's purpose was over him I don't care where you go tonight I don't care Where Your Children Are Tonight the purpose of God is over each one that is on the name of the Lamb's Book of Life and if your name is on that book you are going to be delivered if your name is on that book you are going to be redeemed oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody preach back to me somebody preached back to me that's why Jesus died Jesus didn't die just to save The Sinner but he came for the names I was on the book he said because they are mine they are written within my heart they are craved in the palm of my hand God said I can't forget them God said when he remembers his promise he made to Israel he had to send Moses and when God talked about you in 2015 he said I have to send Jesus to make a way for my son to make a way for my daughter to come into the presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ whoa oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah and when he went on Calvary he took every stripe for you and me he began to scream his blood was tripping his body was tracked up called gotha's Hill but he had you on his mind he was on his heart he was in his oil and his thinking in his program he said I died for them I paid a price for them I'll do it for them he went all the way for you won't you go all the way for God tonight oh some of you too selfish we think too much of ourselves or how can we be selfish when our blood price was paid for your life for my

no no you gotta stop this Worship You Gotta stop them from praising we trying to have a feast we trying to do something holy but these people are acting unseemingly Jesus said if I stop these people from worshiping he said the Rocks would cry out Hallelujah I wonder if you totally understand that Jesus said that the Rocks would begin to cry out if they didn't identify who he was if they didn't give God praise and honor and worthy worthy worthy unto the Lamb of God sent for the world if they didn't give God praise the very walks would begin to cry out the prophet said all nature knew who he was the Pharisees that know him the Sadducees couldn't know him on Earth they were black but it took nature to identify who he was on that cross and when he died the Earth went into a earthquake the mountain shook the wind began to sweep the mountains kept like Rams the sun hit his face nature began to have a Revival because they knew who he was all nature was grown and untravelen waiting for the Son of God to comfort oh same and somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah all right oh give him praise tonight give God a shot that's why we're not seeing Jesus steps into your being steps into your flesh all hell will have to give way to the name of Jesus because Jesus will be inside your soul inside your spirits inside your body operating you when you talk LPG is a socket when you walk it'll be Jesus walking oh Hallelujah the devil is mad and upset tonight because you're beginning to recognize that you are more than a batched for Satan that you are more than a match for the enemy oh Hallelujah if he is with us then we shall be able to drive out the enemy God is force who can stand against us to overcome death to overcome hell to overcome the grave oh Hallelujah I want that power when they send Jesus comes into your heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will overcome every trial every test the enemy put in your way because the same conqueror will be in you oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah his voice the voice of God speaking cannot return boy listen if God if Jesus crave of Lazarus and he spoke a word he said Lazarus come port Lazarus had no choice Lazarus could have been already in Paradise waiting on the master to come back after he had died but that wasn't God's purpose for Lazarus after that it was four days the Lazarus had already been dead God looked at his watch and says he's sleeping but it's time to go wake him oh Hallelujah and the voice of God went down to the graveyard and said where have you laid him oh I'll roll away the stone roll away the unbelief we'll always sit and roll away the oppression roll away the depression roll away the enemy Insider here tonight lift up your hands give God praise and roll away the snow foreign you can't do that line now I'm sleeping no it takes her effort you gotta put some pressure into it you gotta put some elbow grease you're gonna lean against that big old problem you're gonna lean against that big old situation I said it's coming down tonight or all the soup curtains of self-will all the stones that are in your life has to be rolled away Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah that stone bear witness that there was a God in Israel they move the way that stone that stone taught that he would be there all the time but when that stone roll away he recognized that there was another power coming that stone had to give way to the name of Jesus and Jesus said Lazarus comfort if Jesus didn't say Lazarus if Jesus didn't specify that voice if he didn't specify the power of the life behind that voice every grave would have had to answer the call of Jesus when he calls oh hallelujah hallelujah brother that stone bear witness that there was a God in Israel no wonder when the Pharisees said you gotta stop this worship he said if they don't praise me if they don't worship me if they don't shout the stones the very rocks are gonna cry out because they know who I am Hallelujah Jesus on the cross bleeding bloody die the Bible said he gave up the goofs same life that was in this Christ that perform Miracles that heal the sick that raised the Dead when he bowed his head and said it was finished what lay on that cross was that's a shell what Leanna cross was just an empty body but the Bible said he gave up the ghost of spirit a presence left that Earthly party is that that same presence that you feel here tonight that same presence that left that party that hung on the cross the Bible said oh the the veil of the tent the veil of the temple was renting to signifying at the same August being of course the 12th behind past your skins in the days of Israel when they were tuning into the Wilderness no man could go in and see it no man could feel that presence save for Aaron the priests but because Jesus died on the cross and because his blood shed on the earth Sanctified the Earth and gave us access rights to the throne of God the very spirits that dwelt Beyond Badger skins was now loose among the people the same presence of God the same Spirit the same anointing the same fire the same pill on fire that dwelt in a tense was not accessible to the people Hallelujah foreign for three and a half years Jesus is dropping off wood planted word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen if you if don't believe I can all things will be made possible ask anything in my name it shall be given unto you all these signs shall follow them not believe in my name Nisha Castle Devils speaker the cast of devils isn't that right he's a sick raise the dead open your eyes are blind isn't that right he was speaking words to them knowing that this watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost was to come back upon the people and take that same planted world and make it living make it moving make it visible among the people because God cannot anoint anything outside of his word he's got to anoint the word for That season the word for an hour so he gave the disciples the word even though they didn't understand because he knew that that water in spirit would come upon the seed world that was being sown in their hearts Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why you have to receive the Holy Ghost Because unless a corner we'd fall into the ground and die it's a bad alone God in the beginning was alone with his thoughts he was alone with his thinking alone with his own program of knowing what he wanted to accomplish but it come to a point when he was tired of being alone God was fed up for being alone by himself so this great Supernatural Spirit Elohim created logos word oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right created heaven and earth and everything and then said let us make man in our image and all likeness why because he wanted to have fellowship with his thoughts he wanted to have fellowship with his attributes he wanted to speak to his attributes and he wanted his attributes to talk back to him he wanted somebody to have a conversation with you Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah and even when he created man he said it's not good for man to be alone and make him a help meet oh Hallelujah I'll take a rip from his side oh Hallelujah I create woman so that he can have fellowship with somebody it's not good for man to be alone isn't that right laying by itself alone God does not desire that kind of a thing what God desires is for your life it's for that seed to bring forth fruits to bring forth something to bring forth Hallelujah to show evidence to show fruitfulness to show visible life of God in you to be an expression of whatever the seed is it's not good for the sea to just remain a seed no no no no God wants to save fruit God wants to see life God wants us something to show for rich oh hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we too lazy sometimes you just lay around and say God give us a seed oh and we have a seed but that seed is no good unless it goes into the ground and die that seed is no good or if it's just a bite alone but when that sea go to die when that seed go to Rotten when that sea go to producing something a literal life begins to come out of that scene somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah oh man let me hurry up here every seed that is spoken there's a power inside power inside of it to transform itself into whatever the seed is supposed to be oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right God alone has the power to transform isn't that right Hallelujah you could try to conform somebody you could try to conform somebody tell them conform to this law Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that you could conform to it isn't that right I tried to do it the best you can but that's not transformation isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah if somebody goes to prison the idea of a prison is to try to reform them so that they can get back into society so that they can fit in and perform a functional role in society that's called Reformation but that's not what we're talking about tonight what we are talking about is transformation The Prophet said it says the change it's to change your state from whatever you're in to another state entirely it is a change from one form to another it is a transformation you're not what you started out as but slowly bit by as you get closer to the headstone you begin to become a super race you begin to come by super church as you near The Headstone as you get greater as you get in contact with God as you get closer and closer into the presence of God suddenly begins to happen inside of you God begins to transform who you was into who you're supposed to be then you get a little bit of Faith then you get a little bit of pressure then you get a little bit of knowledge a little bit of temperance what is begin to happen you will begin to transform from the inside out not from the outside in oh come on now come on now you know what I'm talking about do you know what I'm talking about tonight there's some people will tell you that some Churches I think they preach and they say God loves you as you are they'll tell you stay as you are God loves you just as you are but that is not God's entire purpose that is not God's entire program hallelujah hallelujah yes God loves you as you are but he wants you to change Hallelujah he calls you out of something to put you into something that is redemption calling out of and going into isn't that right many people love the calling out part that's wonderful that's glorious come on shouting and dancing but the going into part that's the process that's the part that people don't like that's the part that hurts a little bit not the part that pains a little bit but it is necessary in order for you to become what God wants you to become you have to be willing to change you have to be willing to be led of God you say Lord You Are The Potter and I am the player you have to be willing to put yourself in God's hands and let him break you and let it melt you and let them mold you and let them shape you I'll let him form you into what he wants you to be outside of that you're just playing Church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right well let me read a second and every everything under control okay he said no remember to bring he said when he put the seed in the Earth he said the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was see his transforming power he said now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said to be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be he said it had to be that way because he had made it that way and he made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it would have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there its Channel just exactly right isn't that right it's not mixed with any interpretation it's not mixed with any funny thought it's not mixed with any funny idea isn't that right but it's exactly what his word said it would be in the line of his word isn't that right he said it cannot move from there it's China just exactly he said so with everything in his Trust of his own son that would be that way he said it's all good okay and he said each one he said God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds had power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be he said that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said and God has never changed this is just the same way today as he was then God is determined to do something he said the prophet said he will do it nothing is going to stop it he will do it hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh my so every seed has transforming power in itself to transform itself into what it's supposed to be isn't that right and for every age there were seeds that come forth to that age in Luther's day Luther was sent to a group of seeds that were to receive that message of justification they couldn't receive any other message and no other message could give them what they needed to perform for that day and that hour isn't that right they were the siege of justification for that hour and when they heard the message of Luther something inside of them stepped out and was identified with that message and they produced justification it's not right in Wesley's day there were seeds there to produce sanctification and they had a Revival it's not right in the age of the Pentecostal there were seeds there to bring back the Reformation of the gifts to Restoration of the gifts to the church oh Hallelujah isn't all right talking in tongues and healing a sick raise and a dead and casting out devils and there was a sea inside of them to do just what they had to do it's not right well the Prophet come at the end of the age to prophesy of another age to come he prophesied up a bright age he prophesied another people another people in the land who under their messenger would be the final voice to the final age so think it not strange tonight because no man could come unless the father draw him so you couldn't be anywhere else to match you couldn't hear any other message tonight you had to hear write what you are hearing tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah you have to come to this message you had to come to this inspiration you had to hear what you are hearing because inside of you locked up inside of you is a seed of God's potential to produce God's Perfection for this hour and for this season Hallelujah oh Amen Let me hear a piano I think I'll be on my time Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah oh my praise God thank you Jesus praise God hallelujah amen you see the hardest thing to do I've realized is the right thing the right thing is always seems to be the hardest thing to do isn't that right it was easy to heal the sick because these Aries are dead and cast out Devils for Jesus that was easy one time some people came and they're sick their friend was sick isn't that right lay him on a cut they said we love our friend and we're going to break up the roof and let him down through the roof because he has need to see Jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the kind of friends to have the kind that will bring you to church they kind of bring you into the presence of God because they know God is the only one who can solve your problems they know God is the only one that can solve your situation when the situation is beyond what you can do that's when we bring it to God that's when we bring it to the Master's Hand he is able to transform he is able to recreate isn't all right hallelujah hallelujah it can change the situation and here was this friend that was being laid down through the roof while Jesus is preaching and when Jesus sees this lame man as lay before him the disciples begin to whisper among themselves Jesus said which one is easier he said my sins be take away this man's sins or forgive this man since or to tell him to pick up your bed and walk he said I could do both he said I sins be forgiven me he said pick up your pad and walk that man begin to catch all the Fate because you can't just pick up your bed and walk from a paralysis condition just like that no no no it takes fate to do what he did he began to move a little bit at the word of Jesus he began to move a little bit and that's what I needed to do this evening you just need to move a little bit if your hand could move then your arm could move and if you get the arm to move in then your body could move and if he could twist a little bit if he could jump a little bit if he could make it to put your feet into action then God began to do something for you tonight then God could begin to restore you tonight thank God they begin to heal you tonight of every Broken Heart of every broken part and of every broken life tonight Glory stuff wonderful easiest thing sometimes always you know good things it's good to do good things nice it's not right hallelujah hallelujah but the hardest thing is always the right thing to do amen it's not right I'm beginning to close amen Hallelujah he said which one is easy see thy sins be forgiven thee or pick up people and walk he said I can do both he said but at the Garden of Gethsemane he cried out said Lord if it is possible let this cup pass for me death was upon him the price was upon him he was about to pay the ultimate price for the world it was a hard thing to do but it was necessary death is hard but it is necessary isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah when Elisha was following Elijah he said Taria preethi said no I'm following you he followed from Bethel followed from gilga he followed to the school of the prophets but when he got to Jordan Hallelujah and Elijah said what do you want Elijah said I pray thee a double portion of that Spirit he said you ask a hard thing but nevertheless if you see me go if you stay with the word if you come with me across Jordan across the river of death across the Waters of Separation if you see it through to the end if you're willing to go all the way with God hallelujah if you're willing to go all the way if you're willing to die out to yourself if you're willing to go through the process of death to die to your thinking to die to your ways to die to what you think and what you want to die to what you feel to die to what this one say to die to what that one said if you're willing to go through this process with me I'll make it worth your while oh hallelujah hallelujah you're going to get what you asked for you can have whatever you ask for this was Elijah's promise if he was willing to go the distance if he was willing to go the mile if he was willing to go the journey he could have whatever he asked for and tonight God is asking oh Hallelujah thing tonight death is a hard thing death of a corner which people don't like to preach death people don't like to talk about death but death is necessary Paul said I died daily or hallelujah it's not good enough for you to say you have a word see but you gotta commit that word seed to the ground and die that word seed has got to go through a dying through a process of death you got to be stripped of yourself you got to forgive the unforgivable you got to love the unlovable even when you're right and when the person is wrong you have to take wrong and tired and say not by Will Lord but thy will be done it's not right God is asking for a death tonight a death of a corner wheat unless a corner we'd fall into the ground and die it abide alone but when it's high oh when it died when I go through you can play something softly when it go through the process of death it begins to bring forth much fruit oh hallelujah hallelujah it begins to bring forth much fruit God wants much food from you God just want a little bit of fruit no no no he wants you to bring forth 64. he wants you to bring forth 84. he wants you to bring forth 104 but the only way you're gonna come through Allah is you prepare to die Samson when you come to the end of his Road he said little boy lead me to the pillars he said I want to die with my Philistines and I believe that's the attitude that we have to come to after all the signs and wonders after all the Miracles after all Hallelujah that we've seen and we have heard it's gonna take a death oh hallelujah hallelujah for our lives to bring forth kind of fruits that God is requiring of us in this hour in this time and in this season unless a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it apart alone but when it died it bringeth forth much fruit hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah can we say man can we say man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah there's a desire of God in you for something from God God put that to his iron in put something Softly God put that desire inside of your soul Hallelujah to want God to Stills for God to seek God's presence and he's made a way for you tonight we are gathered on this Good Friday evening because somebody died to pay the price for all of us that we could come into the presence of God you couldn't do it I couldn't do it but the lamb did it he paid the price that you could come into His presence oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh and in the teeth of the Old Testament it was death to be outside of the presence of God but in this hour it is death to stay outside oh well it's debt to be outside of God's presence God wants to bring you into a life everlasting God wants to bring you into a life a life of Joy a life of Peace a life and service to God God wants you to be a prisoner for him Paul said I a prison of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah Paul was all locked up Paul was all tied up Paul's Soul was ransom for God Paul's soul is locked up in God oh hallelujah hallelujah and that's the way want to be tonight I'm not satisfied just to be a Christian and just come to church and just to hear the word but I want my life to bring forth fruits Jesus said I have ordained you and I have great elected you I have called you that you should bring forth fruits and that your fruit should remain and that your fruit should remain oh same and somebody same and somebody shame and somebody you've gotta want change you've got to want God to do something for
