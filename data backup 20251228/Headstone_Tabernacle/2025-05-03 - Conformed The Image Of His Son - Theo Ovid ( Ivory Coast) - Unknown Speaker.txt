If you have your Bibles I like you to turn to Romans chapter 8. Romans want to read 28-33. I want to read Romans chapter 4 verse 20 to 25 read in Romans chapter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he had also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not but him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justify and Romans uh uh four reading from verse 20. This is speaking about Abraham. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God. And being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform. No, it was not written for his sake alone, but was imputed to him. But for us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification. And let's just read one more verse there. Verse chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us pray once more. Heavenly Father, we have read your word and I pray the fire of your presence will come into your word and breathe life to your people in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. [Applause] So have a title this morning. Conform to the image of his son. conform to the image of his son. I have a subject predestinated to be molded. subject predestinated to be molded and have inspiration raised again for our justification. Jesus Christ, this morning resurrection morning, he was raised up for our justification. Praise the name of the Lord. Now in the amplified Romans 8:29, for those he forneew or whom he was aware and loved beforehand, he also destined from the beginning to be molded into the image of his son and share his inward likeness. that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. And those he for ordained, he also called. And those whom he called, he also justified, which is to be acquitted, made righteous, and put in right standing with God. So to be justified is like God you are not guilty. You are free from the people. Your case vodka is dismissed. You are free. The devil wanted to keep you. But Jesus pay the price that you can be justified. [Applause] Glory. So therefore you may be seated. to the present suffering of this time is not worthy to be compared to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. Praise God. You may be seated. We said last night, Adam, a perfect man, a man spoken into existence, he fell. But God, he's doing something different. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are going to be born again by the word and by the spirit and you're going to grow. You're going to press. You're going to overcome. You're going to stand. You're going to walk like a ser. You're going to talk like a [Applause] ser now to be conformed to confirm. Listen, the word conform means to comply with rules, to be similar to be the same something. To do what other people do, to be obedient, to be compliant, to act in harmony, to conform to rules, So if you conform, you behave in a way that is expected of you to behave. Glory to God. If you conform, you behave in a way that you are expected or supposed to be. You may be seated. When when when Cain and Abel was given the opportunity to worship, Abel by faith offer up a lamb cut the truth. The blood splash and fire fell. God was pleased because Abel by faith. Cain, he offer fruits and flowers. Now God told Cain, "If you do like your brother, if you preach like your brother, if you talk like your brother, if you walk like your brother, I will bless you. I will bless you." Did you get that? What? What an easy thing. In other words, God tell king, you don't even need a revelation. Just do what your brother do and I will bless you. But you know what? Cain couldn't conform. Cain couldn't adjust. Cain wasn't flexible to see that if God blesses this man. There is something about why this man is blessed and what God bless. No man can kill. [Applause] [Music] 2 Timothy 3 verse 16 it says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished, thoroughly furnished, unto all good works. In the amplified, every scripture is God [Music] breathed, is given by inspiration. Scripture has the breath of God on it and is profitable for reproof for conviction of sin, for correction of error, for discipline and obedience. Listen, and for training in righteousness, in holy living. Here we go. in conformity to God's will in thought, purpose and action. So our lives are to be conformed to God's will in thought, in purpose and in action. We have to think like God, speak like God, walk like God, live like God. You will be seated. Let's go. 2 million people under a prophet message Moses came out of Egypt. Out of two million, just two came out. The same God. that brought them out. Killed them. Did you get that? They were under Moses message. They were under Moses shout message to come out of Egypt. And the same God you that brought them out. There's a he killed them. There's a king. Don't play with God. This message is real. This is the same God that Abraham. This is the same God that Moses. This is the same God that opened the Red Sea. The same God would heal you, deliver you, free you, deliver you the same God. He's the same yesterday. Today all your failure and 10 [Applause] month each day ends a generation. Each day you shak each day to a generation. Each day ends a 40-year period for somebody and each day so many is sealed away in the kingdom. You mean it must be sealed? Sealed. Set eight seals set. Seven seals set forth. Seven spirits set free. Seven thunders. Seven voices. Seven virtues. You have to be sealed with God. You by the Holy Ghost. Not by might. Not by power, but by my spirit. [Applause] Each day so many are sealed away in the kingdom. One day, the last day will arrive while we in our right mind where the Holy Spirit has identified himself. Don't you stop. Don't rest day and night until that quickening power has brought you from the things of the world into the kingdom of God. And you know that you truly are brought into the kingdom of God and quickened by the spirit. How happy with tears of joy. We should be on our knees day and night thanking God for what he has done. You are going to be sealed. You are going to be filled. God going to baptize you. The Holy Ghost fire. [Applause] I know. [Applause] I know. That this is not preached much in the message. They just want you to believe. But when John when they asked John, "Are you the Messiah?" He said no I am not he the one who was coming he going to baptize you fire the John said I baptize in water the one that is coming the one that is coming there is someone coming they are coming this morning it's coming today that one is here he is Yeah. Yes. He going to baptize you baptism. Take the Holy Ghost with fire [Applause] and You may be seated now. There's a natural church, a natural church. Church natural and there's a church spiritual. There's a church spiritual and there's a church intellectual. The intellectual. They're only talking word word. But there's a church spiritual. They are born of the spirit. They walk in the spirit. A connection to the spirit. That connection is that horizontal connection man to man. That connection connection is vertical. A vertical God and me. God and you. That's how it's coming. Come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, brother Bam says, "We find out when these natural and spiritual churches when they come together, there's always a clash and there's a clash because there is jealousy and jealousy causes kind of comparisons. [Music] How do you think Satan is feeling this morning? This resurrection morning on Friday night he is dead. Satan wipe his brow. He said my problems are over. Saturday night. Silence. Nothing moving. Nothing moving. But Easter morning, he is not dead. He is raised. Woo! Hallelujah. [Music] So brother says when the other side cannot get the spiritual results they have to take it by political power to upset the people's minds to draw disciples after themselves. Oh give the Lord some praises. And that's what we said last night. God didn't argue with the darkness. God didn't debate with the darkness. God didn't question the darkness. He just said, "Let there be light. You don't have to argue with anyone. You are the light. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Listen, you don't take a light and hide it. You don't take a light and cover it up. You put the light where everybody could see it. God will take you. So brother, Abel and Faith, Abel and Abel and Cain, there was a clash. Clash. Abraham and Lot. Lot. There was a clash. Moses and Satan and Kora. There was a clash. When the carnal and the spiritual meet, there is a clash. Clash. When Judas and Jesus meet, there was a clash. Oh, glory to God. We are ready. We are ready for that clash. the Lord shout. We are ready. We are ready for that cash. Oh, glory to God. This message is real. Ivory coir. This message will live in you. In you in you. You may be saying now Esau was a very nice brother. Esau had good works. But Jacob. He wanted a birthright. He wanted the Holy Ghost. He wanted a revival. He wanted a breakthrough. And God recognized Jacob as spiritual. Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham. It always cause the natural to hate the spiritual. The spiritual can't hate because hate is not part of the spiritual. So what do they do? They try to destroy the influence. They try to destroy everything because it is nothing but jealousy. It started in Cain and prove it was jealousy. It's the same today when the natural and the spiritual meat because jealousy comes from Satan jealousy come from Satan. Satan was jealous of Michael and Satan tried to perform a coup and overthrow in heaven. But there was a war in heaven. War in heaven. Michael fought. Dragon fought and he was kicked out. He fell to the earth. But the earth belongs to us. [Applause] In the beginning, there was no plan of God for Satan to rule on the earth. In the beginning, what God did, he saw it was good and the devil was not in part of it. God put his son in the garden to rule the earth. We are coming back. We are coming back. Sons of God are coming back. We shall rain on you. We shall rain on you. We are coming back. We're going to conquer sickness. Conquer cancer. Conquer diabetes. Conquer disease. The blind could not see. The crippling on the walk. Sons of God are coming back. [Applause] Listen, we are only here in this condition because of Adam and Eve. Let me blow your mind. What said it was not your fault. It was not your fault. You were supposed to be born at the spoken word. Adam. Adam. was to speak for you. If Adam did not fall, let me say that again. If Adam did not fall, you was going to be on the earth, perfect man dominion. [Applause] So because Adam fell, we came through sex. That's how sex was permitted. What Brandon said, sex wasn't the perfect will. Sex was the permissive will because at fall, let us go to the elected. This virtuous bride, the bride is always part of the bridegroom. So the bride will not be a denomination. It will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ. Not the word taught but the word walked. In other words, This word, the word was invisible until it become flesh. [Applause] The scribe and Pharisees, they had Moses books and tapes. They never saw never saw a devil cast out. Never saw the dead raised. Never saw a sick being healed. And one day they called somebody to read the scripture and Jesus raised his hands. Amen. Jesus say I am ready for years. Jesus going to service nothing. He is not talking. But this service he raised his hands. He came to the temple. He took the book. He found where it is written. The spirit is upon me. Hold it. Holy, holy. They thought he was reading a text. They couldn't see the spirit that was upon him. He wasn't talking text. He was talking reality. He wasn't talking text. Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good tidings to open the eyes of the plan to set at liberty them that are bound. And he closed the book. And then Jesus, he sat down. And when he sat down, he said, "This day, the scripture is fulfilled in your ears. [Applause] This is that Isaiah spoke up. And one day we will say this is that the prophet William spake. [Applause] So your natural life because it was associated with man and woman together in a sexual affair. That association brought on sin and death. So your nature is associated with death. I'm still reading. Your first husband had rule over you because of your nature. By your natural birth, naturally, you love the world because you are the world and you are part of the world. God don't condemn you for sinning because you are a sinner. You are nature to sin. What God condemn you for is when he makes a way for you to come out of your sin and you turn that down. God knows we are flesh. God knows what's in this flesh. But she make a way that we could be directed. That we could be led by the spirit. The spirit is here. The spirit will anoint the inner man. The spirit will anoint inside of you. And what's inside of you? prepare his flesh in subjection to what's inside of you. Give the Lord a praise. So your first husband is this natural life. He said you have to die to that first husband. You say, "I will divorce him and hang him." You put your first husband in the closet. So when you're ready, you pull him out. You want to move on, but you have your ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend at the side somewhere. No. No. That's not allowed. You have to die. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Brother Brandham, the nature of this world has to die. Your name of your first nature was put in a book of life and all your deeds was wrote in it. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book. It is called the book of life. Isn't that right? But then your name has been transferred into the new book, the lamb's book. And when your name is transferred, all your sins is put in the sea of his forgetfulness, not your forgetfulness, his forgetfulness. And when he drop your sins in that sea, he don't remember. He can't remember. Hallelujah. Brother, your name is now in the new book. He said you God put it your sins in the sea of forgetfulness. You stand perfectly before God. [Applause] Brother, brother, I don't feel perfect. I don't see myself perfect. That is you. That has to do with God. That's you. That is your feeling. That's not God feeling wrecked for you. What God is feeling. [Applause] Your name is now in the new book. Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. The lamb has redeemed. You are a new bride. Remember [Applause] the woman at the well. You could understand what really take place there. Her name is in the book. She doesn't know it. Jesus is the book. [Applause] Jesus is the book with flesh on it. So when he begin to speak to that woman and told her, "Go call your husband," she said, "I have none." He said, "You had five." I said, "One you're living with is not yours." Note Jesus didn't say so much. But how you do that? How long you doing that? When did you do that? Jesus to show you how that woman was free on the inside. It wasn't an outside thing. It got a revelation that she ran. When you get revelation, Revelation is not water. Revelation is wine and wine of stimulation of revelation. When that woman Jesus finished with that woman, she ran Come see a man. Come see a man. Come see a man. And some church sister, she say another one, another man. And that woman said with revelation, she said, "No, no, no, no, no. Not them men. There's a perfect man." Oh, glory to God. It is something for God to free you, for God to tell you, neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more. No more. No more. You are free. And Jesus said, not who the church members set free, not who the pastor set free. Jesus said who the son of man get free is free indeed. Oh glory to God. If you are not free get free today this morning you want to be free to worship. Praise God. Hallelujah. [Applause] Brother Brandham, Romans 5:1. Therefore, being justified by faith, look up the word. Here we go. This is deep. The word don't mean [Music] forgiven. Justify don't mean you are forgiven. For instance, If you heard I got drunk and done some evil thing and you found you come and say to me, you found out I didn't do them. Then you say, "But Brandham, I forgive you. Forgive me. I didn't do it in the first place. Now if I do it, I am guilty. You could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty. But yet I am not justified because I actually did it. But the word justified, I don't want you to use your head now. I want to use your heart to believe what is being spoken. The word justify, are you ready? Are you ready? The word justify is though you never done it. Love [Applause] Sh. It is not even regarded. It's in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness. [Music] Listen, it is not even in the memories of God. Now I know many of us ain't get this yet because you are think you are still thinking about yourself. You are still thinking about what you have done. Listen to what justification mean. What was the scripture we read? Who he forneew? He called or who he knew before. He called. He knew you. Therefore, he called you. He knew you before the foundation of the world. [Applause] He didn't come to see how much he was drinking, how much it was smoking, how much it was in adultery, how much it was in fornication. He looked at and see your name and he called you just as you are. Come visit. Visit Now, he did not call you to remain as you are, but he called you to be conformed to have conformed or to be molded into the image of his son. So, let's say it again. Who he called who he call be justified. [Applause] Not forgiven. This is beyond unforgiven. Listen, remember what we preached last night. God had an intent and a desire to bring back his sons. So he had to make a way for us to get back on track. Justification, you can't cancel that. No man could cancel that. Who he found you? He found you me. He called. He called me. He justified. He justify me. Listen. And who he justified? You're already glorified. In between there, in between there is a sanctified work, a process from being justified by faith and you act to your faith, knowledge, emperor, patience, kindness, and the glory. The glory, the glory, father. That day we won as you and I. We won and the glory I had with you. I would share with them that we all maybe in one Brother, the bridegroom bore your shame. The bridegroom took your place. You were predestinated for him to be in his bride. You were deceived by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve. It's no fault of your own by your natural birth. You come after Eve. You are sinner to begin with. You were deceived into it. It ain't your fault. You never did it because that germ that was in you was to be in you before the foundation of the world. God put your name on the lamb's book of life before depression before frustration before your pain. And you can't stand it no more before all of that. He put your name Before the devil tempt you, he put your name before the devil pull you to a side. He put your name before them church folks try to mess your mind. Let me go. Let's go. You was put there by predestination. [Applause] You were for ordained to be a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. And you are only manifested in this day his honor and his [Applause] glory. Brother the bridegroom took your shame and put in a sea of forgetfulness. by the washing of the water, by the word. And then he said this, "You are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning." This is my message to the church. Now, if you are standing on God's word and with God's word, every judge, where are you standing? You are, the pure, virtuous, sinless, bride of the son of the living God. And every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God washed in the blood of Jesus Christ stands as though you never sinned in the first place. That is not the preachers revelation or for pastors the pastor for the fivefold. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Every man, every man, every man under the blood stands perfect, perfect standing. Your state is not perfect yet. You have your ups and downs, your ins and outs. But when God look down, that's my child. That's my child. That is my child. That is my child. God could tell the angels Go to tell the angels, they are coming. They are coming. They are coming. They are coming. They are coming. They are coming. Because there is something inside of you. There's a germ inside of you. There's a seed inside of you. God put that. God put that. And the devil can't take it out. [Applause] Let's go. You may be seated. Brother Brandham, he was talking about Elisha. Elijah was about to leave and he took his mantle and chuck it on a young man. I didn't leave it there. Pull it off. So that young man, he got a taste of the power. I went and hit him. He said, "I am leaving this man. Wherever you go, I'm going. [Applause] Men in the message of that hour tell him know you not your master will be taken from you today he said yes I know it but hold your peace don't try to give me any negative talk I'm going listen to this God usually puts us in the shop and trims us. He didn't alter his robe to fit Elijah. He altered Elisha to fit the robe. He also alters us to fit the robe, not the robe to fit us. Sometimes we want to make the robe fit us but we can't do that. We You have got to be altered yourself for the robe. It is God's robe. He made it perfect. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that is where perfection comes. from ignoring our own holiness, which we have none, and our thoughts, which we ought not to be, but we rest solemnly upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus. Here we go, all these years, as far as we know, he just had one baptism of the robe going over him. [Music] So when Elijah dropped that robe on Elisha, he was baptized, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But listen to this. Watch all these years. As far as we know, he just had one baptism of the robe over him. But through the years, God had molded the man's character into a place after he was called, he would fit the robe and be a servant of the Lord. So God, the robe is perfect, but you have to be cut or shaped or honed or molded to fit in that. Now Jesus was our example and he is the example that we ought to be looking at. Now we find out be seated as we go through life our character molds the image that we are you as you live so is your character it molds you to what you are now you have seen people you just love to be around because of the atmosphere atmosphere that they carry. So their character creates whatever they are. But when God looked upon his lost creation, how he fashioned it and saw it being perverted, his loving character, God had this great plan. for mankind to inhabit the earth and to live in peace and to never die, never to be sick or have a heartache or any worry. That was the desire. Isn't that right? So his loving character, there we go. His loving character molded himself into the person of Jesus Christ. God's own character of love projected himself in the man Christ Jesus. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're coming onto the home church. Now listen to this. Remember, when nobody else could do it, we are invited. [Applause] I just love that. He's not forcing you. An invitation is going out this morning. Listen to this. We are invited to shape our own character to his by his grace. We are invited. Think of it to become characters like his. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence. So when we let his character be in us then we become sons by having the mind of Christ which is his character. And then he said this your mind makes your character. Oh glory to God. Jesus said, "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you." The bride was chosen before the foundation of the world. The choosing of the bride was purpose in himself. The eternal God, he purpose to take a bride of his own choosing. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God, he was the eternal spirit and the bride was already in his mind. She was existing in his thoughts. The unchangeable God. God is unchangeable, in essence and behavior. God is infinite in his ability. He is not now learning or even taking comfort with himself. He cannot act his knowledge. He cannot act his knowledge. Glory to God. That's the thoughts of God are eternal. They are real. They are not. Like a man of a blueprint, like like an architect. You have a picture blueprint and one day going to build a building. He said God thoughts are not like that. God thoughts are real. Yeah. It's already substance substance. Glory to God. So when Jesus said when the word said I knew you before he was in a mother's womb, I knew you that is real. You were in his thinking. You were in his mind. You were in the background of God. Let's go. Adam was form of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God. Then Adam become God's thought expressed. Those eternal thoughts are now being manifested that give eternal quality to the elect. Hallelujah. These elect were not only the eternal thoughts of God which were expressed in flesh in their due season but their same elect. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He identified the elect. as the children of promise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are the children of promise. Royal seeds. Royal seeds royalty of Abraham. your president, the president of Iricos, he don't come out on the streets and just say, "I'm going to travel. I want to buy something by this shop." No. Because of who he is. You have security. You have lights flashing and because of who you are. You have security. You have angelic protection. You have angels watching over you because you are going to be the final voice to the final. [Applause] So the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride literal even though even even though she is feminine in designation she is called the body of Christ. We did not become seed by the rebirth. We were seed. Therefore, we could be reborn. Only the elect can be reborn. Because we were seed in none seed. There is nothing to quicken. but in you. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Musicians, come up, please. Glory. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Let me give you a bomb. Jesus said, "My sheep, hear my voice. And they follow me. You never were a pig." Did you get that? You never were a pig or a dog that turned into sheep. You always was a son. You always was a daughter. I'm finished. Listen to this. Brother Brandon, he was praying. He said, "Lord, confirm it right now. While I'm before your throne, take every one of these people. Take the world out of us. Take me, Lord. While we in your presence, take the world. Ring our hearts. Pull the world away from us. Let us be consecrated Christians. We are before your throne. We are waiting upon thee. Ring my heart, Lord. I see my errors. I I see my mistakes. From this time, I am trying to live the best. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to go consecrated my life. And then he said this, "May there come forth, a revival of the just he pray that the justified will have a revival." He said, "May they come forth, a revival of the just and great power come among the church." It's not too hard to pray that because you promise it. So Jesus Christ, he was raised up for our justification. Now we are free. God bless you. [Applause] to the wall. Take it to the wall. Shout for praise. Hallelujah. Singlelu to the Lord. [Music] Sing hallelu to the Lord. Oh, sing hallelujah. Sing hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the Lord. Hallelujah. Sing God [Music] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
