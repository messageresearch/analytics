morning service we are grateful to be here and we under great expectation for what God will do uh last night I think it was 2 minutes to midnight there was a earthquake in Trinidad 6.2 and you always hear me speak about I don't study much about the hurricane and something and the rains and the storms but earthquake is a bit quite different is the the the Earth shaking right under you and you know like sister Monica Chandler said you cannot argue with God when God begin to work God will work you know TR in for shaken the world is in for shaken you are in for shaken God have a way of uh interrupting our lives to let us know to let us know that he is at work and he want you to come out of your stuff and your thing amen so we are looking forward for a great time this July we don't know how much time we have left where meetings are concerned and so on the world things are changing so so swiftly and um we don't want to just be going chug chug we want to go in the rhythm of the beat of the word that's why you come to church to learn to get more knowledge to get more discernment and Revelation and information that you'll be aware how to prepare yourself so this morning before I start to uh share the word with you I want to share with you the trailer that we have for the upcoming meetings and we're looking forward for what God will do Among Us so this time I'll ask the brothers to put it on for you that we have this true go go ahead he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of [Music] Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the Ed defying of itself in love in his army he presents his Army and the farm of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors of Anza that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers Paul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet beat the enemy with the word of God each one backing one another up with him the chief Captain KN out there in front up here above back behind the enemy that's the Army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his work for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one thrust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded do you imagine Peter James and John going before Sak remember that 120 up there couldn't even sign their own names before Sak see if they if all of their if their reflex was just right and so forth they had a reflex but it wasn't they intellectual conception or scientific research it would through the power of God when it's suck they know nothing to do but act out what the Holy Ghost said to they didn't pay attention to any intellectual what the church said and what the priest said what this said that said they move by the spirit Fearless man usually ministers when they get into the pull pit they begin to think if I speak on a certain certain thing here is a certain member of my church that's a a good pay in this church they'll leave the church and then you go to looking at the flesh again then God can't lead that Minister you've got to say what the spirit says to say then we are led by the spirit of God [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord so all things are ready hallelujah our hearts have to be ready oh praise the name of the Lord so we expect God to do great things among us and we thank God for that amen so you ready for this morning service all right let's all stand as we want to go into the word Hebrews 12 5-11 Proverbs 31-12 and Proverbs 5 11-4 reading verse Hebrews 12 reading from verse 5 and he have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chasten of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked by him for whom the Lord loveth he chasten it and scorge every son whom he receiveth sir if he endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days Chase us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby Proverbs 3 want to read verse 11 and 12 my son despise not the chasten of the Lord neither be wary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he corrected even as a father the son in whom he delighted our last scripture is from Proverbs 5 reading from verse 11 and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed and say how have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproof and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclin mine ear to them that in instructed me I was almost in an evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly bhe heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord any man could read the scriptures but it takes you to come and unfold it our hearts and our Lives May you bless it and interpret our lives in Jesus name we ask it and confirm your word pour your spirit upon your people bring them and into wisdom into Enlightenment into discernment into Revelation and inspiration in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise God thank you Jesus okay so the title of this message I preach on it on Sunday the 26th of May and then all the current just in the area just went out and it stopped suddenly so this is a part two to that the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice this is a part two I didn't get to complet it but I'll try to see if we could complete it this morning and yesterday we had had a real special time uh in the I call it things pertaining to life and godliness was an amazing session and with brother Andrew sharing some things and brother Anthony sharing some things and what what a blessing it was to be dear but Andrew shared about coming out of Egypt and going through the Wilderness and then going into the promised land in Egypt the Believers or the Israelites he had anything at all that's the Egypt stage and in the wilderness he shared that they had just enough man of Fallen every day but God promised them that they will have abundance in the promised land and he was saying being moved from being blessed to become a blessing and I find was just a powerful thing I want you to think about it there are lots of people like to be blessed but how about changing that to become a blessing and to become a blessing you have to be in abundance that you could share that you could help that you could give and he referenced about that Samaritan who helped that man who was wounded priest passing by this one passing by and a Samaritan took him put him in the hotel and paid for his bills and said if there anything more when a PB I'll pay it that is a man that be has become a blessing and that is where God want us to be in a position that we could bless others and when you look at the equal sign eternal life is ready living for others those people who live selfish lives most of the times they are miserable they could be wealthy and miserable they could have big house and miserable new car and miserable but they are miserable because they're not in service but the life of God comes to bring us into true service unto others isn't that something else so then God told them when you come into abundance don't forget me all right that brought you out to Egypt because this is what has happened when God start to bless people they forget him and they believe is their own strength that get them what they get but the Bible said it is God that give you power to get wealth God give your energy God give you mind God give you health God give you strength to get what what you get he said don't forget me when you get and your cup running over don't forget me remember God who brought you out of Egypt remembered him who brought you to the Wilderness what a blessing praise God hallelujah and then brother Anthony came behind and spoke about time an appointed time and god holds time in his hand and he is he knows what is going to happen next and the issue today for a lot of people is anxiety they are anxious about their future anxious about their career anxious about their children anxious about this and anxious about that but when I look at it closer anxiousness is also a reflection of lack of trust in God because he hold time but there is time and there's appointed time you have your time but God have an appointed time for your deliverance for your breakthrough whatever he has for you there's an appointed time oh give the Lord some Praises so you are in time Hallelujah a time to get a breakthrough a time to be healed a time for whatever it is but guess what you have to wait for the appointed time and you have a time also to fulfill the purpose that God raised you for and God called you for we don't have time to waste isn't that right time is a valuable asset and it doesn't come back when you lose it you lose it if you waste yesterday yesterday not coming back it's gone Hallelujah so you cannot just reflect on the past and hold a lot of regrets you have to learn from your faith failures you have to learn from your past if you don't learn from your failures in your past you'll repeat them so it's time to get serious about life about your future even if you're not serious life moves on and according to what you do you would either fail or succeed now if you not how God speak to his children in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I'll multiply thee God want his children succeed because he wants his children to be Witnesses on the earth of his grace of his power of his Blessing don't let the devil tell you God want you to fail God don't want you to fail your enemy and haters and jealous people will want that but not God okay the Lord some Praises do you get me this morning your haters enemies and jealous people going to want that but not [Applause] God God want you to succeed and you must want others to succeed you not you must want others fail that your success might look glorious no no no you want others to succeed and and when the tide raise every boat will rise well give the Lord some Praises did you get that but when the tide raise every boort going to rise we we got to make it we have to make it the world don't like us the world is against us all them demonic activity they against us let's stand for one another let's support one another let's love one another let's encourage one another let's pick up somebody oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah life itself is a struggle we struggle to live we struggle to die we struggle to press we struggle every day of struggle we can't stop now we got to press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus you struggle against tiredness against sickness yes against age against children issue husband issue wife issue money issue marital issue but you have to struggle any all oh give the Lord has praise in the [Applause] house I have news for you God set it up that way what did he set up we bypass a theophany our word body in order to be tempted in order to be tested said that's the only purpose if we were the word we will know all things and we couldn't fall but because we bypass the theophany we are on earth now to give witness to God that we are not part of the bunch of the angels that Rebel in heaven Oh Glory to God we are part of the Victorious spirits that rotated over God that never fell in the beginning Oh Glory to God did you get that this morning do you get that this morning you are part heart of the Victorious spirits that rotated off off of God that never fell in the [Applause] beginning may be [Applause] seated the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice part two pain from discipline leading from G root to righteousness the contrast of Godly discipline versus the consequences of sin all right discipline may be painful in a moment but It ultimately leads to righteousness and peace and I feel that if we get clarity all right as to the vision for our lives and for God we would be prepared to accept the discipline effectively and better that comes our way because it must come this week I believe is test for students the test is based upon what they have learned or what they have supposed to learn but this is crunch time in a few days exam over is either you learn or you didn't learn I he was playing video games or he was disciplined to study and as as Andrew was sharing yesterday God want profit God don't want your break even never see that like way because the man who took the talent and bury it he said you give me one and after so long I have one back for you and the man said the wicked an unprofitable servant you could do better than that oh give the Lord some Praises so God don't want your break even God don't want you to lose he want you to make a prophet and but as you were sharing Prophet doesn't only mean like money because in all labor there's reward if you plant peas you get peas if you don't plant you get grass don't ask me where they're coming from but they coming did you get that you plant corn you get corn you don't plant you get grass weed that you still to cut plant corn plant PE plan something do something do it today do it now get something in your heart this coming service that you are going to change today you want to be a better wife want to be a better husband all right Hebrews 12 just running quickly just just to connect back with what we had before and we'll go on to the other part Hebrews 1211 for the time being no discipline brings Joy all right but seemingly Grievous and painful afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it I remember rebuking one of my sons and it was some hard things I told him he said Daddy a Vex are upset but I'll make you proud now that was golden words he could have say Vex upset and and and done no he didn't say that he said I'll make you proud meaning I will act upon what you told me even though it's painful what you have to share with me because sometimes you who under the receiving as a son or as a daughter it doesn't sound good it doesn't come across good but it is good for you now I will show you where that will apply later on in life when you become a parent when you become a mother or a father and you have your children then you will understand what your parents had to deal with you and if you felt you could get away with stuff when you get your children let them get away with stuff I sure it'll be different then so sometimes your learning is not even for you presently your learning is to take you through life oh give the Lord some Praises your learning takes you through lessons of life that they don't teach you in school they take geography and chemistry and biology and physics but they don't teach you lessons of life that's what they come to church for Jus I come that you might have life and have and live that life abundantly so God want you to have the Abundant Life living oh praise the name of the Lord isn't that right so the pain of regret comes from rejecting wisdom and discipline leading to Serious consequences and remorse ration 3:19 as many as I love still just backtracking I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore repent note is not as many as love him as many as I love so what's the issue with you being rebuked and instructed and corrected why Pastor can't give words why go put words in his mouth to tell you what you need to know not what you need not what you want to know that's politics Minister preaching what people want to hear that is politics so I try to avoid fluff you know fluff is just making up time man understand winging it you talk about this whoever come to you here talking like years ago talk a box of cigarette and preach thinking maxfilter and he said he could watch a fan see fan spinning there all the parts together and he started and even half an hour with a fan and I listen to this thing this is crazy he's not a SP it all together you know if one part missing the F working good and Revelation I that as I tell the ministers I am not here to hear people thoughts ideas and what they think God's in a prophet for me to hear the words of that Prophet I want to hear what is Promised because promise give me a goal promise give me an expectation promise give me a desire that's what promise does I promise you the Holy Ghost I promise you power I promise you healing I promise you Deliverance I promise you the quick power I promise you the anointing to break your y I promise you your family I promise you your loved ones I promise to take you out I promise to bring you in all these are precious Promises by these promises we can be partakers of his divine nature by the promises not by my talk and talk and talk and spending two hours with long talk we not here for that oh give the Lord some Praises you want to hear promise after promise after promise Oh Glory to God when you leave here you must walking out knowing the devil is a liar he don't have a promise but you have oh come on now preach back to [Applause] me listen listen listen even if you're backing inside of here the devil still don't have a promise but you have because God could restore you God could heal you God can bring you out not only you but your family also oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God even if you're lazy the devil don't have a promise you have oh God could bring that Spirit of diligence upon you amen all right so therefore rebuke and chasen to rebuke is to reprove come on now to reprove is to expose with a view to correction all right not just to expose like I say if somebody is naked don't go you they have old clothes and you want to expose them take off that you have close to them tell them take off that only if you have close to them you know you're rebuking and then they they walk naked get close first and then talk your talk oh give the Lord some Praises leave them as they are until you can help them until you could do better if you can't do better shut up keep quiet oh we going to Revival here this morning oh glory to God we going to Revival here this morning exposed with a view of Correction chasing doesn't mean to punish here we go Chason does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject amendment is in mind when you see people getting licked and beaten they want to punish have people like that you know because they get punished they punishing too they say abuse people abuse people because they are abused they abuse we not talking about abuse we talking about discipline amen so hearing is the love of God he desired love a family of his own a family of sons like himself the choosen will be his choosing then those chosen ones born of his Spirit here we go will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk all right come on now so you have a a a piece of equipment or appliance that you bought and you had to set it up had to plug in you can't just put the Box on the say set up th piece of equipment let's say a juicer that you want to juice um like like apples and and and and and carrots and different things to your own health and you have the juicer there and you bring the big box of juicer brand new juicer expensive juicer Rest In The Box said thou set thyself Up in Jesus name amen that box will St on watch you week after week after week and your heal going down down down down down because you're lazy to open the box read the instruction somebody shout an instruction in read the instruction to set it up that you could pour in your Apple and your whatever it is for your own health sake so you waiting on somebody to do that for you lazy let me cast that demon out this morning it out we got to do something come on now my yoke is easy my burden is light it have a yoke it have a burden the devil own heavy come on now we got to press and rock and push oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we got to do something we got to do something stop complaining do something come on now stop being negative do something stop criticizing do something on your mouth going shut up do something help somebody encourage somebody raise up somebody oh give the Lord a shout too much of negativity do something get the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God they say it was in fasted so that the tears will bong together as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have tremendous three-fold strength of political physical spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure oh I didn't think I sign up for this suffer he yeah when you come to Christ you come as a soldier when you come to Christ you come and join the Lord's army the devil seen you putting on boots the devil seen your mask the devil seen what you're putting on you in a war whether you feel so or not and Paul went on to say and I we're going to preach on it sometime coming we rash not against flesh and blood in other words these Spirits may not have bodies but they are spirits you have a body they want a body to use because the devil not talking from Heaven you have to find somebody to speak through what the Lord I shout come on now come on now come on now Hallelujah the devil a talking from Heaven he have to find bodies to speak through and God have to find bodies to speak through and work through God want to work through you glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house do you believe that amen amen amen all right he said be zealous defin repent God is calling for another Zeal the Zeal is cry I'm wrong and you find out people not saying that people preaching false Doctrine not saying that they just going to another Doctrine they repent of the P you know they leave our FKS and they come out and they continue I'm my nature Falls and many FS no mistes are made we have to understand how people get ruined you know we have to understand how Soul become what he is you know God they ask for a king God said but Sam say how you want a king we want a king to lead in front we want a man you want a man take one and then God hand them Saul Saul was never God's choice they call People's Choice by by people's vote by people's love the love the man message love now he just bring the Mysteries real well but God had always had David well the People's Choice step forward rain for a couple of years and then messed up and then when the People's Choice had David right inide the camp afterwards he didn't let to kill David who's supposed to be the successor isn't that something else as somebody say instead of training and mentoring David to take up the post trying every minute kill kill kill David could have kill him too David catch him in a cave one time cut a piece of his cloth and say I could kill you you know said touch not my anointed do my professional harm David not in that foolishness that one one that kill because he figed the Chone is there forever but God doesn't allow that God have you for a particular purpose that's why you are the age and

turn towards truth discipline training that makes people more willing to obey more able to control themselves often in the form of rules and punishments and if these are broken or behavior produced by this training we almost finished connecting to the last time we preach on this trainer because before the adopted Sons could have power over others and other things he has to have power over himself I have some stuff there that I I'm working on and tell it's kind of mind bugling to me when I'm seeing it we have to Dy in the trest sense of dying there must be nothing in US you see if you have a

mystery preachers touch that they can't touch that I one thing one of these things I no and observe all the years with all these characters that claim to be super on top they they don't touch the cross Calvary and de they don't good at all they will hit word on top of word on word coming Bri that's good seed is in the bright that's good the real thing is he seed in you all that is good but then Jesus said except a corner we falling and die could you imagine you you staying long to get dry out yeah you're a green seed you seed and you're drying out you're drying out you're drying out oh God take out this of me take out jealousy and envy and God taking it out taking out after when when you come you real golden brown God say grown for you now you see I didn't expect that all this long time I drying out now God said except because you can't put a green seed in the ground you get a rotten seed the seed when you we pick corn long time is the plan corn we used to hang up the corn and thing like that and all the thing get dry and the corn and you have a corn there that's the plan for next year you have to wait till it dry you can't green corn is the boil we call it boil corn but when you hang it and his dry that's the plant are you with me so God taking some time to get greenness out greenness is your unforgiveness your bad attitude your envy and jealousy your eye long long you're watching somebody have something and you want it to and you don't know how they get what they get all that have to get out of you you must be able to bless and rejoice with somebody when God blessed them you say Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you say oh god oh she so why you looking so how get a new tie and a new little clip and a new little Cur and un this God bless them they cup running over that's why show on their head and their clothes and their shoes leave them alone your time coming oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises what the Bible said rejoice when Saints rejoice and cry when they cry some people can't rejoice when they rejoice and when they cry they say nobody cry is that kind of back to front thing we supposed to Rejoice with you when God bless you we re happy for you to be blessed but if you were stuck up Pride oh God I don't know why I'm saying all these things today when God judging somebody the B say don't mock them and you God don't like that you know something hitting somebody and you smiling and you carrying all good good for them they s where they reap and they s and they carrying on carrying some God has pull back the Judgment off you can't talk like that walk humble be little I was telling my wife they say I want to S right in the ground and fall when I down there you see when you climb up high and you fall you had to look for your body and you SC but when you keep humble and you stay in the dust my wife always tell me that you know she say she want to walk if she fall down she could just dust and get back up when you climb up there some people take the ladder and climb up and then throw down the lad know they they looking to come down they're looking to climb Harder They the lad up and they kick down the ladder Bo they go George and when they climb up there and they do fall forget it you to find a hand their foot day all this C he that he that he that proud shall be humbled and he just humble himself shall be exalted walk humble walk close to the dust anybody should be able to talk to you anybody should be able to correct you and share with you you have have to be up there somewhere where you think he is and when people think they are up there the market is calling when you're overvalued when you're stuck overvalued the commentator say you are due for correction oh give the Lord a shout in the house when people stuck overvalued they are due for correction it climbing Higher and Higher and Higher and afterward it too high the market is corrected come back down oh glory to God but when you stay down God will bless you God and what baram says God looking for a man the more he blessed is the more humble he becomes that's a odd thing because most time people get proud but God I know brother he wanted a back to come to service and what when he get he by the beach you see why he all along God was trying to save him all along he come to service he traveling what he want a car he could serve God better when he get the car he by the beach on a Sunday that what God talking about the heart of man desperately wicked let's let me see if I get to where but I'm talking about this now he's talking about um when a son is Born Into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was not determined was not yet determined it depended on his character so everybody in his message come like on the same page all called of God all selected and elected of God and God has not given out inheritance yet right even as much as the ministers try to make it it's so but it's not really so yet because inheritance could only come by Dynamics because when the Holy Ghost fell on Pentecost that is when inheritance was given and each one got their lick of fire or each one get their portion both Pastor and janitor in the upper room got their portion oh give the Lord some Praises deacons Elders got their portion in the upper room God divided everybody get a chance to get the own portion own L of fire in the upper room that coming back oh give the Lord a shout the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost God placing you positionally in the body what you are in God oh give the Lord some Praises so your portion coming note is your portion not your brother portion that is your brother own I'm talking about your own portion that is coming it is mine I claim it it belongs to me oh give the Lord a shout in the house come on come on preach back to me that portion I claim it it is M it belongs to me so therefore the birth is not the issue the issue going to be the inheritance that is not determined it have family when come to read inheritance and will and whatnot son Beav this way that way that way that way this one get his house this one get land whatnot and that other son father just leave a thank you you know a thank you note nothing at all why because of behavior you you understand sometime it got to leave a will because without a will is is pure problems real problems you know so I like what Jesus did he left a will don't get me start here this morning he died and left he a will and he come back as the enforcer to ensure you get what is yours so when Caleb stood up and said give me my mountain that was part of the contract that was part of the will you know what Moses say about me you know what the prophet say about this end time prde you know this bright supposed to be a super Church a super race a she near The Headstone you know all of that what the prophet [Applause] [Music] said so says the sun right it's your character from then on what means the difference not going to church there are some people go to church as a ritual just like they going to the Catholic this morning you know you come to the Catholics they go to church Ash Wednesday take ashes they they dance hanal Monday and Tuesday and and and and and Wednesday they take the ashes and so on and said the priest the priest exonerate them from the party that they had for the last two things and they comfortable with that they go back next year to party for two days Monday and Tuesday take the ashes and things and they do it for years and they figure that God so you could come here with the same thinking so come this morning to get the lashes this morning you know get lashes but we don't have ashes here we have a word here a word from God and if you take it and apply it it becomes effective to you because Jesus said by preaching the word a word of none effect it have no effect to the people because they have the pots and P doct the disciples came describe and phes came to Jesus it was a very important issue they had on hand you know what the issue was how come your disciples not washing hands before they eat before they drink before they do anything because this is what we do Jesus said you Hypocrites well did Isaiah speak of you your heart is far from me your mou talk in this church talk thing and then Jesus said in vain do you work worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of man but more than that he says not what go into you that defile you it what was come out of you that defile you for out of the heart proceed adulteries and fornications and stealing he was showing is a heart is you oh give the Lord I shout the defilement comes from a heart is to Lord send the fire Oh Glory to God we take Holy Ghost Fire it take the sffs with the c of the altar Hallelujah the drop on the human heart to burn them things [Music] [Applause] out all right so I'm going to skip down you talk about fasting and fighting among one another there's no cooporation at all and I said to you where there's no when there's competition there's no cooperation and I'm talking about supernatural among a church the other Church don't want to cooperate they don't want to have the meetings and so on because jealous and set of issues and so on he talk about immature and if you we blast that kind of stuff but it is what it is but then this is where I close off at and it cut off I believe if God has permitted sickness to come to you to bring you to discipline and you refuse to discipline yourself before God so God give you a choice you could discipline yourself before God when we talk about communion what the Bible said let a man say it say it out loud examine himself not the pastor examin him you know you examine yourself to see your condition whether or not you should partake of the communion if God has the six to come to you to bring you to discipline and you refuse to discipline yourself before God then step out of line don't come in here it makes it worse if you are sinful and you've got UNC confessing make it right before God before you come to prayer and that's is where this thing cut off so we can here do weart tonight one Proverbs 19:3 the Bible said the foolishness of man perverted his way and his heart Fred against the Lord the Amplified says the foolishness of man subverts his way it ruins his Affairs his own foolishness right ruin his own Affairs then his heart is resentful and fight against the Lord what the Lord have to do with that you and your foolishness screw up mess up and then you Vex with God Jeremiah 29 says thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backsliding shall reprove thee no therefore and see that isn't an evil thing and bitter that thou was forsaken the Lord thy God that my fear is not in theed sayth the Lord of host and the Amplified it says your own wickedness shall change and correct you and your backsliding and desertion of faith shall reprove you know therefore and recognize that this is an evil and bitter thing first you are forsaken the Lord your God second you are indifferent to me and the fear of me is nothing you see the Lord of hosts oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah watch this bomb here now watch the son that is righteous he's a gentleman loved his father he loved his father's business and you know what happened when that boy come up certain age the boy was adopted into the family now what did he do they took him out to a public place put a special robe on him had a ceremony and all the people of the city gathered around looked and they look upon the boy and had a father had a ceremony of adoption all right now don't miss this after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddy's that is where watch watch that is where God is trying to get his church to say be mov it will move and sickness going to be arise it will be that way the blind will receive their sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now but then you'll command it isn't that right if you say to this mountain watch what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters need adoption but this is the part I want to get to and this is the part that catches my eye not so much the end part but the process part my eyes sees that watch this now but how can the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist and Baptist Church be adopted until they come to discipline but Jo this mystery is not being preached much right this this unfolding this we have got to be disciplined first when before adoption who said that God said that so this speaking the word I speak the word what speaking what word you're speaking the word now watch this God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you would do that's right somebody Vex their like brother you know and they want to speak existence what this is husband disappear you because somebody Vex God can lose that kind of power these people dangerous you know these are dangerous men out there I don't want that I don't want any power you know I want character because if I have the character I will be able to handle power I can't even trust myself with that power I'm telling you so not yet Lord not yet not yet not yet God does nothing for sure whatever God does it have a mind behind it he let Moses time out for 40 years until he ready for Moses then is when the pillar fire appear not to get a picture for Instagram but to get in contact with Moses to give him the commission to go and get his people out from Egypt do you get what I'm saying so whenever God come down there's a purpose behind that whenever the witness come down there's a purpose behind that whenever rebuke comes down there's a purpose behind that whenever a word come there's a purpose behind that this word this morning canot return void there's a purpose behind this message this morning oh glory to God hallelujah [Music] hallelujah I feeling real tired got about 1:00 a.m. this morning and I said Lord what to do because I have some stuff that I was working on and I just couldn't seem to get it together and just like that it come to me what about the rest of this message and then I knew what I had to preach this morning say my God say hallelujah thank you Jesus when I B back about 4:00 but the point about it is this we get something for you you got to hear this you got to apply this and when you hear it like this morning you go back and listen to it take notes to apply to yourself Glory don't just come and hear here here the Bible talk about men who hearing like people look in the mirror and they forget what man man is you just see yourself the mirror just show you you and you do so and you think you somebody else when the mirror of the world show you you had to know take stuck are you okay are you fine what is the issue what are the challenges deal with you oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God work on yourself repeat after me I have to I have to work on myself on Give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God before you change your husand hband you can't change him he's a character by himself before you try to change your husband change you if F before you try to change your wife change you you work on yourself be a better you oh glory to God hallelujah and see what God will do so before God could adopt his sons that he said he has to come into discipline he said the church Hallelujah has got to come to a place where it is disciplined God's on the work God God is on that work right now discipline these are these are not my words he said God is on that work right now discipline what message this from this some here him this is actually from adoption message so God wants the church to be disciplined discipline is you bringing your life into order there are so many people like to control others and they can't control their own self Bible say Mark the perfect man he can Bridle his he can Bridle his the tongue because the tongue is a weapon tongue is big trouble sometime your own tongue get you in trouble if you can only hold that tongue and keep that thing oh glory Lord God will call you a perfect man if you could manage that little thing that o up and inside of there that tongue Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah that tongue could give God praise and that tongue could cuss somebody blankety blank oh give the Lord a shout in the house but that tongue if it come under control perfect man that pong could speak truth that tongue could speak life that tongue could speak light that tongue could speaks positive that tongue could speak encouragement that tongue could shed light to somebody give the Lord some Praises glory to God in instead of talking negative you talk positive instead of discouraging someone you encouraging [Applause] [Music] someone Hallelujah amen hallelujah what God wants to do with the church tonight God wants to do it with an individual the holy spirit is searching to find men he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint them and give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and do his will not the same old story that we had for 40 years did you hear bang God looking for men to anoint and give them what something special great powers and gifts to work with to will and do his will when the poers are to rock in the bright Church the Pentecost go get penty Horrors they will call for the government to pass laws to Snuff us out because they'll be rocking all around nothing that they can see oh glory to God hallelujah I saw a pre a preacher who call himself a prophet and he's talking about Peter was heal people and people people Shadow and he have five people in wheelchairs sit down here when when I see it so said them people good as them could walk normal I set up you know and he's saying when Peter walked sh he said watch my shadow and on the screen you see

Reach Out people hey that is the gimmick they had to do to get people to come go in I heard a testimony of one say she husband become a prophet he how he become a prophet she living with him he don't

something him and when she going up there she see his cell phone with this this person in this corner here name is so and so and she SE his cell phone there so when he's saying your your name is Terence think he have that here you know and people believe that this man working prophetic so she what what what is that that what you doing that you getting prophetic this is not this is happening out there know so what we supposed to do manufacture healing is that somebody who had somebody wasn't in a wheelchair and wheelchair and when and when they when they get them out step the wheelchair somebody who AC wheelchair get out and walk they say this one motivate that one F but I God that's what we come to now we can't manufacture anything when God ready to work in his appointed time the

till there will be not an unsaved person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of God those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it Father Here We Go may all the great Mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us and we will see the plainness of God purpose that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of Jesus Christ so the mysteries of our purpose to bring forth the Pless of God so that we will know how to behave ourselves our parents didn't teach us how to behave the teachers they had a tough time getting us to behave but the word the Mysteries the Revelation come to teach you in church how to behave yourself and conduct yourself so nobody supposed to be misbehaving in the church do you get that now in other words the word supposed to bring you in line and bring you in order oh give the Lord a shout Proverbs 1: 12-31 says wisdom cry out she uttered her voice in the streets she cried in the chief place of concourse in the open of the gates in the city she uttered a word saying how long he simple ones will you love Simplicity and the scorners Delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge turn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit upon you I will make known my words unto you because I have called and you refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded you have set at not all my counsel and with none of my reproof I will also laugh at your Calamity so when you don't want correction God say when you get in your trouble I would laugh at you I would laugh at your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as a desolation and your destruction cometh as a worldwind when distress and anguish come upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they will seek me early but they shall not find me for they hated knowledge and they choose they did not choose to fear the lord they with none of my counsel they despise my reproof therefore shall they eat yes the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices and the Amplified verse 22 says oh how long oh simple ones open to evil would you love being simple and the scuffers the light in scuffing and self-confident fool fools hate knowledge he the Bible say right self confident fools hate knowledge the Bible said my people perish because of lack of knowledge this is knowledge of God not information knowledge of God verse 26 in the Amplified said I will also laugh at your Calamity I will mock when thing come that will cause you Terror and panic and when your Panic comes as a storm and desolation and your Calamity comes as a whirlwind when distress come upon you then you will call upon me but I will not answer oh we almost done mus come please job 5:17 to 18 behold happy is the man whom God corrected therefore despise not thou the chasten of the almighty for he make it sore and bind it up he wounded and his hand makes whole Amplified say happy and fortunate is the man whom God reproves so do not despise or reject the correction of them Almighty for he wounds but he binds up he Smite and His Hands heal so the same God that break you he would heal you don't move and fight up with the sword let the sword go in and cut and as it comes out it's going to heal too oh give the Lord a shout in the House 2 Corinthians 7:8 says for though I made you sorry with a letter I do not repent though I did repent for I perceived that the same epistle had made you sorry though it were for a season but now I Rejoice not that you were made sorry but that you sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a Godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation but the sorrow of the world work at death in the Amplified Paul speaks 2 Corinthians 7:8 for even though I did grieve you with my letter I do not regret it now though I did regret it for I see the letter that pain you though only for a little while yet I am glad now because you were pained but because you were pained into repentance that's the objective that people get pained into repentance not a pain a hurt a hurt and you still a repent pain and repentance and so turn back to God for you felt grief such as God meant you to feel so that in nothing you might suffer lost through us or har for what we did for Godly grief and the pain of God is permitted is to direct produce a repentance that leads and contributes salvation and deliverance from Evil and it never brings regret the pain of discipline or the pain of regret so Paul brings here the difference between Godly sorrow which lead to repentance and salvation as opposed to worldly sorrow that leads to death so you come like Adam like me you became from attribute to flesh to be tempted you see in order to stand Temptation you have to bypass your theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin so we bypass theop to be tempted by sin now you could have say oh if I could quit drinking just get into Christ and it'll all go on because your body is subject to that Spirit oh my and when you become subject to that Spirit it CHS your whole being subject to that spirit and that Spirit here we go is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or Quicken and believe it or not I'm almost there but was praying and he was praying from choosing of Bri let us pray he said dear God in my spirit is a shaken my heart is dropping tear drops of warning Grant God that men and women will not think I've said it as a joke and the people may not think as something that was prejudice against them may they see it it is love thou bear me record almighty God that up and down this course I went year after year proclaiming the word bear me I took your name by it and said it was thus sayth the Lord so I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus let people shake themselves tonight and flee from the Wrath that is to come for IUD is rote over the doors and over the Nations a black check mark has come

Christians oh god of Heaven have mercy upon a sinful World Lord As We Are Tonight I'm standing I'm trying to stand in the breach and ask for divine mercy that you speak into this crowd tonight and

appreciate the trailer but oid played about the convention we encourage you to take a look at it it was shared in the WhatsApp group it's also on the YouTube channel and everything like that and the Lord has put it on brother ID's heart uh to not not have a set theme for this convention we believe that the Lord wants to set his own theme via speaking through his servants in the way that he wants to speak through his servants so somebody asked me what's the theme of this year's convention the theme of the convention is what the Lord will decide as the theme of the convention we are trusting the Lord to work through his sons his servants who are flying in to speak and to speak what the Lord puts on their hearts as the spirit leads them and we are under great expectation we want to come

we're looking for a wonderful time in the Lord we're looking for walls to come down we're looking for the water to rise so the docks could swim we're looking for the Holy Ghost to move in such a way that there'll be healings and miracles and that no man will be glorified saved that man Christ Jesus because he is the head of the body this is his convention can the church say amen so nobody can say but over set the team no let the Holy Ghost set the team let let the chief Captain Hallelujah set the team up to Convention with each man backing one another up because the Holy Ghost is more than able to do it we have full confidence that the Lord Jesus who has led us all these years is able to lead us all the way home all the way to Perfection all the way to adoption and our job is to get
