hearts as parents because we have to mol or children so that they can grow up to be strong and vibrant followers of Christ I remember saying a prayer in my heart as I ascended the staircase of the sanctuary Lord I dedicated service to an eager and I said I just felt it where and worship normally during a service without dwelling on in my earlier prayer at the end of the service but as I call a prayer line for those who would like to be prayed for my family joined in prayer from where we were seated my younger daughter touched me while prayer was Gwen and I instructed her to sit she touched me again but this time she directed my glance Danita who was crying hysterically with tears streaming on her face I could not tell I could not tell what was happening to her at that point but after service I questioned her and she said she started praying to the Lord for her to be more obedient and when she felt a warm loving presence flow into her body for a moment and then move out of her towards the altar we we can taste the sweet change in her and we want a tan God for His mercy and love for us he sees and cares about the smallest prayer of our hearts and he answers I want to thank

and welcome and some time now come we want to welcome even divas this morning god bless you and welcome to the headstone tabernacle oh praise the name of the Lord I love him this morning [Music] okay well greetings from Cameroon Africa we had such a tremendous time over deer and we should refer to God even for this privilege he meant to share the Word of God to the bride of Jesus Christ wherever she is and we know that's a bride buddy isn't that right praise the name of the Lord and you've got to be part of that buddy gotta be part not that - triumphant praise the name of the Lord and the Prophet said when a man fell he lost this when he lost the fall Christ come as a redeemer he said did you ever stop to think what Christ's redeem us for you give us everlasting life he brought us back into eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be sons of god and daughters of God watch back restored back all that animal lost in the fall all we don't want short enough we want all that Adam lost we want that back we don't want a short cut we don't want no robbery we want all what Jesus died for we wanted the same power Adam had the same dominion Adam had the same anointing Adam had the same spirit out of hat we want all the Adam had Melissa notice how the thing of it is since he has restored man back to displease man in the fall has lost his conscious of what father put him on here to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the feet has been plugged up with business affairs and whole life and domestic things is become clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made man for and when God placed the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if God so patent man the body of a man how much more he patent and says in order the body of Christ the church if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he signed us to come together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these supernatural workings of God oh let's who gives of the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and this of healing all these other different gifts is outlets that God let hold his power let all this revelation that our people not as an individual so much but as a unit we are all together one great body of believers and how do we get to this body this mystic body by one Spirit we are baptized into this body so friends we can join this church we can't join this body we have to get fire to pass baptized us into that body all glory to God only one Spreaker do that not one join in not one church it's not right freeze the name of the Lord praise God so when the Holy Spirit was given a few days forty days after the commission praise be to Jesus you love him for watch they were commanded by the Lord not to preach and do anything until they were into it par from 1 I know these men walk with Jesus talked with Jesus lived with Jesus but they needed power from on high not chicken with the pastor read a book they needed power from on high Oh glory to God not to have all the tapes and then listening to him and the message every day and they that's not the power for my mind or glory or the needed power from one hang they had Jesus living with him and they didn't have the power yet they have Jesus feeding them and they still have the power they have Jesus raised in the den around them and they still another power but this power was a promise of the Father Oh glory to God shouldn't move away from being anointed to be in place positionally to receive permanent power and I think that's what was the blame today for a confusion is because we haven't waited for the commission of God we have went to school and learned theology that's all well but theology here we go theology alone won't produce what Christ said it will produce even yes even the teaching of the word and rightly set in order will not produce these signs so no matter if you farmers if you ever such good wheat until the wheat has fallen to the ground and perish to itself it will never spring to new life and so it is with the believer no matter how well he is instructed until he can perish to his intellectuals he will never born again so this is not the use here this is something here where you're stripped of your human element and you'll get strip and they get broken praise gone and then God could do something special for you amen do you believe that almost done but I'm sitting on the blesses this morning with the word you appreciate my brother praise God young man on fire call of God elected of God gonna be used of God amen so the Prophet said here now what Joe when my inspiration because you had no Bible so these guys a holy man move by the spirit that nobody but they had to be moved by inspiration by divine inspiration and it's going to come back to that alone but we have the Bible and then the inspiration come upon you to move you by the spirit and it will take you back to the world isn't that right watch and the only nude by inspiration because you know this position that he was God's prophet and the only thing had to happen was for the inspiration to strike him and when he knowed what he said would happen because it was my inspiration and that's what the church if it is an order certain order it's got the mechanics ready it only needs the dynamics tonight and if we get the mechanics ready here we go get our hearts right the things that we can do follow him in every word solomon baptism follow him in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there and we are ready for the dynamics to be lit off and only God can do that that's the drop into your heart that feeder see I am now healed then it don't make difference what circumstances is your healed anyhow because it's my feet you are healed o blessed be the name of the Lord you believe that praise God so what a time we had in Africa how the Holy Spirit moving such a mighty way praise be to God and we know the Prophet harvester God all the scattered word all was lost to the ages he has to bring it right back because God could only move through his word I want you to get that now the word is the conductor of the Spirit so if there is no word the Spirit can really work the logos have to be Bridget first for God to speak let there be so the would have to speak the would have to be in you the word is a conductor of the spirit that's why the secret is the word is in the bride but when the word yo-yo becomes fresh then you become part of the conductor of the Spirit itself because not just the word imprint but is another word become flesh in your flesh then you become the living word that God can work through this is good this is goodness is good how many one got in the woman living world because the word was invisible until it be was made flesh or give the Lord a shout at the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God just like I see it but the word became flesh Pelham alas then you could see it a living world I live in faith I live in virtue I live in knowledge you read about it but those virtues gonna live and cook at under it's going to live in you or give the Lord a shout so the seven seas the blood that was sealed with seven seals that blood had to be broken that the life that was in the seven seals which is seven thunders which is seven voices Oh hallelujah could be released so the seven seas have been broken and all the life is hunting the seeds to connect with the life Oh glory that's who you are you can only be born again if your name was in that book they could only be born again if you are son the power coming become not to make you a son but because you are son because you have a seed in you you could be reborn if the Lord Oh God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we have to have evidence that this book have been restored glory no that's Mike wasn't a prophet that's what that wasn't a witness of the Spirit and the power of God to demonstrate that Adams life has not been restored or glory dog or demon let me see that I'm gonna wrap up alone remember this don't ever forget this the same God that put this man a woman in the Garden of Eden no drink no liquor no rum no smoking no whiskey no kokino marijuana just man gana Eden tree of life and tree of good and evil and that man fell the same water put him in put him out Oh hallelujah I wanna say that the same God that put man in chimo don't play with him he is caught tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever and the fact that he gave - word the deal you eat thereof that day you die I've no ifs alive no buts the I am God and I changed not the same God that policial out there wasn't money for four hundred years same God kill them make them perish just two went another two million the same God so don't claim to be boastful and proton Ireland look him nothing like that the same God blame Israel that you the Gentiles could come in all glory to God and when the fullness of the Gentiles all of it and God finished with the Gentiles he goes back to the Jews more glory to God you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord so walk in humility walking fear walk in the consciousness that the same God that blind those people he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power the joint Church now to become the sons of God not what church number gonna call it me no church member the wormwood church bench and said oh I know church pew brought calling something higher than that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have to have a high of ambition the levels too low we have to have a have a high desire yes you have to have it God coming for perfect Shh not a good church a perfect Church so your ambition either go from good to perfect I went perfect is ready if you could is not good enough say they'd only be a good believer you want to be perfect I'm going to Matthew 5:48 beautiful perfect as

next to us we still have ACOs watch the seven angels message is the open the mystery of the seals call in the eleven our Gentile workers to receive the same pain that the first hour receive not no less I want what Peter had that is mine what Paul had that is max what James had Jesus died for me to get that and I put that I don't want nothing less than that choking house Lord you believe that

Jude and the first chapter the food speaks a man but first fully from 2nd Peter 1 amen hallelujah 2nd Peter 1 and verse 16 and says for we have not followed currently devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but will I witnesses of His Majesty for he received from God the Father honour and glory when they came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost a man and a man now turn it over to Jude chapter 1 a man he want to read the first four verses then Jude one it says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that was sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplying beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that he should earnestly contend for the faith what was once delivered unto the Saints for the a certain men crept in unawares who before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ we got a blessing to the ring of his room let's just bow our heads this morning Oh Heavenly Father Lord it's a privilege and an honor to come into your house this morning Lord Father and to worship and praise your Lord who you are and for what you've done for us Lord father lord when we look around us Lord we see that you have

hey many man he will only honor his word he will only honor what he said according to his word and God is obligated to meet you this morning on the basis of his promises on the basis of what he said

with power from on high he already told them he was gonna happen they just had to winch Oh Holly until it be endued until the day come until the time come until the season come they just had to wait I can imagine how them slaves felt well it went that Emancipation Proclamation went out Holly and they knew they were gonna be free all of a sudden they felt a little better because a little lighter every day was better than the day before because they were one day closer one step closer to freedom to Liberty and this morning we are one step closer one day closer one hour closer one minute closer

little cloth draped over maybe joy Jews have put up to twice over to make it more comfortable honey but it was perilous it was arduous but it had to be done and Mary didn't complain Ian mama she say Oh God why me but she understood something she had a deeper revelation and even through the trial even to the para even to the journey the sweet hallelujah anointing of God was upon her because in her heart she had a blessed assurance that she was not just carrying anybody but she was carrying the Lord most high high I lifted up she understood something I'm because she understood something there

talent to me according to thy word Oh hallelujah hallelujah settled herself and trot and random sir any time crash it's being formed in you he said watch the persecution set in watch trouble stop on every hand rush the devil go on a rampage in your home and in your life why do you think that happening the devil not stupid he knows that Christ is being formed in you he knows that something is taking place inside your hearts you're not what you ought to be but you're not what you used to be every day you getting closer and closer to the stature of the perfect man and the devil tryna fight you just wearing that but he's finished and smaller he's finished in your heart he's finished in your life kill a lot of shut up ray yeah man [Applause] something above its head last time he was here he's preaching about the seal of God is now right amen amen oh no don't want to thank what Isaac first message last week that was powerful he appreciated oh and all the holy spirit fell swept through here we heard a testimony were wonderful now and while all this talking last week about that last week day about the seal of God and he said that there come a time when gotta give a message and that message would seal us in or seal us out and I thank God that through it all we learn to trust in Jesus and we learn to trust in God and we receive the true message hallelujah that has separated us from the world that shop when I'll come up from among my people and be not partakers of her plagues be not partakers of Babylon what is Babylon parallel confusion confusion in a message confusion in people's minds not knowing which way is left or which way is right but God give us a compass inside of our souls what is the secret the secret is the Word was in the bride the word is in the bride you didn't call yourself you didn't choose yourself but it was part that shows you it was called it for the seed inside your soul something to connect with the world when spoken hallelujah and the names on the book is the mystery of what the book is pilots calling those names so when that mystery is preached 27-ton others preach when seven voices are some inside your soul agrees with that word doesn't matter how you feel you know your condition before God calls you some of us are Baptists some of us are Methodists for us a good Catholics but let me hear that voice jesus said my sheep hear my voice a stranger's voice they will not follow we have not followed Connelly devised fables but I heard a cry of Jesus it went down pupae on my flesh it went past my bones it went to the marrow it went to the socket on my heart I heard a cry edita I'm coming mama I'm coming mama I'm coming out of this brown yard oh I cannot go back to the way things used to be to the way change was [Applause] when you hear that voice you can't go back scientists say when you experience a new thing your mind stretches your mind expands because you just learned something and the more you learn to expand and you get more of it and it's skill level rises it's impossible for you to go back to being ignorant it's impossible for you to go back to being what you are it's too late you already learned something you already experienced something it was too late to tell Elijah that he didn't feel nothing that that wasn't nothing hello when he fell the mantle drop upon his shoulder his heart expanded he felt something push out a desire it was laying dormant all the time for and for some of us we was laying dormant all the time oh but this more than I pray that a sweet anointing come over you and that your heart expands and something happens little Adam said that positive light inside of you has got to push out and expand and the more of the world you pull out the ball the lost you pull out the more the lies you pull out the more the field you pull out that part of light inside your soul because X and because X what you think is happening you are making room for the Holy Ghost you are making room for Jesus to come inside he's no longer Jesus with dirty feet no no no what he can come we are washing as we throw our tears we are trying it with our hair and worshiping the Living Christ [Applause]

was and all wood for all day the Prophet said you can't get warm by a painted fire and it got a lot of men right now painting fire in this message hallelujah praise God is not giving you a false picture giving you a false illusion holiday of what this thing's supposed to be oh we want that real genuine Holy Ghost and fire that's what I'm here for and I believe that's what you're here for - to earnestly contend for th that was once delivered to the Saints if it was once delivered it could be delivered again I believe it my heart if it was done once before he could do it again if he heal the

hallelujah it's time to be confident and who you are and whose son you are and whose daughter you are and who your God is [Applause] Bible said the people and know that God shall do great exploits shall be strong do you know him do you know this girl that were talking about because anytime this God introduced himself he said I am the God of Abraham I am the god of Isaac when he says that your mind supposed to go back to what that card if Abraham what that God did for Isaac that same God did for Jacob what that God did for Joseph one time when I was sick alone but one morning he woke up after 25 years of testing after 25 years of trial he was transformed his body was transfigured he turned to Sarah I said Sarah you're beautiful what that God did for Abraham what that God devised what that God did for Chico what he did for Joseph what he did for Joshua what he did for Moses what he did for kiddie honor when he did try Oh hallelujah praise call when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all that he's done for me if he was caught then he is caught now he is caught all right now in this church [Applause] and if you believe he's gone now brother you could pull him right next to you you could pull him right at a side of you let your fetch pull the pillow file right where you are this morning what I think sometimes and I heard a preacher say it one time he said a word it's got to be enough for you the problem is some people the word is not enough for them the word is not enough they think to keep their the word is not enough they think to hold them to all the reins and so they look for other interpretations or some new idea to split them on and keep them going getting some new sensation but this gospel is not about sensations prophet said you could scream you could holla the devil don't care about that you could scream sing till you're blue in the face devil don't care about that but when you see that holy consecrated life dedicated to God the thunderous speech the full of humility bravado said that's what we need today thousands of live Rises that's a thunder that shakes the devil the devil hates to see that consecrated life that's sanctified life to God say anything to him just as sweet as he can be I forgive you brother I love you brother he can love the unlovable because there's a real caught in his soul there's a real cord vibrates and inside of him Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah one thing I love more animals you know humans could talk we could talk and say yeah yeah no I care for you one thing a lot about animals is that the communicator an animal they can't talk you have to show an animal how you feel about it and I might be challenging for some people but I love how that breaks you down I love how that breaks down what's your custom you know you could see something and and use words casually or interesting or whatever but with animals is different because you gotta show them you love them and it just doesn't happen just one day but maybe over a period of time you feed him you feed him maybe he's not accustomed to you but after a while the more you feed him anymore you get used to you until after a while he knows this master he could smell your coming down the road you're kind even pull up yet but he's wagging his tail and he's excited because he knows his master is coming home and that's because you can vibrate in something to that animal to that unknowing creature even vibrating something more than words and it's got to be more than words in the sound it's got to be more than just what people say but it's got to be what you live it's got to be a life lived wah hallelujah it's got to be something vibrate out a genuine love a genuine concern a genuine forgiveness a genuine connection Oh hallelujah genuine feeling the Prophet before he pray he had to enter into the sufferance of that person whoever he was praying for he had to enter into that person until a sudden efficient prick nakhon show him something and he said just say it the Lord you shall be here or however he entered into their suffering one time a man came up on the pulpit didn't have no shoes he took his shoes off and gave it to the man and if that was a prophet then how much more ought we to live and vibrate such a life run out in sweetness and humility Oh Holly we can live something to people that people that see a real God a genuine Christian a genuine Christianity a genuine love when you pray it must be genuine I told myself one time I said I want my smile to be real and when I smile I don't want it to be a put-on I don't want it to just be a formality but I want my protection my smile to come from inside my soul I genuinely love you brother Oh hallelujah hallelujah your smiles got to be real your desires got to be real your burdens got to be real real down in your soul that's why when you come to church it's got to be real you got to genuinely want something from the law I desire moving inside your soul you know you're not what you ought to be and your comfort Elevens you throw your hands up at the altar and say lord I need the Holy Ghost I need deliverance I need freedom I need a breakthrough standing in need of prayer I need something more than what I got right now because I can't make it in this condition Oh God remember my children remember my family it's got to be real Oh hallelujah a man number you know food courts here my god Wow Wow well the Holy Spirit is here now amen enticing spirits now today so many people are listening he said now Sunday school oh he said I love it look so many people are listening to enticing spirits instead of taking the Word of God spirits there in the world and he started off talking about spirits demons in the natural demons and the supernatural but Abraham said every sickness every disease is a devil is a fourth dimension disease it coming from another dimension interacting with your human body making you feel symptoms making a few weakness and depression and frustration what is that he said those are demons and tyson spirits that's why this morning we come to rebuke every enticing spirit every force of darkness halle-loo and there's power in the church this morning the cast saw the works of darkness to throw out the enemy Oh hallelujah haha to proclaim light in this place light in you right now right now and you lift your hands right now any worship we're gonna pull out a anointing hallelujah cause is there a fight for us he said so many people listening to enticing spurns instead of taking a word of God they're demons they in the world he saying it go out in two places and they get amongst men ministers they get amongst church members they get amongst good people that's why good self at the time because the devil is still use good people to do all kinds of mischief oh I could it is the enemy of perfect so if you want to make it to this rapture perfection is required therefore perfect according call the good man he come to call a perfect man the statue of a perfect man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he many many man hallelujah the perfect man is who goes into the rapture a many men hallelujah good we'll settle for half we couldn't settle for you know what's just enough but perfection wants all of it a many men all why today get a most good people and it caused them to come into an illusion and then they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the Word of God and he said today ministers of their congregation they allowing people to play cards on the front ain't said he said he said that's what he do is not right he said what did he tried to do he said it's substitutionary something he said they tried to adopt some new plan they tried to adopt education to take the place of the Holy Ghost he said but you'll never be able to do it no matter how well your man is educated I think it's a good thing to empty educated sure but if he hasn't got the Holy Spirit with that his education will do him no good and you can never take the place of the leadership of the Holy Spirit a man oh my notice they instead of this they've tried to adopt handshaking for the old time experience we used to house and he said the day the church has become modern they walk and give walk up and give their right hand of fellowship and that's about the way to do it but it'll never take the place of the old fashioned mourners bench where sinners call out I got right with God that's right but if I'm stand-in the Father he always come he said if you want to see visions you if you want to be right he said stay in the word he said porn works right in that word Oh huh nothing your interpretation not about what you think not on your ideas but God works with the word because the word is a conductor of the Spirit Oh [Applause] if you want the spiritual flow then you've got to be on the word it can't be ninety nine and nine-tenths it's got to be all the word what he said what he spoke what he promised and not fall to the ground but if you stay with that word this morning whoa hallelujah that's a Plan C he said that's a plan he said now my kaya listening is the secret he said Mike I was teeing with what the Prophet said the prophet Elijah because they have a done evil he said the dog to lick your blood and so on and over the data better righteous is another he said now the Word of God to that prophet which was God's word comes to a prophet and they stayed with that and Mike I couldn't go left all right from it because it was already confirmed the Word of God he said right God's Word was with the prophets in them days he said he had the law but he had his word with the prophets and Mike I being a prophet a true prophet he said now look let me show you something oh I see it prophet said he's excited he said lookie here he said this is fresh he said they went 400 seminary students who claim to know the word and wasn't respecting it they tried to bypass it because of pomp because they try to bypass it because it was a king or to Pat somebody on the back and so on looking for pleasure from man isn't that right but he said but this little Holy Roller as I called him a little while ago he didn't care how much patted on the back went on he stayed with God's Word Oh hallelujah hallelujah Oh whoa we needed some more holy rollers what we needed some more radicals they don't care what men say they don't care what this one says what that one says the care about it we are staying with that word Oh throw 10,000 full of my

single [Applause] oh he is the Lord strong and mighty he's the Lord mighty and powerful and he is able to keep his own world he is able to back up his own world Oh hallelujah hallelujah there it is brother they didn't care what the seminar is thought he didn't care what any of the rest of them was he know the Word of God pronounced a curse on 1/2 and he said and nothing else could take the place of it so therefore being with the word I lined up with the word the Holy Ghost line up with him I feel that went over your head so I'm gonna read it one more time he said so therefore being with the word and line up with the word the Holy Ghost lined up with him oh brother sister if you could have a line up with the hole with the world with all of the Word of God line up would go to requirements

not right hallelujah prophet said on why I'm against organized religion the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to get the people where butter Creed no back to denomination butter interpretation no back to the world because the Holy Spirit here it will only vindicate the word it can't vindicate dogmas he said there's no life in them but he is life hallelujah

receive it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what would take place he said if the man a woman could ever get lined up with a freedom from their heart with faith in the inner most oh what a presence to be a what a place to be in friend where you're confident in the car that's burdened I made a mountains the creator who formed it who formed man from the dust of it we breathe living soul into this man hallelujah praise God I was the original image and you know the devil tried to tear down that image in the garden in that Muruga just said it he said the same God that put man in the garden he put him out because he failed to keep his word but if you ever stay with that word brother its back to Eden mother the Prophet stated that world one time and the Prophet look at a little fish as a little fishy I give you your life what happened back to Eden brother because some man stayed with that word and when you stay with the word God will show you a continuation of that world because he's obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises he promised to deliver he promised to restore he promised a revival uh2 the seven thunders or their voices there'd be a revival Bela it'll sweep out across the world [Applause] so many people come to the altar to be prayed for and they have intellectual faith they confess their sins and join a church by intellectual faith they believe it in their mind they believe it because they heard it they believe it because they know it's the best policy that's good self again it's not right but that's not what God looks at he don't look at your intellectual faith he looks on the heart where on the inside when it comes from the heart all things are possible then God not looking at your head he's looking at your heart this morning what is your heart desire is there something wrong is there something twisted up God is evil this morning to mend a broken heart to heal a broken heart to deliver the captive that's why he came to set

way that you could be free Oh hallelujah hallelujah brother you tell me I can't dance you tell me I can shout you tell me I can't sing when I come into the house of God you got to be crazy but I have danced on top of Lucifer's head okay please call I'm here to worship I'm here to cry out I'm here to call upon my god he saved me he delivered me when I couldn't save myself when I couldn't pick up

hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory glory glory who does the devil think he is trying to bum you down with frustration and depression let's frustrate the enemy let's depress the enemy hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah one time David wanted to pursue the enemy he put on his prayer garments when I speak to the Lord how long it took all my stuff they had no right to do that and a word from the Lord said pursue the enemy people and I took some man said I'm going back to watch mind's eye one more paper clip I want my stapler I want my newspaper I want my tire whatever it was they took I'm taking it back hallelujah when you make up your mind that enough is enough we're taking back from the devil everything he took from us we're taking back or children taking back or joy taking back or paralyzed taking back or better checking back off file I'll seal all I love for the Lord we're taking it back this morning don't take no financial the enemy is defeated this morning we serve a risen God we are fighting a defeated enemy take him down please Claude and take what is rightfully yours say man somebody get me a shout [Applause] humor is the attitude that makes a difference the attitude it makes a difference the right mental attitude towards any defined promise will bring it to pass when you know in your heart David said my heart is fixed oh god my heart is fixed when you come into the church you make up your mind this morning today is my teeth this how is my hour this is a bad time this is C time word time back to the pilot and God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises he policy deliver and he meets you there is Lord he promised to make away he'll meet you this morning he promised to heal the sick he promised to raise a dead he promised to fill you with the Holy Ghost God will meet you this morning [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] now is it time to be sitting of God sitting in this hour God will do what he said he would do God always let her run down to a point where human intellect began to run down a message we're gonna water it down gonna make it like it's common make it like there's nothing to it and people run off with their own ideas but when I begin to take place God raises a standard Holly oh how does he do it by taking the same word and making it more positive raising a standard up hallelujah he's raising a standard right now he's raising a standard in this service what is he doing taking the same word that we've heard all these years and he's gonna make it more positive more positive to you that you're going to be delivered it's got to be more real to you you got to believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's just as real as it was on the day of Pentecost all you got to know that he is real you got to know and even in the midst of this scientific age with all this modern sophistication that card is still the same that card is still the same and even in science fields even when technology fails God is still a healer board is still a miracle worker God is still away maker he made a way for Samson he wait a maid for the children of Israel and he's gonna make a way for you this morning if you say with that word God is obligated he is compelled to meet you on what he promised oh isn't that right yeah man it's not right oh my okay I wanna order go back to Fogo forward I'm kind of low to please but praise God I'm almost finished hey man they love him this morning a man said what like Abraham Abraham received the word and anything that was contrary to the world he called it as if it wasn't let every man's will be alive and let God's would be true and it's just lying symptoms lying symptoms in your body that's all it is forget about it throw it out the window this morning it don't mean nothing the only thing that means anything is what God said if he said he'll heal you then praise God he's gonna heal because in that dimension it is finished I don't care how you feel I don't care what's taken place speak a word of life in the midst of the darkness Oh God is able to do what he said he would do his word cannot fail it cannot fall to the crowd a man call it that if it wasn't Oh and any true born child of God receive God's Word no other word but God's words now I he said I don't care what anybody says what system speaks against that word the word is true anyhow and he said God is obligated to meet you on the basis of them promises outside of them promises he can't meet you because you don't cut yourself off from him whoa that's why we preach the promises that's why we plead the promises look at Seymour look at the old Pentecostals they pleaded a promise of the Holy Ghost they believe that not only those which just as real as it was packed a noted apostles and they prayed and they cried out and they began to unknowing that promise to themselves until all of a sudden Malcolm the Holy Ghost among them how come the open door age down comes something from the Lord something he never seen before but what were they doing pleading the promises I'm brother if we could get next to ourselves this morning and hold on to his word God is obligated to fulfill he's obligated to restore the to what he said he would to to break down the walls break down the fetters and your families in your home in your life Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't give up but stayed in play long enough until something happened until sunny take place stay in an atmosphere don't let it devil push it to the left don't let him push you to the right we're gonna have a prayer time this week and we want to stay in that channel until God to something in this church until God do something for young people until go to solid walls we gotta say and praise Papa said let your pants legs be back it at the knees you stay there until God do something for your family Hollan maybe you haven't prayed long enough hallelujah coach get up I give up halfway I think God is not doing nothing and God it's not moving no you stay stay long enough stay there until you mean business with God stay there and let God know I'm not letting you go until you bless me it takes an attitude to make the difference you can't comment what is not a halfway card when God delivers it's a total deliverance and we want our total Elevens in this church in this message in this nation among these people it's not halfway but the people could be halfway the preacher could be halfway no holiday - alright people could be halfway but God is not a halfway God when God calls somebody out it's a totally Liveris but it takes a total separation first the comportment at total deliverance Moses had to be totally separated separated from Egypt separated for all he knows God through him forty years in the desert beat only any kitchen out of him the beat all pride out of him beat all the lusts be taller lives people felt people of everything out of him all of his humanists all of this carnality had to beat all of it out of him all that he thought he was all his idea Oh hallelujah all over he thought he was they called him a Prince of Egypt for years God had to beat not all of them to beat him out there in the desert I've been a hot chance God was melting and molding his son Moses because I was a chopper in the - there was a commission here to fulfill and chorus obligated to meet his people on the basis of his promise and he found somebody he could use [Applause] hallelujah and sometimes that's all God wants and somebody he could use but you got to lend yourself you got to be willing my brother you got to be willing my sister to be used by God if you could use anything you could use me that's why the child's get so hot because the objective is to bend you and don't beat it out of you turn you over and beat it out beat it out without your loss beat out relize beat out your filt without no fornication beat now the adultery beat out six spirits lion spirits and touching spirits out of you [Applause] every trial every testing was to bring you closer to God to beat out all the lust lies in your heart hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and I love Papa dies I've always talked about pizza let's talk about pizza Peter thought he was somebody he thought he was alright he walked on water he seen a sick heel he was with Jesus when this happening when that happened but when it just come people couldn't stand Peter didn't have what it took Peter than a habit was required an hour just stand for Christ he recognized it he recognized it when the trial come and that's what happens when the trial come all of your faults all of your feelings all of your happiness rises to the surface when the trials come whether he come then we see who's Christian and who's that Christian and he planned Church and we plan holy God will judge you you better come get it oh come on you better come with the Holy Ghost but in your heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and Jesus said there'd be many coming that day they did night castables out in your name did not have great healing campaigns and ministries Jesus had depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't even know you but the people had bought their god Taylor ones you're gonna do great exploits you are gonna know him by a revelation and by an experience now pits a new amount of elation because he was able to point him out and said power to Christ son of the Living God that was genuine could Jesus had flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you nobody whispered this in your hair just now but my father in heaven is who spoke that to your heart my father in heaven is will reveal this to you after a while [Music] Jesus had to rebuke him talk about description we use the last person you'd expect to be rebuked but jesus said don't worry I'll pray for you that your faith fail not you're gonna deny me a man before the crows but I'll pray for you Peter that's your faith fail not when you're after your converted then you're going shrink the bredrin and there we see that there was a supernatural element that still remained despite a revelation even though Pizza knew who this man was he still needed the spirit the everlasting anointing that was upon this man to really give him what it took to stand the standard test to stand trial the stand of persecution just an hallelujah and when Jesus came and appeared to them he breathed upon them receive the Holy Ghost and he was with them thirty forty days teaching and unveiling the scripture to them opening the understanding to the scripture many things they didn't understand before but now they were having a word revival northern having a renewing in this spirit I renewed in their soul I renewing in their mind oh I understand what was taking place sorted by the time he left them they went into Jerusalem with great joy they were not sad they were not down and depressed they were not down in the dumps because Jesus had left them no they understood that same Jesus the same Holy Spirit that was upon this man was gonna come back upon their spirit upon their soul and break into them they understood the power what's gonna come something to be in tune from on high [Applause] not upon their not upon your head not an intellectual show but something dong inside a heart a real Holy Ghost baptism a genuine experience the Bible said each one of them had a lick of L over their heads each one of them caught their portion brother I want to come into that kind of a service when we go to pray at that altar and all of a sudden don't come the Holy Spirit but I want my portion I want my inheritance I want to be identified with Pete on the other side because they got this same Holy Ghost so we're talking about and if they got it you've got to have it Mary could me all eyes mother of Jesus no no she had to get the same experience that he's other brothers had she got to get the pride knocked out of her she had to get the lost Proctor knocked out of her all of the selfishness everything that she thought had to be burned out of her and the Holy Ghost had to come into our hearts the same Holy Spirit and take up residence [Applause] prophet ceremony building we always close at hand when you're gonna see something happen but somebody's gonna take place and he said it all this background here it's won't even laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake up all nations oh do you believe it this morning amen amen I want to sing this speaker's here for a prophet I'm almost close any man misses you can get ready he said give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or factory worker that'll put God first and everything he said I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil could put on him he seeks God first he said we must have that he said what is it enticing spirits coming down trying to substitute solely for the Word of God he said but God has no substitute for his word hey man I got my inspiration from is that it's eternal and forever God has nothing to substitute fate God has no substitute god will never take the place of fate fate this alone it stands alone it'll never take roof could never take its place he said hope is a is there evidence of things not seen faith faith is the evidence of things not seen he said hope is one thing but faith is another he said hope hopes for it he said but faith has caught it you've already caught your healing faith declares it is a reality to you Ohayou could declare your own reality true faith Oh hallelujah I was thinking about I would reality and I was thinking of many people living their own version of reality and there's something called common reality shared reality all of us knew under these chairs our red teachers has taught us that red is the color and we all share that but then there's an old version of reality that people live in and people live by their own morals people live by their own value system what they think is important and what you think is important it's not what this other person think is important and then they've got different opinions because they live in different realities and when you go to work you have your own struggles to deal with and this other brothers got his own struggles to deal with and that's why I believe God deals with us as individuals because you're in your own little world and you've got your own things you're fighting up with but God's trying to call you out of hatch into his marvelous light into a shared reality that call is God whether he's in India whether he's in Egypt where he's in South Africa when he's in Trinidad wherever he is he is the same God everywhere hallelujah that's why it's so easy for people to go off on their own tangent go off on their own ideas go up on their own opinion because they love the old version of what they think this Bible said or what do you think the Prophet said or what they think the message said and core does not hear and none of that he said come out of her my people being a partakers of a pigs come on a confusion come out of Babylon coming into the reality that God is the same yesterday today and forever this is the only reality that any Christian should ever live in where faith is moving where Peters a substance of what you're open for when this is a reality to every brother to every sister to every wife to every home with every family every factory worker Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why he said give me a man I'll put God first and everything when God is your reality when God is your world when all you do when you wake up all the time you go to bed it's been gone all the time it's been caught taking you real that trial called taking you through that test God showing you how to do this how to walk how to hock how to hold your peace how to live like a Christian walk like a Christian talk like a Christian live like a Christian forgive like a Christian repair like a Christian make things right like a Christian died like a Christian I gonna ever like a Christian [Applause] hallelujah forget regular clothes I pray we come into the reality that God has for us another reality we've created for ourselves and people worshipping idols unto themselves and what they think is more important what they think ought to be spoken but we want to be like Mike ayah we want to speak only what God say to speak we want to say what card say to say Oh hallelujah are nothing else Oh hallelujah is nice we want to speak what God put up on our mouth to speak we want to have to write this higher the right motive the right objective the right purpose the right this higher oh I'm so lined up with God that God's food could begin to take effect in your heart and in your life not that were coming to a manifestation or holiday won't be a proton but you will genuine eagle you'll be a genuine Christian you'll be genuinely prayer genuinely hallelujah living genuinely dying out to all that is in the world and when you do that more will unfold more of Christ will emerge inside of you more of God will expand inside of you more the Holy Spirit could we get the flow Jude one later on no he said but he beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith to be understand praying in the Holy Ghost secret based on me softly keeping ourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and on some have compassion making a difference one

when it seems like all your problems see more than you could be he is there all the time you know I heard somebody saying this morning many times we we see the destination and God sees the process the things we want anyone got to speed it up but he is looking at the process because he knows what happens at the end of the journey we wanted now but God takes us through experiences to get us in a certain spot and he was saying you know many people thank God for good health but he said your ability to thank God for good health is is really limited until you come from sickness because when you come through some sickness then good health has a new meaning to you we talk about being an amount on top of the mountain top is only as a perspective of when you've been down in the valley when you talk about the goodness of Jesus that's only a perspective that could come from when things were rough and things were not right and and now you can look back and see if it had not been for the Lord who was on my shiner so-called who is rich in grace and mercy allows us to go through divers temptations divert some through the water some through great try but all comes through the blood and whatever you're going through this morning be confident and assured that he is there all the time and he that has called you he that wrote your name in blood is more than able to finish that which he started that's the God we serve being confident that he who began a good work is more than able to complete it let us bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father the anointing is so thick in
