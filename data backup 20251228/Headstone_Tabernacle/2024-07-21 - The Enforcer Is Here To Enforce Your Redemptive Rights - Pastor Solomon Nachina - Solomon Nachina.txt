brother sham Ali brother jash brother green Andrew Fon brother Norris Cummins brother Arthur Guerero brother mzc brother Ram George brother Daniel Hernandez God bless you and welcome so I'm another scripture I like to read Joshua 1 1-3 says Joshua now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jord and thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have given unto you as I said unto Moses and the prophet said this and the church organizations denomination has failed they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system amen a interdenominational system yes sir by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land organization and the nomination has messed it up each one after their own theology each one one after their own way of thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit and will raise up his Joshua that will take the church to the promise with no denominational strings tied anywhere but will take over his church amen Moses had failed he was a lawgiver Joshua has [Music] called Joshua had called with Moses had fail he was a lawgiver Joshua was called of Grace and he took the church over when that headstone come it will come with shoutings of Grace Grace unto him but Brandon said if the power of God has to come among the people it wouldn't even be their prayer it would be the grace of God oh Blessed Be let's all stand and I want to sing Amazing Grace as brother brother green will come and give greetings first but uh I who more eyes who called us who elected us who predestinated us why are we here what are we here for is the grace of [Music] God in how sweet [Music] I once was [Music] lost but now [Music] God bless you tonight I believe I can speak for the local ministers We join together to salute the church headstone Tabernacle for the wonderful time we have had with you this weekend also we salute the fivefold for the wonderful job that have done the wonderful greetings we have had and we can say that we have a wonderful time sometime it is said what more to say but the truth be told we cannot exhaust the goodness and the mercies of God God always have a more just want to read a portion of scripture here and for a few moments I would Age come Revelation 3 21 and 22 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that had an air let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches God bless his precious words to our hearts amen you may be seated using this text God's Prophet ministered for us how can I overcome but a study of the word overcoming the study of the word to overcome we need to come to a recognition we could never overcome anything so the title seems to be Paradox how can I overcome when the truth be told we cannot overcome anything so what it is it is he that overcame for me Hallelujah it is he that overcame for me in the message Paradox God's Prophet speaking of a young man he said in his El intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome the thing but he cannot do it in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome the thing but he cannot do it Christ will have to come and overcome it let Christ come in you already overcome how can I overcome when we let Christ in because he already overcome for us hallelujah so we never overcome we did not overcome one thing we are just HS tonight of what he already overcame amen and amen and amen so we give praise to almighty God Amen what it is all about it means that the god in you is greater and mightier than the devil Hallelujah the god in you overcoming has nothing to do with you it has to do with the god in you the god in you is what make you more than a match for the enemy that is real overcoming real overcoming is to recognize the god in you is greater than the devil Hallelujah trust God these meetings will revive that thought in our hearts amen the God of this world is not as great as the god that is in you the Word of Promise we have is greater is he that is in you Hallelujah glory to God so how do I overcome it is not me overcoming it is the word in me it is the word in me and who is that word that word is almighty God hallelujah so we want to thank God that go we could walk with a s we are not a fearful people we are not walking in any scar we are fearless as our brother ministered for us last night we have no scare because the god in you the God in Me is greater than the god in the world so we recognize by that by God's grace how did I overcome amen so we want to thank God to be a short tonight nothing could overtake you nothing could suede you Hallelujah because you are full of superpower you are full of superpower and that superpower is the Holy Spirit by God's grace in the message Easter seal God's Prophet tells us but I didn't I that's not okay the acts of the Prophet but I didn't didn't quit nothing I didn't overcome nothing I never overcome nothing if I tell you I overcome it I'll go back and do it I tell you I overcome it I will go back and do it but I didn't I didn't quit nothing he just come to me and took it out of me woo Hallelujah glory to God so tonight it is not what I did but it is what he has already done it is he that did it glory and praise to almighty God Amen and amen so brother that is how we overcame that is how we overcome is Christ the word in a message WAP here and we be look at it on another angle in the message WRA here paragraph 147 God's Prophet tells us unless that was God's seed his Gene from the beginning you are gone what overcoming has to do with me what overcoming has to do with me unless you was God's seed unless you was God's G from the beginning you are [Applause] finished as our brother said that is from another realm Hallelujah is a about fact we already overcome as a matter of fact we already overcome somebody overcame for us hallelujah hallelujah we want to thank God tonight brother sister there is something in you there is something in me something that you never put there there is overcoming brother it will give us a recognition now we understand what it mean to praise God what it mean to give the glory to God it means that it has nothing to do with me there's nothing to do with me glory to God hallelujah there is something in you there is something in me you never put there it is something that you could not desire to be there it is something that is contrary to your nature it is the for knowledge of God taking place Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory so when we look at it in that angle we will get to understand who we really praise who we who is worthy of worship who is worthy of Praise who is worthy of worship it is he we worship he is the one to worship there's nothing good have I nothing good we understand further we understand further that there's something about you you rotate from God you rotate from God before the foundation of the world you rotated from God you P down there as an Overcomer you come down here as an overcomer that is why you are G you are seed of God you because nobody can stop you you're ordained to overcome you're ordained to have a victory you're ordained to Triumph you are there to drive Devils you are there to have a victory let the devil hear it let the devil he it Hallelujah yes be His holy name Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah so tonight you know you supposed to walk with Victory you supposed to be assured you you know why because you what when you see some God Prophet call it secured feeling you know what a secured feeling this is what a secured feeling is you could watch the Holy Spirit live his life in you you Ain living you can watch this body fall under control with the Holy Spirit Come On Church that is our security that is our assurance that is our victory tonight Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory let us practice it tonight let us practice it tonight it is not I thinking it is not you thinking let he think through our lives blessed be the name of the Lord so brother we have nothing to be afraid of we have nothing to be afraid of we have nothing to be scared about we are the victory we have the victory from Glory onto Glory from glory on to Glory his army will he lead till every four is vanquished and God is Lord inde theed hallelujah Glory Glory Glory so what a secure feeling this is not emotion now no this is not emotion no no feeling is not a bad thing when it's this kind of feeling what a secure feeling what a secure feeling you know you're knowing and you're watching you're knowing and you're watching you every day you see it from day to day you're knowing and you're watching the Holy Spirit change your nature every day you're watching come on you watch security you watch security that's all security the know he is walking in me the Lord he is working in me you're watching Hallelujah I see the Holy Spirit change your nature from a v person then we know we have passed from Death un life the Holy Spirit living his own life amen amen yes are in you is that what we want tonight this is what worship is all about this is what church is for this is what this place is ordained for this is the inspiration behind this convent is that lives will be changed is that people will be spoken to is that we live here better than we come in we don't want to have a tradition we don't want to have a ritual we want that seek your [Music] feeling Hallelujah woo glory to God glory to God glory to God that we are part of those beings by grace of almighty God we are part I don't know who you are yeah you remember over 40 times God's Prophet talk about the Africans live not once know over 40 times the illustration have a purpose the illustration is for you and I Hallelujah he was a slave he was on a slave condition he was eating slave food but that didn't change his war that didn't change CH his attitude that didn't change

have a lot of chicken when you open them up in the morning the first thing they look for is the rubbish dump once you open them they are running full speed to the rubbish dump and when they get there they are looking for worms looking for dead food looking for rotten things that's what a chicken looks for but the eagle can settle there the eagle is flying high it's flying high if it cannot find Mana it goes higher higher the higher it goes the clearer it Sease oh blessed be the name of a living God and that eagle don't bother with vultures it don't bother with Hawks if the Hulk wants to to

headache it is not your sickness let your body brother Braham said obey your confession confess positive confess positive let the enforcer take that word and bring that word to a manifestation oh this is the hour church this is the time church this is the season that we must come to our manifestation oh praise God organizations have no life Hallelujah you may be seated amen because we have not believed canning fables of men what we are preaching is that se of the Lord because it is not our work it is God's word and we don't need to back our words up he backs up his word hallelujah said in the Harvest time he said now in the days that we are living any historian knows that any Revival lasts about 3 years and then then out of that Revival comes an organization brother sister in this great 15 year Revival that was then that I have lived in been privileged to live in with it with you there hasn't been an organization count out of it there is no more organizations did you hear that 1964 said declared the prophet declared that there is no more organizations there W be future at the time he spoke there is no more there won't be today there wouldn't be there is the last now Pentecost why was Pentecost there said Pentecost had to be there to protect this hallelujah oh you didn't me the Pentecostal organization existed to protect you and I that we can be called out as Eagles into this Divine blessings of God and once we came out Pentecost remained dead no more life but they had to be there to protect this because out of the shock comes the tussle out of the tussle comes the seed and out of that seed come the life and when that life gets back to the seed the shock is dead so we thank God for these men of God we thank God for these gatherings because they are bringing us to a place where we can feed on the body word of the son of man where no organization exists when no man's ideas exist but the power of God prevails and Reigns Supreme oh you believe that Hallelujah Oh Glory I'm coming to my message now this just comments praise the Lord looking onto Jesus he said we are living ahead of that now we are living ahead of organization we are Beyond Pentecost the same as we are we are Methodist and lutherans we are way up to the coming of the Lord where the ministry that Jesus Christ exercised himself the ministry that Jesus exercise himself has to be exactly like the headstone on the pyramid has to be so honed till every stone fits perfectly and the church has got to get in that condition so not just the ministry The Church Must Get in the condition we must come in one mind we must come in one Accord we must be in one place we must have one motive one purpose young people the older people cannot be standing and you be falling away we must all come to the unity of the faith God hasn't got a modern young people the Joshua and Caleb outfit they state faithful with Moses till when Caleb became old from being a young man he said I am still as strong oh young people am I getting an amen this is our service the older people have had their service so young people this is our service and we are still as strong H we are still going to live the life he never failed me yet we are going to stay strong we are going to stay strong we are going in the rupture we are coming to Perfection we are not going to backslide the curse of this world are dead we don't belong to this world or the curse of this world because the love of God is in our heart oh praise be the name of a living God I am not an old man forget about this gray hair is what I inherited from my father but I'm as strong today oh praise God I am living to the coming of the Lord and I am here a witness because he promised that I shall be a witness unto him so I am here today A Witness I am not a witness to the world I am not a witness to the Fashions of this world I am a witness to the Holy Spirit and where the spirit will lead me I will go the spirit will not lead you to the world it will not lead you astray it will lead you back to the word come on young people this message is life this message is true this message is the body word of Jesus Christ oh I will not exchange it for nothing I will not exchange it for nothing I don't care how I go the prophet say sink or drown Hallelujah if all my friends are excelling and I am down there thank God for life I have life I have life and the mercies of God are following my life I will thank him in that situation I will bless him in that condition because my change is coming I am under a promise to wait wait until your change is come and this is the hour for God to manifest his word you have nothing to do with that change he will enforce that change in you he promise I will be with you I will never leave you that is his promise and he will enforce that promise to your life oh blessed be the name of a living God hallelujah Hal hallelujah hallelujah oh we are Beyond Pentecost now Hallelujah we are way up to the coming of the Lord where the ministry that Jesus exercised himself has to be exactly you may be seated like The Headstone on the pyramid has to be so honed and this is where we have the problem a lot of us cannot stay to be honed the horning has to there has to be a cutting Hallelujah a molding a shaping and we don't like that one when the honing is coming the pastor don't like me but the pastor is under obligation to pre the word for the work of the ministry the pastor has a work to do for the edifying of the body the pastor has a work to do stay there trust him who he will not leave you whatsoever comes and goes he is there build your hopes on things Eternal for they will never pass away stay there to behold because there's a pyramid that pyramid is not just a drawing is people you see it wide on the base is people getting narrower to The Headstone is people make sure you are in that pyramid make sure you are in that pyramid because that is what he's coming for a Powerhouse unto the Lord you can't be a Powerhouse outside that [Applause] pyramid this guy where is he from some local Village Preacher what's he talking about the promise of God hallelujah go when the magnet comes the magnet is not going to take your fashion it's not going to take your intellectual conception of the message Hall what Paul had must be in you what William Brown had must be in you praise God what all the Saints have must be in you he said add onto your faith virtue he's not coming for six he's coming for a stature of a perfect man and he has given you all the promises and all he has said is that just open yourself just surrender surrender and receive surrender and believe surrender and hold on don't let say what shall separate us brother Green from the love of God Amen shall distress so what is your excuse and I am stressed how can you be stressed hearing the word shall distress shall persecution he said blessed are you when you are persecuted so why are you crying and I'm tired and I'm not coming to the church anymore why child persecution shall fine and I don't have food to eat shall fine you have no excuse he's here to enforce the promise to you all you need to do is open up surrender yield yourself because he's coming for the same material same promises and the promises are for each and every one of us it is you to receive or you to reject it to receive it you receive life to reject it brother may God bring us back may God bring us back hallelujah amen he said the pyramid has to be so honed till every stone fits perfectly and the church has got to get in that condition we must get in that condition so it's not about my pastor no it's about you getting in that condition to receive the headstone then take the whole thing in the resurrection when the body is raised up hallelujah praise be the name of the Living God so we are in that place we must come to that condition where the spirit of God can trust us that he will be in us that when we walk we can take the spirit to where the spirit can lead and guide amen but if the spirit just drops in anyhow we take it to the world of what Glory God don't do things for our Glory he does things for his glory so in order for him to trust you to give you the Holy Spirit you must use it for his glory he won't give you the Holy Ghost to [Applause] backslide he will give you the Holy Ghost to stay in the word and prove the word and vindicate the word because that is your ministry to vindicate the word oh [Applause] Church hallelujah amen you believe that you believe that are you ready to manifest the word are you ready to vindicate the word not by your might now it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit and that statement concludes with what sayth the Lord and you know that that se of the Lord cannot fail okay the harest time now Malachi 4 teach us that great that before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come this will take place amen how many knows that I'm coming to my message now amen and he will restore the hearts of the children to the fathers is that right the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers and in that day Luke 17:20 I believe it is Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man The Living Word itself again among the people this word church must live we are not crazy when we are passionate about the message we are not crazy because even the Muslims in the Quran it is written that we are the people of the book that is how they refer to Christians so even the enemy knows that you are the people of the book that book that no man was worthy no man was worthy to look on no man was worthy to lose the seals no man was worthy and John was weeping they know that we are the people of the book and there is power in that [Applause] book and he came himself to redeem the book because they were names in that book my name was in that book that is why I am crazy about Jesus Christ that is why I don't play with this God that I serve that is why I am passionate about him and I tell my children there is no hope for you anywhere I don't care what you stay it to become it is nothing unless this is in you once we are on this area we can get our degrees and our jobs and our professions but beyond that there's a day to be born and there's a day to die when you die your certificate becomes useless that job you don't have time for God they will replace you the next second they will not even think about you so I better get this there I better get this certificate I better get the token I better get the Holy Ghost I better break every shackle I better denounce everything and get the power let him enforce the Spirit into my soul oh it will save you when you are dying it will T you from your life it will heal you when you are sick we are not [Applause] [Music] [Applause] crazy amen we are not crazy if we are crazy we are crazy for [Applause] Jesus some are crazy for JayZ some are crazy for Michael Jackson some are crazy for whatever nonsense but we are crazy for King Jesus because he's coming back again I know my Jesus is coming back again he's coming back for me but without that I can't [Applause] go Hallelujah so he promised to restore so if you are not there you maybe see them and restoration is not Reformation so don't sit here to be reformed you better be restored you know I had a you know some in some in some families you see there are problems and the child will be in the family but it's not so welcome in the family he has the right to walk in and walk out eat and drink and sleep but he's not comfortable yeah because there are problems until you are restored amen right and the day you are restored you feel different you walk different you live different you have peace in your soul you can walk to Daddy Daddy and have a commun and have a fellowship with Daddy you can walk to the kitchen Mommy and have a fellowship with Mommy but when you are not restored treasure big time so we are looking for a restoration we're not looking for a Reformation oh just change a little bit no that's not what we are asking for we are asking to be fully restored where you can have a direct communication with Christ oh when you speak he will hear you when you cry he will answer oh that is what we are talking about church amen hallelujah as I wind down I'm I'm I'm I'm done praise God Reformation anytime there is a restoration God sends Elijah Elijah's spirit is with what restoration when Jezebel messed up Israel God had to raise Elijah the tishbite Hallelujah and when he prayed that prayer after he had reped the altar he said Lord I have done this according to Thy word that the people's heart will be 10 turn back praise God they hard heart to be restored Elijah brought back God back to Israel and when God sent the fire the people said Elijah is God he is the god they must see the restoration they must confess that the time of Resurrection has come God was brought back to [Applause] Israel oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you with me tonight Hallelujah and when Jesus came that was the mightiest Resurrection John the Baptist had to come in the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah because Jesus had come to restore all things the Pharisees couldn't understand that the Sadducees could not understand the understand that but it was time for the book to be restored it was time for the price to be paid it was time for Redemption to be completed John the Baptist had to come on the scene and when Pentecost came on the scene they messed up brought organization into the system God had to send a restoration but in Joel 1 when you read the scripture in Joel 1 he told them he said tell your children let them tell their children and their children's children that what the caterpillar had left the lucos had eatting the word of the Lord came onto Joel to tell them the of the time that what the caterpillar left the Locust has eaten what the Locust has left the power has eaten what the power left the caner woman has eaten just to tell them the rotness of the time the deadness of the time praise be the name of the Lord but he told them what to do Anda hit it yesterday call for a solemn assembly let the ministers go wailing and crying and praying oh there's something that can be done because the enforcer must drop down to bring back a restoration oh come on now come on now come on now and in Joel 2 he returned back and told them praise God he said now you know what blow the trumpet come on blow the trumpet blow the trumpet let them hear your shout let them hear your Victory before he's going to do it let them hear it because I will restore to you to you all all the years not part of it all the years I am going to restore what the P destroyed I will restore what the caner worm destroyed I will restore what the Locust are eating I will restore and he had to send Elijah the prophet in our day to bring us back the word and Elijah told us that four death Messengers destroy that tree oh Hallelujah but thank God in the ministry of Elijah the prophet he had to take four life Messengers to restore the church back again back to life back to Victory back to overcoming back to your promises back to the praise praise God when God can flow in you [Applause] again four Messengers and Elijah Elijah's Ministry was the fourth flight that brought back the full restoration and that is where we are today we are part of that light we are the one that have been restored so he says blow the trumpet and tell them that I will restore that was prophecy Elijah has come and gone so where are where we have been restor oh come on now so blow the trumpet tonight your restoration is here and Elijah told us Hallelujah by the restoration that there is going to be a bride that was prophecy but tonight we can say there is a bride and the spirit and the bride say come come to the feast come to your deliverance come to your Victory come to your overcoming so tonight Elijah demonstrated it sister hearty right I give you your two sons those Sons were not in church those Sons were somewhere else but he said I give you and the enforcer the enforcer the Holy Spirit arrested them wherever they were it wasn't by their will it wasn't by their mind F and brought them right [Applause] back is there anything too hard for the Lord we are under a promise when Elijah restored back that place God restored back the altar he said Lord I have done this according to Thy word and we are doing it according to the word of Malachi 4 he Pro PR is a restoration but in that restoration you have nothing to do with it say you are not the seed he said the word in you is the seed and that is what God is hunting tonight so tonight I don't care though your sins be a scallet i the enforcer I will make them Qui as slow Young Brother no no matter where how low you have stooped in sin the enforcer is here tonight to restore you back amen if you hear my word Harden not your heart this word might be for somebody young sister it might be you young brother it might be you God doesn't want to reform you he wants to restore you back to to the body of Christ that you will be counted in the body that you can have Victory amen and victory is not a gift Victory is a character you must fight to have Victory but said he will not push you through a pip and say blessed is he that overcome you must overcome are you willing to overcome tonight are you willing to be restored tonight oh glory be to the Living God you may be seated let me just hit it and we go amen so he says amen the wheat is here the wheat so the shock is there the wheat is here thanks be to God the wheat is here Christ is here he proves his word it is the truth the wheat is here is maturing now laying in the presence of the son not any man May touch it no man can touch that whe he is the enforcer he is picking that seed into his Ghana not any man May touch it is pulling away we have nothing to do with it you have nothing to do with your salvation you have nothing to do with your Redemption you have nothing to do with the saving grace of God if God ever sends his love to the church it will not be by our obedience I'm not telling you to to to obey I'm telling you to believe I'm telling you to surrender I'm telling you to come to the restoration of your seed you must come amen you must make that choice because remember in the garden he told them two trees eat all that you want but this one don't touch but he didn't put a chain on their hands no on their feet to say that the tree is 10 ft away so I'll give you a chain 8 ft so when you even want to get to that the 8 ft you can't try he gave them free moral agency they could walk around the tree and T the tree and thee looks ni but he said we shouldn't eat they had to make a choice in this time of restoration you have a choice you want to be healed tonight amen it's your choice amen you want to go free tonight amen is your choice but he is here to meet you at the point of your decision hallu GL you want to breakr tonight is your choice but the holy spirit is here and all we can say is Lead Me

thank the Lord for his grace for his love for how he put it together and it was he who is the one who put it together you know and uh one of the questions we were asked is what the theme of the

entire meeting and he was able to share from his heart how many appreciate our precious brother Shem Ali A true servant of the Lord a Statesman elder brother the Shem we appreciate you being here with

to sending him away and for saying that you know identifying that we just want to be the on that was standing there when he appeared and the platform is not a platform for man but the platform for

said when he went to India and the spirit the presence of God came now people began to cover themselves because the Holy Spirit brought a certain behavior and it didn't matter what the culture the nationality was you know there comes a point when the spirit comes upon you you forget your American you forget your you forget your Trinidadian you forget your tobagonian you forget wherever you come from because we are caught up in a higher realm and recognize we come from God and we're going back to God and the spirit makes us behave a certain way maybe you might jump like this but at least if
