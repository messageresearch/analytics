our souls to receive from thee that when we leave this place father we be a better people to your kingdom bless the reading of the word the hearing of it and the preaching of it to your glory in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen amen you love him so as we turn to the scripture we're going to look at three portions of scripture amen amen we're looking at the book of uh 1 Chronicles chapter 13 1 Chronicles 13 verse one we're going to read the whole chapter amen so and David consulted with the captains of of thousands of hundreds and with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you and that it be of the Lord Our God let us send abroad onto our Brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel and with them also to the priests and the Levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the AR of the of our God to us for for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul and the congregation said that they would do so so the thing was right in the eyes of all the people and David gathered all the Israel all Israel together from shho of Egypt onto onto the entring of hmer to bring the Ark of the Lord of God from Ker [Music] and David went up and all Israel to Bala that is which belong to Judah to bring up then the Ark of the of God the Lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose names is called on it and they Carri the Ark of God in a new cat out of the house of [Music] ab out of the house of Abad and us and hoseah dve the cat and they David and all Israel played before God with all their might played played played before God with all their might and with singing and with harp and with salry and with timbrell and with symbols and with trumpets when they came onto the threshing floor of chidon usza put forth his hand to hold the ark for The Oxen stumbled and the Lord's anger was kindled against us and he smoked him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God and David was displeased David was displeased because the Lord had made a bridge upon usza wherefore that place is called perusu to this day and David was afraid of God that day saying how shall I bring the Ark of God home [Music] alone so David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David but carried it aside to the house of OB the and the act of God remain with the family of obom in the house three months and the Lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had amen amen Mark chapter 7 verse 5-7 then the Pharisees and the scribes asked [Music] him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with un unwashed hands and he answered and said unto them well has Elias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written thou the these people honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me how B in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men praise the Lord and our last one is Isaiah 40 verse 30-31 even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint may the Lord add a blessing to the of his word shall we pray father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray you send your anointing upon it father take us out of the way and speak to your people this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen and amen amen so you love him amen there's no better place to be than the house of the Lord amen amen as you may be seated you welcome one and all so there's no better place to be than the house of the Lord there's not a time to be alive than this time is the closing of the world's history usering in of the [Applause] Resurrection be a believer in this hour is a blessed time is a blessed thing we are a privileged people to live to see the coming of the Lord to see the outpouring of the Holy Spirit back in the church again to see God tabernacl in the people that God can take on flesh and lead the people to his glory there's no better place no better time to leave than in this time and I'm so glad that he brought me in this hour I am so glad that he brought me to leave and be a witness in this hour when all things are failing when demon powers are out on release but God chose me to be his right he chose me to be a witness he predestinated me in this hour to overcome this principali overcome these powers that I will be a witness to his glory praise God hallelujah you may be seated so for a title today wait upon the Lord amen wait on the appointed time and season so wait upon the Lord wait on the appointed time and season because every promise is going to come to pass but it's not going to come to pass according to your expectation is going to come to pass in his time in his season and last week the Lord brought us to a place the foundation of our faith to let us know that amen our faith is hinged on Revelation amen so he he told the disciples who do who do men say that I am amen and they were eager to say what others said about Jesus but it had to be revealed to you so Jesus turned around and ask them who do you say that I [Music] am and there was silence in the church so Peter rose up and said in Matthew 16:8 thou are the Christ the son of the Living God and in Matthew 16:18 Jesus said thou are also Peter amen I am but you also Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of will not Prevail against you may be seated so God as a church make no mistake about it God has a church God has a church that he will build himself and that church will be built on Revelation revelation of his word and revelation of who the church knows his word so who do you say that I am today oh you may be see it Hallelujah God is going to build his church amen and the Gates of Hell will try the Gates of Hell will come against that church but thank God Jesus said the Gate of Hell will not Prevail and so it is time that the church know who she is and who is the church they called out the separated the elected The Chosen praise God Called to his name how are you called before the foundations of the world he put your name there that you would come out today and receive the word and believe the word but the word has got to be manifested Oh Glory so God is looking for a people that will manifest that word praise God so we're going to take a lesson this morning you may be seated amen amen wait on the Lord wait on the appointed time and season praise the Lord hallelujah now God's church is built on Revelation and so the time of belonging to church is over the time of just coming to church is over because the pyramid is narrowing it's going to come to that needle point love must be in your heart oh because he first loved me he put me here that I could also love him back and who is he he is the word today so every question has his answer in the word every Behavior has it manifestation in the word every expectation has his manifestation in that word praise go and that word has got a time has got a season that it must be manifested so you know David is a very special man praise the Lord you may be see amen David David was a man after God's Own Heart David was a friend of God God loved David so much but David was also another careless leader he could follow after his passions he had so much desire to do good to the Lord to Avail himself in service for God and in that overzealousness David made some mistakes praise God but God's word is God's word and God doesn't change his mind about his word when he says what he says when he says it make sure it carries it to the letter God you may be seated so here was David trying to bring the Ark of the Lord that was taken out of Israel and David said when Saul was King we didn't make the effort to bring it back Saul just left it there in a foreign land but as for me we must inquire we must restore back back to is rightful place David had the right motive he had the right objective but his approach to it was wrong praise God because God had a right person that David needed to inquire from but the bible say that David he consulted with the captains of T of thousands of hundreds so he contacted military because his idea was if we go for that act there's going to be there's going to be a resistance and the only people that will fight will be the Mighty Men of Al so let's take some thousands of hundreds of military men once the military agree with me we will have the victory that was man's thinking praise God then he contacted with every leader of Israel and then after he had contacted these people he brought it to the congregation and said that if it be of the Lord Our God let us also send that information to all our Brethren abroad and so they did that and they went ahead and they brought the AR but they fail to contact the prophet of the land because naan was alive naan was God's naan was God's voice but David left naan out of it and relied on M praise God hallelujah hallelujah so his motive was right SE that his objective was right but God wasn't looking to David's objective David's objective had to come in line with his word but David couldn't wait amen and went his way and we saw the Calamity praise God that fell but they carried it number one They carried it in the wrong place They Carried the AR of the Lord on the wrong pedestral it was supposed to be carried on the shoulders of the Levi they Carri it praise God on a cat they made a new cat for it they made a modern cat for it praise God and God was not pleased with that so the prophet said here in trying to do God a service without in being his will he said now notice there in following God this to all of us now in following God now I want to kind of Jud this in your mind we must keep this in our mind in trying to follow God Amen to keep God's Commandments to do anything right for God to do a service correctly to do God a service correctly are you get me now you want to worship God worship Him correctly you want to believe the word you got to believe it correctly you got to live the life you got to live it correctly to do Serv to do God service correctly there is five musts to do God service correctly so go in looking at your motive go a looking at your objective go a looking at your the reason why you do what you do but it must follow these five must so the now David was doing God a service he was doing everything he know to do except living of God so everything David did was right but he left God out of the picture and a lot of us we are crying for Revival we are crying for Dynamics we are crying for a breakthrough in the spirit but we are leaving God out of it all like David made the mistake here see he was doing something something right something good for the people something good for the church but there is five masks I want you to remember these no matter how sincere A man may be in doing it doing a doing God a service this these five months must be there the first it must be his time to do it so you got to find the time of God to do whatever you want to do for [Music] God oh are you with me this morning amen it's going to be in his time doing a service for God you are waiting for the promise wait on God but you must wait on his time and wait on his season you must wait on God on his time to do it so you are praying you must wait on the Lord don't take a shortcut wait on God on his time it must be on God's time it must be on God's season it must be his will at his time Abraham had to wait 25 years after the promise but had to come at God's time at God's season is a must do a service God tried Abraham in that period God tried Abraham but Abraham had to wait Abraham had to endure Abraham had to believe Abraham had to hold on until it was God's time don't be in a hurry don't be in a hurry wait for God's time because his promise is sure once you wait upon Him He will bring it to pass in his own time oh you may be seated amen first it must be his time to do [Music] it you can't do it in your own time so to everything there's a time and a season and we must wait on God's time we must wait on God's season I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and it's not happening well God promised God promised that when you ask you will [Applause] receive praise God so I am waiting because I know I have asked of him and he's faithful to his word he is going to answer me at the right time it must be in his time it it can't be in your time glory to God hallelujah hallelujah it must be his time to do it so when God told Noah you may be see amen God told Noah it's going to rain the ask Noah how to get a revelation that this voice that he has heard it will not fail because it's God's voice it didn't matter the circumstances it didn't matter the technology of the Season it didn't matter who was saying what Noah believed the word and Noah went on to obey the voice and Noah buil the ey my Revelation Upon This Rock I will build my church Hallelujah it didn't sound like rain was coming but God said so in his own time the rain will come but Noah had to make ready for the [Applause] rain Oh Glory to God God Amen so Noah made ready for the rain he built the ark may be seated and then after he built the ark he had to preach for 120 years God has spoken Noah called a revelation and he stood on that Revelation he wasn't revealed to the family it wasn't revealed to the whole nation it was revealed to Noah the individual but being a prophet of the age he had to bring the word for that age it is going to rain God has made preparation he's made a preparation by way of the ark that it is going to rain run into the ark but they doubted it they didn't believe it they made fun of Noah they disbelieve Noah they disobeyed Noah but God had an appointed time because Noah was doing a service for God he wasn't doing it out of his will he was doing service in the will of God so God had to B no up when you do God's will no matter the opposition no matter the trial no matter the storms no matter what the devil brings your way God is going to back it up because you are right in the will of God wait on that promise don't ever shiver God has spoken it stay on that word in his own time he will bring it to pass you may be seated amen amen so here was Noah at the right time when all the scoffers all the mockers all the church members all the unbelievers refused to obey God after 120 years told Noah by Revelation go get the into the Act 2 by [Music] two and Noah was getting the animals in can you imagine it was only in in the Garden of Eden that we know that Adam could speak to the animals and they obey him he was only the gun of Eden that The Lion and the lamb could lay together and here was God telling Noah get the animal 2 by two think about it today the lion was there the tiger was there the lopers were there the Lambs were there the goats were there the dogs were there the rabbits were there every animal today was there God had to preserve life in his own time he brought back power on Dominion was in the grips of Noah and when Noah spoke the animals obeyed him because Noah was doing a service after God's Own [Applause] will With God all things are possible so don't care about what the scientist is saying don't care about what human reasoning is saying there's going to be a bride there's going to be a 700er Revival but we are waiting on that promise and at the time and at the season there shall be a manifestation there shall be a bright Revival there shall be oh a PR Revival it's going to be in his time it's going to be in his season you may be seated so Noah brought the animals in and all of a sudden they were laughing at Noah oh Noah all your converts are animals you couldn't even get one person to believe your message Noah God but Noah was doing a service amen he was working in the will of God he was doing God a service by God's laid down principles and all of a sudden the door was shuted Oh Glory to God and as it was in the day of Noah so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen May seated he amen glory to God hallelujah so Noah build that Ark and when that door was shut it was shut in his God's Own season it must be in a season it must be in his time are you following that so God gave us these examples like Noah like Abraham to know that you must act when it is God season to [Music] act so knowah how to act right there it was God season for him to act it was God's time for Noah to act and we must also act when it is time to act when it is time to get the Holy Ghost we must get the Holy Ghost when is time to drop our Arts we must drop our art when it is time to love one another we must love one another it is in God's time [Applause] praise God hallelujah you may be seated so number one must be in his time it must be in his season you get it now amen paragraph 114 amen amen so one it must be in his time and in his season number two it must be ACC according to his word that has been spoken so to do God a service it must be according to his word so you can't pray it's like a prostitute going to sell her body and he's praying that God should give a good success God ain't going to listen to that prayer because it's not according to his way do you get my point now so it's going to be in his time and it's going to be in his what spoken word it must be according to his word that has been spoken say it must I don't care how well you say it ought to be I don't care how it ought to be or that ought to be or this ought to be is got to be according to his word it's got to be according to the word it can't come according to anything so God said there shall be a bride it's going to be according to his word he said there shall be a seven tunder Revival is got to be according to his word oh glory to God is going to be according to his word he said wait till the seven tness his voice to that group that can take the word and hand it there is got to be according to his word hallelujah oh glory to God Amen going to be according to his word glory amen oh so we can't get the promise you may be see we can't get our prayers answered we can't get a Revival outside of his word is got to be according to his word so he says worship preed the Holy Spirit he said that lukewarm spirit is an antichrist spirit so there's going to be a people that must overcome the Antichrist spirit and must be on fire must be worship is got to be according to the word [Applause] am so you come to church your worship your service must be according to the word then you are doing God service according to his [Applause] will it's going to be according to his word when you stand praying forgive it's going to be according to his word are you getting me now amen remember we go to get Revelation that's why we started last week the foundation of our faith Matthew 16:18 on this rock I will build my church and the gate of Hell will not they will come against it but they will not Prevail you get it now amen you may be seated so number one in his time number two it must be according to his word so I tell a lot of people oh God told me this how when you check it by the word then you find out that it's contrary to the word no doubt you have heard a voice no doubt you have heard a voice but that is not the voice of God how do we know is not the voice of God we compare it with the word if it doesn't t with that word forget about it praise God David never heard from God David went by his own idea he went by his own intellect if David had heard from God the prophet Nathan would have told David it is time to bring back the Ark of God but David went according to his own thinking went according to his own passion and desires which was good his motive was right his objective was good to restore the Ark of God back to Israel it was a good thing but you've got to wait on God to be led by God to be moved by God You' got to wait on God oh glory to [Applause] God it's going to be according to his word amen amen we thank God you may be seated so number one his time his word r said it must be given so it must be given not just wake up and do anything you want God look Heaven is very orderly everything is playing according to his purpose the sun can just get excited and say today I want to visit the Earth I'm coming down lower than I'm supposed to be there's a Time the feather he goes from the earth the cooler the becomes you wake up and you are looking for pullover and blanket the sun is gone further away from the earth the closer it gets to the Earth get and the heat weather is to hot and we drinking water everything has a time and a season so has God's word go a time in the season there's a time we are children but the time has come once I was a child I as a child that was a time and the season but now I put away now we put away we put away childish things now we are moving to Perfection now we are moving to the Deep things of God time and [Applause] season number three you may be see that it must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by [Music] amen so God has chosen all of us for a purpose for a purpose and he is to do his will and we are to do his service according to that will so we can't do it outside of his purpose and we cannot do outside of his will are you now is got to it must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by so David had to wait on the prophet naan not according to his own thinking because God's voice for that day was the prophet Nathan amen didn't rely on the captains of the army he wasn't on the leaders of Israel it wasn't on the people it was on the prophet so David had to hear from the prophet David had that desire he needed to consult the prophet and he rejected the person God was to do it by and went by the army and David failed he couldn't bring it back he had to keep it in the house ofad praise God hallelujah so God has got his way that is why we must be careful it's got to be according to his word according to his time according to the person he has chosen by to do that will amen that is why said that is why the church has failed that is why ministers are failed that is why ministers are failing because they didn't go into it right that is why we have a scrubed heap of [Applause] ministers but there's going to be a Revival amen because God has got a people that he has chosen to do this revival by they will be loyal to the word they will be loyal to God and they will be loyal to his word they will stay true to God and they will bring the word unadulterated to the people and the word will produce the bride that word will produce a it's going to be a bride God has got a people so doing go a service it must be according to his will you may see that that's why the prophet said there's churches churches there Pride but he came back and told him praise Amen in Mark 57 I mean Mark 75 said thees and the scribes ask him why work not thy disciples according to the traditions of the elders no the God's church is not built on tradition of the elders it is built on his word it is built on Revelation of his word hallelujah he answered and said unto them well has Elias prophesied of you hypocrit Hypocrites as it is written these people honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me how beit in vain do they worship me so we are not here for vain worship no we are here to do the will of God it must be in his time it must be in his season it must be by his word it must be by the person he has chosen to do it by he going to be a bride the Revival doesn't come by the preacher the Revival come by the people it must be by the person he has chosen to do it Hallelujah so it is time the preachers will get out of the way and allow the Holy Spirit to flow through the people to bring forth that seventh under Revival so we should stop binding the people stop binding the people to ourselves no man has a right to find the people to a che tradition no man has a right to bind the people to a change Doctrine God reveals himself to his people and upon that rock I will build my church amen it's going to be by the word watch how these false ones they bind the people to themselves by fear remember is going to be by the word and we are bringing the word to let you know that not all Israel is Israel not all churches are churches not all bride is bride there's got to be a bride in his time in his season according to his word by the person he and those people chosen will point the people to the word because is by one Spirit by one Spirit by one Faith by one Doctrine by One Love by one father we are all baptized into one body there is no division in the body of Christ [Applause] in vain do they worship me you may be seated praise God hallelujah so the prophet said so we've got three now right must be in his time and in his season must be according to his word spoken must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by said I don't care how my dignitaries there is King David just as great as any of them he was King over the nation but he had a way of doing it and he had told them how he would do it but they failed to do it it must be according to his word according to his time the the the fourth one according to his program you get it now amen it must be according to what his program so God told Moses go to Egypt and get the people out because I'm going to send you as a deliverer God had to roll out a program for Moses Moses didn't say yes I'm going now because I already tried it and failed but now that I've heard the voice I'm going No Moses said no lord I can't do it did I tell you something amen Mo said no I can't do ites looked for every excuse not to do it it's a fearful thing to lead God's people it's a frightful thing frightful to lead God's children if you truly have a heart that God has spoken to to lead his children he will run from it because that is his purchased blood Souls of men God has put in your trust and so God must roll a program for you to follow and it cannot be by your own desires and your own wishes it's going to be by God's program and you are put in a state to follow the word that word becomes your defense that word becomes your blueprint he has called The People by his word and he has appointed you by the word to roll his program to bring the people to unexpected end so if you come by the word the people come by the word you will be working in the program of God so Moses ran away said Lord I can't do it I can't speak well go said no I'll give you a sign you hold that Rod put it on the floor it to T to a serpent take it to Egypt God had a program but God didn't tell him that James and J will be there to do the same thing but that was God's program come on church amen [Applause] ah after they did that Moses took back the rod it didn't it didn't convince Pharaoh because Moses was excited Aon Aon we are going to Egypt even though I'm afraid but God say you be my spokes person and you know what God has done God has giving me something we will show this Pharaoh so Moses was excited but God was laughing said Moses Moses Moses don't get excited amen amen so when Moses got there he was hitting his Rock his staff with all the [Music] confidence God said let my people [Music] go just like that okay prove to me he threw his road on the floor saides your God is such a cheap magician can you imagine if it is you your heart to be that was God's program you see God was giving Pharaoh a bait he was baiting he was baiting Pharaoh for his heart to be more hardened for him to disbelieve for him to doubt said no problem because remember Pharaoh was the king of the Earth at the time now pharaoh but this was the king of heaven and King of the earth so he called James and jam and and when they did it I'm sure Aon looked Ates but when he swallowed up the two had more confidence he picked up his road then Moses knew this is God's program we are going to wait upon the Lord hallelujah so Pharaoh said no no no no no no no no you know what so if you watch all the plagues Moses started to call the Egyptians were doing the same see God was God was just Ling them Ling them Ling them but Moses heard from God and the Word was God came to Moses the prophet and Moses was the person that was to do it and the time was right for God to prove his word and here was the program unfolding so bece that so when the last plague of death came Pharaoh had no control over that one because Moses praise God could speak that se of the Lord why the death Angels swept over the land God has told Moses get them to apply the token apply that token when that token is there the de angel can come through Pharaoh had no Revelation he couldn't receive Revelation and it was not written anywhere for them to learn it it was God's program that every household must apply the token so the token Brought The Showdown that was part of God's program be SE I'm almost done amen so after they left Pharaoh said take your people take your children take your animal take everything leave my land [Applause] I'm sure if Pharaoh came and saw a rack Egyptian rack he I mean Hebrew R he pick it and throw it at them take your RS and they were dancing they were singing they were giving Glory we have overcome we have overcome today byebye Pharaoh bye-bye EG we have overcome to so as they were dancing and going and Pharaoh now looked back and but who will build this project we said they should go let's go and bring them back but that was God's program because the pillar of fire that was with Moses in the wilderness had to be identified with the people oh come on [Applause] church amen so they went down to the Red Sea and God didn't tell them that the Red Sea was there when they got to the Red Sea there was the Red Sea it wasn't a river it was a sea they couldn't go forward they couldn't go back but when they turned back maybe to find another way here was Pharaoh's Army coming oh but that was God's program what did Moses say they started trembling Moses say stand still wait upon the Lord don't you shake Don't Be Afraid stand still and see the salvation of your god he has delivered you he has chosen you he has brought you out of Egypt wait upon him wait upon him but this is his time this is his season the Egyptian that you see you will see them no more stand still and see the salvation of your God hallelujah Glory Glory oh church I feel good amen I know my God is able I know the word is true every promise that he has made concerning his bride concerning you stand still don't care about the Egyptians don't care about principalities don't care about Powers don't care about forces of Darkness whatever whatever force of Darkness whatever principality your day of Deliverance has come it must be in his time it must be in his season it must be according to the word it must be according to the season the season of Change Is Here the season of Deliverance is here the Holy Ghost is here it's time for your deliverance time for your healing time for your breakthrough it is in his time in his season oh trust and Obey trust and Obey today there's no other way to be happy in Jesus than to trust and Obey glory to God amen amen hallelujah because God had made a promise you may be seated and it must be according to his [Music] program so don't worry everything that you are going through some through the wat some through the fire some through great trials but all through the blood amen hallelujah [Music] Glory thank you Lord amen we are [Music] waiting in his time in his season according to his word according to the person he's bringing it by and according to the the program five months we cannot break but go by according to doing the will of God are you getting it now amen amen amen program and here was Moses they cross the Red Sea part of the program but you see in the midst you may be seated I'm taking my time in the midst of that God did all those wonders in Egypt did all those wonders at the Red Sea and they knew that God truly was with [Music] Moses why he must it must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it so the knew Moses was chosen to do it so they knew they were working in the program of God which is the fourth step the four M but there was still the Wilderness to try them to prove them to vindicate them to show that they were truly [Music] [Applause] Believers so that program had just begun at the right sea Into the Wilderness and the program was a process of 40 years in the wilderness but that was God's in that program God wanted to get all the old rebels out amen so why are we not getting Dynamics and we have been in the M all these years and the power is not coming is going to come but we got to wait wait on the Lord wait according to his time wait according to his season is going to come but once we are waiting he trying you once we are waiting he's proving you once we are waiting he is forming the word image blessed is he that overcometh it's all according to the program of God are you getting it now amen bece so number one time and season are we following number two according to his word number three according to the person that he chooses to do by number four according to his program okay number fiveam says and it must be by the person he has chosen to give it by and to do it see take somebody he said Moses tried to run from it and Moses said take somebody else but God chose Moses to do it he said many of them Paul tried to get away out of it and many others but it's got to be by the person he chooses to do it by so that is why we we read The Prophet's message amen I will send you Elijah the prophet God a say no Pastor to no church you get it now God is sending his word according to three he sent the word To His prophets then we will pick from that Prophet go to the angel take that little book eat that little book up and prophesy again it's going to be by the prophet it must conf first to His prophets the word of God must come to His prophets the Lord God will surely do nothing until he reveals it to his servant the prophet Amos 37 you see so this is the fifth one and the prophet must be Vindicated by the word so number one in his time and season number two according to his word number three by the person which is the prophet number four by the program then number five it must be Vindicated so Moses was called out Vindicated he proved to the people that God had called him to bring them out of Egypt and after God's program oh they work in God's program Moses died God raised up Joshua part of that program Moses my servant is dead rise up and take the people across that was still God's program indicating that God has chosen his people [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah and that Prophet must be a Vindicated by the word of God there is your five must is got to be that way it's going to be that way so you and I we are doing service let's bring it home I am a believer I am doing service I am doing service to the Lord it must be according to his will because you don't want to do a service that is not according to the will of [Music] God so bunch of lazy Christians who don't want to pray [Music] you must make time to pray it is in his word pray without season so you must pray all the time a prayerless Christian is a powerless Christian when you are powerless you are open to principalities you are open to Powers you are open to force of Darkness hallah we don't come here to say we are casting out Devils we are casting out witches we are casting out but they are real demon powers are real said there's a real Satan there are real witches there are real principalities but you need to be fortified and the weapon of the Christian is prayer prayer prayer Pray without season you've got to pray all the time in order to be protected in order to be shielded we must pray in doing service you want to be you want to be you you you want to be protected under the blood you must protect your life all the time you must protect your standing because Jesus told Peter Satan want to sift you he said but I have what I have what I have prayed for you Jesus protected Peter with prayer and things are not going well for me well I tell you principalities and Powers have engulfed you and have faced you round it's time to break them it's time to break the Yol it's time to break them up it's time to break every Bond of Satan every principality and power in your life is time to break it because the devil is here to kill he said to steal he said to destroy but we have been fortified our weapon today is the weapon of prayer and it's according to his word so we must pray number three according to the person he has chosen by to do who has he chosen to do it is he your pastor to pray for you you must you are the person so that is why all these pray for me pray for me pray for me [Music] Ministries forget about that foolishness you are the person God has chosen in this hour to pray stand there and pray let prayer be part of your life you are doing service to God in his will be a prayer house be a house on fire that when you pray heaven will open up [Applause] oh church amen amen and it is it according to his word he said pray without season Jesus himself prayed and he prayed for the church that we will be one according to his word pray for the unity of the FL pray for the manifestation of the sons of God you may see that a lot of us don't know how to pray because we don't read the word you get it now when you are praying you are only talking to God how do you talk to God you keep a conversation going you must show your gratitude that's why Jesus in teaching them how to pray say our father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name what was he doing he was giving God praise he was giving magnify you got you see you got to know how to pray get in the spirit to pray a lot of Christian don't know how to begin to thank him first thank him bless his name someone say we are praying for 1 hour people talking talking talking talking open ey look at the clock it's not even 5 minutes if you are really in the spirit of prayer 1 hour is too small you even know what time you are finished Because by the time you set prayer topics one hour is too small by time you start thanking God for who he is then you begin to thank him for what he has done for you begin to thank him for how he has healed you how he has delivered you how he has brought you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light oh how he has sent you the prophet all the precious promises begin to thank him for your family thank him for provision thank you for prote by the time you finish just thanking God Alone one hour is up after thanking him then you begin to bring your supplication begin to bring your request H begin to pray for one another imagine you go on your knees and you start to take everybody one by one begin to pray for every family one is too small not just pray because you have to say words Paul caus that vain repetition thank you Lord and thank you Lord God Jesus and thank you Lord what are you saying no talk to God talk to God prayer is your weapon are we doing service to God Amen are we waiting on the Lord hallelujah and waiting for his time and his season so we got to do service to him that it will be acceptable to him one of it is prayer and when you are praying begin to remind God of his Word of Promise to you Lord I am weak Lord I am my my body is failing me Father according to your word they that wait upon the Lord they shall red their strength they shall Mount up with wings as of eag Lord I know as I wait upon you I am trusting only in th Mar I know you renew my strength begin to quote the word back to him [Applause] you get my point now so you you better get in the word read the word and you can get the word to remind him of his word Lord this trial it looks like everything is failing in my life but you said the thought you have concerning me [Music] me now begin to quote the word you say you will bring me to unexpected end and not in you there's no death in you there is life in you there is peace in you there is joy in you there is righteousness in you there's Victory when you begin to go that way brother hey you will not want the song leader to come you will take this place into a Revival with prayer and how can the devil sit on your mind when you are charged up in prayer God is peace God is life God is love so if he says and I will bring you to an expected end do you think that God will bring you to to defeat or he will bring you to to to sadness no he'll bring you to all that is God so that expected end is every positive thing you can think of be seated that is God's program for you Church get into the word get into the word amen amen amen amen so we pray that God will bring us to that reality we must be buil we must be built on Revelation not on our imagination walking defeated no we can't walk defeated we must rise up and do God a service according to his will amen amen so let's go on let's take David and close up but now God revealed the thing to them by David it was David that brought the attention of the returning the ACT to the people so God inspired David but what should have David done with that inspiration consulted the prophet there are so many voices in the land today especially from Nigeria Christian Christian Christian shouldn't pay tis anymore then some some already some Believers that don't like paying tis they grab it and this one they are not preaching this one then they grab that one [Music] inspiration whatever you read whatever you hear go back to the message check it with what the prophet said amen if the prophet is against what you heard no matter who is saying it no matter if angels came down when the person said it forget about it the prophet is the absolute but the br's message is the absolute let me say it with Clarity so that people don't misunderstand me when I say the prophet is the absolute I am not meaning William Braham I am meaning the message he preached the message is the Absolut not some theolog the message so whatever you hear check it with the message if that Prophet say so don't care who is against him it must come by the person that he has chosen to bring it back and that person must be Vindicated and the message is Vindicated is D of the Lord stay with it wait on The Lord Oh Glory to God hallelujah you may be seated said now God revealed the thing to them by David and by the ministers and by the people and by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and not by naan who had th serve the Lord and the Lord said he would do nothing until he showed that prophet of the age do you get it so whatever we are hoping for it must be revealed to the prophet of the age so he said wait wait till them seven tunders Al his voice to that group there is a group there is a group I said there is a group that are waiting for them seven tunders it shall alter it shall alter because the prophet said so and I am waiting no matter how long it takes I am waiting no matter how it lingers I'm going to wait for it Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah and the Lord said he would do nothing you may until he showed that prophet of the age what to do see what they did they went straight out of the word of God and put the ark upon a new cat see they went about to do it apart from God's Commandments and God's provided way that's what happened today friends that's why we've had so many great Crusades and so forth and no results no results no Holy Ghost no Deliverance why the answer is here more infidelity infidelity that is people not sincere to their marriages and relationships that's why we are so many great could say it and so forth and no results when you talk they say they say you shouldn't PR that way the message but the message is human beings that are in the message you go to conventions and young people come they're not converted there's no more message that will prick the heart of the people when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost Peter was preaching the word to the people and the Bible say and they were prick in their hearts the Revival the messages sermons should convict people in their heart that they will want to see God they want to repent of their sins they want to turn away from their ways it must break their [Applause] [Music] hearts we've had great so many great good Saints and so forth and no [Music] results more infidelity you have conventions and young people instead of seeking God hiding in Corners to do filthy things [Music] during how can that be God in the message more infidelity more sin I tell you this nation is gone not only this nation but other nations is the spirit of the age but God must get a people God must get men God called men in shape and in place to run these Devils out of the land run these principalities out of the heart of the people because it's not the people is demon powers and they must be set free and the Holy Ghost is here in this time in his season in his program to set the people free we must get God back on the scene is said not this nation only but other nations he said this nation like England of another age has been The Prostitute of all the rest of the Nations you see that so we must stand to be Witnesses Witnesses of the power of God Witnesses of the word the lii shoulders was the original way to do [Music] it God called men to preach this word god called men to pre the word that hasn't changed the availability of books and tastes does not warrant the setting up of [Music] churches if you disagree according to the Hebrew Book says stay there and get the things straightened up you get my point now amen that's why we have all scrap heaps along the way but God has got a briide God has got will stand up today when you disagree with the pastor you break up the church and go and start your own church somewhere you disagree with this church you break up and take when the church grows to a level then you see all kind of James and J they want to break up churches and go start their own church where God has got to call you toeach that [Applause] word it's not books and tapes it is the call of God to preach the word it's a fearful thing to trade Where Angels Fear to trade the Levites was the original way God to was God's original way to do it today they put it on a new cat see today you have rich people in the church influential people in the church that God has blessed them with money they begin to they begin to Target the poor ones in the church before you know it they build an infuence around themselves before they know they feel they can preach the word before you know they feel they can put the quot and C together before they know they take part of the church out and we have so many of such churches in this ccil but God has still got God called men is not bringing the people is not packing the people to f the church but the Holy Spirit bringing his word to the people's hearts that there can be a manifestation of vindication of living [Music] [Applause] reality be seated amen and because it happens that way no room for Unity they will stand against Fellowship stand against Unity because they don't want the spirit to get through to the people new cat now it will never work remember Elijah and the B prophets when it came to the fundamentals of sacrifice they knew how to lay the altar they knew how to prepare the sacrifice they knew how to cry and call [Music] fire are you getting it now amen but fire only Comes In God's Time according to his word according to the man that he has chosen to do it by according to his program then the fire come to vindicate so the Holy Ghost is coming said it will never work they didn't consult the right way so they got out about it and went about it in the wrong way and that is what happened today when men no matter how sincere they try to do him a service outside of the provided way of revealing it they always mess it up God sets it in his own way no matter how sincere you try to do it outside of that you will mess it up God is calling us back wait on him don't run ahead of God wa on God amen amen wait on God oh and the prophet said look today at the big Crusades you wonder why I ask myself sometimes I ask myself questions why why why why why why can't we see the the outpouring of the Holy Ghost why can't we see people really come to revivals and leave the place filled and satisfied [Music] look at the big Crusades that we've had across the land just tickling like it's like somebody in the room suffering and they want outside to know that he's enjoying and be tickling and be laughing be knocking glasses together said look at the big Crusades that we have had across the land is proving that is being in vain we are getting people converted filling up the church pking the people in the church the church is fing today we have 100 tomorrow we have 200 say it's in vain said didn't Jesus say in Luke 7:7 in vain do they worship me in vain did David bring the AR up in vain did Ahab train them prophets ah in vain did Bam take that money teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men he said them people are really [Music] sincere what I wanted to get today is not your motive is not your objective it must be by God's word for him to prove it look at B Ahab and Jehosaphat je he wanted to go around to Ramon Gilead there was another one like David and he invited Jehoshaphat to come and help him oh let's go and take back that land hallelujah amen and when he came J looked at it and all the 400 prophets of B they had prophesied oh go the Lord has given it to you but je a Son of God a True Believer say something is wrong how can they all be saying the same thing is there no one that speaks for the Lord have you consulted him ah said yes there is one you consulted him oh he doesn't speak good for me it's not about speaking good for you it's about speaking what the Lord has said it's about declaring what heaven has declared it's about declaring that se of The Lord Oh Glory to God Amen so Jehosaphat said let's hear when he called him bece he said oh yeah go the Lord is with you just like the other 400 but jhap knew that he wasn't from the Lord when they pressed him said I see Israel scattered didn't I tell you didn't I tell you that this guy whenever he comes around here seven Thunders didn't I tell you about this seven thunder guy but did the prophet say it the prophet say the seven ters will be your Revival he say the seven ters will give us Faith he said is always that guy against me say well take him and lock him up cut him off I'll go and come back and deal with him Mah said if only you come back if you come back God hasn't spoken to me there's going to be a manifestation but we got to wait for it don't be in a hurry be in a hurry the Prophet The russan Mighty wins they didn't move him the F shaking campaigns didn't move that Prophet the Russian Mighty winds did not move the prophet what moved him was that still Small [Music] Voice and we thank God amen amen so the B said the people are really here there's no preacher on this Earth including the pope who doesn't want to make Heaven nobody is taking a stand the way they are taking a stand because they don't want to make Heaven they are all sincere on the doctrines they are holding on to and they are doing with the right motive and the right objective thinking they are right in the way very sincere and very honest not to leave the people astray but you see it's got to be by the word no matter how sincere it looks if it is contrary to the word throw it away and line up with the word do you get it now amen praise God hallelujah so them people are really sincere they are so sincere said that don't mean nothing our sincerity don't mean nothing Seven Day Adventist and all those calls get out there on the street and do things that one of us wouldn't do Catholics stand on the corners and beg and so forth others like that we billion time billion time billions of dollars still Beg For It sincere no doubt churches go and preach and so forth and ministers stand in pull pit and do everything they can do to get new members into their church but it it's a new act days but it's a new AR like David said there is only one act to follow that is the word of God there's only one act to follow the Act the message of the hour amen [Music] that is the only act to is the word of God anything contrary to that act stay away from it stay away from [Music] it any other thing apart from that word stay away from it it's on a new cat and not on the shoulders of God right stay away from the thing don't have nothing to do with it are you getting me now amen that's why I Stay full obedience to the word and it's not about sincerity and you know is the AR you may see it oh I'm done but the word is good amen so the B said the there is only one act to follow that is the word of God anything contrary to that AR stay away from it it's on a new cut and not on the shoulders of God right stay away from the T don't have nothing to do with it I thank God God give me Grace to stay true to the word St to the ark from the T seal we're almost done now the natural e fell she couldn't wait in a hurry she fell spiritual Eve fell God's bright fell fell in the garden Christ bright fell in Rome by the same reasoning against God's word she also fortified her right of virtue to Satan which we found in the breaking of these seals that that was Satan and still is Satan there in the church am that is why we are bring we preach sanctification that's why we pre Holiness is not is not it's not an old aake gospel because without Holiness no man can see God God a telling you are born in sin shaped in iniquity so by your birth alone you are already not in it but he has given you the word and that word gives you his program how to live holy how to live righteous how to stay faithful how to stay a witness it's not by yourself righteousness is by the word you are made clean by the washing of the water of the word you get it now amen amen amen so what what what made it the breaking of the seals prove that s it was Satan and still is Satan the Bible said that it is the very seat of Satan May SE and as he fortified her virtuous right and give them over to Satan in the Garden of Eden the church the bride of Christ did the same thing at Rome when they forfeited the Bible for their dogma and reasoning so how it t Tes you just run the types you are bound to come out right are you getting it now she forfeited her virous word the word of God when she sold the Bible and put a man there and says the church has right to change anything they want to change and they've done it and the bride of Christ the Pentecostal bride sold out her virtue at n and as if to Satan in the garden in the Garden of Eden exactly then the prophet goes so God has promised this church this Pentecostal Church knowing that she would do it like he did Eve God has promis the Pentecostal Church said do you believe that she has sold her birth rights she saw her bir before her vir when she left over there do you believe that then what good is a Creed not based on this Bible the prophet goes on so they sold out their B right not only the Methodist is said not only that Methodist Baptist Presby Pentecostals and the rest of them have sold their birth formed a denomination Rome what made her do that she formed a denomination and put man at the head of it no matter what God says you've got to do it the way they say do you get it now and they come no matter what no matter what God says amen amen no matter what God says you got to do it the way they say well what is it it is nothing in the world but spiritual prostitution so we going to stay with the prophets know what anybody says what I say not my interpretation of what the prophet means prophet's English is so basic that every primary child can understand so it needs no interpretation we got to stay what with that Prophet say oh no matter what God says you've got to do the way they say do it well what is it it is nothing in the world by spiritual prostitution the wrong type of a woman yes sir Creeds Ling Creeds manmade Creeds uh seven tunders is not the seven tunders they preach seven tunders is seven ters so if you are now agreeing that the seventh ther Revelation is true just say it nobody say say what we [Music] say because we didn't say seven the prophet say seven [Music] ters we are saying what the prophet said and if you announce saying it well the prophet said it and we thank God you are now saying it Li then she became when she did that she became a wh to God and her daughters has done the same thing said Christ wants his wife pure with the word pure with the word that is why God Wants You in doing his will in Waiting upon God you have to remain pure with the word the way she must be be seated the psychology of human beings Women Believe what they hear sometime you see a very beautiful woman and they tell that this is the boyfriend or the husband of this woman and you like with this girl is what the man is telling her what she's hearing from him he might be useless and know nothing but she's rich and beautiful but that's the one she loves because of what he has been pumping into that's a psychology of human beings and Men also choose by what they see our eyes is our problem and the women your ears are your problem so if you take gossipers you hardly see men in inside that thing have you heard is women who have time for their ears are always that's why the serpent said did God say bring that foolishness to Adam would have booted him out of the garden spoke to Eve well the devil has still got the same trick on the church he comes with interpretation to let you hear false Creed and God is also looking at the character of the church to see is there Faith there is there virtue there is there knowledge there is there Temperance there is there patience there because he's the bridegroom he looking at the character he is looking for a church with a spot with a rink he is looking for a people that can wait on his word he is looking for a people that can believe his word that's why the prophet said The more you hear the word the more you become the way because we are the Bride of Jesus Christ so Christ wants his wife de with the word the way she must be because nothing not one thought or one GLE or [Music] anything or TI will pass from that law from that book till all is fulfilled Jesus said both Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away don't put any private interpretation to it he want the pure unadulterated amen not even a fleet I wouldn't want my wife flating not even a flat sorry I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other man and when you go to listening to any kind of Reason beyond that you are fting with Satan amen amen don't make it feel he said Don't It Make You Feel religious God wants you to stay unadulterated stay right there with the word stay right with it all right stay right with the word no matter how it looks like it my linger your promise might T but take that word upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they that wait upon the Lord wait on their church amen wait on the
