for life we thank you for strength we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy great is your faithfulness lord we don't have the words to express our gratitude for bringing us to this spot lord not simply this room but this spot in our lives and this great intersection of our journeys that you have seen fit to bring us together under the canopy of life lord under the covering of your blood that could speak better things for us and the very best of our expressions could ever say to you we thank you for your blood we thank you for the truth that has been revealed to us that has us with such a confidence in the midst of our trials with a hope in the midst of our pressures lord there are so many afflictions and the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous we have grown to understand that it is part of the process but father we all need more grace and more strength to deal with the many trials we have to deal with so i pray tonight you strengthen your people through your word lord i don't have any thoughts it's your word your love letter your expression of your thoughts that you have left with us all these years we have it in our homes we have it on shelves we have it on mobile devices but lord i pray tonight you would walk out the pages of the bible lord that this written word when in combination with the revealed word lord fire could speak into it into our lives that it becomes a living reality to us so father we commit this bible study into your hands may you bless those that are here bless those that would join us and at the end of this service may we be better christians may we be better men better women lord may we become more mature more sensitive to the still small voice and we'll put away childish things and irrational behavior and impulsive behavior to be more measured christians where we think before we speak and we pray before we act father so we give this service over to you and we thank you for a finished work lord that you have already done you've already seen this service before it even took place and you know the outcome so father we we want to surrender our will to your will tonight and the lord we give you honor we give you glory and we give you thanks in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen so greetings tonight in the precious theme of jesus christ it's a great privilege and an honor to be back in fellowship one more time um in this bible study and i trust that you are having a wonderful day that you having a wonderful week and that you were able to take advantage of the holiday yesterday if you had the opportunity to have the holiday and to to break the routine of work and the schedule of life and maybe relax and take a pause a sailor it's so important to take that opportunity to rest and and there's nothing wrong with resting nothing wrong with taking a break jesus had to rest but random love to go and hunt and do different things to just just get you away from the hustle and the bustle you know it's so easy to get caught up in a in the race some people call it the rat race and the the living of life in a schedule and a piece and these things so these interruptions allow us to pause to reflect to think to meditate to ponder to ask questions and i trust that this interruption tonight is such that we'll ask a question and we'll pause and we'll reflect and we'll think and reconsider certain things so by the grace of god i want to connect to the message from on sunday and i trust that it was a blessing to you um the transformation of peter and what it means for us i was sharing with brother over after the service that it is really a mind-blowing thing because growing up and this is my personal experience as much as you hear that the prophets and those who went before were normal we never really accepted it as normal at least for me you always felt that peter and all these men were just a bit very special we we know everybody special you know but they were just you just couldn't see you know you and them in the same category you know men of like passion and men who went through their own ups and downs and their you know their own struggles but as you go deeper into studying all of these characters in scripture you realize that every one of them had their struggles every one of them had their challenges every one of them were confronted with situations that they didn't even know how to respond and and um you know even today i was just thinking back about peter and you know the message on sunday and what he went through so i kind of want to connect with that kind of talk a little bit before i get into the substantive text tonight because by going to the substantive text it sort of has a different meaning when you understand how god used the man and what the man had to go through you know where ibanum speaks about forgot to do something you have to have men in place to do certain things you have to have men in shape to do certain things so god takes you from your background your family your job your profession you know when you see how god operates very bad i'm typed out that when god wanted to express himself in all the letters in the new testament he had to find a writer and that writer was paul paul was an educated man who was able to express certain things and when you go through scriptures even the four gospels you know and you read the book of matthew i was having a conversation on this you know that that the lord's prayer when you look at the way matthew expressed it you know he he said forgive us our debts and then and and in another book is forgive us our sins but machi was a tax collector he used the language that he was familiar with you know as a financial mind um and even in all of the books the the the the story of the talent is only found in matthew because that's that's the reference that maybe resonates with him in such a way because and all of the parallels are tied to how god used individuals in their sphere of life you know where god plays them and that's why when the prophets say god will adopt a housewife he will he will adopt the farmer he will abduct and it really in whatever place you are at you have to realize that there's no accident with god and god placed your diet for him to get the glory and for you to be a manifested son or a manifested daughter in the middle of your neighborhood when nobody else could have stood there you have a certain something to stand in your job in your family whether you are one of 29 people there's just something about your makeup your constitution your dna that has you standing and and that to me is what resonates when you look at the unlikely people who made it you know by the brand when they get to the other side you can see people who you want to know how they made it over because you know they may have been unlikely to succeed you know when you when they go to school and in your last year school you have teachers so say well this student is most likely to succeed and then you have those who you just say a prayer for them because you already don't know where they're going to end up you know but i thank god that many of us who maybe they said a prayer for us because they were not sure where we would end up by the grace of god the third pull is for the weaker ones so by coming to our little conversations around your word it's to reinforce and for us to pause and to think you know about these characters in scripture because every scripture is for encouragement every scripture is for correction every scripture is for us to get advice and for us to reference the fact that there is a precedent and precedent in law means a matter took place in the past that was acceptable in the court that could not be referenced to defend your position that's why when a when a judge makes a new ruling that has not been ruled that there was no ruling of that nature before and it now becomes accepted as pressing and it's such a careful decision because anybody in the future can reference that precedent to defend their case can i give that can i talk about that again one more time i want us to understand this whenever a judge makes a ruling on a matter for the very very first time there is no record of it your honor i want to present this case but there is no precedent there's no way you could deal with it a certain way but when that judge now makes a ruling that no is now admitted as a new president everybody who comes after could reference that ruling as a foundation for their defense so when we can look through scripture and see what david went through and what joshua went through and what moses went through and what peter went through and how god dealt with them and the precedent that was established with how god dealt with them it gives us faith courage and confidence that if god could do it for peter and for david and for john and elijah he could do it for me too can the church say amen if them brothers could make mistakes and god could redeem them my you mean god to redeem me too that to me is a great encouragement so i was there there was something that didn't get to express in sunday service and the lord had it that i just want to kind of touch some of it a little bit and the way i like to approach things with scripture is just kind of think it through and look at it as if i was there you know and you look at and i'm just going to take a few highlights before i get to it but i'm just trying to think and i want this to drive with me a little bit to when they came to get jesus and peter draw his sword and chop off the man is now this was not brother clarence in the beginning of peter's journey with the lord so before i even deal with the fact that peter chop all the man is i still trying to understand why peter still think he need to carry a weapon when he is coming to when he is under just think of it after you've seen you seen all kind of miracle you've seen what manner of man is this that even you win and he see obey him but peter still feel he need to be carrying a shank carrying a knife carrying a weapon was it for trying to process what is going through peter's mind that morning that peter decided to get up put a blade in his waist to head to service with jesus after three and a half years and that the instinctive response when they came for jesus was not pray for the brother not try to reason with a man not try to have a conversation with a man but peter decided to draw a sword and chop off the man ears and he realized the humanness of the man and as i'm studying it i'm saying but wait a minute the issue with peter is it it is almost like a child expressing themselves so so so the child say lord if you bid me to come and for that moment of glee and excitement and and and i really wonder how the other brothers used to view peter and what is the processing because it is significant and the reason i'm highlighting it again is throughout all of scripture the stature of a perfect man is a foundational truth for us god didn't have paul preach that message he didn't have matthew who preached that message he didn't have he reserved that message to this rock called peter to preach his message and i wanted to see how god worked through the man and more importantly i call it the maturing of a son because the version of peter that was going through these things and these stages one would think that after a month with jesus this is not a month with brother within him this is not a month with a with the prophet in him this is jesus one would think after a month two months six months a year in a program even at university degree is three years four years in some cases one would think that at the end of jesus ministry which is the point when they came to get jesus that peter would have ironed out certain rough parts anybody with me and it just resonates to me how much people think they know about themselves under pressure i want to just ponder this a little bit how much people think you know they all say you don't know how you will respond in certain situations and i realized that you know what brother branham said the devil will make you prove every one of these witches so you have the devil testing it and you have god approving it i want us to appreciate the fact that this thing is already a life you know and what peter's life unfolded prior to the upper room was a life that required more change so every day now i'm seeing lord what change is required of me and that should be something that drives us all because the moment you accept your present situation as the equal sign of the destination you lost the examiner you feel because it's a daily work of improvement now i want us to appreciate this and by the branham titus oh he said it was the age of the horse and buggy it was the age of the car it was the age of the airplane is the age of the astronaut and he said the whole world is making progress but the church these spiritual beings want to be moving in a previous level of operation we have made statements before in this same bible study that if you don't know something there is no excuse to not learning there is no excuse to not growing there's no excuse to not changing but it takes a desire in us to want more if we are not inspired to want more there's something wrong with our christian work because every scripture is tighter more grace closer walk deeper desire better experience blessings of the lord and the reality is as is in the natural and in the spiritual whether branham said it like this we are living under our privilege so i'm looking at the fact that peter one thing about peter peter wasn't afraid to try i just having a conversation so peter see jesus walking and what resounds apart from the fact that he had the faith to go out there peter was willing to try and he wasn't even sure of the outcome but he was willing to try so it is not just that peter had fear to know but are you willing to try to try and try again are you willing to take the risk and do what you have not done before are you willing to pick up a book and read willing to it is many things i'm a quiet person i'm a disc i'm a dad and many of us live trapped and peter was not living well i already know these certain things peter was consistent in his approach to being willing to take risks i want us to appreciate that but imam speaks about being reckless in your feet and the recklessness and faith is not doing irrational things and jumping off a building and no no no no no but it's putting fear to the test to be able to try god plead for your family find new words to speak to your children you never tried before anybody with me tonight i just laid i just pulling still from the life of peter to see maybe get to see another side of it because the pizza that started and evolved and repeated and wrote first and second peter is just a mind-blowing transformation mind-blowing transformation from the way he spoke and the way he acted and the way he walked to a measure it's almost like he took a random person and turned him into that sniper because by the time you read first a second peter there's no misplaced words it is very deliberate he has gone through some stuff that you can't move him anymore anybody with me he has been pleased he has been shaped he has been horned that even when his wife didn't cook for him he just went and lay down and meditate and god open up himself to him that was uncharacteristic of the man peter before his transformation anybody with me brother peter in every aspect of his life i'll go back to my transfiguration i'm just touching a few of these points before i get to my substantive scripture tonight i told myself i wasn't going to be too long peter sees jesus no i try to stand up there if i was there he sees jesus moses elijah and peter with the best he could face you know what this is spiritual you know this is something happening let us make a tabernacle but you know what not one not two let me make three whole tabernacles and i'm trying to understand now in principle peter was trying to reconcile the spiritual happening with his understanding i want us to appreciate this and i said on sunday lord willing the lord jesus ignored his statements but peter himself is trying to come into terms with what is happening around him and i say but why didn't god say peter the wrong doctrine why why didn't jesus punish him for saying that that statement and i tell i realize you know god when god is honing you and training you and it is not always be beat he allows us to make mistakes and it's okay to not know you know some of us parents parents feel they need this they're supposed to know but many times it is okay to say you don't know you know i hope this frees somebody it is okay to sometimes not know because peter didn't know he trying to make sense of his world last one before we get into these substances last supper all the brothers go on upstairs it did not delegate somebody to wash feet anybody could have done it nobody did it everybody with me jesus decides to start to do it now the fact that jesus start to decide to do it will make anybody uncomfortable because this is now close to the end of his ministry it's like a shocking thing to see so but i starting to feel a little guilty and thing because if jesus doing it maybe i should already do it you know when jesus gets to peter peter say lord i'm not worthy for you to wash my feet and you know and based at that point in time what peter said make sense to him i'm not worthy i know who you are and when jesus said if i don't do this if you don't allow me to do this if you don't be part of this thing when peter hear that because they were lord hear them even so don't just watch my feet you know just build me just pour this thing in and i'm just watching the child like call it childlike fear the child like understanding the childlike attitude the willingness in every single situation i realized peter whether he was right or wrong he was all in can we just appreciate that for a minute whether he fully understood or he didn't understand the significance the importance of it he was all in [Music] i mean i've shared it before in this bible study some time ago about the story of hermann cortes hermann cortez for those who study history was one of these spanish explorers who came into south or central america i believe it was into mexico or whatever it was and when he landed he told his captains here's what go burn the boots because if you're burning boats and there's no way to get back to where we come from the men now have no choice but to go forward and the reality is when you really understand and i look at this thing called all in and a hundred percent and really whatever you're doing whether it's your business your marriage your family serving the lord there's a huge difference in the outcome when you do 40 percent 50 or you go all in and the one thing i admire about peter there's so many things is pizza was a all-in kind of person i'm tired of people who always ready to give up right the training tower you know what the reason is and this is what roman cortes identified and it's also tied to peter because when you read luke 5 when peter said he left everything the bible said and follow jesus he had no backup plan it was follow jesus and leave everything else behind command court has created a situation by shutting down the opportunity for retreat it focused all of their attention on how do we win sometimes you have to figure out how to close the retreats how to blow up the bridge behind you to force you to figure out what the next step looks like i will close all this part by saying this god didn't tell adam a play-by-play ball by ball commentary advisory on how he should do and what decisions he should make and all these things adam's job was to figure it out walk by faith and figure it out it is impossible for us to know everything but if you walk by feet and figure it out you'll achieve something everybody feeling fine few little thoughts to encourage you a little bit so let's go first peter 1. first peter 1 verse 1 we're gonna spend some time in the book of first peter tonight and we'll see how much the lord will have us do peter an apostle of jesus christ to these strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia bithya elect according to the full knowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied this right in here is not the fisherman who on citizen of himself this is some solid salutation i want to read those first two verses in the amplified peter an apostle special messenger personally chosen representative of jesus christ to those elect both jewish and gentile believers who live as exiles scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia minor and bithyo who are chosen according to the full knowledge of god the father by the sanctifying work of the spirit i want to suggest that by the sanctifying work of the spirit to be obedient to jesus christ and to be sprinkled with his blood may grace and peace that special sense of spiritual well-being do you have a special sense of spiritual well-being it is it is well with my soul anybody with me tonight he said may grace and peace that special sense of spiritual well-being be yours in increasing abundance you see what i'm talking about increase and growth as you walk closely with god that is that peace be multiplied so i want us to understand grace unto you and peace be multiplied so the grace and the peace that peter is speaking about that he's extending as greetings is not something that is even fixed in time or fixed in quantity or fixed in that moment but he is saying let it be multiplied in other words let the peace that comes through this gospel be ever increasing let the grace that is associated with this gospel be ever increasing that's why as believers it is unacceptable for you to be walking around sad and depressed and frustrated and you don't know where you're going because grace and peace is supposed to be multiplying in your life anybody with me verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again under a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead i'm going to read it and i'm just going to keep going verse by verse and i want to capture it in the amplified and i want you to begin to see yourself and see now this transformed the peter as he's beginning to build up into this great expression of the revelation of his fate that he would have had by virtue of being under jesus ministry being there in the upper room being his own trials and testing on his honing so let's go blessed gratefully praised and adored be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant and boundless mercy has caused us to be born again that is to be reborn from above spiritually transformed now you see this is this is his that's that that's what i've said peter's writing is also his testimony that is to be reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed and set apart for his purpose my to an ever living hope and confident assurance through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead that's was three verse four to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faith is not a way reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein he greatly is rejoice though now for a season if need be here in heaviness through manifold temptations so in the amplifier it says in this you rejoice greatly even though now for a little while if necessary you have been distressed by various trials is there anybody been distressed by various trials so peter wrapping that all up and saying in this you rejoice graciously you know you'll greatly rejoiced because of the shielding of the power when you read the amplified from verse 4 born anew into an inheritance which is imperishable the amplified says beyond the reach of change so it means your inheritance can't even change oh you don't hear me tonight your inheritance cannot even change the promise of god about you can't even change what god have in store for you can even change hallelujah an undefiled and unfeeling reserved in heaven for you peter is just this is a foundation this is the pa even gone into the people thinking yes or no he just talking about what is reserved for you who are being protected and shielded by the power of god through your faithful salvation that is be that is ready to be revealed for you in the last time in this you rejoice greatly even though now for a little while if necessary you have been distressed by various trials verse seven let's go that the trial of your fate this should be an encouragement to you who have been holding on you who have been fighting that the trial of your feet being much more precious than of gold and perish it though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ let's read that in the amplified so that the listen to these words now so that the genuineness of your faith how genuine is your faith so now peter is talking about the quality of your feet now you remember when peter walked under water jesus asked him why i'm to your face you know why did you doubt so it shows that faith could be a resource that has declined fear could increase faith could be there for a minute and it fleets away so pretty saying here so that the genuineness of your feet which is much more precious than gold which is perishable even though tested the testing of your feet and purified by fire may be found to result in your praise and glory and honor at the revelation of jesus christ now i like verse eight whom having not seen he loves you you you you catch that we'll get it amplified shortly in whom though now you see him not yet believing this he no writing like no fisherman here in whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing let's catch that in the amplified though you have not seen him you love him and though you do not even see him now you believe and trust in him it's not what faith is not your testimony anybody with me hallelujah so whom having not seen your love so yeah you haven't seen him but you love him even now you see him not yet you believe you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls you greatly rejoice and delight with inexpressible and glorious joy receiving as the result the outcome the consummation of your faith and salvation of your souls verse 10 listen to this now peter is preaching jews and gentile alike this is a message he preaching for us and i'll show you of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you let me read it again regarding the salvation in the amplified the prophets who prophesied about the grace of god that was intended for you searched carefully and inquired about this future way of salvation so peter was saying now with an authority all them prophets who go on in the past been searching for this way that i'm talking about here now anybody with me verse 11 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify you see how deep peter's teaching is so peter is saying searching what or what manner and the spirit of christ was in them that signified when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow let's read it to me amplified seeking to find out what person or what time the spirit of christ within them was indicating as he foretold the sufferings of christ and the glories they're starting to follow verse 12 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves my lord so peter is making it clear to them that they're prophets of old they were trying to figure out if it was for them and that's why i said when i preached about paul and paul was saying we who are alive and remember paul thought he was in that to them not even realizing that he was speaking about us to come so peter is saying all them prophets will go on before we're trying to figure out what what men what manner of time and people saying it wasn't even for them and peter said it's not for that group here let's go unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us did administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent from heaven which things that the angels desire to look into my lord help us everybody feeling fine i want to read verse 12 really amplified i hope you're riding with me it was revealed to them that their services their prophecies regarding greece were not meant for themselves and their time but for you in these things the death resurrection and glorification of jesus which have now been told to you by those who preach the gospel to you by the power of the holy spirit who were sent from heaven into these things even the angels longed to look so peter was looking peter was actually tying up mysteries from before his time to show that those prophets were all pointing to now pointing to their future they didn't even understand what they were speaking about and just to think peter paul and all of them in their era were speaking also thinking that what they were speaking was going to be present tense because faith is always present tense not even knowing that they were all still pointing to this last great dispensation this gentile anybody with me you see the grace that god has kept all these years short every age and time to bring it to us now so after all of that now peter now ready to preach because he has no later foundation so verse 13 is the first time he starts to give an instruction to them he laid a foundation from verse 1 to verse 12 and now in verse 13 he now says wherefore give up the loins of your mind you see where you start with you're thinking good up the loins of your mind in the amplified it says so prepare your mind for action friends when you get up in the morning you have to prepare your mind for action you can't go to work and not be prepared for action you can't go to prayer not be be for action you can't be distracted and and and this move bother you and your mind all over the place and it can't focus on so after all of the foundation that peter laid upon them in verse 13 he now for the first time begin to exhort them on certain anyway say wherefore give up the loins of your mind wherefore good at the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ i want to read that one more time this is an encouragement to us friends wherefore girl of the loins of your mind one to be sober thirdly and hope to the end for the grace in other words don't don't stop hoping don't ever give up hope that's what you say you know don't stop believing don't stop holding on for the promise whatever you do anybody with me i want to read that in the amplified so prepare your minds for action be completely sober in spirit steadfast self-discipline spiritually and morally alert fix your hope completely on the grace of god that is coming to you when jesus christ is revealed out of this is lessons and lessons that you need to sit down go to this again many of you have not sat down and go verse by verse into his picture but i wanted to bring us a spot that you look at this transformed man who was an uneducated so to speak fisherman a rough man rough around the edges had his fault had his issue but when god changed him look we're still in the first chapter of first peter and the amount that peter already said here tying back to the prophets time back in the predestination time back into election time back into the new birth all of that optimus 13. let's go verse 14 as obedient children could you be obedient are you obedient not fashioning yourselves according to the formal lusts in your ignorance now that's powerful let me read that i want to spend another time here live as obedient children of god in the amplified do not be conformed to the evil desires which governed you in your ignorance before you knew the requirements and transforming power of the good news regarding salvation i want to read that one more time because if you really believe the truth and you really believe this is right then what driving you is as obedient children not fashioning yourself so so this is beyond saying go backslide this is beyond saying don't follow the world of them peter is saying here do not be conformed to the evil desires which you used to operate with when you didn't know in your ignorance it's one thing if you didn't know there were many things peter didn't know there were many things peter didn't understand there are many things peter say and do and act in his ignorance anybody with me but it cannot be a sit down at this level and have this kind of conversation and then go back to the former lost anybody with me tonight are we riding i i forget to check your time yes how are we doing but but but the current i would have making me time because i i'm so focused on this thing i ain't even looking at the clock so i want us to appreciate friends there has to be a line because peter could speak with firm assurance of that separation between the old man and the new man anybody with me the old loss and the new desire the old behavior and his new behavior his old walk and his new work so he's seen as obedient children not fashioning so this fashioning in the king james version which is do not be conformed in the amplified means that and i want us to appreciate this when the holy ghost when the power of god come upon your life you actually have to fashion yourself or conform to go back into the old cell phone only appreciated that is as if a chicken break out of an egg and you there trying to go back in the egg so you're twisting and you're turning and you're trying to fit back into the old self but you come out what you doing living in the old way when that hallway was 4k when he was in ignorance but the 19 ignorance tonight you know better so why you want to live as if you don't know when you really know that's why when we preach we say you don't need us to tell you where you're doing wrong you know what you're doing wrong and you they're trying to fit yourself back in the world but you don't come out you know you know too much you see too much you feel too much of the anointing you've been in too much services and your spirit move and touch your heart a certain way and yet still you have to be reminded to be obedient and don't fashion yourself you're going to wear clothes you're not supposed to wear because you're trying to go back the way you were when you were ignorant you know better you know nobody in this room can tell me they don't know when they put on you wrong clothes you wrong clothes nobody had to tell you the wrong music you know you know is the wrong music anybody with me nobody can tell you when you say the wrong thing you know you say the wrong thing because the experience of whatever level of transformation you have had has exposed you to a new truth and you could no longer operate in ignorance so peter is calling them out on it and he's speaking to believers notice this entire letter is that written to a church members or backsliders or unbelievers you know this is clearly addressed to the elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied this is not your members he is talking to people who've been through some spiritual experiences anybody with me but he's not reminding them get your mind right the pastor can get your mind right for you you have to get your mind right you have to bring your body under subjection you have to understand and identify the formal lust the former appetite the former desire when you didn't know we're not saying it wasn't that way we wasn't saying you didn't know but now you know better let the night be a line of separation hallelujah between that all walk and this conversation we are having tonight anybody with me can we go on a little bit as obedient children i want the nearest thing no no not fashioning yourselves so keep putting a level of work to the signal people working to try to fit into the world you know you're working you're trying to use the language and in the conversation and i remember in school i think it was from one up on two or something i don't even know if i tell that on them this we had no tv in the house but your boy listening to them talk body tv show and thing now but i want to come across as if i'm watching it too so i'm a good student there so i listen i listen until i know all the characters i see tv show yesterday but i must really be characters better than them because i had to study it to have a conversation with them about the tv show you have to know the characters so by time we they're talking hey boyer see what joe do boy i say but joyce something that you remember when he did so and so and so and i could go and recall joe from the episode five time ago i wasn't in but in my own way i didn't want to be excluded from the conversation but it's real work to try to be included in them so i want us to appreciate the fact that when you look at your life and how it had to fit in on your workplace and among your family gatherings and around different situations when you know better something has to bolster your back your spine to say listen the person you know know is not the same person who is a hungry years ago you know and you don't have to even explain yourself you have to justify yourself you just have to know where you stand okay let's go we're 16. actually actually let's go back we still have 14 sorry so as obedient children not fasting yourself according to the formal loss in your ignorance was 15 but as he which had called you is holy now this is a tall order this is when peter gets along it's a serious serious thing you know but as he would have called you is holy so be holy in all manner of conversation daddy mommy brother sister take that in a little bit in the amplified but like the holy one who called you be holy yourselves in all your conduct be set apart from the world by your godly character and moral courage there must be no difference in your character when you're in church when you're at home when you're at work when you're going to this shop it can't be your temper under control when you're wrongly bedridden because when you're only bedridden you're temperance it is true any time tamron's gamer yes yes you just find that gear when you're among your bedroom he's able to throw it in let's show it in yes yes use all your strength to true in that gear and but when you're not around the bedroom and you're in the workplace and somebody going to your locker somebody thinking the temperance gear just do-going you're trying your best to but the the you that come out is like peter when you still have shank is peter when he under pressure is peter in the old man come out now anybody with me but he look at the challenge peter not saying they're not called peter not saying you're not calling not elected you're not blood washed peter not accusing him of that no but he's saying i still want to push you higher after you already know the truth about who the lord jesus christ is and the fact that all the prophets of all were pointed to this aid and when they thought it was for them it was ready for you he went through all of that with them and he still come and say to them listen because it is written be holy for i am holy everybody with me let's go let's go to the next verse let's go to verse 17 and if you call on the father who without respect of persons judge it according to every man's work past the time of your side journeying here in fear in the amplified it says if you address as father the one who impartially judges according to each man's worked book conduct yourselves in reverent fear of him that fear is of him and with profound respect for him throughout i like this the time of your stay on it i love it i love it it's as if you're in a hotel this this is like a hotel you know you're just here you're staying here you have a room a little room here in this hotel called and during his stay he's saying be reverent have godly fear and because of the godly fear and because of the reverence it makes you respectful it makes you honorable it makes you conscious of what you do and say i remember saying young people years ago live as if jesus right next to you and if he is right next to you all the time and you are conscious of his presence your life will be different you know just think about it friends think of you walking into your lunch room on the job or going to the supermarket or you're going to the bank and they tell her they're wrong you know but jesus next to you i'm sure you can find a better way to say it [Music] i'm sure you could put the words together in a different structure that they could express you what you need but you're not coming across like somebody in the world anybody with me verse 18 for as much as he know again peter is building on what they have been taught he said for you know in the amplified that you were not redeemed from your useless spiritually unproductive way of life inherited by tradition from your forefathers for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers your redemption is not based on your family line is that based on your achievement is it based on what you have done or earned but verse 19 but with the precious blood of christ he's reinforcing things they already know he keeps reconnecting to foundational truths so he could push them to become better christians verse 19 but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god verse 22 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the virgin see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently verse 22 since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourself so when people say to me it's a hard life and believe in a christian i find myself you know struggling with this and have you been obedient are you taking this thing to heart and saying lord i really want to cut all these things i want to stop being i want to close the windows because the windows and the doors that are open to the enemy is what's infiltrating your house go out there come and i close the window and door for you you have to close it whether it's music books movies conversation relationships friends whatever it is it can't be we having all these services and you still want to receive foolishness and expect god to be able to bless you a certain kind of way because he is holy light and darkness can't live in the same house what are you prepared to give up to make jesus comfortable that's a reality or question accent could you pass your phone to the lord and say jesus use my phone could you check every you take whatever you want to check and friends if you had to think twice about that you need to look at your life could jesus turn on your car and wherever you playing on your radio and you driving with jesus and you write her well you know you go by some people and say well excuse place there or excuse the musica or excuse me they have an excuse if you're excusing something excuse this excuse that the excuse they say excuse me could we reach a point where there are no more excuses that your life becomes transparent what you see is what you get that is peter whatever steve peter was in peter had no deception what you see is what you get peter believed he need to tabernacle he said tree tabernacle james look at him john look at them they say we don't even know what to say they say nothing he's just transparent let's go since by your obedience to the truth god help us to be more obedient but i like when brothers say this i like him but i said i like him but that other thing i do really i really take it i don't take it on too much you don't take it on too much when we know full obedience see the entire world entirely usually token you are taking it on too much you still want to do something in your way well it's really it's it's in my house and you have all kind of excuses and god is looking at that not the pastor god looking at that since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves so obedience is tied to purification only seen that there obedience to the truth is tied to purifying yourself so every time you obey you would you're actually cleaning out your life in them i hope that resonate in your home i hope the young children get to the hobby grandparents getting i will be mamas and the fathers and the believers the church rallies are wrong this thing here what word are we obeying tonight is what we are doing in obedience to god's word our actions disobedient to god's word will god be pleased by this some of us more interested in what your boss like and don't like than what god like and don't like you're up late at night during report your update all kind of thing you're doing for natural man and god wants to be pleased to say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased that pleasing that statement that was part of what peter experienced untransfiguration witness the adoption of christ is only obedient sons getting that in them oh come on now only obedient daughters get in that not attendance in church or reading books or listening to tapes or shouting it's a product of obedience let's go still in verse 22 since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves for a sincere love of believers of the believers he's now driving further down the road i'm reading any amplified see that you love one another from the heart always unselfishly seeking the best for one another not god bless you and you're already not seeking the well-being it is a performance i always say he introduced if they really really want to do the what is the oscars for acting if you really want to really get the best actors you have to come here because people can act apart so this unfailing love of the virgin he said love one another from the heart always unselfishly seeking the best for one another going to verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible verse 23 by the word of god which live it and abide it forever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flowers of grass and the grass wither it and the flower thereof fall it away word of the lord endure it forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you let us jump into chapter two we have a little more time we want to keep driving down the road [Music] first peter two verse one again i want us to underscore reinforce and remind us who this is addressed to we're not going to be too much longer he is not speaking to random people on the street he is addressing believers but he is challenging them just as brother branham's own experience with the lord when he realized he had to be more sincere the issue was not the gift the issue was not the anointing the issue wasn't the revelation the issue wasn't the understanding of the word the issue was non-relational it's about a sincerity it's about a closer walk is about a better behavior about a better conduct peter could look back and see how he changed i'm not what i used to be but are still trying to be something more so first peter two so put aside every trace you see that word trace trace is not a thing itself you know trace is the evidence you think was there anybody hear me tonight he said put aside every trace so in other words the male is gonna know but i have a little trace you know when i see a slug on the ground and you see the little remnant that he was there anybody know what talking about he slapped no longer there believer in the mark he never traced that he was there so peter is now going deeper into the hearts and saying the malice i know he might let's go on nobody have a little a little cheese a little a little remnant the little thing that has flare up from now and then i'll get ready to close up so put aside every trace let me just fix this we're folding aside all malice in the amplified so put aside every trace of malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings in the amplified so put aside every trace of malice and all these seats and hypocrisy and envy and all slander and hateful speech so in other words as a believer hateful speech and slander and envy and hypocrisy and deceit and malice and the trace of these things should not exist verse two as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the wood that he may grow thereby in the amplified like newborn babies you should long for the pure milk of the wood so he's bringing a analogy an example uh a way to compare the way to look at at how your conduct is supposed to be so this whole concept in the message of people who sit there as if they were taking something and if by ten year any messages seniority and a guarantee of something if you're like newborn babies you should long for the pure milk of the word so that by it you may be nurtured and grow in respect to salvation ultimate fulfillment verse 3 if so be he have tasted that the lord is gracious so he said this is conditional or based on a previous experience if in fact you have already tasted the goodness and gracious kindness of the lord so he's now appealing he said because maybe this is not for you you know it's a real preaching you know he said but if you're if you would have experienced and tasted the goodness of the lord you should be able to identify with the fact that you should be operating like a newborn babe that the world never gets boring to you but it's this word that feeds you that no matter what situation you're going through in life you can find reference can be word to keep standing to keep your foot firmly planted anybody with me tonight we almost finished to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious let's read that to the amplified come to him the risen lord as to a living stone which men rejected and threw away but which is choice and precious in the sight of god verse 5 ye also as lively stones and i broadly type on sunday how peter was identified as stone or rock unshaped and he's now preaching about lively stones stones in action stones that are moving stones that are alive ye also as lively stones have built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ so there's so many things to unpack here in verse 5 but let's read it in the amplified first you believers like living stones are being built up into a spiritual house for a holy and dedicated priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable and pleasing to god truly through jesus christ so i want to underscore something here you can make a sacrifice that is not acceptable to god jesus himself when he was on earth say in vain do they worship me that's a scary thought that's a scary thought friends in vain you're in church because your sacrifice not being accepted you see how serious and grave this priestly responsibility is on us because the priest was instructed to bring the sacrifice a certain kind away a certain kind of sacrifice in a certain kind of order getting ready to close out verse 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded in the amplified behold i'm laying inside a chosen stone a precious honored cornerstone and he who believes in him whoever adheres to trusts in and relies on him will never be disappointed in his expectations friends this gospel we preach is the only thing that has satisfaction guaranteed everything else you do in life you need a warranty think about five years they give that two years a year ten years and then the best thing you get you have a time limit in it but this thing is eternal he said never be disappointed in the expectations verse seven unto you therefore which believe and i believe tonight i'm speaking to believers and we're closing out here we're going to close it out of his heat until you therefore which believe he is precious but we know that not everybody believes we accept that we have family members who don't want to hear this we have friends who don't want to hear this you have people who left church who don't want to hear this they are up to their own devices and it is only the grace of god that we can see it so we cannot judge them and rail on them it is the grace of god to us and we have to see it from the perspective that if it wasn't for the grace of god to take the scales of our eyes we would be like anybody else so we are no better than nobody so but unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the bill is allowed the same is made ahead of the corner in the amplified this precious value then is for you who believe in him as god's only son the source of salvation but for those who disbelieve the very stone which the bill has rejected has become the chief cornerstone and verse 8 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the wood my that's a serious one we closer with that one even though it's something like the word being disobedient where unto all so they were appointed now let me read the number five and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense for they stumble because they disobeyed the word of god and to this they who rejected my savior were also appointed in other words he is separating now peter those who just don't believe from those who are given the opportunity to believe but they fear to obey the word or they catch that a stone of stumbling on a rock of offense so people say well well they church people or they believe this and they have all the issues yes we have that we're not really trying to talk about that right now we're dealing here now with a deeper issue even to them which stumble afterward now being disobedient where unto all so they were appointed they were given an opportunity to walk this walk talk this talk live this life and just as in the teaching and adoption where the tutor is dispatched to see the conduct of the sun before approving for adoption to see if you're a real son or you're a vagabond remember the prophet brought it out if you could sign the father's check but the whole adoption ceremony the hearing him your secretary's gravity father was based on obedience so to this point when you compare chapter one and this point up to this one at chapter two peter was really kneeling down a deeper sense of obedience of god's word because when you know seed as obeying god's word all of a sudden you don't have issue with the pastor saying something or the assistant pastor or the elder or the deacon because if it's god's word your natural immediate instinct factory resetting response is yes lord i want to dress right i want to live right i want to do the writing if i have to repent i need to repent whatever it is i want to obey everybody feeling fine so we'll pause here for tonight i trust this little exhortation bible study would be an encouragement to you feel free to keep reading we're going to spend some time on peter by the grace of god by the time we finish here you will not only know peter the man because we're going to keep touching his life but the message of the man and what measure god gave him because every character in scripture god gave them a measure and a purpose we were not blessed to physically meet peter but thank god there's enough in matthew mark luke john acts even paul speaking about peter and peter speaking about paul and then peter's own books for us to see this unique character that i said within the context of the new testament is like a david that we could see so much of his life as a young man all the way to him saying lord if i have to get crucified not like my lord because if i'm different because i worry to because if i like my lord can we pray heavenly father we thank you tonight for this opportunity lord to talk about you and to talk about a son that you used to help us father through the message on sunday and through the continuation tonight lord we could see lord you you left all these clues and these truths and these revelations lord that came to the sun lord that would have preached this message after your faith with you knowledge temperance this statue of a perfect man this image when it is complete is the servant of god hallelujah that is pleased lord this great headstone message the capstone revelation the mystery of the warning and the shaping into the word image you took a son a unlikely apostle as it were a man who wasn't readily qualified but you qualified him by virtue of a great transformation in his spiritual and unnatural lord we can look back and see what he went through and see fractions of our lives when we didn't know and maybe we tried and maybe we gave up and maybe we let go but we could also see the outcome the expected end the planned end the result of predestination the result of election the result of calling the result of training the result of tutoring the result of being rebuked even in matthew 16 when jesus said get there behind me satan to see that peter didn't say i'll leave it in church no but he he took it and he persevered and he pressed because it was a seed in him father god made a seed in each son daughter mother father child visit a friend backslider be quickened tonight by the word lord the word that is so real to us the written and the revealed word that is such a present tense reality to us lord that at the end of the day if we were to underline the great teaching tonight it's about a new way of obedience and sincerity in our obedience a desire to look back at our obedience father because we know the prophet brought our full obedience to the lord entire word of god entitles us to the token we see peter reinforcing the purification as a blessing and a benefit of obedience and see him talking about the stone that is rejected by those who just don't believe but even lord those who were appointed to believe but struggle with the word help us to not struggle with the word tonight but to really look at our lives in our homes and our environment and our going out and our coming in may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless the fasting and the prayer meeting on friday night lord may we do our best to be obedient lord to respond to the service tomorrow night the fasting and the prayer meeting on friday night and the service is coming sunday may you bless our pastor bless the ministry the elders deacons the ushers the technicians the helps the government the sunday school father every single person who has a role to play the fathers the mothers lord those who know those who don't know father may you be with each one and strengthen your people in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen thank you for being our wonderful audience may the lord richly bless you tonight god bless you
