Lord we know we know we'll never be the same granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen we have to pray request music after the service at this time one in turn your Bibles to one portion of scripture from George chapter two when I read the scripture tonight George chapter two when I read verse 1 to 15 next week Wednesday night there'll be no night service we have a deer pray and fast and in the morning to the evening and that would be a double you know Friday night service next week seeking the Lord so you only read Joel chapter 2 reading from verse 1 blowing the trumpet in Zion summon alarm in my holy mountain and all the inhabitants of the land tremble for a day of the Lord commit it is nigh at hand a day of darkness of gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people are strong you had not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the years of many generations a fire Devorah before them behind them up flame burner the lionesses and garner even before him and behind them a desolate wilderness ye nothing shall escape them the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so shall they run those of charts and the tops of mountains shall they leap the noise of flame of fire that devoured the stubble as a strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pinned all feces shall gather blackness they shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men of war they shall March everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one trust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon this sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro in the city - I run upon the wall they should climb up upon the houses they shall enter in that windows like a teeth the earth shall quake before them the heaven shall tremble the Sun and the moon shall be dark a star shop shall be draw they shinin and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong and executed his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible who can abide it therefore also now said the Lord turning even to me with all your heart with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and R in your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repented him of the evil who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering a drink often on to the Lord your God blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call assembly call a solemn assembly may God bless his word you may be seated amen oh praise God could you see it praise the Lord tonight that's what we had to do to praise Him and to worship Him oh praise God sir tonight I will try to blow a trumpet song and a laugh that's a title might blow a trumpet song the lamb and I believe this is a call to go out the court of samba out of liturgy out of being lukewarm and prayer a call to repentance a call to confession the call of the prayer now this trumpet was first announced in numbers 10 numbers 10 verse 1 to 10 and I read it and the Lord spake unto Moses saying make to the two trumpets of silver of whole peace shall don't make them and don't misuse them here would have held purpose to them for the calling of the assembly for the journeying of the camps when they shall blow with them all the Assembly shall assemble themselves together to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation if they blow but with one trumpet then the princess which are heads of thousands of Israel shall gather themselves unto thee when you blow on a lamb then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward and you blow on a lamb the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blown an alarm for their journeys but when the congregation is said gathered together you shall blow but you shall not song can allow and the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever short your generations and if you go to war in your land against the enemy little prostitute then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and it shall be remembered before the Lord your God you shall be saved from your enemy and in the day of your gladness and in your sullen days in the beginnings of your months you shall blow with the trumpets over your booty offerings over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you a memorial before your God I am the Lord your God Amen so that was where God introduces trumpets and you notice that the trumpet gave a song to cause a certain action whether for war for gathering for announcement it had a purpose behind it they had instructions behind it it gives a distinct and a sitting song for certain purpose but tonight I am trusting that God soars blow into your heart that you will rose you into action to shake you into action and not this intellectual sitting in church taken here would message thing not that but the school you want to still you interaction hallelujah we believe that it was the duty of the priests to blow the trumpets for the assembling of the congregation to remove the camp to go to war to announce danger it was the duty of the priests the blew that trumpet the church is in need of a weakness no one never prophet said the bride had another revival yet there have been no manifestation of God to stir the bride it will take them seven thunders the prophet knew that it will take something a week of the people to wake up not the people I should say wake up the bride because she was sleeping but something on a weaker up or do you believe that tonight so the strumpet was used a song and a lamb to give fear the danger is that a warning come in isn't that right two rows of impending danger arose the people that they could be sensitive to the judgment that was at ham oh praise God hallelujah so we believe that there's a need for a weakness or glory that got to get a fresh Boonton for your children and your family people take it for granted you look what is good what is good what is good you can say measure and no burden no tears no travel no crying and sighin parents and church sharing outside and there's no burden hallelujah oh they did a condition that you will get a burden Oh to blow a trumpet in Zion and summon a lamb to shake yourself they say this cannot continue something has to take place something of the break for all glory to God when scienter feel Zion brought forth you can continue just like abnormal normal normal a trumpet is a song that seems something is about to happen judgment is about to strike it's the day of the Lord at the abacus and givenness and the app just meant and earthquakes and all Canada's acid is coming nobody could stop it Oh hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God too cheap to check the church from his dullness and from the love Oh glory to God and whenever the trumpet song and it's given and an announcement that just my decision hallelujah the judgement is near uncle said is terrible well glory that God is not what people expect it is terrible and one of the messes have not seen yet is the judgment of God or glory of God the missions of a senior yet they come the church to believe a prophet and they come to church and I figure this is heavenly Lord being in church that's not it you know God is the word hallelujah Lord we believe that what the scriptures say let the inhabiters of the earth tremble you trembling no have need of nothing [Music] let the habitants of the it Jimbo that's his cap you read hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise be to Jesus get it back here now Oh glory to God hallelujah blow the trumpets in Zion Shalala my holy mountain let all have a symbol for the day of the Lord come it it is nigh at hand oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah let's continue praise God it was a call to an awakened of a of a deep repentance he said come Tim with all your heart with fastings with we pin with travailing praise gonna lie hoping that God could give the out like like I truths to awaken you hallelujah people have so much information how they get settle with it they know everything you're no more than looter you know more than than them messengers who was a mess early age and have more knowledge you know that what that be messing the East had in those old early like Wesley and so for people now no more than that because of what is a vision last day but what I did to it what they know when Jesus died my faith in the earth whereas he works to express that fate when works is faith expressed theatres are a thought citizen writing something in our book faith is not reduced faith is not readings push any message that's not fate you know see it have to be expressed to be vindicated as fate and you can only do that by words or glory to God hallelujah had faith yet tonight to come to church but don't miss the opportunity of what go I want to speak to you tonight don't think is the lights additional don't think is not just a normal service you know this is a trumpet being blown or chlorine I've got a warning going out hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah trumpet songs and timer warning trumpet of announce war or blowing a corner a war against the family I can see loved ones against your sons against the daughters I guess your husband against your wife spiritual wickedness in high places I'm talking from every corner Oh glory to God you can't sit and do like it that's what happened and this happened it's a war in the church it's a walk in this this church oh it's a long as your life it's a work as your soul you are fighting for your life tonight you're fighting to take your land tonight you're afraid to possess what you know is your own hallelujah warnings have always been given by God before judgments always he don't ever send trust men without warning he always sent a warning for judgments people ignore the warning but the judge measures always come in but a warning given opportunity to escape the judgments warning give an opportunity to make preparations for the judgments glory to God people have conformed to the world so much like the world is nothing Christian the world you know is nothing not like the old-time days but we have to get back to spirit one say the world is in their spirit is sodomized in their spirit but the church is not in the spirit of the coming of the Lord so there is the spirit of the coming of the Lord that the church have to get into and the message was supposed to produce that the messages to produce that spirit of the common of the Lord and you have to him back to the feet of the father's Oh glory to God amen hallelujah deadness in prayer prayerlessness no prayer life hallelujah - fine back that channel where prayer becomes your bread prayer becomes a very life here becomes your energy prayer becomes where your when I call you have to go to the gas station to get gas - I wake up with all prayer you have no gas prayer become your gas without the prayer you have no gasoline that me you run a note that means you ain't going nowhere you think about it but you're not doing anyway because not your mind it's not your power it's not your strength it's not your human energy and human spirit it has to be the Spirit of God that coming up on you all glory to God in the third pull is five things five things open up the world and you know I was thinking about it my teacher on it and come like a sequence in the order he then sees in this order by a season as particular order open of the world 10th vision spoken word Kings sword and preaching to eternal laws the eternal loss is the last one the open reward is the first one the tenth vision in the tenth vision there was a little room but the fire the Holy Ghost of the Prophet the pillar fire went in a position he said I'll meet you in there and when he asked about that little embodiment scripture when you pray pray to the father who sees you in secret and your father who sees in secret shall reward you openly I do have the time tonight but every one of the total identification have a scripted behind it King sought spoken word open of the word every one of a scripture including preaching the eternal laws but it has to start maybe open of the word we would open to you hallelujah nothing knowledge of the world the opening of the world where God reveal himself to you and it have any sack up on your life like an open vision like what Isaiah had that could drive him to the temple and it worries me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips a personalized vision of God knows how many can shake it off your husband can shake you off your children can shake you off to bite can shake you off nobody can shake you off because a vision from God hallelujah man I give you and I take it away man I give it to you and monta uninspired from you it's a vision that could give you it's in your heart hallelujah glory to God it can make your truck like a lamb I brought wood as it was in my heart or chlorine Oh God we are wherever to take this land because I'm bringing one I says what's in my heart Oh glory to God I've sat in this mess of all these years and nobody it will affect me from going to possess this land this spirit land this mountain of God Oh glory to God I will not back down from it all that wasn't God he pardoned the Christ all that was in Christ he pours into the church Oh glory of God hallelujah gonna promise no Liam vici hostage church for their promise to half that bright let me see it good Jesus I gonna marry no half that bright glowing I'm half dead woman what she is gonna do with that he can't work true that he can't use that he can tonight that is my best yes well bury that no one is here at a hot or cold or chlorine accord but if you're lukewarm rusty New York a moat you warm you're looking like you're like but you're dead he wants you on fire you want your heart he wants your red heart he wants your under expectation is coming you're ready with him you by his blood you already took the book or chlorine Oh God not for himself but for you he took the book to bring you your redemptive rights or give the Lord a shout in the house Oh hallelujah praise God amen that's why you took the book as you could get your redemptive rights hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah praise God Oh descriptor quickly hallelujah this ravines up the for after this I looked and behold a door was open heaven and the first voice which I heard whether it will a comput talking with me saying come up hither I will shew thee things which must be Hereafter or glory to God that voice was like a trumpet tell em come on dinner trumpet voice it come up hither no stain that earthly atmosphere don't say that natural colours here they become higher that I come in the spirit to see further the sea people to catch more or give the Lord a shot you can stand a fleshly can and natural family selfish stuff and expect to see what what do you think you want to see christ was the dog christ is the door he's not right about and said before I set before you an open door and he's bringing a revolution inside her here he said this is from religion Chapter four just a novel he said you know I've said before the open door he said after the methodist church age they turn away from it I've said before an open door I put an open door which is the Holy Spirit hallelujah so when God put the open door he put no man with that door before the whole experience has set before you open door Holy Spirit and that it was an open door that anybody that's why the Pentecostal is had no man messenger it was open door still that's why the Holy Ghost poured upon them because open door is not right watch watch I put an open door which is the Holy Spirit and he said by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is Christ he said that message before the Methodist Church and the turn aside from it the core personification and refused the Holy Ghost remember that's the open door how do we get into Christ by one spirit Holy Spirit which is Christ spirit we are enter in not my hand shaken not by sprinkling but by one Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and made partakers of that one body one Holy Ghost baptism into that door Oh hallelujah I says again one Holy Ghost baptism into that door this door was set in heaven he looked up towards heaven and he's in an open door on the first voice so like a trumpet and all the scenes change from Patmos to heaven the voice here we go the voice that will walk with the seven golden candlesticks that same voice didn't change but the voice when it was hid in the first time how many remember that I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day in the spirit isn't that right I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard behind me a voice of a trumpet that song like many waters and that many waters is a voice of the ministers the voice of the preachers the voice of many waters the voice of the people he explained what the voice of many waters is it's cause for all the ages speaking the word the people and as they rejected the voice turned the judgment or glory to Gordon remember revelation is still a book assembles a lot of things representing something else let's continue hallelujah and when I turned and look I saw one styling the missile sum of all of Stan's legs and he showed all the mystery of them seven golden candlesticks holding seven stars he looked and saw an open door an open door into heaven how do you get in by Christ Jesus one door one way any man can climb one away and the other we see him as a thief on a rubber and in the parable of the one who climb up and was in the wedding supper with hope they comment on was found guilty was bombed and cast into outer darkness only one way I believe I preached here not long ago whenever somebody gets married in the old country he given invitations himself he has to furnish the robes and when he met this man sitting there how many remember the parable he found a man at the supper table without a wedding garment on what is it the bridegroom stands at the door and all who comes up with an invitation no man can come to the Father except by me and when they come to the invitation so that everybody will look alike look alike not you better than who and who look alike watch watch whether they are rich or poor bond or free black or white male or female they are all one in Christ Jesus and the bridegroom stood at the door and received the invitation and put the rope around his fellow so the rich and the poor all look alike that's the way it is in the kingdom of God there's no big guys and little guys there's only one guy one Christ Jesus wanted Christ only believe that so this money came to this back door and the master came as a friend how did you get in here when I got it on Jesus said as himself he said he called to the port of dynam foot on hand he was cast into outer darkness where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that's Christ's own words he was cast out because it through here we go without the wedding garment he comes some other way besides the door because if he come to the door he would have received the wedding garment he said oh listen to then if the wedding gammon is the baptism of the Holy Spirit Hall our Weaver will be going to be represented any other way you've got to come by christ jesus the way the truth the life Oh hallelujah by some join in some church message and brother branham what I see without the door you only getting started the Bible he said he'd never believe and tremble Oh hallelujah let's continue but here's what I want to get to revelation 1:10 313 I want you to notice the voice that he heard speaking to him had the clearness of a trumpet you know how our trumpet songs it give a shrill song what does a trumpet mean question in the Bible what does a trumpet mean war anytime you see a trumpet blow it is war in the by the time it is a song in meant a war then he went further either a revelation or something to take place so identify treating a war a revelation or something to take place all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord wonderful hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah praise be to Jesus thank you lord okay let's continue Honolua come up here the war this is the setting of the great battle the people that rejected God's message rejected the Holy Spirit the messenger of the seven churches oh the one that had rejected this message of His grace has nothing left but judgment and that's why with the jubilee trumpet song those who don't wanna go free had to be bored in the air so that they would have no more effect upon them they have to hear it and they can be released from the condition because they choose not to go free all glory to God that's exactly right when it come to that sets per set condition he does fifty-fifty still righteous still holy still oh this is not skim milk Alleluia there's one that rejected his message of His grace and not only but judgment was ready while he was making ready to pour the plagues upon it come up here I will show you what was taking place hallelujah Moses had to act first before he saw the miracles did she humor boys had to act first before this holy fourth man in the fire they had to act on the wood so the world is not given to sit down just to think about until talk about and to explain about and to fellowship about the word come future acts on it I'm gonna short George sent me something I guess I think I'm gonna read it sometime not not tonight about a woman who came and she was too late for the prayer line and she was healed before of some disease or something like that and she commonly back and Byron was leaving mom say the same God that he we are the first thing will he do what you have no or something like that and as she got here three months later the miracle was performed on her and it brought brother George my home take three months it takes three months but it was done I said when I thought she was a believer she believed what the Prophet said Oh glory to God because I live in some miracle and it's a span of time miracles so what could give your miracle and it's already released to you praise God hallelujah praise God it already released you see it yet but already release that blind man he was already healed Oh blow it up caught him I take 7 days 10 days to reach 1 month 3 months 1 year it doesn't matter your family shall be delivered he released your miracle he came back your family already praise God you're waiting on that miracle but you were acting upon what God said thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God Joshua let's go back to this morning he match around the wall exactly like a chief captain told him the enemy must be was defeated because there was inside the wall but now he was going to get in how he'll get us out of here so he took a little stroll to meditate and then he's met a man he joins and he's told him what to do and it's a kind of hard thing to think watch that you could blow a trumpet and make a wall fall down I waiting the mother the instruction looking kind of flimsy that you could blow a trumpet and make a wall for long but he acted and God makes it simple and silly it goes plumb over the head of the limb it takes those unlearn that don't know very much to understand it but when you try to figure it out you can't figure it out you got to take God's word for it the we said to do it not the way we think to do it but the way he said do it Oh glory to God when I bid you the shout shout and then drop them trumpets on them walls Oh glory to God I guess in science we're going to it no they might say how them trumpets not a hit a song and hit some kind of porn a clever and uncertainty they could explain it away right now but court said when I beautiful child show walk Laurita thought when I shout there is something reverberations I'm gonna set up and I go take it from there like hold Damon was doing his sling and when they will release the stone God never said God said release it and I won't take the stones from there or give the Lord a show but I'm taking rock quarry chilled up in the air and then done come a woman he say has to do something for something to happen get the Lord a shout inside of here do you get that change do you get that believers you've got to do something for something that happen not just talk about it do something about it he b-boys they acted upon the Word of God they said you should not bow down to any image they will not do it he's a Boeing or 20 fiery furnace now wait a minute God is able to deliver us we know what we will do but we are not going to bow down our God is able if he doesn't develop deliver us no problem but we're not going down you obey in the word this is what we're talking about if God don't deliver you you're still staying with the word because the world is caught and when God saw those brothers under the fate I've said to act upon the word he's I come to myself footman in the fire or glory to God to bless his sons who stands faithful for him and got some some some sons in the last days who are staying with that word and if you stay with the word poor will show you a continuity of the word or give the Lord a shout Oh blow us trumpet in Zion hallelujah glory to God they acted upon the Word of God and then Gordon great brought that miracle Daniel acted upon the Word of God and then he saw that miracle or praise the name of the Lord do you love him tonight praise God hallelujah Matthew 24 verse 2 jesus said unto them see not these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be tuned down and he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming under the end of the world and then jesus said unto them take heed no man I deceive you watch them fellows over there I don't know man come and tie up on deceive you for many shall come a few shall come then - him I am Christ and shall deceive many I am anointed hallelujah and the bringing false teachings of falsehood see and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet nation shall rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes diverse places all these the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another shall hate one another and many false prophets not of you expect them but it alludes many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many many false prophets and many people to follow them false prophets all right so do oh go back be many because many deceived I mean many off hallelujah but he

and cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins yet the seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and for the ordinances of their God they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take the light and approach it to God wherefore have we fasted say they and OCS not God like a fast and like an idea see not where for how we are fitted it was all and all teak has no knowledge and then God speaks behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure exact all your Labor's behold you fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness you shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice to be denied in other words there's a fasting that makes your voice to be heard and I I call fast an amplified prayer as well pray have volume on it oh let's continue is such a fast that I have chosen a different man to flick his soul is it the boat on his head as a blur to spread sackcloth and ashes under you we don't call this a fast unacceptable day to the Lord is not this the fast have chosen what for to lose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to deal I bread to the hungry that don't bring the poor that are cast all to my house when those here's the naked that don't cover him and only high not thyself on my own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning then hell shall spring forth speedily the help and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be your rear award then thou shalt call and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am if thou wilt take away from the midst of thee do you can put in for the finger and speak in vanity if thou draw all thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted then that shall delight rise in obscurity my darkness be as the noonday and the Lord shall Kinkaid continually and satisfy thy soul and drought and make fat i bones and thou shalt be like the watered garden like the spring of water whose waters feel not and data shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach to restorer of paths to dwell in we have a great ministry ahead a great call in the head but it's a cost that goes with it I'm almost done Ezekiel 33 reading from verse 1 again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the share of Israel and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their Watchmen when he see the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever here at the song of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the song of the trumpet took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the short come and blown up the trumpet and the people be not warned if the short come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand oh so this give a different perspective now of this trumpet to be blown oh if the watchman doll or the trumpet and things happen God require at the watchman's hand the man so Solomon so there were seven so sodaro Solomon I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked a wicked man don't shall surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if the warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in iniquity but that was delivered I saw therefore thou son a man speak under the house of Israel does he speak seeing if our transgression of all still be upon us and we pine away hold shall we live say unto them as I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but are the wicked till from his way and live turn me from your evil ways why will you die Oh hopes of Israel so if you see from these scriptures whatever burden for people to really repent because he wants to forgive he wants to restore he wants to heal he wants to bless if you believe that Isaiah 21 11 12 the building of Douma he call it me or the seer watchman what of the night watchman one of the night the what one said the morning comment and also the night if he/she will inquire in ye return come on in brother branham preach a message watch my one at night he says and then is talking about as soon as we get washed up and groomed up talk what people estimate eysan we will meet at the tavern as usual and I'm sure John you are you all dis to buy body message be here today watch 100 hour trying to make a dick to Joy although our life gonna tell us there's a push in danger because it was finally tower he seen something and these people want to party they want to drink and whatnot so he's talking about people who talking about it with this watch man want to take away the joy from us he said know what and you know we have the best happy days I'm in our soldiers meet each night same place we enjoy fellowship together gambling a few drinks as for myself he said I would refuse to be alarmed about any of this stuff that this watchman would talk about or rabbis know about this or pastors and so on we believe that there will be a possible chance to Watchmen could be right all this warning thing and warning thing you know we don't have to take that so seriously do you know this this is Birdman oh you know there's something about danger there's something about debt that seems to have a forewarning of it many times that loved ones before passed on across the other side a warning comes to them hallelujah Watchmen must be on duty at all times he was to warn the people of approaching dangers that was his duty to watch for Putin dinner danger he was up in a tower that was built much higher than the walls and this tower had to be up there in it the books of astronomy and so forth you could watch the stars I'm telling the time any approaching

that Watchmen ought to be trained he had to know what he was doing but at any distance as soon as he arose the enemy could detect it he could tell their walk he could tell their match he could tell their color he could tell that rank-and-file that's his father whom I could see could see it he was higher than the rest of them he was trained to know the enemy and God required a whole city as it
