John's up to twenty nineteen to twenty three acts 1:8 there'll be no services this week there's no zoom service or no midweek service we all be working towards the parenting City Convention it starts on Friday 8:00 o'clock one o'clock on four o'clock to three times of which were conventional be streaming so on the great expectation the obvious some will be here amen in the church but every stream in life eat o'clock one o'clock on four o'clock Friday Saturday Sunday tree services each day there'll be no service this weekend okay reading Isaiah up the 35 which tree to eat striking you the weekends and confirm the feeble knees say to them that have a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even God with a recompense he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the Deaf shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for the wilderness child waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land Springs of water the habitations of dragons but each they shall be grass with reason rushes and a highway shall be there and a wage I be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those that we fear in men no fool shall not add errand so in John chapter 20 verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear the Jews came Jesus stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you notice they were assembled for fear of the Jews he said peace be unto your wedding yet so said he shown unto them his hands his side then what the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and he and and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive II the Holy Ghost who suffers in serum it they are remitted unto them whoever sins he retain they are retained our last scriptures acts 1:8 familiar Scripture but he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria outermost part of the earth may God bless his word you may be seated or praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord just keep giving my Prius offer in there don't find me as prism too much in Oh glory to God we always talk at my prison because this is what Lucifer saw that we were doing up in heaven and they got jealous and tried to do a small thing to get praises for himself and because he wanted to be like the Most High he wanted to be like God and and and he wanted to get praise and worship so we are showing Lucifer that on heaven we praise and worship God on earth we praise and worship God we live in here worship and God and sickness we're gonna still worship God if the roof blow off we still gonna work God if we lose our job because tell worship God if the press come down we still worshipping God if they shut down the church we still worshipping God or glory that we were built for this thing we were called for this thing and you are called for this thing oh praise the name of the Lord alright so this morning out of the blue whatever title that Holy Ghost bunch that attacked that Holy Ghost bunch and have a subject out of that Holy Ghost Bunch the bracket a nerve an inspiration the water and spirit of the Holy Ghost amen together now the title is that Holy Ghost Bunch subject out of that Holy Ghost Bunch the brain an inspiration the water in spirit of the Holy Ghost oh praise the name of the Lord let's go upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell can prevail against it so if the church has been prevailed by all kind of stuff something wrong because jesus said this real church his church says his church no gates of hell approval agency we baitcaster will come against it but the cap reveal because that real rock is revelation inside individuals the church is not this building the church is not this bunch of people Jesus churches that rock revelation that we put inside the individual and in every age individual survive hallelujah Daniel survived the lion's den or glory the God the three Hebrew boys survived the fire it was rocks inside of them which is a revelation of faith and we are surviving by faith this morning and you are faith for yourself to believe God then you have to have fear for your children and I want to sham it inside the day you have to say for your children don't you ever give up on them for the devil Estela liar you have to believe deliverance will come or glory no God is anything too hard for the Lord I said big fact no no nothing nothing Elohim come down not many unveil themself across the loops until today nothing every mystery has been revealed don't tell me your repression it's more than the power that is here don't tell me your frustration is more your sickness your sadness Oh glory to God hallelujah oh my god himself in Isaiah says strike the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees Citadella fearful at be strong Saanich your God will come or glory your God will come let them laugh let them mock let them say or you believe this only believe that let them have a good laugh but your God will come I am no more jack your God will come Oh hallelujah praise God ha come and save you and his hand and the eyes of the blind shall be opened when when when when your God has come or Chloe baby said early will I seek Him oh you wanna promise your God will come your prayers not in vain I don't care you feel like the heavens is like brass and it's shut up there your prayers not in vain you are under a promise your God will come all right so you know what might have felt when the disciples following this Messiah Jesus I guess in their own thinking they thought he was dead forever I guess they own thinking they don't have to worry about bread fish sickness dies the man to be wrong you're sick you hear you you're hungry you feed you Oh hallelujah oh yeah you're running out of wine he turned water into wine I mean that is a man to be working with you don't want that man leave you you want to work with that man they thought he was there forever but all of a sudden he said if I don't go the comforter will not come I would never leave you comfortless a little while they will see it me no more but you I want to see me did they know what he was talking about they thought that this man that multiplying by Dan says this man that healing the sick was with them forever but that man was about to leave them Oh glory to God and Peter said no he said get behind me Satan Oh glory to God and then one time he said his heart was fixed and his aestheticized too was Jerusalem he was green for a crucifixion I wanna bring it this really is this morning he was not going just to be crucified he was going for you [Music] and that is why you should be praising God yet this morning when he was doing Calgary he was going for you every width of the cross he was seeing you because if he didn't do it you couldn't hear this morning could I ask out in the house if he didn't do it you couldn't be here this morning my god he would hit him in this morning because he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes every time they beat them by our stripes this is him again by his stripes when that black bass beat his back was by his stripes we are healed this morning Oh glory to God God still heals God still opened Blaney's God still close to Tom to speak the Deaf to hear the crippled to walk or have faith and God this morning anything

and tell you this over some kind of thing as far as I could go but if you want to transport this here to make a rule you have to make a way so God had to make a we a platform to get his spirit to float on because it was so messy Oh glory to God so God sent the word and the world become the conductor of the Spirit so go I have some plumbing to doing some electrical connections to connect upon

very religious and go to church be a member there of and they can't go on to a Sunday sermon amen now God promises in this these what he was going to do and I would like to ask anybody any minister any way of one promise that God made the change and what he said that they were to but what the three church is doing it now but it want it they don't want it here Harris would Jesus brought go to human lives God was made human when Jesus was born God became man that he might become fellowship with man and in man to achieve one purpose just one purpose that is to bring to man what God is not what a church is so when you see people succumb to this just because it's just habit you know that that Alaia talking they're the past align the people like is buncha liars because I know what Jesus taught the object is to bring God to man to bring a man to what God is how he lives his nature his being all about him and that's why I said at the finishing of the seventh seal we supposed to be all the way of the eternal who God is how he lives his nature his being by that time you come like a next kinda Adam because you coming into communion with God or fellowship with God like Adam had in the gardener even because when I am lost the connecting line and the dial tone on his phone went dead after being in sin there was no way he could commune to God so God as I put the blood substitute until Jesus come to reconnect them back to heaven on the cross was the reconnection to bring back a day is a direct direct line and to prove the line was direct when Jesus died you rip the veil of the temple from the top to the bottom to expose what was hidden all along only high priests could go inside adhere only man I've got to go inside earlier when when Jesus busted fail he showed us whosoever will to go inside out here on us open MODOK understand this you sisters in here you break into that field you more north the temperatures Danny put but dead as a doornail ever you more inspired that them ministers let me put it that dead be any pulpit God's every pink slip and aluminum Oh hallelujah Oh glory hallelujah so when that veil was rent it means that you have direct access so you anywhere any factor training that any part in your house you could just pull your heads or say Lord God as a daughter of God I have a son of God I'm coming through the blood and I note you the blood you see me sinless you see me without fault but I come for my child and fit I reach out to them and I clean them in the name of Jesus I claim that deliverance I claim healing I claim the power of God or glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah where you where you you're under the blood where are you you under the veil where are you you under covenant or glory to God hallelujah

receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they had to go any up room to Terry listen to the answer to that question it was a promise he gave them so that breathed upon them was what say it aloud a promise all right now what it was a promise to give them he breathed upon them his promise said receive the Holy Ghost it was a promise here we go and they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled so receiving Holy Ghost that's a promise over your life receive your healing receive your deliverance receive a breakthrough let's continue the same thing is when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business natan for the promise to be fulfilled so I prayed for and your door do nothing happened feeling and you nasty and your unbelief rocking so and God can work with your unbelief rockaroonie work with fate so you say when you receive your prayer you receive your blessing then you go about your business normal normal normal bye sighs I'm here by faith I'm

here and ice ice pop open he was easy was falling onto the promise don't let go why I wonder so easy [Applause] to make it to be Olympics time that you can't just be running it you make to run you use it you going to do Olympics you've been back home it not boo consume your go and put in a boxing glove in a box to two rooms a box in and say boy I'm gonna be a heavyweight champion know you'll be own champion right inside your host you in so it just doesn't work so you make a sprint as a bicycle you look everybody else's you and you say you will be the fastest on a meter on any world you'd be fastest woman it doesn't work so all those people that make it at the Olympic never have to go through training and qualification tests because you want the very best because they are competing lot but people are crazy and people who just don't know they compete only people who this is the life if the instrument is tremendous then doing this the doing this that but this has come like the life they are dedicated to it because they want to represent the country well God won't have representative of his kingdom people have represent where they come from and to do that he had to get the very best and some of the best wasn't dead in mud in filth in sin in all kind of condition but they were his best I mean mind them bum them out and then he's had a clean mo because this is his best Satan was deceived by how they were in a mess but this was God's best toe be fooled by the mess you are not like the rest you are God's best he leave the best for last so he leaves you for the last days or chlorine of caught you I could have the victory you are going to overcome you appointed Brett oh you are going to be filled with God my lord my lord [Applause] Boris let's continue the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit is an experience of being filled and enduring power for service power for what for service so for us to get into true service we have to be empowered by God and Jesus said you shall receive power after not winter come upon you not Wesley come upon you not the Pentecostal baptism come upon you but after the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you go be witnesses unto me not under a church not unto our system not until a group but unto the Messiah even the seventh seal you shall be witnesses unto me the witness shall be inside and manifested outside okay the Lord a shout Jesus was God's witness as long as they have him with them they were fine because they had God witness with them but the prophecy hanging over them was for this witness to come into them so when Peter receive the Holy Ghost he know how to witness in him as my father sent me jesus said so send I you it was a promise breathing on them the father had sent him went in him so to send them guys out he had to go into them and then learning of the word didn't do it the teaching of the word didn't do it they explained in the world and they understanding didn't do it it was the fire it was the Holy Ghost it was caught on mighty that came and jumped on in their socket of their souls that's history so what's the point in trying to see how this one teaching so right and this one teaching and teaching my teacher where is a God of the teacher God wrap up the teachings and put life inside of it he put life and Pisan in sanctification but life and hottest and justification but life and hydrogen reduction of the world but the thing is that get to the life Oh glory to God hallelujah you know long time with parents when a game met somewhere they do the highs in something when you're drinking they get the whole thing to go if you get our message straight Oh bitter boy complain about this and complain about that but that is what good for you Oh hallelujah so go ahead app it up and hide it and slip it in Satan's Kingdom you take Jesus unroll em also who Jesus is a baby no no that is 12 years already cut for them fellas early in the priesthood no you're not about my father's business 18 years silence inulin church seen them given wrong teachings false doctrines and wrong interpretations and s saying that that is temperance but that is I just really a nobody and somebody might be its it you see it wrong you caught your own scripture not Jesus 18 years season watching everybody is same way Jesus when the day come somebody wants a my to read for us this summer day Jesus put his hands up like that first time Jesus coming forward to read and he find his cool of eyes I wasn't like a Bible like this and you gotta find his school of Isaiah in the FATA chapter they got a big school open it's cruel fine guys see the Spirit of the Lord is upon me this is young Jesus looking for you don't know let me to preach the gospel open the eyes of the blind and set at liberty them that are bruised Hollis's and depreciates terribly of the Lord and I can see him banner and kiss the book roll the book I said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears they thought he was reading a text but he was the express text he was the text expressed he was the text made flesh he was the living text he was the laws literally but fresh on it [Applause] ah whoa my god and I keep saying it over and over I don't know how much even catch it but it's something that I love what he said he said he told a search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life what is he saying to them says the text because you think because you listened to the text because you could say that the text because you could speak the text you have to the life he said but detects testify of me [Applause] so the text is not dead just to talk the text is to identify a prophecy and I am the fulfillment of the prophecy of the text but then he went further he said you wouldn't come to me that you might have life so he was showing life is not in the letter life is in a person [Music] get the Lord a show that's why he doesn't know so much of books and tapes and everything can be so miserable because life is nothing the text life isn't a person the person of Jesus Christ or do you catch it do you see it then you have to leave and go to him to get life I am the way I am the truth and I am the life itself he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to tell me get power to become the sons of God you have to get power to become part that Holy Ghost Bunch wow

your confession and feel free that goddess forgive you of your sins so you separate and key things there where you are saved you confess Christ you feel free you're no God forgiving for your sins that is one thing but this whole evil thing is power power to pray power to overcome father say I am sorry pardon sir please forgive me power to take wrong power to humble yourself little Brahm says could

Church under processing all glory to God we prophesy over you this mornin glory whoever sees it so you you think goin to give you power to see you up oh we think what have your family for loved ones for the power half to go and do something what else Anson's get power in the middle of the field and there's no pause wrong in Samson Samson moving around so instead of four long blue then ever testimony Samson got backed out in the middle of the field and he did not display any power or do anything free the crowd what does the money is that sergeant told me to put in place because he had to be in place for the power to be active when Peter came on three thousand shows received the William there was power granada's Montana when he went to countenance houses power his power he didn't know listen he never meant the Gentiles before you know God as a gift bit of vision to go to Cornelius house Cornelius under vision expectant Peter God working on both sides that man don't know fully what to do this is a whole new moon for him he never experienced this before he began to testify about the Lord and why pizza was speaking the word the Holy Ghost these people never came to a service that never get baptized but the Holy Ghost because the man heart he was just and default but the Holy Ghost was watch what you have in your heart let me give the Lord a shout all my doctrine this man was taught how much mysteries I think he had how much revelation and Bach until she listened to none Peter was the living book Peter had the book DITA Hockley Aslam [Music] and his name was activated by the spirit coming through the word oh why Peter speak these words the Holy Ghost owner can do it the Holy Ghost sort of pipe and the Holy Ghost rip down to the pipe of the word and touch the gene the gym in Cornelius and corniness become activated son that'll be the said the same God that poured out upon the Jews his dough come to the Gentiles it is the same God the same reality the same experience Cornelison walk with Jesus two and a half years corners in the air Jesus teaching calling us via testimony of a man that was activated by God with the full-si germ in his body [Applause] let me see said so after the Apollo experience God only using these men but the full gym so now you understand where I'm the Philip he in the revival but a man Hanafy OPI he gettin away he and a chariot miles away reading scripture because he's burdened and the word is a conduct of the Spirit so he's reading written text and he don't have an avenue for the text to be open for the spirit to come in so once the word open is to open up a channel I won't forget this do I ever forget this once the word open is to make a channel for the spirit to come in so Philip was translated from the way he was to the mind is it understandest with no readers and when he brought the word to him the spirit and he all state GOP up he going to appear not with a bunch of books and tapes but fire fire the same core that Philip had this man huh you're gonna teach you he go to printing they remembers me to open up the word just get the spirit in is that no cellphone in that time it have no human connection in the time it's just Holy Spirit connections Holy Spirit translations Holy Spirit's anointed Holy Spirit directed that's why his bogus it is nonsensical for any man to try the guide the bride leader bride be in charge of the bride that mean up land money in a punch in his mode doesn't think that his head a brain a brain punch just even think that because the ax the book of Acts was the acts of the Holy Ghost and all those brothers were guided by the Holy Ghost all those buttons did by the Holy Ghost led them to do or glory of stealin full of the Holy Ghost he was a deacon he's preached to them and busted them and stone him and before he died he said no evil a latest one day they'll charge get him a discount not this one that others data do you it not this one don't even put that on your book or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thanks all free he was it always might to get steppen to glory already where I'll go in a cavity potent that's my home I went home this world is that my home I went o or glory to God and fellows understood that this flushes as a robe the understood put in this body dung they understood the resurrection T of anak glory that they will call unto and they understood that there was a perfect sheet of us coming down the road to bring the rapture and the resurrection I'll make that possible because what a random said is a rap that I was then all and further was gonna go but God postponed all of that so they had to go wrong only grown we are the harvest we have the fruit of the ages we are what all the apostles and prophets long for looked for God told Daniel go die where the book is sealed to the time of the end understand dying God unseal the book to release you from the book you are the words of the book you came from the book you had seen parts of the book and this welcome to activate you by power this obviously power or glory to God hallelujah glory to God a cast up now and a groove inside of here they don't want them screaming Holy Ghost Bunch let me say to you you know you see this that is they will put them on the church right you see she's pregnant with something cause she's bringing forth numbers all DJ chips just growing they have more members but it's what the green wit is what impregnated with he said they don't want any screaming hollering blabbering acts 2:38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would embarrass her it would ruin her an educated ethical sound effects society change that she belong to here they will try out she can't live it so she brought one here we go to be pregnant it with the word heady bomb because that is the only pain that the word can bring forth [Applause] brother died the only came you mean the only kind of work at prefer is the blabbering stop speaking Holy Ghost Bunch hallelujah staggering slobbering glory dog audience come on oh yeah I snuck might even come down your nose but you don't care who behind you who in front of you the Shelton bunch the noisy Bunch he said as the only time the word could produce not just raise a huntin naughty Shaffer has turned but this kind the Holy Ghost bunch tank wait a minute wait a minute when the Prophet said pick up a pen and write he said out of a true the group of the world a true seed of the word God would present Christ with a beloved bride you mean the truth sheet of the wood is the Holy Ghost Bunch that's right and out of that hole it was bunks there's gonna come a bride or get the Lord a shout so if you know have you you are part of a Holy Ghost Bunch I say rejoice because you are qualified bright material all I need now is a surgeon's knife to do some cuttin to be wound and fitted or glory the got a feeling mrs. this morning Oh glory give the Lord a show hallelujah hallelujah here we go born of the Spirit of God it has the Spirit of God in it no intellectual kids join in Creede going Bobby a painter face there is no such thing in us at all you don't find that in the Word of God you find an old-fashioned sanctified Holy Ghost felt I love God screaming hollering shouting praising God that is what you will find don't let me mass fool you you're not shouting for me you better have a shot inside and I show coming out your mouth [Applause] [Music] oh and I said Holmes just you know God is going to restore by shining forth the evening light to restore the whole wood of God again watch the full manifestation of Christ in His Church but hungry if we see that MacArthur proceedures he said look how he said is here Gorgon restore the full wood of God again let me translate it that the full manifestation of Christ in his wood and it's Church so see full world is not full text full word is full word that it would become a contribute for full spirit to come because the world was lost to the ages he Bibles if he said he said seven angels to gather the scattered word to tie back into the world to bring down the Holy Ghost because with the fullness of the work on the fullness of the Spirit or I say this way with the restoration of the word come the restoration of the Spirit never see when wasps are digging a hole to play pipes water their small pipes and big pipes it was a major interruption which is in major pipes these huge guys because that is the pipe that shallow water into areas and then they get lesser size structure into homes and different things like that are you with me for the do the work in this last day God needed full pipe so first excellency the Lord Himself had to do this problem the Lord Himself commentor to lay down this pipe for the spirit to come because the enemy command like a flood in his last day and the Holy Spirit has the coming like a flood to raise a standard against the enemy so the Lord couldn't send them some other angels the Lord Himself descends from heaven with a shout and when Jesus cried seven thunders shorter voices oh and those Tumnus was to catch the bride execution right promise Oh glory to God so now the platform of the word has been laid which is this year it felt you knowledge every mystery hidin behind that in there have the ages and care have the messengers in there of the mystery in there after history and there have the Saints in gear have the colors the rainbow in there of the life itself so when you have got to have the mysteries you have the rainbow you have the covenant you have the channel of God for the Spirit the flow true all the written for is the gap because that that completes the whole thing which is charity the bond of perfectness let's continue where does it tree right the fruit at the top so it's the top of the tree that it sees even light now we know there was there was for death messengers can't go home Lucas Caterpillar and paw moon and it took for life missing just to bring it back luta justification wesley-san vacation till it is popular ghost Pentecostals and the fourth was the word is not right hallelujah for killers took it for messengers have to restore it

you're saying feel not because I help in that situation you're filter to work there in a situation as long as the effect they will come true [Applause] all right the fourth was the word the Word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection saying that Christ has finally after justification implanted sonification being planted the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ organism died out price has again scented himself like the cup of the pyramid justification sunny vacation baptism Holy Ghost then common of the cap what is it what is it he said that Holy Ghost bunch being pulled out so that I could fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away that is that my ministry now that is Christ's ministry so the Holy Ghost Bunch had to be wound to connect with the same ministry

until it is written it is written it is also written Jesus shopping for peace never show one display of power and all the powers on him when he kept the power that is when he went to the temple the fine description or chlorine at God so what's something now so after holiness come upon him the very life that he produced well here we go that same water in spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did if it's the same seed so the prophecy is for the watering spirit of the Holy Ghost to come up on the seed in your life so that is why he said they call themselves on the Upper Room dry seeds what were they waitin for the water and spirit of the Holy Ghost or glory no God and that is why Jesus went to Calvary to release that water in spirit or glory to God because the badness that the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified or glory the cause of Jesus had to die to pay the price to release the spirit that we can
