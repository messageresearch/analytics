========================================

let's look together revelations chapter 6 verse 7. when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth be say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with the death and with the beast of the earth amen let's just pray dear heavenly father we ask that you had just anoint us now lord as we look into your word we pray lord that your holy spirit would take control and that you would speak your words of eternal life lord help us all to relax lord and to receive from you what you have for us we pray that you would bind every spirit in here that be contrary to your spirit and let your holy ghost have preeminence and free reign in our hearts and in our lives we ask that you bless us lord and keep drawing us up higher in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you as your seed and i just wanted to mention i appreciate that song brother telus wrote and we sang it as a congregation i really enjoyed that i thought that was a wonderful blessing and i appreciate joe for helping us get it as a congregational song it's so nice to see god using gifts in the body to bless the body i mean what what what inspiration went into the song and to sing it once or twice and let it be passed off the scene would be a shame we want to make that part of our worship amen and so i just appreciate that and brother tell us and i were talking the other day and he said something to me that he piqued my interest he said something and pointed to something that i hadn't paid close attention to in the fourth seal so i want to bring that to you i think it's it's interesting in verse 7 he said and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see now this is unique to the seals because when you look at the first seal the second seal on the third seal you heard the beast say first you heard the beast say the second one you heard the beast say the second beast the third one you hear the third beast but this is the first time where it says they heard the voice of the fourth beast because god is honing in on something every word matters brothers and sisters because it ties us right to revelations 10 7 because this ties us to revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and when we hear the voice of the fourth beast of the eagle anointing i mean i think god wants us to see the word voice so we can correlate and put these two things together and recognize we're talking about the same thing hallelujah what a blessing that was so i appreciated that insight and drawing my attention to that it was wonderful you know the world's falling apart but the bride's coming together amen and you know just watching the news over the last week has been absolutely astonishing i can hardly believe you know what we're seeing we know these things are true and and it's it's not just astonishing it's grieving because these are people's lives these are these are terrible things that are happening but we know when we see people losing property and people losing lives and destruction coming upon the earth we realize the high price of sin you can see you can see why god cannot withhold judgment god gave space to repent he even gave cain an opportunity to repent and cain refused to repent and god sent him out from the presence of the lord and him and his whole lineage went into utter destruction in the flood god couldn't stop he he's a just god he gives space to repent but if you refuse amen your opportunity to repent there's nothing left but judgment when mercy is spurned there's nothing less but judgment and this world has spurned all the mercy that god could extend and the long-suffering of the lord he sent he sent prophets and he sent preachers and he sent church-age messengers and the world has continued to march to the beat of lucifer and not to the word and god cannot be a just god and withhold judgments and just over just a little over a week we saw two major earthquakes hit mexico yesterday another one hit mexico city the same day amen one hit off the east coast of japan a 6.1 two nights before that a small one hit los angeles 3.6 the whole earth is shaking friends it's shaking and there's a reason that it's shaking because because we know that that this world is bringing forth birth pains brother branham started preaching birth pains and in birth pains he starts to explain to us that the earth is bringing forth the the earth from the womb of the earth it's birthing forth a new world for a millennium a bright new world for a millennium for the honeymoon period of christ and his bride and so as it gets closer and closer and closer to bringing forth that new millennial world the the birth pains increase in intensity and get closer together and brother brennan begins to explain this birth pains to us and so we realize that the birth pains are coming to produce a new world amen a bright new earth for a millennium refashioned and and and remade for the millennial reign so we realize that these birth pains have to be timed just right because they have to correlate with the condition of the bride because you can't birth the world too early because we have to have the rapture first and the birth pains are increasing intensity until it comes to the final push in the three and a half year tribulation period and that final push will absolutely disrupt all of nature amen atomic bombs will go off volcanoes will go off everything will disrupt until the earth is formed over again but that final push can't start until the rapture so as we see this getting more intense and more intense and more intense we've had hurricane harvey amen and you know we've had hurricanes since harvey who talks about harvey anymore that was just three or four weeks ago and there's people still underwater in houston but that's old news now used to be you have a disaster like that and it's news for a year now it's news for a week if not that it's news for a couple days because then there's a bigger one coming a greater one coming something that's unprecedented something that's never happened before and something we haven't had in the century what is it it's the birth pains and the birth pains are timed amen just right because it's got to go to the final push in the tribulation period but right before that the church has the rapture so the ripeness of the bride is bringing birth pains you're it's you it's your condition that is causing the news reports it is you getting in line with the word as you coming into the maturity of the seed it's you coming to harvest ripeness that is bringing the birth pains on the earth when you read your newspaper it's you coming into position that is causing this earth to speed up amen the birth pains are coming rapid because the earth has to be ready to push forth a new world for a millennium when the bride gets raptured so everything is moving in condition and timing according to the condition of the bride hallelujah we're watching chaos break out around the planet not just hurricanes not just earthquakes fires droughts political unrest economic disturbance the whole world is crumbling everything is absolutely falling apart there's not a political hope in the world there's not an economic hope in the world the whole thing is a disaster why because it's all about to fall apart and bring forth a new world for a millennium why because the bride is coming into her position she's coming in to harvest maturity and ripeness i don't know about you but i'm excited we don't enjoy the judgments of god we don't take pleasure in what's happening but we do recognize our position and we do recognize what's going on praise god let's pull up oh we got it pulled up already we want to go into the fourth seal and take a look at these things as we go and and what we're seeing in the world is very pertinent to the fourth seal brother branham said here said so happy to be back in the house of the lord tonight this is his opening comments in the fourth seal in the service again and so happy that just thought this one wouldn't come but it finally did and i'm so thankful that being the last of those four horse riders which i think is the one of the main messages to the church at this time and that's the absolute truth the rapture is contained in the fourth seal the full maturity of the brides contained in the full for for seal the unleashing of the sixth seal judgment is in the fourth seal amen it's all here and that's where we live right now that's why this is one the main message to the church at this time so we know that this fourth horse rider is the pale horse is spiritual death and the incarnate devil there's a principle i want to look at brother brandon brings out in the third seal he said now let's back let's just background this just a little bit on the seals that we have passed because just like in the church ages why we try to give a background to kind of lap it over until you could that's the way the ages are actually in the scripture one laps the other one over just like that climbing a ladder or climbing a step rather one one running down to the other and coming back like that as you go up steps now see brother brandon's teaching a principle and if you don't catch this principle we're going to be totally lost because he says in the church ages the church ages lap over one another one age blends into the other age amen and he said the same thing for the seals he wants the background because the seals just like the church ages one laps over the other and brother branham said it's like going up a set of steps a ladder of steps if you go up this and i can say we've got four seals here right one two three four don't count the first one i'm here i can count when i go to this one i'm on the first seal but when i go here i'm transitioning from first to second there's a period of time that i'm in both seals just like the church ages and then i move up i'm no longer in the first seal i'm totally in the second and then there's another transition period where we're moving up through and we're transitioning to the other and then we're transitioning to the fourth if you if you try to make it a meat cleaver where you hop from one to the other you're gonna miss what god's doing because there's certain thing he says that applies here there's certain things that he says applies here and certain things that apply here so you have to understand where you are and brother branham is a transitional prophet just like elijah when he came and john the baptist was a transitional prophet taking them from the law to grace moving them amen from the atonement of bulls and ghosts to the atonement of the lamb of god and he stood in the gap joining the two together and brother branham came to do the same thing he come he comes as a transitional prophet to stand in the gap and move us amen from the atonement under the church ages to the true atonement the restoration of the word amen and so you've got to catch the transitions and the reason why is is brother branham says in the in the fourth seal he says watch he rides on a pale horse as he appears on his ride the last ride he's on that last now and that's not in our day that will be on down it's the seal foretold because see the church has dawn gone up when this happens when christ appears here on earth this fellow appears and becomes completely the devil so brother brahms talking about something that's coming under the fourth seal and when the fourth seal when we make the full transition from third to fourth seal amen then the the bride is raptured and when she's raptured the devil comes down and fully incarnates the beast at that time fully incarnates the boat becoming the beast of the beast at that time amen and that's coming in the future that hasn't happened yet because it can't happen until the rapture of the church and he comes down and fully incarnates one man but we have already come to the transition period because if we hadn't come to the transition period the eagle couldn't be flying but brother brahma said we're in the eagle age the eagle is flying because we're moving into the fourth seal i think as we go along you're going to see this more clearly he says the fourth stage of the writer watch the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternal separated from god why is that because when we move completely to the fourth seal and the church is gone there is no more mercy there is no more blood there is no more place except for the hundred and forty four thousand for redemption because when the bride goes up the blood goes up because the bride is the spirit by the blood the bride is the blood by the spirit so we know that that the bride is here and she's the mercy seat on earth holding mercy open but when she goes up amen what's left for those who are not already sealed away there's no transition he that is filthy be filthy still he that is righteous is righteous still even the foolish virgin can't change state once the rapture goes there is nobody that can enter in once the rapture goes so now what you move to is eternal separation from god all except the 144 thousand they're under a special covenant he says under the four seal no wonder he could impersonate himself in the personified name and called death he sure was now god only knows how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed and probably literally billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name death so brother madam now is taking this forth uh this this horse rider coming to the fourth stage now receives a name he's been death all along when he rode the first horse he was death when he rode the second horse he was death when he so when he comes as compromise on a white horse he's death slight deviation from the word is death it's death riding that power but he's changing horses because he's trying to bring the people to eternal separation from god to spiritual death and so death moves from the white horse to the red horse death moves from the red horse to the black horse death moves onto the pale horse when he moves on to the pear horse now he can be named because why because now there's a prophet on the scene under the eagle anointing we have the voice of the fourth beast who's the voice of the seventh church age messenger who can now declare who's been on the horse all the time amen luther couldn't tell you who was on the horse amen wesley couldn't tell you who was on that horse but at the opening of the seals there's a prophet under the eagle anointing that can say that man's name is death that's the antichrist that's been writing that all the way through and now he's openly declared amen he's bringing the people to the physical battle of armageddon where there's utter complete destruction for those who gather together but listen to what brother branham said just one line statement back in the third seal he says now there's always the natural and the spiritual keep that in your mind brother branham said all prophecy has a natural and a spiritual fulfillment hallelujah there's always natural and spiritual we find this very clearly in the scriptures when there's a prophecy that said i call my son jacob out of egypt amen and what he's talking about is the exodus when he brings the nation of israel out of egypt but it also applies to jesus when when by a visitation of an angel in a dream joseph is told to take his family down into egypt to avoid the wrath of herod and he goes into egypt and then another angel tells him that herod is dead come out of egypt so that that verse applies to the nation of israel and it also applies to jesus christ the same scripture we have scriptures in the psalms that apply to david but they also apply to jesus christ and they also apply to the bride of jesus christ yes and because the word is eternal it just keeps rolling and rolling and rolling amen once you see the pattern that fits it will always work it never changes amen praise god so so we have to understand now that yes he brings them to physical death but before he brings them to physical death he brings them to spiritual death hallelujah the four series said like he gave egypt to give egypt place to repent what was the last peg plague was death that's the last plague that's hit the pentecostal church now remember spiritual and natural we know that there's going to be an incarnation when the devil is cast out of heaven amen when the bride goes up he enters into the to the the beast and he brings everybody to death right he brings to the battle of armageddon and brings him to physical death but before that happens he already brings the church to spiritual death and here's what brother brenham said it was death the last plague was death that's the last plague that hit the pentecostal church it's spiritual death she's dead not will be dead she's dead that's in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead he gave her a place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead shall never rise again and what brother bennum is showing is that the fourth horse amen the death is already entered in the ecclesiastical realm it's already entered into the spiritual realm before it comes to the physical realm he's already incarnate in a church before he ever becomes incarnate and one man he's incarnate in a church this is so important to know because we realize that the devil is only mimicking what god does and we know jesus christ is going to return amen in revelations 19 riding on a white horse to come and bring destruction to all those that gather against jerusalem how many knows that's true and when he returns amen he is he was incarnate god incarnate and one vessel jesus christ battling with devil incarnate and one vessel amen the beast but before we get to that battle of armageddon amen we've got to back up before the rapture of the church and now the devil has gathered his false bride and he's incarnate and infiltrated and incarnate the church because jesus christ is incarnate his bride in his church and now the battle is going on right now friends we're right in the middle of the battle of these two great forces on earth and don't you think that that that that we've got a lot of friends out there in the denominational system we have no friends out there in the denominational system not anything against the people the people might be just fine but the system itself is going to come after you that's a promise hallelujah and those who are married to the system will turn on you also because he's incarnate he's incarnate the people first and then he's incarnate the one vessel jesus in christ comes incarnate and the people first called the bride and then he comes back incarnate in one vessel spiritual and natural you've got to watch the spiritual and natural hallelujah so the pentecostal church and the pentecostal church is the final stage of the harlot system you have to realize that that the catholic system came up to thyatira and we'll get into this maybe more on sunday the catholic system came up through three stages then in the fourth stage it's come to the pinnacle of its power and it gave it was given space to repent it did not repent and went into spiritual death and then the protestant system rose out of that and for the final three church ages the protestant system's been going and the final stage is pentecost and here comes a prophet on the scene that says pentecost has is dead it's come to death because as as the as the protestant harlot system was moving into death there was a system of the bride that was moving into life because the battle has always been between life and death christ and antichrist hallelujah only two forces and the four seal on mine he knows you yet he gave her space to repent but she didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it hurry so he gave her space to repent she didn't do it he's talking about the catholic church you have the and the harlots the mother and the daughters he's he's done it again because he did it to the pentecostals he's done it again she won't do it her rejection away makes her her rejection makes her a perfect way for satan to come into her and incarnate incarnate what incarnate the false church and let's read that her rejection whose rejection the false church her rejection makes a perfect way for satan to come into her and be incarnate incarnate himself right in her because she rejected the word and that's exactly the same thing that the protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejected the vindicated truth of the word of god and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he will make an image unto the beast when they can consolidate together right yonder now and go on and do just exactly what he said so now the devil that now i told you before the secret of the four seals incarnation that's the secret of the fourth seal an incarnate devil and an incarnate god and you just have to know where are they incarnate at one is incarnating himself in the false church that was given space to repent and she did not repent and her rejection of the word makes up the perfect scenario for the devil himself to enter into her right why because he's only copying what god is doing the third seal said the first first three stages of them went into the dark age talking about church ages went to the dark age then the third three stages amen comes the church out from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost again incarnate god made manifest among us here he comes in as the antichrist as the false prophet then the beast then in dark age and the church comes out of that dark age justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost incarnate word the way now so those three stages was to bring god incarnate in the people justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost is the birth and the birth is god incarnate in his people and and the devil has worked his system down to where now she's rejected the word and he comes into her hallelujah but we come under the eagle anointing which is god himself the prophet and the children of god if god is an eagle his children are eagles hallelujah we've come through these these beasts these powers working through the church age but it's been building to something from the feet to the thighs to the legs to the shoulder it's building one it's building back the second masterpiece in the masterpiece family bringing back here the first half of the bible built to jesus christ the first part of the masterpiece then he took a piece off of that masterpiece to start making the second masterpiece and he's built it through seven church ages why he's building up the second masterpiece the male incarnation of god and the female incarnation of god and joining them together how hallelujah don't let anybody tell you you're insignificant you're a nobody that you're never going to make it that's the lie of the devil the message of the hour came to break your spiritual amnesia so you can see who you really are and this is who you really are amen you're not a nobody you're not washed up you're not beat down amen you are absolutely a child of god been redeemed by the blood of the god and has come to the true atonement no no no i'm just going to stop for a minute because we got to understand this you say the blood of jesus christ was the true atonement absolutely the blood of jesus christ is the true atonement but but but but but the word was made flesh the word before it was flesh it was the word and the word was made flesh and brother bennett said the word bled for you the word died for you you're saved by the bleeding bloody word [Music] the word amen the word is what bled for you the word that makes the bleeding of the word your atonement because now the word come down which you are a part of the word of god and that word come down and it all coalesced into one form and it was given an earthly blood and that blood was spilt for you it was the blood of the word so the blood of the word was spilt for you to redeem back all the word hallelujah and so now that that blood was spilled but when jesus spilt the blood and redeemed us back and paid the purchase price why didn't lucifer get destroyed why didn't he wrap everything up why wasn't it all finished then what have we been doing for the last 2000 years there's something more in redemption than just the calvary calvary paid the price there's nothing to be added to the price that was paid but redemption wasn't finished on calvary the price for redemption was paid at calvary but every attribute has to come to earth and be expressed to come into redemption [Applause] and so now you were saved by the blood that blood that dripped down was the blood of the word and the life that was in that word was released when the blood was spilled and the life of the word comes back to you the word to quicken the word that's inside of you hallelujah this you this has to register friends because now we have to understand why it's so important that the message came because now after that they're bloomed out of there a a church at pentecost amen this church had come under redemption the price was paid they had received the word and now they went out and they manifest what was taking place and the manifestation was doing the very same works that jesus christ did but something happened and they started to lose the word and when they started to lose the word amen they were losing something with atonement they were losing something with redemption because you're saved by the blood of the word and so now the lamb has been doing the work of kinsmen redeemer up behind the throne he's been sprinkling seven sprinklings of blood the cover for the ignorance of the people because the word was kept from them for generations and now they had to they had already been purchased they had to be preserved and they were being preserved by the lamb up there making atonement for them as a mediator saying they didn't mean it they don't know the word's been kept from them and he's mediating for them all the time but because the word was lost in order for us to come back to full redemption claims and for the atonement to be in full effect there has to be a return of the whole word and until there's a return of the whole word we have to hold in this pattern where the the lamb is up there as kinsmen redeemer covering for ignorance covering for ignorance covering for ignorance but god doesn't want him always covering for ignorance because the purpose is redemption redemption is to bring back to its former state reconciliation and redemption brother benham ties together redemption is to purchase back and reconciliation is to return to afford a former state so now you cannot come to god's mind for redemption to the purpose of the blood of atonement can never be fulfilled until there's a full return of the word and brother banham said the foolish virgin has to go into the tribulation for the purging amen because they refuse to accept the atonement in its fullness he said the atonement in its fullness the word because when the word was restored at the opening of the seals in 1963 now the full measure of atonement has come to the church and now the full effect of the blood has come to the church they were under partial partial partial yes they were being saved yes they were redeemed yes they're going to come forth in the resurrection but they had lost that life that they had at pentecost they had lost the power and the manifestation they had at pentecost because that's when they had the full revelation of the word but when they lost the word they lost the power and there was somebody up there covering for their ignorance until a time when the promised son would return because he said he said thy seed shall bruise his head and brother branham said he gave a substitute and that substitute was laying there paying a price until that full promise of the seed of the woman come into manifestation and when that full promise of the seed of the woman come into manifestation now it was time to do away with the substitute because now that promise that prophecy that was given in genesis 3 is now standing on the earth ready to take its place and when he takes his place and he dies and sheds his blood now the prophecy is fulfilled but remember everything in the bible happens twice moses smote the rock twice jesus was crucified twice and now now brother brenham says very clearly when you read through the seals book very clearly brother branham says now what happened is satan came in again and did what he did in eden and he deceived this early church and when he deceived this early church amen now they had compromised on the word and now there had to be a promise of the full measure of the seed of the woman to come back again and make it right and so now they're going through partial partial partial partial amen and they go through partial partial partial but there's got to come a time that the seed of the woman returns because the read full redemption is only in the full word you can't have partial it's got to be full amen he said moses was christ in a type all the prophets were building up what were they building as they come through the old testament they come through the psalms they come through the prophets they were building back the image of christ bringing back more word upon more word upon more word but there could not be atonement till the full word himself came and then that full word was lost but the blood was up there amen making atonement covering amen mediating for the sins of the people that were redeemed under that covenant but it had to build back again through legs i had to come back to full word again that's why the message is so critical that's why there was a prophet on the scene that's why there's an opening of the seals that's why redemption has been explained because it's got to come back to the full measure of the word again hallelujah this wasn't just something little neat thing that god was doing god had promised to do this all the way back in genesis 3 and the opening of the seals was fulfilling genesis 3 the seed of the woman was coming back into manifestation again hallelujah hallelujah the word was lost the word had to come the word was lost the word had to come hallelujah oh praise god now do you see yourself friends amen you're the one who sees this you're the one who believes this when it came to your door you didn't reject it but you accepted it and you found your identification right there making you a part of that word that bled and died that's why you were with him when he hung on calvary because you were part of that word amen that's why you were with him when he came down in a cloud on sunset mountain because you're part of that word that's why when he preached the seals you were right there in the seals amen because your name is in that sealed book and when he was preaching the seals it awakens something in you because you're part of the seals [Applause] why is it so easy for you to accept and somebody next door can't even see it makes no sense because it's for you you're part of that word this message had to come a prophet had to come the seals had to be taken off so that we can move into the full benefit of the atonement amen because the bleeding bloody word bled for you and died for you and without that full word you can't get full benefit of that blood but with the full word comes full benefit of the blood hallelujah oh my god it's good friends many prophets and wise men would have loved to see your day they could only see parts and pieces and they had puzzle pieces and they were trying to get them put together and they wanted so bad to see what you see for sealed brother brandon says but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high there ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there he sees where he's at some people get up there can't see where they're at so don't do no good to get up there brother braham says god claims himself to be jehovah eagle he's eagle himself he's papa eagle and we're little eaglets his children remember we talked about a little while ago we were talking about why does brother branham tell that story of the eagle in the chicken yard over and over and over again we're starting to realize these aren't stories these are parables jesus told parables amen and the parables were the mysteries of the kingdom amen and brother branham is not just telling cutesy stories he's giving parables that are the mystery of the kingdom and the mystery of the kingdom is that egg was always always always an eagle and it came out of its first position which was up high and the cleft of the rock and it was brought down to earth amen and it hatched out and was in spiritual amnesia it had not no idea what kind of creature it was it had no idea how it got here all it knew was all it had experienced in this earth coming from the lofty heights of a cleft of a rock coming down from the mountain to the earth and down on the earth it hatches out and it's just trying to live like all the other birds live chickens in the chicken yard scratching and eating meal and eating worms and and all this stuff and he's always a bit of a misfit amen but there had to come something something had to come to awaken him to his true self amen and what was it it was a creature just like him only fully mature and that fully mature creature flew over and screamed out what was the scream it was the voice of the fourth beast [Applause] and the voice of the fourth beat this called you and you looked up and when you looked up you said my that's me that's what i am i'm identified with that and all of a sudden you said but how how can i do this he said just jump just jump and flap your wings and you jump a little bit and you land on the post and you flap around a little bit before you know it you're flying in the heavenly going back to the position that you were formally in going back from where you were when you were taken out of the nest and put down the hatch out on earth now through the process you're going right back to where you came from what do you think the rapture what do you think that takes you to a new home the rapture takes you back home [Applause] hallelujah when that eagle lifted off the ground to fly it wasn't going to a new home it was going back to its original home only it had no recollection of that place amen it came down here and it had no memory of where it was before but when something screamed there was a familiar something in the heart and it was being called back to the place that it came from hallelujah this is why brother branham said i could preach on them seals for a month amen and still not touch at all hallelujah i haven't even gotten close to where i'm supposed to be and this clock says 899. hallelujah praise the lord that reminds me of something i just want to share something with you it might not mean a a hill of beans but it was interesting to me i was studying about this 144 000 because that's really important after the fourth seal when the beast starts riding and the 144 000 is the calling out of the jews and i'm looking at that and all of a sudden the thought strikes me how many jews are on the planet today so i pulled it up i went and looked i pulled it up and there was an article in israel national news and they had they got the number and when i looked it up it said 14.4 million 144. god's calling out a hundred and forty four thousand one four four and when i pulled up the census how many jews are on the earth today there's one four point four one four four i almost fainted i said this may not mean anything but to me right now i feel like rapturing i feel like how what are the odds it wasn't 14.5 15.4 144. those things get me excited i believe we're in the last days i believe we've come to the moment that we've all been waiting for this completes the battle friends if you notice this completes the battle the eagle anointing facing off against the pale horse incarnation completes the battle the spiritual battle between the two forces the devil incarnate and his bride in his church god incarnate in his amen and they all gather around trying to shut up the bride is that true this is before the devil is incarnate and the beast they build the world council of churches the ecumenical move they unite together and they come to close down these churches in churches like this and they gather around to shut her up but she'll never be shut up she'll be taken out and just about when they're about to uh succeed in their cowardly deed he snatches them away amen friends it's the eagle facing the pale horse amen it's life facing death spiritual death and spiritual life facing off again in the spiritual battle of armageddon and then when we go up he comes down and christ returns incarnate jesus christ himself to finish the battle we're in a battle right now and the final forces are facing off you know what that means i hope you catch this we've come all the way through this battle that started in heaven and came to earth we've come all the way to the end when brother branham said what have we come to we've come back this is what he says we have come back to satan and his angels and michael and his angels that's where we are right now we have come back to this original battle in heaven now we're facing it right now what does that mean that means you are the greatest fighting force this earth has ever seen cannot lose an invincible army by what by revelation my revelation of what the seals my revelation of the whole book my revelation we've come to a position amen where we realize what we are facing we don't fight against flesh and blood what do you think these scriptures are referring to and no soldier entangles him thinks himself with the things of the world put on the whole armor of god amen finally taking the sword of the spirit which is the word of god amen and there's a sword coming out of the mouth of jesus christ which he smites the nations and destroys his enemy what is all this talking about spiritual warfare the battle in heaven spilled down the earth and now it's come right back brother man said we have come back now we have come back to the devil and his angels and michael and his angels that means you're the elite fighting force you're not god didn't put you here in luther's day he didn't put you here in irenaeus's day he didn't bring you here to face a partial power of the devil he brought you at a time he ordained the attribute inside of you to arrive at a time to be awakened under not a partial word but a full word to face not a partial devil but a full devil and he gave you everything you need to overcome with because there's only one weapon that's the word and you don't have a short word you have the full word [Applause] hallelujah oh friends we've got to wake up and recognize where we are amen this is where we are you are put here to defeat the devil your purpose in this life is to overcome the enemy that's the only purpose in this life is you overcome the enemy you'll overcome him in your workplace you overcome him in your family you overcome him in sickness you overcome him and and and financial crisis you'll overcome him in catastrophe you are here to overcome him and everything he throws your way you are here to put it under your feet [Applause] you're here for the full word to defeat satan i am far from where i need to be will you be patient with me i'll tell you what if you've got to slip out you won't hurt my feelings at all i know people have to work kids have to go to school but there's something i'm desperate to get to isaiah 14 hour thou fallen from heaven o lucifer sun of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which is weak in the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit here this starts off in verse 12 with acknowledging that lucifer is fallen from heaven right how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer so in isaiah we find a fallen lucifer who's fallen let's go to ezekiel chapter 28 if we could turn there together just want to slow down for a minute and just lay this in ezekiel 28 verse 12. ezekiel 28 12 son of man take up a lamentation against the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest of the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering this artist topaz and the diamond the barrel the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle and the gold the workmanship of thy tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in the in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more never shalt thou be any more so we see in isaiah 14 we see lucifer cast down fallen from heaven all right but we see an ezekiel a future casting down and destruction do we got that so he's already fallen in isaiah in isaiah chapter 14. he's already fallen but here in ezekiel god says you've been in eden amen you've you've rebelled and i'm going to destroy you and you shall be no more and he's speaking of a future time all right brother ben says this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven this is super important that we catch this sin did not when we talk about original sin we've got to be careful that's original sin upon the earth but the original sin happened in heaven and when it was thrown down from heaven cast out of him into the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what this purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since hallelujah it went from the battle from angels to humans it's an old battle that started way back beyond time is out of the seventh seal and satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to earth and the battle set in and again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word now if satan comes down and through deception gets the children of god amen to to break down and let down on the word then satan has victory over the word so the battle has always been over the word because satan could not rebel unless he was rebelling against a commandment he could not rebel unless he was rebelling against the word i'll show you that in just a minute he won satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word not two it doesn't take two it takes one one of his subjects letting down on the word satan has victory over the word of god so glad god's predestinated a bride that won't fall if he hadn't predestinated you would never make it you're not smarter than eve you're not stronger than eve amen you're not in any better position the only thing that separates you from her is your predestinated position in the mind of god to overcome in this last day and you shall not be defeated why because he said so because he decreed it because he promised it because he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle amen that's why you're going to overcome in this day see so many times when you get into this position where we think this just can't be me this just can't be for me amen i'm going to let down on the word i'm going to fail oh my goodness what's happening now is the devil is tricking you to look at yourself but you fail to remember god's not looking at you god's looking at the lamb so why are you looking at you you need to be looking at the lamb and if you're looking at the same thing god's looking at you're going to see there's no blemish no blemish on that sacrifice that means under that sacrifice i have no blemish oh that takes a revelation that comes by faith you can look and you can look at all your faults and everything that's wrong with you but the god is not looking at your faults and not looking at you because if god looked at you he could not accept you he has to look at the lamb and because the lamb is perfect you're perfect [Applause] the word is perfect you're perfect the lamb is the word the word is perfect you're perfect you're saved by the blood of the word making you perfect by the blood of the word and when you receive the word amen and you receive the spirit of that word you are now washed in the water of the word and you are perfect by the word [Applause] not by your flesh not by the deeds that you do amen you are perfected by your faith in the word and it has nothing to do with your deeds your deeds are the works that you give back to god because you love him amen because you believe what he said about you and that puts in you such a love that his commandments are not grievous unto you you can't wait to do what he says but has never been based your atonement has never been based on your deeds your deeds are an evidence of your faith hallelujah somebody's going to go free somebody is going to quit being beat down by the devil and somebody is going to quit looking in the mirror to find out whether they're worthy or not somebody in this room is going to quit looking at themselves and start looking at the atonement and looking at the lamb and say if god accepts that he's got to accept me because i believe in that and i believe i'm part of that and i believe it's shed for me i'm part of the word and the word died and the word bled and i've accepted the fullness of the word and if the word is perfect i have to be perfect somebody is going to go free because it's based off faith and when you believe that that puts you back in your virgin condition it puts you back in your original state hallelujah look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did we're coming right back to what started in heaven we are marching right back to the same battle that was fought in heaven we're coming right back to it friends something went wrong in heaven and god has chosen to use this that we're going through now to fix what went wrong there and we're coming right back to that battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to the earth and he polluted eden then he's been polluting it ever since now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and it's to be finished on earth at the time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked him out michael and his angels overthrew them just run out and when they did it dropped right down in eden and here started the battle down here you got that so there was a war in heaven and when michael and his angels overcame them they cast them out and lucifer the devil came down into eden and in eden he started the work all over again hallelujah let's look in the bible actually i want to read a quote that day on calvary 1960 sin did not start on earth sin started in heaven how many sure of that now lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth you got that lucifer the devil was a condemned creature before his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same bases that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminences to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble friends what is he saying he's saying what took place in eden had already taken place in heaven that they were given a choice and the choice was between two trees knowledge of good and evil and life and every and satan lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice and he wanted something better than what he was given see that's why when we see something take place in eden it's only reflecting what just happened let's go to genesis chapter 3. let's look at this together i want you to see this very clearly in your mind see brother branham is never ever just pulling something out of his hat he's a word prophet and he's talking the word in genesis chapter 3 verse 22 after the fall god had dealt with judgment he had done all this and he said in the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil what happened what had just taken place in heaven now took place on the earth and after man fell by disobeying god's word god says man has become like one of us the heavenly host knowing good and evil the battle in heaven had spilled out to the earth what happened there had just happened down here who was god speaking to he was talking to the heavenly host man has just gone through what we just went through do you see that the lord god sent him it says in the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove the man out and placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now listen friends i want you to i want you just to pay attention to me for a minute to catch this god and his mercy would not let the man live forever once he had tasted this tree why because now man had become like us god says speaking to the heavenly host man has become like us knowing good and evil but god in his mercy wouldn't let man live forever that way why because heaven was stuck in that condition heaven is stuck in that condition and something about redemption on earth is going to fix that problem god moves him away from the tree of life until atonement is made because the man cannot live forever in this fallen condition why because heaven has had a rebellion heaven has had a rebellion against god heaven has had a war and now these subjects are cast out to the earth amen and now man has become like one of us and lest he take the tree of life and live forever i'm not going to let him i'm going to forbid it that's the mercy of god something was wrong in heaven something went wrong in heaven but something is going to be made right hallelujah praise the lord you have to ask yourself a question when satan came down he went to eden but brother branham said under this fourth seal when the bride goes up where does satan go now i thought satan already came down i thought satan was already cast out of heaven why do we see him cast out of heaven twice right he says satan you've fallen from heaven you've been in eden amen there was a battle in heaven brother bam said it come down to eden but after it goes through when the rapture takes place when the bride goes up now satan comes down amen let's look at revelations chapter 12 together there's a clue in there that you'll find out what he's doing there you have to ask yourself if he's cast out if he's lost his position have you fallen to earth what is he doing in heaven and revelation chapter 12 will tell you what he's doing in heaven revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which secures them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice you heavens and ye that dwell in them woe into the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that is that he hath but a short time so here after the rapture we're seeing satan cast out of heaven again satan's cast out of heaven where does he go he goes to eden after god's children fall through deception and disobey the word now we find him back in heaven in the book of job it says when there was a day that the sons of god presented themselves unto god satan also came and presented himself so now we see a satan fallen from heaven but now we find him back in heaven what's he doing in heaven what's his title in revelations chapter 12 he's the accuser of the brethren before adam has fallen before man had fallen there was a nothing to accuse the children of god for but when man fell now he becomes the accuser of the brethren he was given his position because of the fall of man because when he comes down he has a title he's the accuser of the brethren before the fall he could not accuse the brethren do you understand that so what causes him to cast down when is he fallen when does he lose his position when he can no longer accuse the brethren amen he's losing his position by faith and the atonement by the full word bringing full atonement rights to the people he's losing his grip on his position because the children of god are coming to a place where he has nothing to accuse them of because the only thing he can accuse them of is disbelief in the word that's the only sin is disbelieving the word smoking drinking adultery is not sin sin is disbelieving the word amen the original sin in the garden of eden was not adultery the original sin was disbelieving the word and now we're coming to a place by faith at the restoration of the full word bringing back the full life bringing back a perfect word for perfect faith for a perfect rapture now he has nothing to accuse them of and she goes up and he comes down that's how you're defeating satan by receiving the word amen not your muscles amen not your power not your brain but by receiving the humble word by receiving the full word of god you are absolutely causing him to lose his rights to his position in heaven the only right he has there was given to him in the garden of eden and we're coming to a place where we're going to receive the word she's predestinated not to fall you're predestinated not to disbelieve one word and when you come back to full faith in the full word he is utterly and completely defeated and loses his position and woe into the inhabitants of the earth for the devil has come down and he's angry because he knows he has but a short time because he cannot deceive the bride of christ anymore that's the battle you're in friends that's your victory it's a victory by faith in the word it's a perfect word bringing a perfect faith for a perfect rapture you're not going to find it you're not going to find a denominational doctrine you're not going to find it in theories of man you're not going to find it in the entertainments of the world there's only one place that you're going to find this overcoming power and it's in the revealed word of the hour and when you throw yourself completely into the revealed word of the hour that word brings a life that life brings a faith and brings you back to the original faith of the original fathers and that full faith in the full word causes him to utterly completely lose his position in heaven and he is cast down can i go a few more minutes amen let's just preach all night amen god is good there is nothing that gets me more excited than this there is nothing i love more than finding my position in the word and knowing that i i i have entered into the invincible army and god is building my faith to a place where i shall not be defeated because there's nothing in me that wants to disbelieve the word every time the words presented i want it and when more is presented i want more what is that that's the word coming to the word hallelujah praise god and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony the word of their testimony that word testimony is more often than non-interpreted witness they overcome him by the blood of the lamb in the word of their witness against him listen they don't just overcome him by the blood of the lamb they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their witness this word witness is the same when it's used of john the baptist when he comes to forerun and witness of jesus christ testifying of jesus christ amen this is the same word witness when jesus says the works that i do they witness of me same witness you have a word of witness to testify against the devil hallelujah your life your testimony is testifying against him he's the accuser of the brethren your life is accusing him it's witnessing against him he cannot defeat this bride he cannot get her to disbelieve the word he cannot have victory on this one he's taking out that one and this one and this one but there's coming one that's standing on the earth that he will not have victory over because she will not disbelieve the word and when they come to that full manifestation of full faith in the word he has absolutely lost his position in that way he cannot stay and when the bride goes up he comes down let me tell you something the bride is going up we're not waiting for the bride to go up i'm waiting for my body to change but i've already gone up friends i've already been called out of laodicea i've already been resurrected out of dead denominationalism i've been called out of laodicea into the bride age my soul has been raptured to another realm i'm waiting for my body change amen i'm not waiting for the rapture i'm right in the middle of the rapture i've went spiritually so that i can go physically hallelujah hallelujah we're raptured friends by the word calling us up higher in the dissension of christ and the lord shall descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god the lord himself shall descend when he comes to the shout we come up to the shout out his coming down is bringing us up the dissension of christ is the ascension of the bride [Music] you should already be living in heavenly places your thinking should already be leaving carnal thinking of the world and moving into heavenly places by the shout and the voice of the archangel and brother brenham says his voice is in her now the voice of the bridegroom is speaking through the bride what is it you're ascending higher the dissension of christ is your ascension friends hallelujah i want to go just a couple more minutes let's turn to luke together luke chapter 10 this is we're getting into the meat right here friends luke chapter 10 verse 1 after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray you therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into the harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves carry neither person or script nor shoes and salute no man by the way and unto whomsoever house she entered say first peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there your p shall rest upon it if not it shall return to you again don't stop reading there in the story brother ben is taking his disciples excuse me and he's taking them to 70 and he's going to send them out two by two and they're going to go out preaching the kingdom of god and preaching out amongst all these villages now jesus is not going his disciples are going you got that he himself is not going he's sending them out now let's go to verse 17 when they return and the seven the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject to unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven whoa what did he see satan fall from heaven when did he see satan fall from heaven when did jesus see satan fall from heaven when the 70 came back and says the devils were subject unto us he sent them out he himself didn't go he sent them out and when they did what he did jesus said i see satan as lightning fall from heaven what is what is causing the fall of satan is when the church is coming to its position and manifesting the very same thing that jesus christ manifested when they get to that place i see satan as lightning falling from heaven amen you're not called to be beaten down and trodden upon and be nobody in this earth you're here to take your position just like they did there remember everything in the word repeats and when jesus not himself calling casting out demons not himself overcoming the devils but when he sent out disciples two by two when they overcame it jesus testified that i saw satan as lightning fall from heaven it's you who cast him out friends it's you coming to the life of the word that cast him out he loses his position brother branham said in the message thy house it was immediately after jesus gave his disciples power against unclean spirits and then he they went out casting out devils sent them two by two he said don't go to the gentiles but go rather to the lost sheep of israel and as you go preaching them kingdoms of heaven and heal the sick and cast out devils and so forth then they come back rejoicing happily come back happily rejoicing and said he said rejoice not your your names rejoice not because devil's a subject in you but rejoice because your names are written in heaven he said i beheld satan falling from heaven like lightning see the power of that church moving forward had just upset the whole kingdom of satan friends we're supposed to be moving forward in the power of the holy ghost and the power of the word and when the power of the church moving forward had just upset the whole kingdom of satan you see and he saw him as he dropped from his places because god had again given power to his church he beheld him falling like lightning from heaven it was cast plum out of the holy places and everything the power the power of that church of them having power jesus said i give you power over unclean spirits and they really upset the kingdom of satan what could we do with it today oh praise the lord and friends we've got to expect these things because if we're going to upset the kingdom of heaven this church has to come back to its original condition like it was at pentecost pentecost is the example pentecost is the is the is the level of the church that we're working back to where did she fall from she fell from pentecost amen brother branham said in the acts of the holy spirit i tell you peter preached a sermon on the day of pentecost and 3 000 souls were saved the devil the devil never even moved out of his bed pay attention the devil never even moved out of his bed that's right oh well let him alone see but he passed through the gate called beautiful the next day and healed a man crippled from his mother's womb and all hell turned loose on him throwed him in the jail and kept him overnight yes sir put him in the prison the inner cell there because the phenomenal the devil said i can't let this thing get started now divine healing if they do they'll really will knock my props out from under me that's right because i might fool them around with a little theology once in a while but i sure can't fool the real thing that comes out of the people see it done i'll just stop this before that other group gets on the scene 3 000 people are converted in one day and and peter's never arrested they're not gunning for him they're not coming to arrest him and throw him in jail but he heals one lame man that is set by andy listen friends jesus walked through the gate beautiful and that man sat begging home from the time he was a child and they saw him daily at the gate begging arms there was a testimony that went out everybody knew him he was always at the gate beautiful jesus walks through the gate beautiful and doesn't heal this man because he's waiting for his church to do it [Applause] brother brahm said jesus didn't finish all his works when he was here on earth he left some of it for the church to complete jesus walking through the gate beautiful and he sees the man laying begging he says your time's coming i've got a redeemed seed that's going to be upon the earth they're going to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and my life in them is going to manifest amen what happened peter by peter healing that man not preaching to the 3000 and converting them but healing that man peter now vindicated the ministry of jesus christ because they knew that they were ignorant unlearned but they take note that they had been with jesus jesus didn't complete all of his works when he was here he left some of it for you to do yes hallelujah that makes me happy and the god of his evil age he said now we find this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve she is not that type of woman she will be tried by his word she will be tried by his word the bride as adam as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation the enemy face to face listen to this under the temptation the enemy face to face she failed on one promise and now the people that's called for his name of course his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not just by denominational truth or something but every word she is coming down to the showdown face to face just like the garden of eden only she's predestinated not to fall and when she doesn't fall i see satan as lightning cast down praise god let's turn to first john chapter three i am very close to being done you guys are wonderful i love you all first john chapter 1 verse 3 or chapter 3 first john chapter 3 verse 8. he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning stop the devil sinned from the beginning eden no heaven i got that so let's now now we're placing this the devil sinned from the beginning when he rebelled in heaven and when war broke out in heaven and for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil because the devil sinned from the beginning christ had to be manifest on the earth to destroy the works of the devil the earthly journey is fixing what went wrong in heaven the devil sent from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifest to destroy the works of the devil oh friends we got to see this earthly journey isn't a waste what we're doing we're in the battle and we're having victory and the victory we have the the lucifer will be destroyed forever god could not destroy him in the original battle or god would have and we know it served god's greater purpose we understand that but there was something that bound god by his own law that he could not destroy him and it cast down and god is setting a trap he come down to this earth and he put man in a weak state amen and he put him down there susceptible to fall and he put him in a flesh like an animal amen and made him where he could fall that's what brother branham said and satan took advantage of this weak condition and in this week and this is satan's having victory and god is just setting a trap because haman's going to hang on his own gallows esther's going to the throne and haman's going to hang on his own gallows and here the devil has built a gallows amen he's built it up he's trying to preserve his position in heaven and his kingdom on earth but the the bride is going to kick him out of heaven by her life of belief on the word of god total faith in the word of god she's going to kick him out of heaven and she's going to take her place on the throne in the kingdom the heaven he's trying to preserve is for her and the earth he's trying to hold on to is for her hallelujah now you see why he fights you so hard one subject let down on one promise that he has victory over the word he's trying to hold it off hold it off keep my position in heaven amen keep my kingdom on earth but satan your kingdom's coming down your kingdom's coming down because there's a full word bringing full atonement in this day with a full life to make it live in me not my life his life living through me hallelujah for this purpose because the devil sent from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil eve was deceived by the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life jesus went to the wilderness and was tempted by the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and jesus overcame not with his mighty powers but he overcame by one thing it is written showing us how we can absolutely overcome the pride of life the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh with it is written the word is our victory the word is our sword the word is our strong tower it's all in the word that's why the word was restored hallelujah partial word partial life full word full life who wants to read a message book now right brother said in the church age book he says you're you're you're only a strong spiritually healthy what else is it brother benjamin there's three you're only a strong spiritually healthy and something else as your knowledge of your word and your adherence to it so if you don't hear it and you don't adhere to it you're not strong and you're not spiritually healthy and you're not the third thing which is really good too but it's in the church age book see everything is based off hearing the word and adhering to it hearing the word and adhering to it but you've got to be hearing the word brother brahman said god god is trying to get this to you but you let so much take it out of you you let your jobs and you let your spouses and you let things of the world take it out of you god is trying to pump it into you and we're letting distractions of laodicean carnality take it out of us we've got to get ourselves separated god calls for total separation from all unbelief and this civilization is an unbelief civilization your phone your car your hospital it's all based on unbelief amen we've got to separate and come to the word hallelujah son of god was manifested he might destroy the works of the devil brother brother said in spoken word is the original seed christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil he's just quoting first john 3 8. you believe that now i can't explain all this i'm just going to throw through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long i said this before he's going to hit the high places won't stay too long this is a six hour sermon christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believed that what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same why because if he was word his body is word and the word of god is manifest to destroy the works of the devil not the word of god in here we've had this for hundreds and hundreds of years in print it's never destroyed the devil yet it's when the word is taken into a vessel and manifested out and that destroys the works of the devil jesus come by and he told his disciples i give you power over scorpions and over serpents and over every power of the devil amen that word meant nothing until somebody believed it and operated in it and when when peter goes down to the gate called beautiful and he said look on us gold and silver have i number such as i have give i unto thee what's he doing he's taking the word that jesus spoke now becomes manifest and the manifestation of the word destroys the works of the devil the devil the sin had put this man in this condition sin from hybridization sin from the garden had caused disease and disruption in mankind and caused this man he's sitting there afflicted of the attributes of sin that's the works of the devil christ was manifest to destroy the works of the devil and the body was done to do the same and jesus said i give you power but if peter would have never exercised that that would have just been words amen the words the words themself do not have the power to destroy the works of the devil it's the word made manifest that destroyed the works of the devil god had laid down prophecies in in genesis chapter 3 thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head amen that would have that that was laying there and laying there and laying there and until it was come manifest the serpent's head was not bruised so having the prophecy go forth yes it's a complete work yes it has to come to fulfillment but till the time of manifestation it doesn't express its full power and god has given promises in this day and we are not here to talk about the word we're not here to talk about the token we're not here to talk about the life but we are here to apply the token we are here to manifest the very life of jesus christ that's what we're here for and we have to expect it we have to know our place and we have to operate according to the word he was put here to destroy the works of the devil his body is to do the same and christ is the mystery of god revealed now christ the works that i do shall you do also see the same god the works that i do shall you do also more than this for i go into my father the church will be a little longer in light see vindicating his promised word he said the works that i do shall you do also more than this for i go into my father the church will be a little longer in the light what's she going to do while she's a little longer in the light vindicating his promised word that's our commission is to vindicate his promised promise as god did his promises in christ's body as god did his promises or fulfilled his promises in christ's body so is christ doing his same works in christ's body the church see now making his mystery known to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning this church is here to be the light shining in the top of the tree bringing back the original fruits that was in the church last scripture romans 16. romans 16. verse 20. romans 16 verse 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly i thought the promise was for the seed of the woman and and the serpent shall be bruised under this feet of the seed of the woman which we know is christ when christ came he was the seed of the woman and he came as jesus christ in that body of flesh and when he came in full measure in a body amen that was the fulfillment of that prophecy and he was supposed to bruise his head but here we get to paul talking to the church in romans and he is referring right back to that prophecy in genesis 3 that refers to christ and he says and the god of peace shall brew satan under not jesus christ's feet under your feet shortly why because there's two masterpieces going together to make the masterpiece family the male expression and the female expression the head and the body and the head has united with the body and now this has become the full manifestation of christ the seed of the woman on full display in our day to brew satan under your feet friends he is not coming down from heaven until you're in position he's not coming down to all unbelief is out of the church of god and she's operating in the full power of jesus christ and gone back to what she fell from in pentecost as long as we're not doing what god calls us do we're paralyzing the work of god you know why when when moses came to deliver the children of israel he came but the children of israel weren't ready for deliverance yet and he came and they said what are you a ruler over us and he runs out into the wilderness for 40 years over 40 years and while he's out there what's happening something's changing because they didn't want him when he first came but now after this long delay all of a sudden conditions have changed in egypt things have gotten worse in the world and now all of a sudden god comes down to moses and said i'm come down to deliver my people for i have heard the cries of my people they weren't crying for deliverance when moses were there they were comfortable but the the condition in egypt changed and when the condition of egypt changed now the people started crying for deliverance and god heard their cry and now it was time for deliverance the prophet came and brought us the word and he fully expected the church to rapture you listen to what he said he fully expected that church to go but have we come to the time where egypt has changed the world has changed over 50 some years now we've come to the place are the people now crying out for deliverance are we now are we now ready for what was brought to us the first time are we now ready to take the word that was delivered to us 52 years ago are we ready now are we crying out say oh god would you bring it now now i'm ready for deliverance i want that word now i want that manifestation now i'm ready to sacrifice all my ideas i'm ready to give up all my life i'm crying out for deliverance if you want something from god cry out for it desperation always brings god on the scene and it is time for this church to cry out for deliverance saying oh god we have been in this land we're in bondage in this land but you've promised us redemption and freedom to go back to our promised land amen there's a promise in the word the god of peace shall bruise satan i used to read this scripture i thought well that's neat satan's going to be bruised you know i'm thinking of bruce like oh oh oh i got a bruise let's see what this word means in the greek bruise is suntribo in the greek it means to break in pieces to shiver to tread down to trample on to break down to crush to tear one's body and shatter one's strength and god and god of the god of peace shall tear satan's body and shatter his strength and tear to pieces into shivers satan under your feet shortly he's not only going to lose his position in heaven he's going to lose his earthly kingdom haman's losing it all haman had worked a plan to where he was going to get it all he got the king's ring he got the king's friendship he's going to destroy his enemies he's going to be secure in the kingdom but there was an esther that came on the scene and when esther came on the scene she disrupted the entire works of haman and haman ended up hanging in his own gallows and satan has been trying to get keep keep the inheritance from the children of god and he's worked a plan and he's got certain rights because because of the fall and he's been the accuser of the brethren and he set up his kingdom on earth and he's a squatter bringing satan's eden he's got it all mapped out he's got his plan he's so close to having it all secure but there's going to be an esther that's going to disrupt the whole works and esther is going to see to it that haman hangs on his own galleries the god of peace shall break into shivers and tread down to break the body and destroy the strength of satan under your feet sure let's all stand musicians if you could come hallelujah amen [Applause] eagle time in an eagle age for eagles to fly i feel how many feel like flying i'm ready i'm ready oh my it's my when i find out that it's my life my obedience to the word my faith in the word of god that's going to utterly destroy him i tell you what friends what i want to do in the evening is read my bible i want to listen to the tape i want to dive into that word because that's the victory that's the sword that's the thing that will defeat the enemy and i i have to take the word and i have to receive the word and i have to submit myself to the spirit and let it flow through me so that we can all have victory as long as he as long as one subject lets down the bar on the word satan has victory over the word of god but he salt to it to predestinated a bride and he sent a word and he sent a life with that word that is going to assure that she does not fall how many is in that group hallelujah let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you for your word god you have been so wonderful to us lord many prophets and mighty men lord would have loved to see this day but we're just humble people lord we're farmers and mechanics and housewives and all kinds of different jobs that we have and we're old and young and middle-aged and bald-headed and gray-headed and everything under the sun and lord we're nothing special in the eyes of the world but we are a predestinated people lord and you're by the opening of the seals you're breaking the crust off of our eyes lord you're bringing us to a fresh revelation of your word to waken us from spiritual amnesia to take our place in this invincible army so that our enemy can be completely and utterly destroyed oh god forgive us for our compromise forgive us for our laziness lord strip us away from those things and bring us lord to your word let us have your word and only your word grant us faith lord quicken faith unto us that we might believe give us greater revelation open our eyes like never before to see your word oh god we love you we ask that you have your way with your people we yield ourselves to you we give ourselves to you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you saints i remember a story brother ram tells of the eagle going through its molting period he calls it the moping period sometimes and he gets down and he gets a crust that comes over his face and comes over his eyes there's only one way that he can restore his strength and go to the heavenlies he's got to get this crust off of his head and off of his eyes somehow somehow many who've been trusting the lord eagles not sinners eagles somehow get this crust of the world built over our eyes amen john the baptist brother bram said his eagle eye filmed over he got into a place amen he was in a condition in bondage and separated from the life of jesus christ not able to be associated there he got into a position where he had a film that came over his eyes and many times it can happen to your eye that that spiritual amnesia can begin to creep back in and we start to identify more with the world than with the word and crust but there was only one way for that eagle to get that crust he had to beat his head on the rock of revelation of jesus christ beat out all his old thinking beat out all his own stubbornness beat out all his own ignorance and he had himself to beat his head on the rock of the revelation of jesus christ how many of you need here today to beat your head on the rock of the revelation of jesus christ and say god give me fresh vision beat this crust of the world off of my eyes break spiritual amnesia for me let me see you lord oh god break the crust from off of our eyes friends you've got to beat your head on the rock of the revelation of jesus christ and all the scales will come off and you'll renew your strength and as eagles mount up with wings and fly god bless you brother joe you have a song for us amen let's sing this together we're going to let you be dismissed we've kept you a long time but i'm not going to say i'm sorry amen all i'm going to say is god bless you for your faithfulness god bless you because you love the word amen let's sing the song together father replied
