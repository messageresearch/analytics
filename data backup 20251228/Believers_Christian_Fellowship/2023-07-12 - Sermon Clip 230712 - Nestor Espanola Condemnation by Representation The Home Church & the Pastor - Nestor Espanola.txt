========================================

that's why the prophet said those who love you those you love God will give it to you see that's how important the pastor is praise God he is God's angels to you praise God to guide you he will be accountable to your soul see that's why I'm very careful even in our church I'm very careful when I studied the message when I started scripture before I give it to the people praise God see because that is the the last commandments of Jesus to the apostles if you love me feed my lamb Peter if you love me feed my sheep be there if you love me feed my sheep say if you love the Lord if the minister is a pastor love the Lord he will find he will find the food for God's children for the ship of God for the Lamb of God Hallelujah see that's why the message you cannot feed the flux in a wishy washy message you know praise God you cannot do that to the message believer say in the church that's why I've been telling you to the people read the message read the message in that way you will understand what I am saying I give you the quotation but if you don't read the message you don't know praise God the holy story Hallelujah say even if you read the message if you have no Pastor you will be like the eunuch remember that in the book of Acts then there is one unlearned man Phillips he said how how do I know if nobody explained it but he is a smart man Hallelujah that is what I'm telling to the people you need Pastor praise God you need home Church say Hallelujah when you are at home say yorat is you know it then here at home you're going to exercise everything Faith virtue your Temperance your patience praise God your godliness you can only do it here not in the outside Alleluia
