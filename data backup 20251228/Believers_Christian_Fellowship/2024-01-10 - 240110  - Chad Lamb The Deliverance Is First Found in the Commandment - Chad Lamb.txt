evening let's bow our heads together de Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be here to be able to sing the songs and mean them from their heart Lord not just a tradition not just going through motions but the reality that strikes us deep inside Lord I thank you for that reality and I thank you Lord you've given us a time and a place and a way to express that back to you with our brothers and sisters Lord we thank you for Gathering us together for bringing us here for Watching Over Us Lord as we come to look at your word we pray you would come and help us Lord that you would open our eyes that you would be the one that rubs the I have in our eyes give us eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you want to speak to us tonight for Lord we set aside this time to commune with you to worship you in spirit and in truth I pray God Lord that you would do what you've promised to do that you would come and feed your sheep but we're surrendering to you now take the preeminence among us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this evening it's good to be here here together once again and they say the weather looks like it's going to get bad but it is January you know we've had it pretty good so far so we praise God for that and we thank God that we could be here tonight let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Jeremiah together I just want to say is returning there that that this is going to be part one of a two-part and so I say that I preface that because I want it's going to take two parts to get the thought together amen so don't leave you're you're going to leave here today with half a thought amen so there's no way I could have put it all together in one package I I've got two things that I want to share and so I want to lay down this principle first that we're going to go into tonight but if the Lord still leads me the way I feel led today and things go the same way and the direction I feel that it's go on Sunday we'll come back and Lord willing will do part two and these two parts must go together amen and so just remember that that's my preface that's my disclaimer amen let's look together in Jeremiah chapter 7 let's turn to Jeremiah chapter 7 Jeremiah chapter 7 and let's look at verse 22 for I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that I commanded you that it may be well unto you man God bless you as you have your seats keep your Bible open in this spot we're going to continue on from here amen when we look at this if if you back up to verse 21 he says thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel put your burnt offerings into your sacrifices and eat flesh and that's a strange statement but if you understand that when they offered burnt offerings that was a whole burnt offering unto the Lord it was something that burned on the altar completely to God but when Israel would offer sacrifices amen that sacrifice they would give a portion would go to God a portion would go to the priest and a portion they would keep and it was a sign of them feasting with the Lord all right so part of the sacrifice many times the worshipper would keep and eat in the the priest would eat and then they believe it's symbolic of God also eating so we're on the same page but now he's saying take your burnt offering put it in your sacrifice and you eat the flesh basically God saying I don't want it anymore that if I could boil it down to layman's terms he's saying keep it for yourself I don't want it anymore so now we understand verse 21 then it brings us to verse 22 for I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices he's basically saying the original purpose I had in bringing you out of Egypt was not for burnt offerings and sacrifices that wasn't the whole point amen and when I first brought them out I never spoke to them about burnt offerings or sacrifices that wasn't what I wanted but this is what he says but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you and it may be well unto you amen and God was saying to them do this amen and keep my Commandments and obey my voice this I didn't talk about sacrifice I didn't talk about all this ritualistic worship all I said was obey my voice that's all I said that's all he wanted all God has ever wanted from the very beginning is somebody that will just obey his voice that was God's desire of people that would just obey him and listen to him and that's where man has failed All Through Time man has failed to simply just obey the voice of God and then he says I I I I desired I spoke to them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk you in all my ways that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you now now God is not saying amen uh walk in all that I command you so that you can make me feel good or that you can amen somehow bless me no he's saying my commandment was for your benefit that it may go well with thee amen it wasn't about amen making God feel good or it wasn't about no God gave commandment for their sake not for his but what did he want he wanted the people that obey his voice so let's turn keep your place right here in Jeremiah 7 if you can put one hand or put a bookmark and go to Exodus 19 we're going to read from Exodus 19 and come right back to Jeremiah 7 Exodus 19 we're going to begin reading at verse three this is when they been brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand they've been brought into the Wilderness of sin they've been brought to mount siani and in verse three of chapter 19 it says and Moses went up unto God went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all the people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel what was the first thing God told them when they come to Mount Si amen he told Moses to tell them if you will obey my voice he says if you will obey my voice and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all the people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of of priest and a holy nation amen what did God want God wanted a fellowship God wanted a people to be a peculiar treasure unto him Amen in order for them to do that they had to obey his voice amen they couldn't just walk in their own way they couldn't just go according to their own imagination but he had to bring them into his understanding amen and how did they get to this place in Egypt they didn't get here by their effort they didn't get here by their willpower they didn't get here by their wisdom they didn't get here by their Good Conduct they didn't get here by their obedience how did they get to this place because he kept a covenant he made with Abraham and he came down and rescued them himself it was an unconditional Covenant and he performed his oath and he did what he said he would do and he brought them unto himself he went and got them and brought them unto himself and now he's telling them amen this is where he picks it up in Jeremiah I didn't speak to them about sacrifices I didn't speak to them about burnt offerings all I said was obey my voice why he tells him and if you obey my voice you will be a peculiar treasure yeah amen now I don't think I don't want to I don't I don't want to think carnally on this I don't think he was saying if you'll do this then I'll do this as a reward for you doing this I hope you understand that if you obey my voice I'll reward you no he's just giving the reality if you obey my voice you will be a peculiar treasure in all the Earth cuz nobody else is obeying God this is what you will actually be he was they were already his Delight they were already his inheritance they were already part of the Covenant but if you obey my voice you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation that's what it's like if you obey the word let's go back to Jeremiah chapter 7 now Jeremiah 7: 24 says but they hearken not not nor inclined the ear but walked in the counsels in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward this has always been the problem God gave them opportunity he he gave him his voice he gave him his word and instead of just simply obeying his word they still walked in their own imaginations according to their own heart and they went backwards it wasn't very far it wasn't very long from the time he spoke to them in Exodus where we just read from Exodus 19:3 it wasn't very long from that moment until Moses was absent 40 days and what did they do they went right back to worship the gods that they had seen in Egypt and they made a golden calf and went right back they went backwards and not forwards amen and all they had to do was obey the voice of the Lord amen it wasn't about burn offerings it wasn't about sacrifices it wasn't about ceremonial worship it wasn't about any of that God wanted a people that would obey his voice amen amen let's let's turn from here back to Genesis chapter 2 this is where it all begins of course and for a title I'd like to write this title down uh like for you to write this title down it it's it's an interesting title the Deliverance is first found in the command commment the Deliverance is first found in the commandment and we're going to look at that and it's becomes self-evident once you look at it the Deliverance is first found in the Commandment why because if we keep the Commandment we never need Deliverance if we keep the Commandment we never need rescued we keep the Commandment we never need God to bail us out because our deliverance that we call for when we get in trouble is actually first found in the Commandment if we keep the Commandment we don't need the Deliverance so the Deliverance that we're constantly seeking and constantly going back the Deliverance is first found in the Commandment if we would just obey his voice we wouldn't need so much Deliverance all the time right let's look at this in Genesis CH 2:1 15 says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so there is the command that is the that is the only commandment he gave to man in the Garden of Eden that's the only instruction he gave to him and everywhere else he said you can freely do this you can freely do that you can eat of every tree you can enjoy you can become a god upon this Earth I've given Eden over into your hands amen and he had absolute Liberty but there was one Commandment that he gave to man and that commandment was don't eat of that tree Amen brother B said in the message leadership he said at the Garden of Eden what caused death and all this sorrow every heartache every little dying baby every rattle in the throat every ambulance scream every hospital every graveyard was because Eve doubted one word not all of it just a it just perverted it now God said man he was to keep every word of God now that's the first of the Bible amen they they were completely delivered free protected safe from all harm from everything amen if they would have stayed with the first commandment if we they would have stayed with commandment Numero Uno they would have never had had another commandment that's right do we understand there would have been no reason for the law there would have been no reason for anything else because they wouldn't have fallen into a sin nature they wouldn't have have digressed and degenerated as human beings amen they wouldn't have had a corrupted mind amen none of the things that we see death would have never set in sickness would have never come corruption would have never come on Earth they would have never been in a hybrid condition all of the things that come later amen that require so much more instruction they would have never needed if they would have kept the first commandment the Deliverance was already embedded in the Commandments amen that's why it's better to obey than to sacrifice amen because obedience that's what God says all I wanted in the beginning was somebody that would obey my voice amen and he had his children on the earth and the only thing he asked them to do was obey his voice concerning this one matter and they failed in that and when they failed in that now it set up a scenario where they had to be delivered amen but the Deliverance was first found in the Commandment so look at Genesis chter 3 verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw the tree saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat I love I I I say this it's a redundant statement and it goes without saying but I love the Bible I love how perfect everything is laid out I love that the longer you read it and the more revelation God gives the more perfect it becomes in every jot and every turt and now the the serpent comes to begy and we know he's anointed of the devil we know he's actually possessed of the devil amen and he's here trying to tempt the woman and he comes to her and asks the question about the one commandment the only thing that's withheld Amen in in she says we may eat of the Trees of the garden but of the tree in the midst of the garden we're not to eat of it nor touch it lest we die and he begins to contradict that statement and when he begins to contradict that statement he begins to make he he begins to appeal to a desire in Eve he said for God verse five for God do know that in day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil now all of a sudden he he goes beyond the commandment and and he starts to impose his own uh his own interpretation of why God doesn't want you to eat the tree is that right he starts to add to the word by his own interpretation and now he's giving her his idea on why God because God never said why do you understand when God gave the Commandment he never said why he said don't eat of that tree but he never said why not to eat of that tree amen because there's no reason to know why you don't need to know why the protection is in the Commandment even if we don't understand it and that holds true today friends the protection is still in the Commandment even if we don't understand it amen so Eve didn't understand why because God never had said why so she just had the Commandment with no why there was no reasoning behind it there was no explanation without reasoning without explanation without understanding she was still perfectly safe behind that commandment and nothing could ever harm her we think we only should do what we understand and we should only keep Commandments that we understand listen it doesn't matter friends if it comes from the Lord just obey because the protection is behind the word amen so many times amen there's little deceitful serpents that come along and say well you know he said that because and this is there because forget the because amen just take the word at face value and believe it amen brother B said in Satan's Eden Eve did not want to do that but he showed her how it was more wisdom in it she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and God told her not to try to understand praise God it wasn't that God said don't try to understand he just gave her no explanation meaning you don't need to understand this amen all you need to do is obey it oh I love it so what did she do she took what the serpent said and when the serpent now began to give his own interpretation of the why she took another look at the tree why now she's trying to discern something figure out whether the Serpent's right or you know what was told she doesn't understand so now she takes another look she readdresses something she should have never readdressed she begins considering things she never should have considered she begins to look at this tree and she begins to say well now look it's good for food and there's nowhere in the scripture that says that's untrue right she looked and it saw that it was good for food she saw that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise you know I believe all of those things were true I believe that was the characteristics of that tree she was properly Discerning the characteristics of the tree but the problem was when she saw well that's good and that's good and that's good she in herself couldn't see where the bad was she was blind to the problem she could see positive characteristics she could see benefits of the tree because the serpent opened that up to her to where now she's want she wants to know something she doesn't know she wants to understand and God never gave her any inkling of an understanding cuz she didn't need to understand all she needed to do was obey and she was perfectly safe so now the serpent begins to open up this this this scientific side to start to analyze the word and to start to use her own discernment on the word and then after all the discernment when she couldn't find anything bad about the word amen she believed the serpent she was beguiled she was deceived amen and she took of the tree and ate and gave to her husband and he ate with her and then we found out then the whole the whole system came crashing down immediately everything began to fail because immediately they begin to realize that they were naked their eyes were open they realized they were naked now all of a sudden they felt shame they felt fear they felt all kinds of things amen everything God was protecting them from without explaining why they started to realize now what was the implications of leaving the word in the message lean not unto thine own understanding he said but look friends listen nowhere in the Bible were we asked to understand we're not asked to understand it we're asked to believe it believe it by what by faith if you understand it then that makes makes Faith an old you can't understand it but you believe it anyhow if I could understand God I wouldn't have to believe God I do not understand God no man understands God I can't understand the word of God but I accept it I believe it and I'm not asked to understand it praise God Amen you know we we we sometimes have to just be children so let's go to Genesis 22 in Genesis 22 let's read verse one Genesis 22 and 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of this is a a Commandment that God now gives to Abraham and God gives him no explanation of why no understanding whatsoever of why he needs to offer Isaac he just tells him to take his son his only begotten son and offer him on Mount Mariah you talk about a trial that's a trial man and it says God tempted him it said I'm sorry it said and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham this word tempt means test or try God was testing or trying Abraham and he sent him down there now Abraham begins to he takes the boy he takes two servants he takes some mules he begins to go down and and he's going to perform what God's told him to perform but he has no understanding of why there's nothing else there's no explanation God gives nothing else that he can go on he doesn't know what this means he doesn't know what this is all about amen the only thing he knows is that God gave me this sign and the promise of the inheriting all things and the promise of being a nation is in this sign it's in the name Isaac because that's what God told him that's all he has amen he even has his own suppositions he has his own ideas amen because we we find out in the New Testament that go that he offered Isaac amen believing that God was able to raise him from the dead as he re received him from the dead so he had his own idea about how God could do this amen but he didn't have any understanding as to why do you think Abraham knew that this was foreshadowing a father who would offer the promised son for the Salvation of the world he didn't have a clue what he was doing he was just simply obeying God and he comes to verse 11 he says and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I this is when he had taken his son tied him laid him on the the wood amen he had taken the knife in hand to slay his son and the and the angel of the Lord St stops him verse 12 and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou has withheld thy son thine that not withheld thy son thine only son from me I think God was pleased amen God was pleased but God made him go through all the Motions he didn't make it easy I this wasn't an easy commandment to fulfill this wasn't something light or trivial and I can just do that and please the Lord no this was the probably the most costly thing ever to Abraham the most painful difficult thing he'd have to do but God asked him to do it and as he doing it amen God stops him at the last moment because Abraham had the to fully obey and Abraham had to be committed why because Abraham is the father of the faith and we are Seed of Abraham by faith this is the example this is our father and this is the way we should act now let's go down to verse 15 and the angel of the Lord called into Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and H has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice what has God always wanted he's wanted his children to obey his voice I don't think he's changed his mind today brother man was preaching this in 1964 in a message called the patriarch Abraham this is what he said what a promise because of obedience obedience is what God wants it was once said obedience is better than sacrifice to obey the Lord is better than any sacrifice that you could do you realize that the the that the churches are caught up in all kinds of sacrifices the church world the nominal Church World they do all kinds of good works and and and there's nothing absolutely nothing wrong with the good works there's nothing wrong with feeding the poor there's nothing wrong with taking up clothes drives there's nothing wrong with missionar work there's nothing wrong with sending Bibles overseas there there's no way you can fault that in any way and call it evil the problem is they're doing sacrifice with no obedience because they completely reject the word of God Amen and so when you we remember with the statement to to obey is better than sacrifice amen it comes from it comes from 1 Samuel when Saul was told to to to destroy the amalekites he was told to utterly destroy the amalekites and he was told to destroy their villages to destroy their cattle to destroy the young to destroy the babies to destroy the women to destroy the men to utterly and completely wipe them out amen but Saul does not completely wipe them out he preserves their King he preserves some of the choices of the animals and he preserves all of that and saves it amen and then when Samuel comes along Samuel comes to him and he says what is this bleeding of sheep that I hear and the Lo of cattle amen and he's saying oh we've we he goes first he says I did what you told me to do I did what the Lord said he says no you didn't do what the Lord said because to do what the Lord says is to do exactly what the Lord says not 90% but exactly what he says that's obedience amen because when we mix obedience with our own desire and alter the word of God to fit our own desire that's actually Rebellion not obedience and we may be able to get brothers and sisters to look at that and think of that as obedience but obedience is 100% not 90 I hope we're on the same page that's obedience and I'll just read it to you out of 1st Samuel 15:22 you don't have to turn there but 1st Samuel 15:22 he says and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord this is basically what he told Jeremiah when I brought you out of Egypt I didn't discuss burnt offerings and sacrificing but this that you obey my voice now Samuel saying what do you think pleases God most feeding the poor doing missionary work uh uh visiting the homeless what do you think what do you think he desires the most fasting and prayer and coming to church every service paying tithes and giving large sums in the offering what is more pleasing to him that are obeying his voice he said behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion he called what he did rebellion and what did he did mostly obeyed yeah and it was called Rebellion for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord Heath also rejected thee from being King Saul claimed that he kept the word of God and he did partially but through the voice of Samuel we find out how God views that he views that as Rebellion amen let's turn to Leviticus 26 together Leviticus 26 verse three Leviticus 26 and verse three if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and do them then I will give you the rain and due season and the land shall yield her increase and the Trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach into to the Vintage and the Vintage shall reach into the sewing time and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give you peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will rid evil Beast out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and you shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by The Sword and five of you shall chase a 100 and aund of you shall put 10,000 to fly and your enemy shall fall Before You by The Sword for I will have have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my Covenant with you and you shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new all of a sudden God is trying to teach them here in Leviticus as they move as they're moving into the land he's trying to teach them all you have to do is obey me and I will take care of everything else this is the lesson that he wants them to learn if you will just obey me amen he he tried to keep it simple it was simple the garden they failed he tried to keep it simple in The Exodus Journey it was really simple and what God was going to do was give them Ten Commandments and that was it he was going to add nothing to that but when they rejected him and ran away from him now came a law of ordinances and the Book of ordinances came what is God trying to do he just really wants to get the people to understand there's only one way and the only way is to hear my voice and Obey and if you'll do that everything will be fine they told them now if you will obey my voice and hearken unto my Commandments to do them I I will send the rain you'll have the Harvest one Harvest will lead to the next Harvest to the next you'll have plentiful you're going to have to get rid of the old because you got to make room for the new you're going to have an abundance of everything no Army will come in here and threaten you but you'll be protected amen no sword will go through your land amen he promises them no pestilence he promises no Beast will come in to do damage he promises in other places all your all your yous will lamb amen all all your heers or all your cows will will will have have have uh uh what are baby cows calves woo praise God now you see what good linguist I am they were absolutely under the blessing of God when they were under the word of God but we see this cycle in Israel how many of you read the Old Testament this is the cycle what is the cycle God gives them the Commandments he tells them he'll bless them if they stay in his word amen they stay for a season and begin to drift and it always starts slow at first and then it gets worse and worse and under the drift all of a sudden Calamity start to come amen bad weather strikes them they have they lose crops enemies start to come in beasts start to multiply amen the their their their their herds start to fail everything around them starts to fall into ruin amen and what's God doing he's trying to drive them back to the word because only the word will work amen remember this whole battle did not start on Earth this started in heaven and there was a rebellion against the word in heaven and now that Rebellion is spelled out to the Earth and God is trying to get his children to do one thing and only one thing stay behind the wall of the word and everything will be fine amen that's the lesson that's the cycle the cycle keeps repeating amen and then they would fall and then they would cry out to the god they would repent he would come in and rescue them and promise protection they would go for a while and they would go back into the same cycle but God's word never fails never fails just like in Eden if they would have stayed behind the One Singular commandment they had there would have never been an ambulance there would have never been anybody died there would have never been old age no starvation no war it's all because they let down the bar on the word let's go to Malachi chapter 3 Malachi chapter 3 verse 7 Malachi 3 and7 even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you sayeth the Lord of host but you said wherein shall we return will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed God where have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of host if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will rebuke the devour for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the fields saith the Lord of hosts same thing same principle same thing we're talking about he says your fathers left my ordinances amen you're under a curse you're he says you're under a curse right now and they're like where how what did we leave and he and and he begins to tell bring him back to the simplistic understanding of tithes and offerings you're under a curse because you've robbed me you've kept back that portion that I've told you to bring your tithe and your offering but he says test me prove me come back to the word repent and return back to the word and see if my word doesn't work see if I won't destroy the devour for your sake see if I won't keep your fruit on the vine until it comes fully right see if I won't preserve your Harvest see just test me and see if the word doesn't work and I say that today why we we we have tested him we've come to the word and we can stand here and say he holds the fruit on the vine amen he he keeps the devour away he prosp ERS He blesses he does that because we have no capacity to do things in ourselves we can't protect ourselves one iota we're weaklings amen we're inept we're unable but by the grace of God we have come to this open book to this word and God has preserved our families he's preserved our children he's preserved Us in every single way that we can be preserved amen we've already we've already tested this and proved that it works amen you know as parents we begin to understand this principle because when you have a when you have a little toddler that's just starting out in life they have no understanding whatsoever is that right no understanding so I'm going to give them Commandments for their sake right to keep them safe to protect them for their prosperity and health and good good fortune but they don't understand neither can I make them understand but if they stay within the confines of my word they will stay safe they won't be harmed they will grow healthy everything will work out for them amen I think it's so wonderful that God Amen allows us to flesh this out so we can begin to understand these things amen that now I mean I cannot make them understand I wonder if God could have made Eve understand all the consequences of leaving the word right she had she had no contrast with which the base the understanding on I don't think she could have understand she was so new she was so fresh let's just say she was so young an inexperienced if I could say it that way yeah it's like you take a child and you have a young child and you're walking into a crowded place maybe you've gone to a fair or to an open market or you're at the zoo or you're someplace amen and you tell that child you stay next to me and never get away from me hold my hand when we walk through here and you don't get without of arms reaching me because you know what kind of evil lurs in the world and you know what people what harm there is to young children and what people will do to young children that's right but you can't make that young child understand that neither would it be responsible for you to scare them by telling them all the possible dangers does that make sense it wouldn't be right it would be wrong for you to terrify them by saying you know what kidnapping is and you know this and there's abuses and yeah you understand what I'm saying that would terrorize them they're too young they can't comprehend they don't understand amen but they don't need to understand all the consequences and all the Evil all they need to understand is one thing a mom and dad are have my best interest in mind and if I listen to them it works out fine that's why we discipline our children they need to understand you have to obey my voice because if you don't obey my voice you could be in serious danger one day that's why when we're at home amen we speak with a calm voice we give calm commands to our children and if they don't obey then they get the repercussion we don't want to get them trained to the level that they only respond when we get louder and louder and get really mad and then they'll finally stop because sometimes they need to respond the first time when you're on a busy street when traffic's going by and you need to say Johnny stand still not Johnny stand still because he's only used to listening then right right why because we're doing it for their benefit am God has been training us to keep his word yeah amen amen because it's the only thing that works it's it not halfway not one foot in one foot out not partial but we've got to come to full obedience to the full word of God that's the day that we live in so we understand this as parents we've seen this work but really the the reality is true for all of us when we're new Believers we don't understand there's so many things we don't understand yes yeah and and there's so many things maybe the prophet says when we're we're a new believer that we don't fully comprehend why he says it and what all is attached to that amen but it's inconsequential whether we understand it or not because the same protection is still available just in obedience amen I don't have to understand it all I have to do is know this is the voice that God sent in this day to direct me amen and I've got faith that this is coming from the word and the word of God always works amen and as new Believers we don't understand just like that little 5-year-old doesn't understand the dangers that are in a crowd doesn't understand the people that are there and what they're capable of but Mom and Dad understand all he's got to do is trust mom and dad and he'll be fine but as that little T ages and he becomes at the age of 15 16 17 amen he begins to understand what he didn't understand before amen not because he's been trained in his natural progression of life and we as new Believers don't always understand every commandment everything the prophet said everything that we've been re all the instruction we've received in this day but it's inconsequential because our protection is in obedience but as we mature all of a sudden the light bulbs start going off that's why that's why that's why that's why amen amen you think of parents you take parents with a teenage daughter amen they're protecting that girl keeping her in modesty amen because they know the danger that lurks out there right and I would say not even the danger that lurks out there amen because there's danger all around us because everybody's in hybrid flesh don't think that the danger is only outside the message the danger could be in the boy sitting next to her because he's also in hybrid flesh and if he's not born again there's danger there do we understand this is real reality friends amen and so we're we're we're taught to dress modestly with shamefacedness and sobriety not with the platting of the hair the outward ad dorant and all these other things and the prophet of God come and reinforce this so well amen but when that girl moves into those teenage years or just prior amen there's a desire in every girl to be pretty brother said it's natural nothing wrong with that it's natural but if if we don't understand we as Parents Ought to understand understand that what the prophet taught us is for our good because if we let that daughter start to dabble around in flat fashion and start to play around I mean with a little bit of this and a little bit of that and she starts to take a little bit of mascara and she just touches a little bit of this and a little bit of that and tries this fashion and tries that hair do amen there may not be anything evil or Wicked in it but I just want to run a scenario past you let's say she tries a little something amen then she goes and and and and it's on the edge and amen yeah and she goes to a youth meeting and that happens to be the day that a boy pays attention to her now what did she just learn that if I get a little fashion and do a little do my hair up a little bit and maybe drop a little uh put a little manicure on my face I'll just say what the prophet said right then it equals attention from a boy right and there the Trap is set yes amen that's it now she's stuck thinking in order to get attention I've got to push these barriers yeah and she doesn't know that that boy may had may had nothing to do with the way she wore her hair that day or the clothes she put on that he may have been attracted to her for her character right yeah and this is the first time he's had a chance to show her but she's attaching it not to character but to looks yeah and then all of a sudden she's in the Trap it's our job as parents to keep them out of these traps because you want your daughter I want my daughter to know that that boy loves her for her that he's attracted to her character amen that she's pretty too she wants to be pretty and she wants him to attracted to her because he's pretty there's nothing wrong with that but natural beauty not the Max Factor yeah amen not cover girl but uncovered girl girl amen the real girl is what we want because it sets up these little traps amen all because we allowed a little experimentation we don't want to be too strict and all of a sudden we're going to have problems when we just listen to what the prophet of God told us it spares us from so much trouble amen and you know that teenage girl doesn't have to understand you can explain you can share but at the end of the day she's protected because there's a mom who's been down this road before there's a mom who understands a girl's heart and how easily it can be ulated by a boy's affection and so it's so much better when she didn't have to do anything special or anything extra and that boy was interested in her anyways and now she spared from the trap amen so these things are examples but we see them as parents we understand them the same thing is true in the gospel the prophet has taught us things that maybe at this stage of life we don't understand maybe in our early days as a Christian maybe we don't quite understand why and maybe the Bible says something I don't quite understand why it's written that way and then the prophet comes and interprets that scripture to us and say this is what it means listen let's just get in the habit of saying God whatever your voice says to me I want to heed that because I've learned from Adam and Eve I've learned amen from The Exodus Journey I've learned from Samuel I've learned from all of these that there's only one thing that you want and you want me to obey your voice and if I obey your voice I'm perfectly safe and me why was it that he loved David so much over Saul because he said he got himself a man David a man after his own heart that will do all my will amen that's what he was looking for that's the king that he set up one that would do all his will that's what God wanted amen let's go to Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6: 25 he says in Matthew verse 6 our chapter 6: 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not life more than meat in the body more than rment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into the barns yet your heavenly father Feth them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one Cuban into a stature and why take you thought for reignment consider the llies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spend and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all of his glory was not AR raid like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which the day is which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you it sounds like the same promise that he gave to the Israelites that if you obey my voice and follow through my commandment I will give you I will take care of all of these things it sounds very similar to that to me here in the New Testament seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all of these things your reignment your clothes and everything else it'll be taken care of amen amen seek the word of God first seek the kingdom of God first and God will take care of everything else amen there was a uh some examples that I I wrote wrote down some other examples I just I like the practicality of the word there's so many times that we get into problems in our families we get into uh trials let's say we get into a marital situation where there's marital strife and and then all of a sudden we need deliverance we cry out to God save our marriage save our Deliver Us help us and we go to the pastor we go to counsel we do whatever we can we get everybody praying that's wonderful but the Deliverance was already in the Commandments yeah amen if you go back to Ephesians and just take what Paul the Apostle said husbands love your wives as Christ love the church wives see that you reverence your husbands no matter what kind of trouble you find yourself in and no matter what kind of problem comes your way if we'll just work it back to the word I guarantee there's a breakdown in that Simplicity of that Commandment that the Apostle Paul we br broke it down somewhere either that man did not love his wife the way Christ loves the church or that wife was not reverencing her husband and it brought a breakdown in the family and we we could call it all kinds of we stress because of work and the finances are this and the kids are that no the reality is somewhere we stopped obeying the word and when we left the word amen we left the protection of the word and now we got all kinds of tension and strive when what we need to do is repent and come back to the word and God will bless his word amen yes amen we we we come to the stage where we have teenagers and and the whole world expects that teenagers are problems they're all problems listen I have raised five teenagers and they've been no problem whatsoever and it's not because I'm smart has nothing to do with that but I absolutely believe the word of God that there's a promise in that word amen and if I do what the scriptures tell me to do in discipline and requiring obedience keeping them in the word keeping the atmosphere in my home I believe with all my heart that God will keep the devour away from my door I believe with all my heart amen you know I'm speaking in generalities I know that bad things can happen in difficult situations I don't want anybody feel condemned but the reality is God has made us promises and if we stay behind the word it has to work friends it's got to work and we can say what do I do about my rebellious child they won't listen to me they won't do anything I say they won't the problem was not 16 177 the problem started at 12 months 18 months when you didn't do what the Bible said to train a child in the way should go and when he's older he'll not depart brother R said it's not child delicacy it's parent delinquency is the problem so you can see it's the simple obedience to the word of God and letting the word shape our lives that is protecting us from so much trouble amen I mean we can just look around we are a spared people I don't know I mean and most of you have jobs have families have associations outside the framework of the church and you see the catastrophe that are striking lives everywhere not just rebellious children now children addicted to drugs at young age promiscuity amen all kinds of horrible things that people are dealing with and we don't have to deal with it why don't we have to deal with it am man wasn't it cuz we're a better people cuz we're smarter cuz we're wiser because we got our ducks in a row it has nothing to do with that this is simply a product of obedience to the word of God we have come to the word we have practiced the word and the word has produced the results that he promised it would be produce it's not a mystery it's a reality amen yes amen it's simple it's the simple things that are overlooked and neglected that become big problems and then we want rescued down the road we need a deliverance we need a miraculous solution to our problem but the solution the Deliverance was embedded in the Commandment right the Commandment held the Deliverance but because we're a fallen people so many times we failed with the commandment and now we're reaping what we sow I think we should all be encouraged just to keep the word of God say God put a hard in me to keep it God open your word to me give me give me understanding give me wisdom give me all the tools I need just to Simply obey your word because I failed I failed I failed but I don't want to fail anymore because there's consequences for being outside of the word there's blessings for being in the word amen so many times that we CR cry out to God for deliverance from medical conditions and and and God you've got to save us from this sickness you got to save us from this disease I mean you take for example diabetes God you got to save me from diabetes but they proven diabetes in in many many cases is linked to diet it's no mystery anymore it's the American diet so we've been instructed how to take care of these temples smoking drinking things that are harmful using of tobacco and if we would just do what has been told it would spare us so many things we'd be spared by what simple obedience to the word of God Amen we need to say that word is for my good amen every word of God is for my good and I'll just stay with the word so many problems we don't face and we won't face because of obedience to the word God is good let's go over to the Book of John John chapter 8 verse 51 now we've come into the New Testament and we're going to listen to the words of Jesus John 8:51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death let's go to verse 14 or chapter 14 sorry let's go over to John Chapter 14 verse 15 if you love me keep my Commandments verse 23 Jesus answered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come in we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me let's go to chapter 15 verse 9 chapter 15:9 as the father had loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full how is your joy going his Joy going to remain in you and how's our joy going to be full when we keep his Commandments it's that simple there's a promise that comes with it it's not just for the Old Testament this is for the New Testament too let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 36 First Corinthians 14-36 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord amen now Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments now the Apostle Paul says if you're a prophet or spiritual acknowledge that the things that I write unto you they are the Commandments of the Lord so now it's not just keeping just what Jesus said but now what Paul said because what Paul said are also the Commandments of the Lord amen and see this is what this is the foundation that the early church was built on uh Paul the Apostle says I am the chief master builder I have laid the foundation and the and we know the foundation the Chief Cornerstone with Jesus Christ and it was the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets and he says I have laid the foundation of the chief master builder be careful how you build on because he brought the word amen that was to lead this first church out but what happened in the first church age a white horse rider came in and began a deviation off the teachings of Paul amen and what happened we know church history we know what happened it didn't go up it went down it started to decline it started to deteriorate until it moved Into the Dark Ages why because it had left the teaching of the Apostles and Prophets with Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone there was a blessing attached to the word there's a curse from leaving the word but God wasn't going to leave it in ruin he was going to bring it out how was he going to bring it out he was going to bring it out by restoring the word and as he restores the word when they come to the word blessings start pouring back in and there's a restoration of the brid tree praise be to God so here's what brother Brenham says in uh Balman Gilead so I want to tie everything together with these last few statements if you'll just stay with me said notice how that's just because the preachers just let down let it come right in the church finally just gradually creeping in a little bit like this and I sat and talked to an old Methodist preacher not long long ago used to sing a song we let the bars we let down the bars we let down the bars we compromise with sin we let down the bars the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in and then brother RM says this well I think his song really expressed it you let down the bars that's all you just let down the bars one came in and he began to talk he began to talk it this way and they begin to look and he prospered a little bit and he said well if Jones can do it Dr Jones I can too and the first thing you know there it goes and it's just like the old tobogan slide you slip around on it how many remembers old tobogan slide you sit down keep slipping around real easy seeing how close you can get to the edge and all before you know it down you went that's what happened to the Pentecostal church that's right don't see how close you can get to it see how far you can stay away from it yeah amen he said one time there was a driver had to ascend the mountain and a man had to hurry and get across the mountain and so they said one driver walked up he said I'm such a perfect driver I can drive these six head of horses in my Carriage within six in of that Rim across that great thousand foot ledge I can drive it in 6 Ines of full gallop and never fall that's pretty good and there was and another driver stepped up said sir let me take it I can drive within 4 in of it at full gallop and never fall there was an old fellow just standing standing over there looking the man wanted to go across the mountain he said what about you sir he said well look Mister according to what they're talking they're better drivers than what I am I hug the wall I don't take any chances he said you take me across see don't see how close you can get to sin without sinning see how far you can stay away from it that's the way it is keep off the territory alog together yes that's the way I want a church that's the church I want to belong to one that shuns the very appearance of sin and get away from it this is good advice it's good advice it's good advice that will get labeled legalism many ways but how is it legalism to want to fully obey the word of God explain that to me to want to know that if God spoke it if God restored this word and God told us do this don't do this there's a reason behind it even if I don't understand the reason it's not for me to start doing like Eve did and analyzing why he said what he said and maybe he meant this I I don't want to fall back into that trap and find myself somewhere down the road derailed amen because I didn't simply just obey the voice that God sent in our day I know that sounds simplistic friends but it's absolutely the reality that we face I have I I have not been around a long time and I am not ped a long time and I also have not been a Believer for a very long time but in the time that I have I have already seen that very same set of sequence of events play out and in the end it it ends in disaster you have people who no longer believe the message they have their children who go Wayward and all kinds of things happen why they wanted to play around with the boundary amen and they wanted to gallop at full speed close to the edge amen and they wanted to analyze again why this was taught and why this and why that stop playing scientist amen and come back to the Simplicity of saying God your word is for my benefit it's for my my good you sent a prophet to me to help me to stay in the lane that you've called me to to bring us back to the faith of the fathers amen it's not for me remember remember the vision that somebody came and told uh brother brandham about brother brandham all of a sudden he was he was up on a mountain and he was up on another mountain and I'm just going off memory so I may have a few details wrong and he was this man had followed him and he was riding up on a white horse and finally he found him over on another mountain and he said brother B how do I get there he said you have to be called of God to be up here and he said in the vision he looked down at the base of the mountain and there were scientists nixing things while the prophet was on the scene scientist and he screamed with a loud voice I think it was when he said I must ride this Trail again but something he screamed and it said it shook everything and the scientist looked up they heard it but they went down and started mixing again I'm saying leave our own minds and science out of this thing come back to Childhood Faith come back to be a child of the Kingdom a child of God in sincerity we want to we want to keep the blessings that God's given us and I know I'm preaching through the choir again just like on Sunday I know that cuz we're blessed we're protected we're saved but the devil has never stopped trying he hasn't taken a holiday he hasn't taken a day off and he's not going to stop trying how did he start in the first change with a white horse that looked like Christ it looked innocent it looked good but it was a deviation from the word so what tactic is he going to use now amen I believe he'll probably use the same tactic and I don't want to get swept into that and if it means I have to be a little bit naive and childlike and just just do what's said and maybe not even understand and somebody say well why I don't know why why did the bible say that why did brother say I don't know why he said that he just said it maybe I don't want to take a look like eve took a look maybe I just want to stay with the word of God maybe I just want to stay with the message that he's given us God knew what vessel he chose he chose the right one amen he knew what would be taught and if God saw fit to bring it that way then why would I analyze it and just say God help me help me Lord help me to surrender help me to know help me to grow help me whatever whatever I need help with Lord help me I don't even know what I need help with but I know that I need help amen let's go to first John 1 John Chapter 2 1 John Chapter 2 1 John 2 and three and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keep keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected whereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked amen let's go over to chapter five John chapter 5 verse 1 John 5:1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ as born of God God and everyone that loveth him that begot everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievious amen for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith am oh his his Commandments are not Grievious but they're delightful because I know what they are their protection their life their freedom they're not restriction so many times the devil will try to make God's word look like restriction restriction on who can marry and who can't restriction on who can preach and who's not eligible to preach it looks like restriction that's not restriction that's Freedom amen that's blessing that that's safety that's security that's where God wants to keep his children in the message Shalom brother B says it's a symphony se you find it comes to a junction everybody is all wondering I call it a junction and in in Shalom if you know the message Shalom brother bram's talking about going amen I think it was to the high school orchestra and he saw them do a production of Peter and the Wolf and in Peter and the Wolf they act out the parts with the different instruments and he he got inspiration there at the high school orchestra and he brought it up here in Shalom and he starts to talk about there's certain Junctions and as the beat starts getting closer together there's a transition coming and those who are in the symphony and those who read the sheet music they can see it's time for a transition and when it starts to beat they know what's coming next amen and that's what he's talking about here he says he goes I don't know music a musician in here why he he'd forgive me of my rude way but it's there a beating out got to have have something to act it'll get real low way down you wonder what it is but see if you get into the rhythm of it you understand it that's the only way you'll ever understand God is to get into the rhythm of it what is it how will I brother bam I'm just as true a Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal that's not the Rhythm the Rhythm Is God God is the word the word is God God's rhythm is obeying his word amen then when you obey the word he beats that Rhythm right to you then you take your place whenever it goes down down up whatever it is you know those Junctions what puts us in the Rhythm the word of God and he says this is how he said it the word is God God's rhythm is obeying his word that's why we never understand the message standing outside the message trying to understand the message the only way we will understand this message is get into the Rhythm the only way you can get into the rhythm is get into obedience to the word and when you obey the word in this message it starts to beat out a rhythm in your heart amen you start to see the Junctions we can never do it halfway we can never do it On The Fringe we can never do it with one foot in one F out that will never work friends there's got to be a say I need that Rhythm to beat out in my heart so I know the Junctions of time and we got to make a surrender to that word and lay ourselves be amen and then we'll get into the rhythm of God's word we'll be in the symphony Amen in Colossians 1:18 he says and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen the preeminence that he might have in all things the preeminence and that preeminence is to be first to hold the first place am man he's become the head why so he can have the preeminence what is the preeminence first place first place in what maybe first place in my heart maybe first place in my life first place in the church and he is the word what should have preeminence the word what is the headship the word and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed now see the whole threefold three-fold purpose to express himself he wants to become now the world is lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior to the reconciliation of the blood from his cross now he had to become that to die in order to save and to bring himself back into the church to have the preeminence in his church now remember it cannot and will not and never will never has been a denomination he has to have the preeminence and he is the word that's the day we live in and Christ is the mystery again he says his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express himself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the word be and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them what are we here for to become the word how do I become the word when I let the word go through me I must surrender to the headship of the word he must have preeminence and brother bam told us in that great mystery of God that was in the back part of God's mind it came forth in a three-fold manner the first was to get preeminence in a man he did that in Christ Jesus what did preeminence look like he said I only do that which the father shows me amen now he's to get preeminence in his bride in the church amen what's that going to look like I only do that which the word shows me that's where we're living today that he's got to get preeminence in us all of us every member of the Bride but also so he's got to have full preeminence in me every area of My Life The Doors within the doors within the doors he's got to have preeminence in my thought life in my secret life in my public life in my church life and my home life and my work life in every life he's got to have preeminence that's the day we're living in I'd like to turn together to ecclesiastic I want to read two more scriptures and if we could turn to Ecclesiastes together and Ecclesiastes is written by Solomon who was the wisest man on Earth at the time and Ecclesiastes he's struggling with the vanity of life and he's expressing how life goes and the vanity of life and and and there's nothing new other the Sun but everything keeps repeating and and he's got a whole dialogue in Ecclesiastes on this subject but he comes to the end chapter 12 he comes down to the very end verse 13 and he says Ecclesiastes 12:13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter this is at the end after he's went through all of these vanities and all of these things and let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man when Solomon the wisest man on Earth he comes to the end of all all of this trying to understand the world and trying to make sense out of everything when he comes down to the end he said this is the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man every generation has failed but there's got to be a generation so there's been Brides brides and churches churches but there's got to be one there's got to be one that'll give the headship preeminence there's got to be one that he can come down and live his own life in there's got to be one one that will surrender where the word will work one that that he gets preeminence in this is what he says in the seventh seal it's an old battle that started way back Beyond Time Satan and his angels was kicked out then they come to earth and the battle set in and again be because Eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of godone and from that very hour Satan won the battle over God's word because one of subjects the weaker let down the bar Satan won the battle over the word because one subject let down the bar he says and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word say God help me please help me not to let down the bar I've done it in the past friends I've done it in numerous ways but I'm praying God take control of this vessel because you can't have we can't keep letting down the bar on the word it keeps giving Satan victory over the word but this word is going to win today this word that's been delivered this word that's been restored it will defeat the Devil in every way but it needs a vessel to work through and I just want to stand here and yield my vessel for him to work through and say God I want a greater surrender than I've ever had before but I need your help amen again back in Christ is a mystery he says and in there there would be a Time come forth when he would Express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down what did Eve turned down the word obedience to the word she exchanged that for wisdom we're here to exchange wisdom back for the word we're here to reverse what was done to lay down our own thinking and give up wisdom and come back to the word amen amen bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down in Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we ac accept amen oh I thank God that he's come back and he's put something in our heart to accept it amen this is the final verse I'd like to read together if we go to First Timothy together first Timothy 1 Timothy chapter 1 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 now the end of the Commandment is do you want to know what the end of it all is Charity which is love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith unfeigned what's the end of the whole matter just love God out of a pure heart not with selfish motives not with our own scientific ideas not with manipul Just Surrender out of a pure heart amen and a and a good conscience and Faith unfeigned what has God been trying to get he's been trying to get this all along what does he want he just wants somebody that'll listen Len to his voice I'm so glad I believe with all my heart he's called me to be that somebody I'm not worthy of it I'm also not very good at it but by the grace of God I believe he has called me to be one of those that will hear his voice in the end time and he's called me to be one of those that he gets preeminence in I believe that if I didn't believe that I would give up and I'd run home and I'd crawl under the sheets and ask God to take me now but I believe that he's going to get preeminence in me and I know he needs more room yeah I can confess that today I need to give him more space more room I need to die a little more there's still too much pride there's still too much self-preservation in me there's still too much of my own thinking but I believe with all my heart that I'm living in the day when when he's going to get the preeminence in a body of Believers and I believe he's doing it now by degrees because I can look back and say I'm not what I I may not be what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be amen and I know that God's word has had greater prence than me and he's brought me into a greater place than I've ever been before he's brought me into a greater freedom than I've ever known he's brought me into greater blessings than I've ever had and I'm not talking just the financial just the natural things I have that too by the grace of God with my family with health with all the things that God's blessed us but that's not the freedom I'm talking about there's a freedom in my soul that I have come to a level that I've never been at before amen but I don't believe he's done yeah I want him to have more I want him to have more of me I want him to have more preeminence in me I want the word to be my headship in every area of my life I want to throw open the doors within the doors within the doors and say you're welcome here you're welcome in every part of my life in every chamber of my heart you're welcome in my thoughts and come and let that word wash everything else out and let me God give me the strength give me the courage give me whatever I need the faith whatever I need just give me the the elements I need just to obey like a child why Jesus gathered he gathered the little children unto him and when they were disputing on who's the greatest who's that he brought a little child in the midst of them and he stood that child he said in the midst of them said unless you repent and become like one of them should not even see the Kingdom of Heaven I don't I want to be a scientist I want to be a child amen I don't want to be the smartest one I don't want to be the one that's got all figured out what I want to be is one that can humbly submit to the voice of God to surrender to the word in every are of my life because if I can do that I will become what God has been looking for all along what was lost in Eden is being restored right now am and I believe I'm looking at the people that he's using to restore it am I believe that we may we may have messed up today and yesterday and maybe mess up tomorrow but I still believe that's true I can't help but believe it amen I see where we've come from I see what God's done Among Us and I've seen what the word is doing all around us and I can't help
