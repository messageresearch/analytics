========================================

then you realized i'm nothing i have no power i have no strength i have no ability you know you start off i'm the bride of jesus christ amen you are the bride of jesus christ but if you're acting as the bride serving your own purpose in this life he'll let that vision die in you until you wonder whether you're bright or not he'll let you get sidelined he'll let you get weighed laid he'll let you fall on your face god will let you die to your dream of being bride until you realize that you're nothing without him you're not bribed by your merit you're not bribed by your good looks you're not bribed by your wisdom or intellect you're not bright because of your good understanding you're bribed by his election and his election only and it was a purpose he purposed in you before the foundation of the world and the minute you stop serving his purpose and start serving your own purpose he'll let your dream of bride die until you find yourself in sin you find yourself in compromise you find yourself in confusion and you wonder who am i am i even until god will come to you and say you're my bride and you say who am i that i should be your bride who am i and this this this death is for a purpose amen we've got to die sometimes to our wrong thinking to our wrong ideas sometimes our children are raised down and we tell them you're a bride and you're this and you're that amen don't be too scared when god lets them fall flat amen don't be too nervous because god needs to break some of that wrong understanding till they can die to their concept of what it means to be bride die sometimes to their own ideas being raised in perfection being raised in the word amen some of them may have the wrong idea not all of them some of them have the right idea but if some of them have the wrong idea god is going to get his resurrection power on display and he'll let our vision sometimes of who we are die he'll let our understanding sometimes of who we are die just like he let paul die to his old life just like he let moses die so that he can bring a resurrection then all of a sudden in the resurrection when god begins to say you're my bride i want you to be a witness in the world you say who am i to be a witness you know i can't do anything right you know i'm a failure to start with you know i can't speak right you know i can't keep the doctrine dry you know i still don't feel like i completely understand everything praise be to god when you get to that place you're just about right
