but if it pleased the king and if i found favor in your eyes would you come to a banquet that i've prepared see when the king sees esther come something happens in the king if you read this amen we know the story you can read through it it's only nine chapters but when you go and you read he wanted vashti to come to him when he called and she refused he wanted vashti to come to him he was enjoying himself he was feasting and he wanted and she refused to come to the king but here without him asking esther reverently and humbly approaches to him and when he sees esther come in the royal apparel humble and submissive and reverent he's moved he extends the scepter and he says what is it that thou want i will give anything up to half my kingdom like what a statement for this king to make why would he make a statement like that because he had a queen that wouldn't come in his bidding and here she comes of her own free will because the king wants fellowship with his queen amen the queen and then she says would you come to a banquet of wine i prepared for you and immediately he said is make haste and make ready amen i couldn't get vashi to come to me not only does this woman come to me she wants me to come to her she wants to entertain me she doesn't want me to entertain her she wants to welcome me into her house she wants to entertain me she wants me to find welcome in her place and her abode amen god is not looking for the kind of bride amen that comes to god's house amen to get some benefits and comes only when she wants to comes to church and comes to get a reward doesn't come when she doesn't feel like it he's looking for a queen that will come to him because she comes to him humbly reverently and wants him to come to be entertained in her house because god wants fellowship he doesn't want a queen to stay separated he wants a queen to come to him and ask him to come to her he asked her again in the banquet of wine what do you want up to half my kingdom listen this was not he's not the mayor of gomer he he is the king ruling over almost all the inhabited world at that time and he's going to give her he's got a kingdom that goes from india to ethiopia and he'll give her up to half the kingdom she's going to be a joint heir with him because he wants a woman that loves him that comes to him and invites him to come to her
