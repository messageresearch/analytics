========================================

brother Bantam does some wonderful things in the word amen to bring us to a higher Revelation and understanding of the life we live in we are not going to live a life free of trial and tribulations God doesn't want us to meant so much Prosperity preaching another kind of preaching and it makes it makes it sound like God never wants you to suffer any God doesn't want any hardship or any obstacles to come your way that God's a doting grandfather and he wants to remove everything so that you can live a blessed life and everything can be perfect amen but brother Benham come along and told us that's not the reason we're living in this Earth We're living here for education so that we can gain character to Reign by in the next life and that character is a victory not a gift and it comes through hardships through trials through testings so the prophet of God came and he brought reality back to Christianity the churches have taken reality away amen but he's coming brought reality back so that you can live the same kind of Life they lived in the scriptures so then we're not confused when difficult circumstances come up there's no confusion now God why would he bring him out of Egypt Into the Wilderness delivered them from a mighty hand slew the army that was after them brought them into such a wonderful Victory and the next thing he does is he lands them by by a spring of bitter water that they can't even drink another trial why he wants to show them that he loves them some more God why is this happening to me God why why maybe he wants to show you who loves you again or maybe he wants to show you his power and his goodness maybe he allowed the circumstances to get such a way so that he can show you how able he is to deliver
