so what is a filter used for a filter is used for purification so if you have a water filter amen a water filter is used to purify the water so if water passes through the filter the filter is there to collect anything that you don't want in the water so if you have a water filtration system at home or any kind of filtration system it's used for purification purification of air purification of water purification of any other fluid or whatever you have a filters for purification what was the waters of separation for purification so what is this all about that god has provided something that would purify his people amen and it's a water of separation to separate us from the world god has given us his word amen and we live in a day when it's not partial word partial understanding but it's the full revelation of the full word so there's been a pure filter restored to the people again a waters of separation that has come back to the church where we know that we can be clean it's no longer guessing there's no longer hoping i know i can be clean how can i be clean by surrendering to that word amen by just submitting to it and obeying it amen we make things so complicated sometimes that that i i how do i know i right i want to be right oh i wish i was right amen the devil can get us on i wish i was right merry-go-round and i hope that i'm right amen but there's one way that we know that we're right it's when we surrender to this word there are things that that that we may not know decisions that we have to make and and we labor over those we want to be in the will of god and we want to do right and we make the decision the best way we know how to make the decision but if we filtered it through the word if there's no word hindering us from stepping right or left we just have to go by the leading of the lord the way we feel is right to go and trust that god will help us if we're wrong but we ought not to have so much anxiety over those things because there's been a water of purification and as long as we're surrendering to the word with all that we know god will take care of the rest where we can be nervous where we should have anxiety and fear is when we know we're not right with the word when we know the prophet of god has taught the scriptures in a way taught the conduct of a believer in a way and we knowingly refuse to walk in them that's where we can be nervous that's where we can have anxiety but if we're doing all that we know to do trust the word to be the filter and trust it to be the waters of separation
