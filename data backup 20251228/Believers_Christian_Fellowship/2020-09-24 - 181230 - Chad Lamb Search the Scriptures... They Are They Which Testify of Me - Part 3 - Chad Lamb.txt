========================================

be it unto me according to thy world according to thy promises [Music] the truth that sets me free according to thy word o lord once again [Music] says the truth that sets me free [Music] according to your word oh lord be it unto me hallelujah praise the lord was good to see you this morning their heavenly father we thank you lord for your word as we begin to read lord and this wonderful scriptures that you've given to us lord let it be more than an intellectual reading lord more than what a mind can comprehend but we're asking you for divine revelation on your word lord anybody with literacy can read but lord you've written something here between the lines for your bride to pick out god you've written something in this love letter lord that you've written in such a way that only the one nearest and dearest to you can catch it lord and i pray that you'd give us that revelation those eyes to see and ears to hear what it is you're truly saying in your word i pray that your spirit would anoint us to speak and to hear the truth of your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen let's read this together before we see it in john chapter 5 verse 39. search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me you can be seated you can probably tell by the reading of the scripture that we're we're continuing on with the same thought search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me amen because we found out that jesus was sitting here and and and there's there's always somebody willing to contest the revealed word it's amazing but whenever god brings the revelation of this word there's always somebody willing to contest that and contradict it and fight against it and jesus is simply saying search the scriptures amen the same scriptures in which you think you have eternal life they're the same ones that testify of me and the bride has come to the same point i believe you know she can say search the scriptures for in them you you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of who we are the position that we're in what god has been doing and what the mystery he's had in the back part of his mind it's laying here in the scriptures and it's been dug out it's been it's been mined out in this day and held out for us to see and the bride can see it she can catch it amen she's the the mystery of the bride has been laying in this word the whole time and in this last day he has peeled the veil off of it and he begins to show it and then he shows all the types and all the shadows and there you have the seventh seal is laying all all the way through in every type and every shadow and all the mysteries through the bible there's christ you can see jesus christ in types but every time you see jesus christ in types if you go back and look a little closer you'll find there's a woman there in mystery also there's a bride laying there with the mystery with the shadow in the shadow of the shadow is the bride and this last day we go back and read the bible and all of a sudden it doesn't read like it used to read amen same words the words haven't changed you don't have to alter the words you don't have to change the text in any way all you have to re do is read it with your eyes wide open and there you see she's there and she's there and she's there and she's there praise the lord hallelujah let's turn to genesis as we we look at this we'll start all the way back in genesis brother benham said in the seventh seal i'm not quoting verbatim so you have to forgive me if i get a little wrong but he says if i had time i'd go back and show you the seven seals spoke of all the way back in genesis in the beginning and it's just amazing to me he makes statements like that and he doesn't always have time to go back and break it all the way down but what he's trying to do is he's trying to point it out and then point it out and he says i'm just hitting the high spots just enough so you'll know what i'm talking about amen because he said when the seals open he said that he said that unveiled the entire bible it unsealed the entire bible but brother branham did not have time in the rest of his ministry on earth to take every single scripture that was referring to this every place that showed the bride he didn't have time so he just hit the high spots just enough so that you would know what it is amen and once the keys are given to the bride the keys can she can take those same keys and unlock the mystery in every type and every shadow it's laying there but she can't be afraid amen to explore the promised land that's been given to her she can't be afraid to venture out into the message and take the keys that's been given to us by a prophet in this day and search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me so you can't be afraid of that amen there's a great fear sometimes in saying you can't take a scripture amen that the prophet didn't use my goodness just think amen just think for a minute brother brenham said i came he said i preached what paul preached is that the truth when he was beyond the curtain of time amen and they and they he asked he said you'll be judged with your group and he said what about paul said paul will be judged he says well i preached what paul preached and they were all laying there and they all said they were resting on that how many of you are resting on that brother brandon preached what paul preached but he didn't stand in the pulpit and read romans and come back the next day amen and read first corinthians and come back the next day and read second corinthians he preached what paul preached but he was able to take what paul preached and he would use examples in the old testament paul never touched he would pull scriptures out of the old testament that paul didn't refer to but yet he preached what paul preached he had so much confidence that he was going to come to judgment and be judged with his group he had so much confidence that he was going to pass the judgment because he preached what paul preached even though he didn't say verbatim will only verbatim what paul said he was able to take paul's message and find it all through the old testament amen [Applause] once once revelation locks in the bride is not afraid of the scriptures anymore she's not afraid of the message anymore she's not scared why because without revelation there's a fear uh i'll get it wrong i'll get the cow eating grass in the top of the tree the only way you can get a cow eating grass in the top of the tree is if you don't know what the whole picture is supposed to look like but by revelation you see the mystery of the seventh seal you see the bride coming of christ you see what's unfolded in our day and now once you see the big picture you can go down into the details because the details will fit the big picture every time the only way you'll get the cow in the grass and the top of the tree amen is if you don't know the big picture if you don't have revelation and without revelation there brings a fear and with fear we're afraid to venture away from jordan too far we've crossed into the promised land amen joshua has brought us over to the promised land but you know i'm afraid to get too far because i know if i can see jordan i'm in a good position amen but over the next hill is another valley that belongs to the children of israel they've got to get away from shiloh they've got to move away amen from jericho and they've got to get into the full possession of the full land and our full possession in this day is the whole word of god the entire bible hallelujah this is not the time for kindergarten this is not first grade this is time for a fully mature bride [Applause] who is what the manifestation of the full word on display in a people on earth today and she's not afraid of the word not afraid of the bible not afraid of the message why because she sees it and once you see it you see it you can't not see it you just see it and if you've seen it then you can't help but see it in ruth you can't help but see an esther you can't help but see it in deborah you can't help and see it in the woman that was given to adam you can't help but see it once you see it once you really see it everywhere you look you see it praise god so we can't be afraid can't be afraid of the word of god i can't say i can't go there in the scriptures because brother never read that scripture he said the opening of seals unlocked the entire bible so there's not parts that are off limits to the bride [Music] amen so paul uh brother brennan preached what paul preached but then we're told excuse me we're told that this same message will go to the jews have we been told that by the two witnesses in revelations 11 is that correct [Music] so the two witnesses in revelations 11 amen the the coming of moses and elijah to the jews they're going to preach this same message to the jews so they're going to gather the 144 thousand around pull up their laptop and push play so that they can hear the prophet [Music] because they're coming to the same message they're coming to the same message but they may not play one tape they may not have one book but it's the same message hallelujah praise god it's by revelation hallelujah as as time continues on we realize more and more how crucial revelation really is because intellectual understanding amen will tie us at knots and back us into corners and and and and have us fearful and timid and afraid but revelation takes all fear away genesis chapter 1 let's go to genesis chapter 1 and we'll begin at verse 26 you pray for me the devil don't like me and that's fine by me the more he dislikes me the happier i am the more he rages and the more he fights and the more he tries to deflect the more i realize i must be making him mad and if i'm making him mad and if i'm a threat to his kingdom i'm perfectly happy in that position he rages but he can't win and he can't he can't have victory he's already defeated genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and every and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so we find out this is in the sixth day of creation and brother branham says you can this seventh seal spoke of all the way back in the beginning in creation and so we find that god here in the very first chapter in genesis god is revealing the mystery of what's in his mind he has a desire he has a thought amen he wants an earth that's inhabited with sons and daughters of god that's what brother brenham told us so he begins amen after the judgment that has taken place upon the earth the earth covered in darkness and covered in water amen he goes in and he begins to reform the earth to the image that he has in his mind and so now what's in his mind is becoming manifest through day one and day two and day three and day four and day five and he's coming all the way through the seals here in creation and he's revealing what's been in the back part of his mind as earth begins to take form and takes shape and what's he doing he's making a habitation for his people but then amen on the sixth day amen under the sixth seal he is going to make something in his own image not just something that's in his mind but something that reflects his very own image so he makes the man and he makes him male and female but this man is still spirit man amen and still a spirit being at this but in that spirit man is male and female so that we could come along in this day and go back and say that's me right there search the scriptures amen they are they that testify me where are you right here amen because when god come out as the great logos amen it was it was a spirit form amen in the form of the logos amen christ before he was jesus christ before he was born the baby come out from god amen to reflect what god was and in him was all the attributes of god both male and female where are you right here all the way back in the beginning and look at the charge that was given them he blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful multiply and replace the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea or the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen that charge to subdue and have dominion was given to the man both male and female hallelujah so we find all the way back in the beginning in the book of genesis in chapter one he's coming through revealing what's in his mind breaking the seals of the mystery of his mind by by for putting the light in place and moving the heavens up and and putting the grass in place and the trees in place and the fish in place in the birth and he he's revealing until he comes up amen to the crowning act he meant and he comes all the way up to revealing something that reflects who he is his very own nature something that's in his image and he makes man a spirit man male and female and then we know he takes the man and he puts him in the in a body of flesh amen so that he can be known because he was like the great spirit like the holy ghost moving amen over all of god's creation having dominion and authority but none of the creation could interact with their god is that right so he takes adam and puts him into a form of flesh made out of the dust of the earth so he can interact with all the creation so now they could see their god he's done the same thing with jesus christ amen it was god who was brooding over the world it was god who was orchestrating things and running everything but man amen could not amen interact or see or touches god until he came in the form of jesus christ and when he was here when adam was down here interacting with the animals naming the animals he made took possession in the garden of eden god says it's not good that man shall dwell alone it's not good that he should just be male and female in one vessel it's not good so he laid him to sleep and he pulled out amen the ingredients to make the woman and he made the woman amen and then he presented the woman he woke up adam presented them back together again and he said it is very good and then he moves into the seventh day and the scripture says he rested because everything that he was going to do to portray what his will and desire and what was in his mind he had already done it it was already there if you wanted to know him just look at what he made just look at the man and the woman having dominion over the earth and now you know god he revealed it in six days the seventh day doesn't reveal anything it's the seals all the way in genesis chapter one comes to the seventh day it says chapter two verse one thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them so his work was finished after his work's finished he comes to the seventh and he said on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god had created and made so the work took place in the six amen the seventh was the silence was the mystery what was the seventh the seventh was the resting of the one who did all six so then we go over to revelation chapter five we'll just pick this up quickly verse one this is the book of the generation of adam and the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created so now we find out that when he created the man the male and the female he created them and blessed him and called their name adam so when the woman come up amen when he made the woman when he took out of the side of adam the rib amen and he and he split his spirit from masculine to feminist and he made a woman that woman as soon as she was formed amen her name was adam her name didn't change when she was with him her name was adam when she was separated from him her name was adam she was adam i mean do you see the mystery you see the message amen when she was separated out and put into another form and when she come forth in another form now this is the feminine form it's the feminine form of adam she is adam he is adam together they are adam where's adam he's there which one both remember god did not call her woman adam called her woman adam gave her a title amen god did not call her eve adam called her eve and she received her name after she became adulterous and her name amen her name symbolizes her adultery it references her adultery become the mother of all living so amen she shouldn't have ever had a different name she should have always been adam because we have always been with jesus christ amen when he come out as the lawyers when he was the attributes in the mind of god we were there amen when the logos came out with god we were there amen when he formed it into a body of flesh we were there and that's what the scripture says so it's what the prophet says and then when he's separated out it's all the same thing all the time she is him and now she is dwelling in bodies of hybrid flesh but that's not the she this isn't the she we're talking about it's the inward man amen it's the life on the inside it's the life of god down in the soul that is coming to manifestation through the new birth amen that is christ that is the very life of god amen now living and being on display through the veil of hybrid flesh the hybrid flesh is not her the hybrid flesh is not him it's the life on the inside being portrayed through the hybrid flesh hallelujah so now we're seeing our day all the way back in genesis this great mystery that the that the seals have unlocked this great mystery that the message is actually pointing us to the message amen before that that he begins to declare his message he first has to tie together all the loose ends so the preaching on the serpent seed and godhead and water baptism in jesus name and all that's tying together all the loose sins and he's got to tie together all the loose ends before he can declare his message i understand that so the message isn't serpent seed godhead water baptism no denomination that's not the message that's the ministry amen of the seventh angel the seven church eight messenger tying together all the loose ends that was left down through the church ages and when he's done tying together then down comes the angel then down comes the mighty angel christ revelations 10 1 to do what to reveal the thunders the mysteries that lay and the seals the symbols of the seals amen when after he's tied together the loose ends then the message comes so we can make a big mistake in thinking the message is malachi 4 that the message of serpents see that the message is water baptism in jesus that's not the message friends that's fixing what had been left off by the reformers that was the completion of the reformation but the completion of the reformation will bring us to the restoration [Applause] the restoration is back the full word coming back in the manifestation hallelujah friends hallelujah you can be in the message every so many years and not even know what the message is we've been in the message so long and we can become masters in theology on serpency masters in theology on godhead masters and theology we can debate with theologians on water baptism and they have no ground to stand on i mean we can take some of our sunday school kids amen and they can and they can explain water baptism through the scriptures that nobody can deny that they're staying right with the word the whole time but that's yet not the message the message is christ male and female hallelujah amen i hope that doesn't scare you that's the truth that's nothing but the truth so we've got people who have degrees they have that not real degrees but they've got degrees and and message doctrine degrees and servicing water badminton godhead no denomination blah blah blah blah blah and we've mastered him we studied him we got the scriptures we've got the bible studies we got it all lined out amen but that's not yet the message [Applause] the message is christ hallelujah those things are essential we believe all of that amen that's just the word amen we believe that amen it was the word being brought back amen and put back in place so that the word himself could come back to the church hallelujah praise the lord i don't want to get off too far you just hang tight praise god so we find in the old testament all the way back in the beginning amen this mystery of the message is laying here amen in the man and the woman amen being one coming from the same source the woman doesn't come from a separate place she comes from the same place she comes into her own manifestation but she's still the same thing she is adam it's amazing amen when she can become talking to the serpent amen and the serpent if he wanted to address her the woman he would have to say adam we know the serpent could speak because he talked to her so when the serpent wanted to get the woman's attention he would have to say adam hallelujah i love the message i love when god by revelation will take tradition and crumble it at our feet because the denominations have a certain understanding amen but the message is come amen to bring us out of a traditional understanding and bring us to the revelation of the true word so we start off in genesis chapter 1 and we see the mystery there but let's go to the very end of the old testament let's go to malachi see we're looking at search the scriptures there that testify of me where can you find the bride genesis chapter one praise the lord you find her where you find the bridegroom if you find the bridegroom in chapter one you can find the bride in chapter one now let's go to the last two verses of the old testament malachi chapter four verse five behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so here the very end of the old testament lays out a prophecy for elijah to come but it says here behold i will send you a lie to the prophet who's the you who's why oh you who's the you that's the bride right there there she is search the scriptures they are they that testify me right there elijah the prophet was sent to me amen he was sent to me to turn my heart back to the faith of the fathers all the way in chapter one she's there all the way in the last two verses of the old testament she's there and she's everywhere in between [Music] hallelujah i mean we could we could just start rattling off stories and start showing she's there and she's there and she's there and we've done that over the last several years we've looked at story after story we looked at deborah deborah coming as the fourth judge amen under an eagle anointing you know from the tribe of dan under an eagle anointing under the four seal anointing you have a woman who becomes judged what a mystery in the bible amen where god will not allow a woman to be a priest never have a woman who's a king but now he will ordain a woman to be a judge in the book of judges amen it sticks out like a thumb it's like what is this in the scriptures it doesn't make any sense it's like god totally forgot all his principles of headship it's like he totally forgot everything in leadership that he had set up and he had structured everywhere else in israel everywhere else for everything else amen he structured it a certain way but when he gets here you've got this thing hanging out in the book of judges like a thumb what is it it's there to get your attention it's a woman the fourth judge amen under the flag of dan under the eagle and what's she there to do she's there to declare the bride's ministry under the fourth seal and it's in the story and it's the story of deborah it's under the story of deborah amen when there's a victory that's going to come over the gentile amen and that victory that's going to come she prophesies it'll come by the hand of a woman what's it what is this story it doesn't make any sense yes it does it makes perfect sense once you know the message and you've seen the mystery it's unlocked amen what debra is doing what the victory in the hand of the woman is doing what is going on amen and it wasn't a jewish woman that had victory it was a gentile woman because when the king their oppressor their antagonist amen when he was running from the battle he runs into a tent and i didn't look it up i don't have all the names but go back in judges and read it comes back and do this tennis woman she invites him in and she lays him down to sleep so it's going to be okay you stay right here because the enemy is going to be slayed in your tent because the biggest enemy you got is the one looking you in the mirror every morning this old hybrid flesh amen this old nature of the earth amen that's the thing that has to be destroyed and where is the enemy going to be destroyed for the gentile bride in her tent because your hybridization is going to change into a glorified body you will have the ultimate victory and so what does she do and then she takes a tent spike and she drives it through his temples into the ground what's she just doing she's destroying that old wicked mind of the enemy amen that old serpent mind that comes in and through his wisdom he'd be in his septility he begins to seduce the bride and now here this gentile woman under the eagle anointing under in the fourth chapter under the fourth judge under deborah now this woman takes and drives a spike right through the enemy's mind said i won't take your thinking anymore it's the mind of christ it's the word or nothing we can go through the bible and go through the bible and go through the bible we come to abraham abraham's bride has to come from his father where does christ's bride come from same place they had to come from the same father out of the same amen out of the same loins comes the bridegroom and the bride and then he wants to have a son so he takes eliezer his servant and now he sends his servant back to the homeland amen to fetch a son because it's got to come from the same lineage the son the wife for the promised son has to come from the same source hallelujah so now brother ben tells us his ministry is eleazar actually the lord told him his ministry was eleazar and he begins to share he's the eliezer time and he's going to fetch a bride for the promised sign amen but as he goes and he goes back amen back into the land back into the denominations and now he's looking to fetch out a bride and bring her out to separation where isaac is because isaac has been put out of the seventh church age isaac is without the camp so he's got to go into the camp amen and he's got to find the woman and he's got to bring her out of the camp to be united with isaac so what's he do he goes in there and he's not going to find the woman by intellectualism he's not going to find her by questionnaires he's not going to find her by going to the authorities he is only going to be able to locate her by revelation and he says lord amen the one that you choose let her give me water and also water my camels the ten camels that he brought and brother branham says that's the beast that's the power that will pack her all the way to her isaac that's the word that's the message that'll carry you all the way to eisen and so eleazar comes along amen and he comes to the well amen it's amazing that there's always a meeting where the water is the water of the washing of the water of the word the water of life coming from the throne of god there's always a meeting taking place by the water eliezer comes and said lord i don't know who she is i don't know what she looks like brother branham couldn't come into a crowd and he couldn't say you and you and you and you you're all the bride come with me i've got something to tell you he didn't know what they looked like but he said let the one amen that waters me and the one that waters my camels let her be your chosen one let the one that will do reference to me and one that will reverence the word the power that'll pack her back to isaac let that be the one and so now rebecca the virgin she comes along as a bride she's coming along she doesn't know she's the bride she doesn't know eliezer is here to call a bride for the promised side she has no idea what's happening just one day she's walking along and all of a sudden she hears a voice and then it's a man who's asking for water amen now now she's in the vision now she herself has to catch a revelation of something eliezer cannot tell her directly because he was told not to explain the third pool he comes to the seventh seal he says stop right here now there's a part that she has to play out to prove that she's the bride and the part she has to play out is not the part eliezer will sit down and say now a plus b equals c squared root to this minus this and it'll bring you to this conclusion did you get it do you see it let me go through it again no he'll lay out all the pieces he'll explain what a is he'll explain what b is he'll explain what c is but he can't amen explain the third pull [Applause] because the seventh seal when it was open there was silence in heaven she herself has to catch the revelation he can only identify her by revelation she can only be identified by revelation it's only by revelation [Applause] that's why you can study the message until your brain is fried you can read and read and read and read and read and you can get it lined up you know where i've got i've got 70 quotes on this subject i've read all of them i'll tell you i did a search the other day i was searching on a subject and i found 85 times brother branham used this particular word i was studying i read every eight every one of those 85 quotes in detail and at the end of it i knew nothing more than when i started there's something i'm desiring to know from the lord on this subject but it will not come by intellectual research of the message it must come by revelation so by the time i get done with my 85 quotes i can't say now i've read everything the prophet said now i must make my conclusion that's the wrong way to read the message they say well i'll take everything he said i'll cipher through everything he said he said this 47 times he said this 12 times and he said this last this was later in his ministry i'm going to go with this that's the wrong way to read the message friends you're going to get the cow and the top of the tree eating grass if you do it that's an intellectual way to study the message now there's nothing wrong with it i hit quote searches i read all through them but at the end of the day with no revelation unless something sparks that to life i'm just i'm just as confused at the end of 85 quotes as i was at the beginning if anything happened i got a little more twisted up because it'll say something this way here and something this way here and it looks like they contradict one another and then he changes it over here then he goes back to what he said previously god has delivered a message through a man with a seventh grade education so that you can't hit quote shirts quote searches and put it together intellectually the man will misspeak he'll rephrase he'll get the words wrong he'll get the characters and the bible stories wrong all so we cannot intellectualize this message all so that it must be by revelation he's got i read 60 quotes i got a study on it i don't need your study i need revelation i need god to open my eyes so that i can see the big picture if i can see the big picture the little pictures start to make sense but if we start studying the little pictures till we get brain cramps and we don't see it fit into the big picture all we're going to do is get things misplaced and stuck in the wrong spot square pegs and round holes and round pegs and triangles and my goodness it's going to be a mess later on that's why brother said above everything pray for revelation say god just show me your word i mean we're we should be diligent in reading we should be diligent in listening we should read our bibles that's our duty and our honor and respect towards god for what he's given us we should give our lives to it he's given us this message we should devote our whole life to the message but unless he brings revelation all we're going to do is put a whole bunch of words into our mind and we're going to use our own mind to die to decipher them and all we will do is start another denomination [Applause] but what's the cure for denomination revelation lord above all give us revelation so we find the mystery of the bride genesis 1 we find the rhetoric of the bride malachi 4 we find her all the way through so at the end of malachi behold i send you who the bride elijah came for who the bride eliezer came for who the bride and it's amazing brother brown said let this be the crowning of my ministry that i will take the close of the word and dress a bride that i will prepare her for her meeting with her isaac and then eleazar comes to the crowning of his ministry and the crowning of his ministry is when she they're riding and they're coming into the field amen and and now she sees someone afar off and she says who who is that i don't recognize that cloud that mystery ring of cloud in the sky who who is that what is that cloud you said it's seven angels and it's a pyramid and it's a cluster of angels but but who is that and eliezer's crowding is when the lord told him turn it to the right because rebecca tells eleazar who is this coming he says that's my master son that's isaac amen and she jumps down and she covers herself with the veil and then she runs to meet him and you don't hear anything else about eleazar after that eliezer's ministry is finished now the bride and christ have become one and now mother branham in his crowning act he lays out the word amen he does like haggy eye the chamberlain does in the book of esther he prepares esther to meet the king but you remember after esther meets the king and is accepted amen and there's a marriage union haggai's work is done he's never mentioned again in the book of esther his work is finished he came to the crowning of his ministry [Applause] so the crowning of eliezer's ministry was to fetch a bride prepare her along the way bring her into the presence of isaac and then to point out who isaac is and then after he's done that his work's done the bride takes off from there she runs right to him [Applause] hallelujah brother brenham comes and we've got this ring of mystery this cloud this pyramid this cluster of angels all the things that he's talked about but he himself has never identified it he says the cloud and he says you know he talks about the cloud and how it's formed and the vision and the pyramids and the angels and where they came from and the blast he's talking about all of this but he's never yet identified what that cloud is or what that cloud brought or what that cloud represented and then the angel of the lord said turn it to the right and brother brown says it is right he's looking at it right side up he's looking at it like he's holding it right turned through and they said turn it to the right so he turns it to the right and he said right there it was he said it was christ amen hoffman's head of christ amen just right there shrouded and it was the it was the it was the wings of the angels amen making up the ring of clouds making up his hair white as wool and brother said it's our lord up there eliezer's pointing him out at his coming and saying that's our lord up there there he is amen run and be united to him amen not a cloud not an image in the cloud not a picture on the wall amen but christ coming in the fullness of his word now he's here the seals have been open the message has been delivered now run to him [Applause] he points him out and then shortly after that he leaves the scene i don't i don't ever imagine rebecca after she's been united to isaac and been and become his by an invisib by a union a physical union i don't think that she would ever go oh i wish eliezer were here i wish i was still on the journey i wish i was still somewhere between the denominations and meeting christ i still wish i was in the journey somewhere amen you know there were so many times when i had a need and eliezer just had it right there i had a question and he had the answer and i wanted to know something and he was just in the next camel over and when i had a question i would just call over to him and he would answer my question when i was hungry amen he would provide for my needs when a storm came he could just take care of it amen eliezer was taking care of oh i wish i was back there no she had already united with isaac amen and do you think that her appreciation for eliezer ever faded away and where did her revelation of isaac come from eliezer where did her understanding of isaac come from eliezer she appreciated eliezer eleazar was still there amen guiding the bride through the message that he brought but the objective was to unite with isaac that was the objective of eliezer's ministry that was the whole point of the father sending him was to bring a bride back for the son hallelujah i say thank god so we're here in malachi 4. behold i will send you eleazar elijah the prophet who's the you rebecca the bride do you see it do you see it through the whole bible now let's turn over to the first chapter of the new testament we just read the last two verses the old testament which is the prophecy of elijah coming to the bride so it's a prophecy related to the bride all the way at the end in the old testament now we turn to the beginning of the new testament we start in chapter 1 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham it's amazing that he mentions the son of david the son of abraham because that includes both covenants he says the son of david now jesus the son of david son of abraham we know that there was many in the lineage in between abraham and jesus but he skips all of those and he hits david because there's a promise that his son shall sit on the throne forever so there's a promise laying in david that applies to jesus christ and he's going to be the son that sits on the throne forever and then there's a promise to abraham thy seed shall inherit the earth and so now it's mentioned jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham so you know this is the one who gathers all of the promises together amen all the covenants are wrapped up in him the promise the david and the promise to abraham verse two abraham begot isaac and isaac begot jacob and jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharasin and zara of tamar now this is the first woman that's mentioned in the lineage of tamar and pharaohs begot ezram and ezram begot aram and abraham begat amina dab and amina dab begat nayasan and naasan begot salman and salman got boaz of rahab the harlot second woman mentioned and boaz begat obad of ruth the moabitus three gentiles how does the old testament finish with a prophecy to the bride how does the new testament start with the mystery of the gentile bride laying right in the generation of jesus the son of david the son of abraham and right down through we've already got one gentile bride two gentile brides three gentile brides and boazby got o bed of ruth and obed begot jesse and jesse begot david the king and david the king begot solomon of her that had been the wife of urias now i'm studying the scriptures the best i can tell bathsheba she's not mentioned here bathsheba was actually a jew but she was married to uriah the hittite making her hittite because what you're married to is your identification and so now there's a reason it doesn't say bathsheba but her that was married to uriah the hittite so that you would know here is the fourth gentile woman so here we come through the first six verses through the first six seals we come to the fourth woman because the revelation comes in the fourth seal amen at the time of the sixth seal the sixth thousandth year now we have the fourth gentile woman it's the fourth stage of grace [Applause] amen it's the fourth stage in the restoration which will bring us to chapter seven or verse seven and verse seven is in solomon solomon is a type of christ so the sixth brings us to the works of the seventh which is solomon solomon is a type of christ that actually brought israel into their golden age into their millennium a type of the millennium so here we have in the first seven verses of the new testament is already showing us the seven seals you can't make this stuff up and you can't see it without revelation you can explain that to somebody with no revelation like what yeah four women whatever four seven six i don't mean anything but once you've seen the seals open and you recognize what's happened you go back and say it's laying right here at the beginning of the new testament amen there's four gentile women under the fourth gentile woman under the fourth stage of the restoration comes a seed amen and that seed is a type of christ who brought israel into their type of their millennial reign they have peace on every side the prince of peace the son of david the son of god that's solomon's titles hallelujah search the scriptures they are they that testify of me amen because it was in the sixth day that the man was given a woman and why was he given a woman amen why was why was adam given a bride to reproduce himself in the sixth day hallelujah six is the number of man god is working his mystery through man hallelujah amen in the sixth thousandth year since the fall god is working this mystery through man and when this mystery is complete amen she'll bring forth christ upon the earth again and then we'll go into the seventh day the millennium search the scriptures but we can't search the scriptures without revelation we can't search the scriptures without the message all we get is confusion but when the message comes now you can't hardly get through a couple verses in the bible and all of a sudden you've got to get up from he said i cannot believe what i'm seeing either i'm gone completely mad amen or the spirit of revelation is here unlocking every verse in this bible amen sometimes it's shocking how you'll sit down to read and you just expect to do a daily reading and you're chucking along and get through a couple verses and all of a sudden you hit one and it absolutely explodes what was that amen that's revelation you see something you've never seen before but how did you see it what caused you to see it the revelation of the mystery of the big picture of the seventh seal unlocked every other mystery and god in due time comes and unlocks it praise the lord let's go to john chapter 6. the gospel of john as we move through here praise the lord john chapter 6 and let's look at verse 41. the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven it's amazing how every time the word tells them the truth they deny it they argue about it and they fuss about and here he is the manifestation of the word telling them the truth and they don't like it who doesn't like it here's the question who doesn't like it the harlot the prostitute the tax collector who doesn't like the revealed word of the hour amen portraying the truth of the word who's fighting it it's always the religious leaders who fought every prophet that god sent the religious leaders it's a it's absolutely amazing that now the very ones claiming to proclaim the truth and hold the truth are the very ones fighting the truth says let's go back here verse 41 the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph go right back to carnal understanding isn't that william branham wasn't his dad an alcoholic hallelujah hallelujah that's why that's why dr davis looks at brother branham brother venom says you know the lord told me that i'm going to pray for kings and potentiate amen and he doesn't catch any spiritual revelation at all dr davis looks at this humble young man amen what 20 21 years old got a zeal on fire to preach the gospel come from humble background has nothing in poverty and he looks at him and he says how are you with your seventh grade education what's he doing the same things they did to jesus right here it's the repeat of the scriptures all over again he's looking at brother branham and he's saying you with your seventh grade education you've got no money you've got nothing how are you going to take a ministry to the world a ministry of healing how are you going to pray for kings and pon how are you going to do it and brother branham with the revelation says i don't know how i'm going to do it but he said so if dr davis would have been a spiritual man he would have said i'll pray for you brother i don't see how it's possible but i believe you but he goes right back to carnal amen if there's anything that's limiting us today it's our carnal understanding i say god burn that out of my mind where i think that i can't walk on water i can walk on water the thing that i can't disappear from here and reappear over here amen you don't have to have a glorified body to disappear and show up 100 miles somewhere else philip did it in the same kind of body you have and this message came to restore us back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers that's the faith that philip had it was enough faith to cause him to vanish out of sight and reappear somewhere hundreds of miles away amen that was not in a glorified body that was with nothing different than what you have today he had the full revelation of jesus christ we've received the full revelation of jesus christ there's nothing nothing impossible to them that believes the message come back to bring the full potentials back the full potentials are here your body changes inside of you amen the fullness of the rapture is inside of you everything has come back we're waiting for nothing [Applause] this body oh so many pounds of it i won't tell you how many can walk on top of the water this body amen can vanish and show up somewhere else amen this dirty mouth amen that's been sanctified by the blood of jesus christ can speak squirrels into existence [Applause] hallelujah the only thing that's limiting us is the stuff between our ears that we've come to rely on so much memory and reasoning and affection that we've come to rely our whole existence on that was only here for us to contact this earthly realm that was not given to us to contact the heavenly realm this is the mist this is the vapor that's the reality this is the negative that's the positive i say god help me quit relying on the negative help me quit relying aiming on the mist but help me base my face solidly on that which is real the real is not what's seen the real is what's not seen that's reality hallelujah they all did that with nothing different than what we have right now hallelujah i'm tired of living below my potentials below my privileges we think oh if i lived up to my potential i would be healed of a cold friends if you lived up to your potential your body would change to a glorified body that's the potential that's laying inside you right now you are the bride of jesus christ amen with the full measure of his life that has been restored back what is impossible nothing hallelujah praise god let's get back to our scriptures verse 41 the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which come down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know you have no idea what you're talking about brother branham said communion i talked about this last week communion service the last service he preached said i realized i'm not the son of charles and ella brandon amen hallelujah i'm the son of god i'm not the son of you fill in the blanks for yourself i'm the son of god i'm a daughter of god hallelujah that's the identity that we have to have they were just looking at the outward and they had no idea who they were talking to this is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i come down from heaven here they are they're absolutely bamboozled by the words that are coming out of his mouth because they have zero revelation but their intellect was perfectly intact there was nothing they weren't deficient in mine these were some these were some mighty minds of the day that were standing here they weren't deficient in any way in the mind they had no problem they had good vision their hearing was fine their bodies were sound their mind was sound amen but they said what is this what is he saying he's come down from heaven he's the bread that came down from how did he come down from heaven he came from joseph amen we know his mother and father amen this is jesus we know all about him we saw him as a little kid we saw him raise up what how can he say he come down from heaven hallelujah search the scriptures they are they that testify of us friends how is it that he saith he come down from heaven jesus therefore answered and said murmur not amongst yourselves no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they they shall be all taught of god listen to this they should be taught of who who taught peter that jesus christ was the son of the living god my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who taught peter amen it was the father god who taught peter and he says here they they shall be all taught of god amen revelation is not imparted from one man to another amen god uses the god uses the gift of preaching and under preaching he can give revelation but preaching itself will not impart revelation amen preaching is just one gift of god breaking the word down and sending it out of the people so that god himself can take that word and teach it to you in your heart amen revelation cannot be imparted it cannot be caught like a cold amen you cannot grow up in the message all your life and have revelation [Applause] revelation comes from god they must all be taught of god everyone that cometh to me must be drawn of the father they must all be taught of god now that makes the next scripture really interesting every man therefore that hath hath hath heard is that present tense or past tense half past tense i won't make you answer out loud because if you're like me you don't know your tenses very well grammar is not easy for me all right every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me so when do you learn of the father after you come to him no before you've come to him you must learn from the father when did you learn from the father maybe when you were with him before the foundation of the world amen maybe there you learned of the father amen you're part of the the attributes of god come from the mind of god and come to the earth and before you can ever come to christ you have to already have been taught by the father and have heard from the father when did you hear from him amen when when he was decrying amen let there be i was there in that logos i was there i have no conscious memory of it amen i can't think about it i don't remember it amen but i was there not this part of i but down in here there's a part of i the real me down on the inside not you've never seen me ever you've only seen the tent that i dwell in temporarily but you have not seen me but the real me was there amen and those that come to the father hath already heard and has already been taught of him hallelujah amen that's grace brothers and sisters and that's revelation coming to god's grace every man therefore that hath heard i love the way this is written and hath learned of the father cometh to me past tense present tense if he hath he will if he hath learned he will come praise god why are you here why do you believe the message not because anybody explained anything to you not because anybody taught anything not because you have a great intellect not because of your thesaurus and not because of your your greek lexicon that's not why you're here believing the message you're here because something in you already knew it was true and when the word came the word came to quicken the word the word came to the word the life came to the life the word was already there the life was already there the seed was already there so the seed word comes to the seed the life comes to the life the word comes to the word to quicken it to life because it's already in the seed simple if you have revelation super complicated if you're trying to figure it out not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life hath or will have he that believeth on me hath present tense or past tense past tense and it's everlasting life so it's all tenses past present and future i am that bread of life your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say to you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life half eternal life so if you have eternal life you'll eat and drink you'll eat and drink not because you figured anything out you'll eat and drink because you have eternal life what's driving you to eat and drink eternal life what eternal life the one you already have that's right hallelujah when you were committing the worst sin you've ever committed in your life that thing that the devil when you're down and weak will flash before your eye to try to get you to go into depression and feel unworthy that sin that makes you shudder when you think about it when you were in that sin that eternal life was still inside you amen and that's the thing that brought you out of that sin into the word and brought you to him because it was already there [Applause] hallelujah who so eateth in my flesh verse 54 again and drinking my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed this is beautiful he's already told he's already told us that the bread of life is his flesh that he gives amen and he says my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed now when he makes this statement this is kind of an emphatic statement he's saying my flesh is meat indeed it really is and my blood is drink indeed it actually is and if i would stand here at the pulpit and say something like that today you would look at me like brother chad you've gone off the deep end but see brother jesus christ is speaking spiritual things and in a spiritual realm we have got to stop living in a natural realm [Applause] amen this this message come to lift us out of this natural carnal amen central and bring us into another position amen where we can see amen with spiritual eyes spiritual things and we can understand with spiritual understanding spiritual things not comparing natural with natural but spiritual was spiritual and now in that spirit realm not here on earth but in the spirit his flesh is meat indeed it actually is something you're feasting on because you're not feasting on the body words of a man you're not feasting on the words of a man you're feasting on the body word of the son of man how am i feasting on it not with these teeth right here amen it's a spiritual feast amen where we're eating the lamb amen when we're eating the word and we're growing by and gaining by and drinking his blood which is his life amen the blood is the token of the life and it's the life and the word that we're receiving spiritually not physically we don't rip pages out of our bible and crumple them up and eat them amen we don't believe that when we come to communion amen that there's transcendence the systems transition to where we can ring a bell and say a prayer and all of a sudden it becomes the literal body of jesus christ and now you're part of him because you've actually eaten him no it's not physical it's spiritual everything to the gentiles is spiritual not physical amen we get hung up with jewish ideas of physical not looking at the spiritual he told us you're a holy nation you're a royal priesthood that's what peter said holy nation what is the boundaries of our nation where are the limits where is the headquarters where's the embassy amen what flag do we fly it's not a natural nation it's a holy nation it's spiritual it's not physical now he says you are a royal priesthood okay where do we light the candles what altar do we serve at amen where do we do the offerings where is we're a royal priesthood where do we offer it's not physical it's spiritual that's why the apostle paul amen he says and i believe it's in hebrews he said you've not come to the mouth that might be touched to burn with fire you as we say you have not come to a physical mountain that you can touch that burned with fire that actually burned but you have come to mount zion now paul is declaring another emphatic statement that you have arrived to a place that you have come to a position and now you have come to mount zion well where is it where is it on the map can i find it amen i mean is it like sinai can i go find it can i locate it can i find burn marks on the top of it you have come to mount zion you have come to the holy city you have come to the new jerusalem you have come to the innumerable company of angels you have come to the church of the firstborn you have come to the sprinkling of blood to speak better things than abel you have already come to this position it's a physical position in the spirit realm it's not a physical position in this realm he says you've come to these things already but you can't see them with these eyes but yet we've already arrived we've already come to mount zion we've come to the new jerusalem we've come to the innumerable company of angels we've come to the sprinkling of blood that speaketh better things we've already come but we can't see it this is the promise to the gentiles amen it's it's not physical when jesus christ came to the gentiles how did he come he come through a prophecy that was spoken in isaiah it says thou shalt be a light unto the gentiles right so the prophecy is christ shall be a light unto the gentiles simeon confirms the prophecy when he takes him into his arms when he's eight days old on the eighth day simeon confirms the prophecy and then when the prophecy is going to be fulfilled here comes paul walking down the road with the message what is paul walking down the road with the message he's the light to the gentiles he's the confirmation of the prophecy this is the lord coming to the gentiles it's not visible friends it's invisible amen hallelujah god let's keep reading verse 55 my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drinking indeed he that eaten my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eaten manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum so he was in church he was teaching in church he wasn't with republicans and sinners he was in church many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it and i see there comes a rejection not from the outside but here comes the rejection from the inside this is a hard saying who can hear it it's only a hard saying with no revelation once you have revelation that's an easy saying that's a piece of cake we can sit here 2 000 years later having the revelation of what this meant look back and say that's easy there's nothing complicated in that but that day that he was speaking it before the revelation of it came they're standing there and they're saying even peter is standing here not knowing brother bram says they didn't have a clue what brother what jesus was talking about all of his disciples they're standing there and they don't even know what he's talking about and the other disciple says it's a hard saying it's a hard saying because of a carnal mind that's the only thing that makes the scriptures hard that's the only thing that makes the message hard is a carnal mind amen then jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto him does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before they just said he came from joseph we know his father and mother and now he's talking crazy again what if you should see the son of man ascend up where he was before now listen to this it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing he's telling you quit looking at the flesh i'm talking about the spirit the flesh prophet nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that we believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except they were given unto him of my father and from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him these were his disciples these weren't just people these were his disciples verse 67 then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go amen hallelujah how many of you have been there in the message amen somebody asked you a question somebody starts to show you contradictions somebody will confuse your mind and they'll take the message and twist your mind in the knot amen and all you can say is where where else will we go there's no place else to go he says peter answered lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe in our shore that's a revelation friends we believe in our shore not of what you meant by eating flesh and drinking blood he was not sure about eating flesh and drinking blood that's not what he was sure about he was sure about a revelation god gave to him that came from the father himself and that revelation was we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god amen you know what revelation is going to hold you when somebody confuses you on the message or twists you up or tries to make it convince you or something else it's that same revelation that comes from the father where else will we go this message is christ it holds the words of eternal life it is unlocking of the revealing of the mysteries it i i can't figure it all out but this one thing i know and am sure of friends that's the key right there if nothing else get that say god give me a revelation where i'm sure that this message is christ amen a foundation that no matter what said amen peter can't run away no matter how much his intellect cannot interpret or handle the things that jesus is saying and do you think that it hurt peter when he saw all the disciples walking away you remember at this time peter still thought that this was going to be a great movement peter in his mind he still thought this is going to be a massive movement amen there's going to be the whole nation is going to be converted jesus is going to become king and i'm going to be his right hand man that was still peter he was still expecting big things more people to come amen more miracles more signs more wonders more prestige more honor and now he starts saying things that don't make sense he starts saying things that are twisting even his twelve disciples minds up in knots and now peter starts seeing the the disciples walking away but there's something anchored in peter's heart he hath heard from god he hath been taught of the father he said thou are christ the son of the living god he says we believe and are sure we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god i want to ask you what is this message christ and we've got to be sure that it's christ because we're not sure it's christ somewhere along the way we're going to walk away because something's going to be hard to understand something's going to be hard to deal with there's going to be a separation or breaking off or a walking away of disciples or some words that the prophet said that i cannot make sense in my mind somewhere along the way there's going to come a challenge to faith amen and only thing that is going to stand that challenge is this revelation that i am sure that this message is nothing else than jesus christ returned back to the earth in the form of his word [Applause] i'm sure of it i know it amen i don't know a lot of things but i know that's true and that's the thing that'll keep me in the dark days that's the thing that'll keep me in the trouble sometimes that's the thing that'll keep peter when everything peter thought was going to happen goes in reverse but his revelation of who this is cannot go in reverse because peter didn't get it himself it was given to him of the father and if it was given of the father peter himself can't lose it [Applause] hallelujah how many of you thankful for a revelation from the father because you would have lost it a long time ago you would have left it when your prayers weren't answered when your family got sick when there was a death of a loved one amen when the pastor fell away you would have fallen away but there was something that didn't come from the intellect there was something that came from the mind of god amen possessed the attributes and qualities of god and it was an anchor in the soul that had been quickened by a revelation from the father and you said this is nothing but christ you can spit on the message you can spit on the messenger you can spit on me but it's christ nonetheless hallelujah we believe and are sure that thou art christ the son of the living god let's turn to john 17. where john 17 verse 14. in john 17 14 he says i have given them thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world praise god has he given us the word it doesn't matter if the world likes us or hates us we're not of the world who does the word come to those who are not of the world who does the word come to the bible says gods is that what the bible says the word comes to gods gods are not of the world they're from another world you call them gods whom the word of the lord came to that's right okay he says verse 14 and i have given them thy word and the word hath hated them the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world so however much so that jesus was not of the world is the same way his disciples are not of the world it's the same way you and i are not of the world so however jesus was not of the world is the same way we're not of the world explain it i can't but i believe it i accept it i pray not that thou should has take them out of the world but thou should has keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the lord he repeats it just so that we'll get it there none of the world even as i am not of the world let's go over to first john first john chapter 4. trying to get to a certain place here so bear with me we'll just keep laying the word down john chapter first john chapter 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is yes let's go back to english class present tense past tense future tense present tense it's always a present tense god jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god let's go back every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god simple and this is that spirit of antichrist where of you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world so if it was there in the world then it'd already come is it here now same spirit amen year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are there of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god that means we've come from god they come from the world we come from god we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error john just makes it simple we are of god if they hear us they're from god they don't hear us they're not of god simple praise the lord i want to take a few more minutes and look at something not really a diversion but another part of the puzzle let's go to luke 22. luke 22 69. i just want to lay this in here today jesus is in trial with the high priest verse 67 luke 20 267 he asked art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you you will not believe he's already told them tons of stuff and they don't believe anything he ever says anyhow so i answer the questions now and if i also ask you you will not answer me nor let me go hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god this is what i want to talk about the right hand of god let's go back to mark let's turn back to mark verse 14 and pick this up again 14 62 mark 14 62 and jesus said i am and you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of of heaven amen we're going to get into this this later but i just want to lay this down and i want to read this quote from questions and answers from august 23 of 1964. brother brahm is saying when when was when man was made in the image of god and then god come down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and god together heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other god and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us jesus said i come from god and i go to god is that right after his death burial resurrection and ascension when the body was taken up to set at the right hand of god now now brother brennan's going to talk about this body sitting at the right hand of god now listen to what he says now i don't mean god's got a right hand god's a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of god that in that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in earth is named after and subject to it a name above names jesus christ so brother branham is telling us this is not a geographical position the sitting at the right hand the scripture says sitting at the right hand standing at the right hand on the right hand it's all those terminologies are all the same thing amen god is a spirit he doesn't have hands well the prophet said it's not that jesus christ amen has to sit on his hand or stand beside his hand amen it's a position of power and authority it's a position not a geographical location because some people think that he must stay at the right hand till a certain time to also fulfill and then he'll leave the right hand and come down he will never again leave the right hand of god because he will never lose his power and authority when he comes to earth and his body again to set up the kingdom of david and begins to rule and reign on earth for a thousand years he is still on the right hand of god [Applause] he cannot leave the right hand of god because when he come down as a man and a body and he conquered death hell in the grave and took the keys and ascended on high he come into that position of power and authority and he will never leave that position no matter where that body goes we have to stop thinking with carnal minds and making heaven like earth where something has to sit here and it's there and on the right hand it's a position of power and authority when jesus christ the same body that was nailed to the cross comes back to earth in the millennium is it here as son of david he is still in the right hand of god hallelujah believe the prophet believe the word first peter 3 22 says who has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him see every time it's referring to the right hand it's referring to power authority to to his position let's go to revelation chapter 4. now we know that revelation is a book of symbols and we want to take a look here just as we wind down this morning revelations chapter 4 verse 1 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now where where is jesus yeah where where is the nail pierced body where's he's on the right hand so he's got to be in physical position to the right side so i've got to see like maybe a shekinah glory of god or something and then to the right of that i've got to see the earth body that's not what john saw when he looked and he looked all over for a man and the cry goes out a christ says who is able to come and take the book and loose the seals and john looks amen brother branham said he looks all around and he can't find a man who's worthy where's jesus at amen where's the man who died amen brother bam said he's back in behind the throne doing the mediatorial work of the high priest office what do you mean he's behind the throne i mean the bible says he's at the right hand he can be at the right hand and behind the throne he can be at the right hand and on the throne of david in the millennium the right hand is a position of power and authority not a physical location if not the bible means nothing or john had a false vision hallelujah praise be to god so the right hand is power and authority let's go back to revelation chapter 1 real quickly i'm going to skip ahead just a minute revelation chapter 1 verse this is the this is jesus john has seen jesus he's seen him in the midst of the seven golden candle sticks and he's got the stars in his right hand he said the mystery of the seven stars was thou saws in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the salmon candlesticks which thou sawest are seven churches so the seven stars are the angels to the churches are the church age messengers where are the church age messengers in the right hand of jesus where's jesus and the right hand of god so when john looks up and sees the throne why doesn't he see jesus standing on the right hand and in the right hand seven angels it's symbology jesus has become the right hand of god and the right hand of christ on earth of the church ages is those seven church age messengers they have the power and authority of god this is not physical locations this is spiritual positions we've got to quit being denominational believers quit being baptist reading the book of revelations and be message believers [Applause] now let's turn over back to revelations 4. revelations 4 verse 5. and out of the throne this is the same scene you just saw and out of the throne preceded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god i thought god had one spirit brother brennan said this is one holy spirit working in seven different church ages but the bible says seven spirits of god where are they at before the throne what are they it's the holy ghost that was working in those angels where are the angels and the right hand of jesus christ where's jesus christ and the right hand of god amen you can't paint a picture that confusing to make all of that physical it's spiritual brother-in-law says in the ephesian church age out of the church age book there he is with the seven stars in his right hand the right hand her arm signifies the power and authority of god psalms 44 3 says for they got they got not the land and possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand in thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hast a favor unto them in that right hand of power are seven stars who according to revelations 1 20 are the seven messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind these messengers to every age they they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word he says in the revelation of jesus christ out of the same book the seven spirits before the throne is the spirit the spirit that was in each of those seven messengers giving them their ministry for the age in which they lived i want to ask you a question when the apostle paul was here did one of the stars leave jesus's hand and come down to earth and did one of the seven spirits leave the throne no friends this earth is only reflecting what's going on in heaven heaven is not far away heaven is right here if you travel to heaven how long will it take and then what path will you take how many miles will you go it's not a physical location it's another dimension and what's happening in this flash is only materializing what's going on in that dimension it's not as though a star leaps and now jesus is only holding six stars they're always in his right hand [Applause] praise be to god we're not children anymore praise god let's go back to revelation we're in revelation let's go to revelation chapter 5. and i saw on the right hand huh i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side and sealed with seven seals i thought jesus was on the right hand i thought the stars were in the right hand here there's a book in the right hand side the right hand signifies authority and power now let's go all the way back to genesis chapter 1. in genesis chapter 1 when god said let us make man in our image male and female he made thee them and he gave them dominion and said he said subdue and have dominion over the earth what were they they were the power and authority upon the earth but when they lost that position by sin the title deed to redemption was taken amen and it went back where to the right hand of god because what is this what is this title deed represents it represents the power and authority of god to rule and reign on the earth and that power and authority is coming back to mankind through the bride and the bridegroom amen the bridegroom purchased it back the bride now is finishing her part in the plan of redemption coming back to full word with no no no no no failing no no subtility no deception no compromise no changing the word she's coming back to fulfill her part and when she finishes fulfilling her part standing true on every word and then what's happened the the the seven seal book opened up showing where the power and authority to rule the earth lays it lays in christ and his bride they are joint heirs he that overcometh and laodicea shall sit with me in my throat even as i have overcome and sit with my father in his throne what is this it's the book in the right hand signifying where you and i belong [Applause] brother ben says in the rising of the sun look what we've seen this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals that's the book that's in his hand to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord i told you was around and a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was we knew and we knew just look at it this way it's our lord up there you see he's talking about the picture of the clown they didn't know what it was we knew just look at it this way it's our lord up there you see do you see [Music] he is the one listen to this he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was open so in the right hand of him that sits on the throne what's in the right hand christ the book of christ brother benham calls it a book of redemption he calls it the bible he's got another name for it we'll go to in a minute he says he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha omega the beginning the end what identification and quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatched us from death to life brother bram goes on to say in christ is the mystery of god revealed now you see those seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him where's the book in the right hand power and authority coming back to mankind the record of christ power and authority in the right hand who's got power and authority to the reign it's in the right hand but it's a sealed mystery nobody knows the mystery the mystery's in the right hand but at an appointed time there's going to be another one who can take that and open that up and reveal the mystery of the power and authority to rule the earth hallelujah all that's in this book would be him listen would be him for that's the believer the words in the book yes and the word is him all that's in this book of redemption is him and that's the believer the words in the book what are you talking about i don't understand that yes you do read genesis chapter one the mysteries in genesis chapter one he made them male and female and called their name adam called their name jesus christ everything in this book this this seven sealed book this redemption this title deed everything and that would be him and that's the believers are you the believers then you're the believers then you're in the book [Applause] that's the words that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him male and female and all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and there he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir there's no bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's christ and christ is the word that's why when that cloud came and only had the head of jesus christ because it was the headship coming to the body the bodies on earth the headships coming to the body the body is the bride the headship is the word at the opening of the seals coming back that's the headship is the entire revelation of the entire book is the head show ephesians 1 and 3 says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love but god who is rich in mercy this is chapter 2 verse 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus so where are you sitting in the right hand of god if christ has been is quickened up to the right hand of god power and authority and we've been quickened up to sit with him in heavenly places where have we been quickened to the right hand of god spiritual amnesia is keeping us from that romans 8 16 says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together what's our position the right hand what's the book in the right hand what's in the book the title t to all of earth the power the rulership the right to rule and reign we shall rule and reign with him upon the earth now listen to this the invisible union of the bride of christ now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold so in the right hand that him that sat on the throne in the right hand was what the seven seal book the book of redemption the entire bible the record of christ the believers are the words in the book the marriage circuit i don't know about you but when you have a marriage certificate you don't just put the man's name on the marriage certificate but in the marriage certificate is the two who are becoming one amen you put the bride and the bridegroom on the marriage certificate and this marriage certificate amen was completed before the foundation of the world when we were chosen in him and what is this marriage certificate it's the title deed to earth it's the right to return with christ and rule and reign for a thousand years and this title deed book is open the mystery's been revealed christ himself has brought it down the mighty angel revelations 10 1 amen and he gave the mysteries to the seventh church age messenger and the seventh church age messenger gave it to his people and now what do we have we have the title deed we have the mystery we have the right to be kings and priests what did it come to do break spiritual amnesia to let us see who we really are brother says in trying to do go to service without it being god's will i went through and i wanted to see christ in the right hand seven stars in the right hand seven spirits before the throne book in the right hand i wanted you to see all this because i want to come to this it says you see a tree struggling to live that means there's a tree that don't die you see a man struggling for life it shows that there's a tabernacle waiting somewhere that don't die if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting the good heavenly father permitted me to walk behind the curtain one day and see it but the man would be on the curtain of time and seen that he knows it's true he says in the rising of the sun or no in the masterpiece 1964 in the masterpiece he says so we realize that we're in a negative form that we're in a negative form and as long as there's a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive c because it's because of the positive that makes the negative what was martin luther the negative what was the positive the star on the right hand he was reflecting the positive here in the negative it takes the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere to strike that light strike that lens or there wouldn't be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflecting something here on earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't i'm the worst deceived man in the world i spent my life in vain but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's there see that's why we're here why are we here we're just reflecting something from over there and that life over there is not moving and leaving and transcending and it's there reflecting here this is reflecting what's already there hallelujah brother branham says it is the rising of the sun he's talking about going beyond the curtain of time and he says one day when i was wearing myself i said boy you'd better go ahead if you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the lord you better hurry up and do it you're getting old see and there that morning the quickening power came and let me look over the curtain and i seen all of you over there wait a minute he's talking to a room full of living people yes sir not dead in the vision when he goes over there he's greeted by a woman who's passed away was 80. she's a young woman he's greeted by his first wife hope amen but now when he comes to the rising of the sun he says i went there and i seen all of you over there they were sitting right here in a church but in that dimension there's a body eternal in the heavens already made hallelujah and the life sitting in the sea is only reflecting the life that's over there amen jesus says in john 3 13. said no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that cometh down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven he's here and he's there you're here in there is that shocking that's what brother branham said the scripture says if these bodies of our earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already eternal in the heavens it's there already amen i'm here and there at the same time now how long does it take to get from here to there how many miles away do we measure it in kilometers where is it it's right here friends that's why when you heard the word and recognized it was eagle food you heard from your theophany how far away how loud did it have to yell did it echo through the canyons where was it not naturalized spiritual eyes oh god brother madam says and christ is revealed in his own word you're going to find out one of these days when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here too just in another dimension faster than this you're not flying off somewhere when you go to heaven heaven's here friends just in another dimension where's the right hand of god here heaven's here where's the right hand of god here where's the title deed book here what's the words in the book the believers where are the believers here the revealed word is here the unsealed book is here the words that are written in the book is the believers and all the words is him he's here as the believers unsealed by the unsealed book hallelujah it's not far away it's not something to come it's here say god rip the carnality right out of my mind help me to forget my five senses to touch and contact those are let me have that one sense of faith that sick sense that can touch you at all times that can feel you to know you're real that know the realities of the word are all around me right now the right hand of god is being revealed now power and authority what was it that let william branham speak squirrels into existence the right hand of god what was it that had him speak to the storm in colorado the right hand of god where did he get that power and authority from god how are we going to do it when the mystery of the right hand is revealed on earth we're going to do the same thing praise god say god let me search the scriptures i don't want to read them as a bible school student i don't want to be a bible school student i want to be a believer i want to be just as much believers peter was ignorant and unlearned couldn't sign his own name smelled like fish and he could catch something none of the theologians could catch i i want to be a man like simple hattie wright that may not have been able to explain very much but she said that's nothing but the truth that's what i want a spirit of revelation to say this is nothing but the truth pray god i want to read my bible with spiritual eyes i want to be in my bible with the eyes of understanding being enlightened amen not the old carnal way of we used to do it amen we used to just take it these are english words and they mean that my goodness they've been arguing over that for thousands of years let them keep arguing but the eyes of understanding having been open now we go back to the same scriptures we've read dozens of times and now the sudden we look and say that's me that's me that's me that's me that's me i can see the mystery through the entire bible and i couldn't see it before did the words change the words didn't change i changed say god changed me let me see this message for what it really is god bless your saints let's stand hallelujah we love you the love of the lord we praise his holy name for being so good to us you know how many prophets and wise men would have loved to see this day you know how many would have loved to have been here in this day you know you know how they would have longed to hear a sermon preach like this but it's this day it's the day that we live in that he's expressing all these things to us we used to think that someday i'll fly away to the wild blue yonder and i mean how long of a trip will it be how far is it between heaven and earth see those old ideas of above the clouds and you know past the milky way my goodness friends it's another dimension it's not even another place really brother bam said it's right here just moving at a faster speed and this life that we're living now is a reflection of that one that's the positive this is the negative the negative is portraying the positive but as the positive and the negative get closer together brother brandon says it's like a shadow of your hand far away you can start to discern fingers five fingers it gets closer and you start to recognize the outline of a man's hand five fingers you can count and you start to see some detail but all of a sudden the positive and negative come together and our bodies change and we meet him in the air how high in the air where at in the air what air praise god we just changed dimensions friends it's just a dimensional change it's a mile up no it's half a mile up no it's three quarters a month no because there's oxygen we don't need oxygen and you can start all kinds of arguments about how high you're going to go it's a dimensional change praise god almighty i thank god that he's brought us up from our childishness and our kitty stuff and brought us into a place where all things are possible to them that believe say god give me a revelation a greater revelation a revelation like i've never had before the revelation of the rapture that will change my body let's pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word we just ask god that you just come to us lord quicken lord more of yourself to us lord you've given us life lord your own life you've opened our eyes of understanding that we might see you but lord we're not satisfied we must have more god there's more of you to be had we sense it we we know it lord there's a greater realization lord there's more of the positive moving into the negative and we're hungry for more lord we're hungry to be that manifestation that you've called us to be in this day we're hungry to live the literal life and put it on display to be the light of the world let it be in us lord move all the carnality out of the way lord forgive us lord for being so earthbound we just pray god that you would lift our heads above all of the cardinal that's going on around us lift us into heavenly places that we can see our position all that we might recognize the day we're living and we might recognize what's going on all around us we might live a different kind of life lord the kind of life that you lived when you were here on earth your prophet said you lived a life all to yourself that's the kind of life we want to live lord the same life that you lived we god we prayed you would grant it open your word to us lord let us see it god open the eyes of our understanding correct us where we've been wrong correct our wrong thinking our wrong understanding give us your mind lord in greater measure than we've ever had it before and let it change our minds we give ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] praise the lord tell your friends it's not what we used to think it was it's not anything like the denominations teach it's so different that it took a prophet who could go into the back part of god's mind who would have thus saith the lord on the scriptures because we could have never figured it out with a carnal mind i'm thankful for that and we know that when brother brenham comes to preach the rapture he explains the order of the rapture the or the rapture comes in an order the shout the voice and the trumpet he says he does all three while he's descending descending from where brother branham said heaven's right here how long does it take to descend i mean it's been 50 years since the prophet was here so it must be a long ways away like if it takes 50 years to come so far from shout voice to trumpet he must have been a long ways away he's been traveling for 50 years friends it's not a distance it's not a measurement he's descending from one dimension into another [Music] through the shout the shout is what the message to gather the bride through the voice the voice is in the bride the same voice that called lazarus from the grave that voice is a life lived what's he doing he's moving dimensions he's slipping into this dimension until he slips so much that the bodies change and we meet him in the air where another dimension don't think of things far off in long ways it's here it's happening he does all three while he's descending he's coming into this dimension in what way in you and me say thank god for that let me live it every day of my life let that reality shine forth in this dimension i pray in jesus name let's sing we'll let you be dismissed god bless you you have a song let's sing that song he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is the same love he's the same yesterday and today and forever jesus is alive and well
