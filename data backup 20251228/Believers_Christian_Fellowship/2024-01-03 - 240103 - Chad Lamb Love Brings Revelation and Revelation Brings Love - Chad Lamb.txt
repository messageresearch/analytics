in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all let's take our Bibles while we're still standing and turn to First John the Epistle of first johnen it's good to be together on the first official service of 2024 amen I'm so glad we're able to be together God is good to us amen and we pray that God Amen starts us off on the right foot amen praise God I want to look at first John chapter 4 and I'm want to read two scriptures out of 1 John chapter 4 1 John 4 and the first one we'll read is verse 8 he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love let's go down to verse 16 and we have known and believe the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God in God in himen God bless you as you take your seats so we know that God is love amen and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him amen and I want to take for a title if I can for this evening for a subject is love brings Revelation and Revelation brings love love brings Revelation and Revelation brings love and I I I really want to uh tonight if I could just speak on John the Apostle John and the disciple John I want to speak on John I want to speak on the Book of John the Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation and kind of tie all those together and I just pray that that you pull on the gift because I all of this stuff floods through my heart as I meditate and all these pieces come together and for me when I'm sitting and meditating on this I was sharing this with brother Franco today when I'm meditating on this all of a sudden everything just congeals together together and everything all these little pieces become one picture it's almost like a thousand piece jigsaw all of a sudden I see the whole thing and now I come with a thousand pieces and I don't know how to get you to see the same thing that I see it's going to take the anointing of the Holy Ghost operating through a gift amen because I want God to do the same thing for you that he's done for me amen and take all these pieces and put them together so it Paints the same picture that that is in my heart Amen in the Ephesians Church age brother bam said from the church age book he says a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God the great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God so brother Brenham calls John the Apostle of love he also in another place calls him the disciple of love amen and and we know we know because we've been through it so many times and we're going to go into it again today and read the quotes but we know that John Amen in the Book of Revelation is a type of the church he's a type of the Bride amen so I want you to lock that into your heart and allow that uh allow that to be true as we talk about this so John is a type of the Bride amen and John is the Apostle of love and and as we look through this we're going to see John has a unique relationship with the Lord John has a unique Revelation John is John sees what none of the other disciples see John John was the youngest disciple at the time Jesus was walking on this Earth and after he departed amen John with a special relationship with with Jesus Christ amen and we'll explore that through the scriptures but but he's the last Apostle Amen to remain alive after they're all deceased amen and it's all showing a tye because John was the one who made it longest he was the longest lasting or the longest living disciple amen and he made it all the way to the island of patmas where he was caught up in a vision and taken to the Lord's day and he saw all the way to the end amen and so he's a type of the Bride because the bride would be the last of the seven Church ages she would be the last amen of the Bride the last of the Bride that would be on earth so she outlived them all you see that and she herself will get caught up amen into the Revelation and see all the way to the end as well amen so you see the types and similarities we're talking about John the Apostle John we're talking about the the the the go Gospel of John the Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation but what we're really wanting to see is an identification of ourselves amen so brother Ram says in the message do you now believe said now in St John you say uh brother bham you sure read a lot out of St John he said it's one of my favorites John is a book of love oh my goodness we're going to see that you get into the Epistles of John it's so evident in the Epistles of John first second and third amen all through it he's crying out little children love one another Above All Things love one another he that knoweth God a he that knoweth uh uh he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love the things that we just read but all through these Apostles or these Epistles first second third he's talking about love and love one another and love the Brethren and and and all of these things he says if you don't love one another how can you say you love God who you've not seen and you can't love your brother who you can see amen John is the Apostle of love the Epistles are all about love but then brother brandham says that St John The Gospel of John is a book of love what is the relationship between Christ and his bride it's a love relationship all of these you see what I'm I'm trying to say all of these pieces are starting to congeal and paint one picture amen so and and this is where brother R says that about the Epistles and he said we always know uh Peter of course we always know that he's the Great Burly faith that just reaches out after it whether you can see it or not and hope is James and John was charity because John even as Epistles were called the Epistles of love so now we see John is love and and and we heard uh uh uh when when uh uh Brother Kyle preached he talked about Peter James and John faith hope and charity Charity's love and they were taken up on the mount Transfiguration to be those Witnesses John is always typed with love and John is typed with the bride amen so now we're beginning to see our position now in the breach uh uh uh brother banham starts to explain something in the breach that I want to capture as well but let's first turn to Revelation CH 4 together and let's read the scripture by the grace of God I'm just going to throw a ton of pieces out and then ask God to help us put them together where so don't get nervous we're throwing puzzle pieces everywhere but we ask God to help us find where they fit Revelation 4:6 and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like un Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had a face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so now when John gets caught up into the Throne of Throne Room of God in chapter four here he now sees a door in heaven a voice has come up hither he goes up and he sees one sitting on the throne and he starts to describe everything that he sees but round about the throne in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne are these cherubims and one was liken to a lion one liken to an ox one liken to a man and one liken to an eagle and brother bam picks this up in the breach and he says now remember the lion and the ox and so forth the head of the man and so forth and then watch those seraphim the word while all Mark Matthew Luke and John all stood around the book of Acts now brother M's talking about the cherubs around the throne and he ties it to Matthew Mark Luke and John around the book of Acts he makes this parallel and he and he goes on to say further in the breach he says in Matthew markk Luke and John those gospels are standing there guarding that the wisdom of a man the power of the line the work of an ox the swiftness of the lepers or the eagle rather yes the gospel standing there remember when we had it in the seven Church ages and brother R he when he preaches the seven Church ages he he talks about this and he goes into it in Revelation chapter 4 and Revelation chapter 5 back in 1960 and 61 when he preaches it but what he begins to show is that around the Throne of God are these four living creatures and you can pick it up in Ezekiel and Ezekiel they have the same cherubims and these cherubims eat had four faces and they each had whichever way they looked they had a face of a lion face of an ox face of a man and face of an eagle and brother R ties it to the cherubims all the way back on the Eastern Gate of Eden when God had to move the man out of Eden because he had fallen in sin and he put cherubims there with a flaming sword turning Every Which away to keep the way of the tree of life amen and those were cherubs and brother Ram ties those cherubs to the ones in Ezekiel to the ones in Revelation 4 amen so we see there's four and brother BR shows that the those four living creatures were four anointings that were over the church through the seven Church ages amen when the apostles came out preaching come out in Pentecost and the Apostle Paul came out to establish the word they were under a lion anointing they stood against the face of all opposition with boldness and they boldly proclaimed the word and the Word was written down and we got the New Testament amen but then after that we would have a change in the horse rider from the white horse rider of deception that lion anointing was fighting that deception with the true word but then it would come amen into a red horse that would begin to fight and as it would take up the sword and begin the fight there was an ox anointing that came to the church amen and they would become Martyrs and they would lay down their life for the word these are this these are four anointings over the church amen and so then amen as we would move into the Dark Ages and the black horse would begin to ride and he had stomped out everything and brought everything everything into a a a Dark Age amen God would raise up the man anointing which is intelligence and wisdom amen and he would start to print the word and start to translate the word and start to bring the word back through the man anointing amen and that man anointing was the anointing over the reformers it was over the Lutheran age the wesleyian age and the Pentecostal age amen but at the end of the Pentecostal age there was going to be an eagle anointing that would come and the eagle anointing is the prophetic anointing cuz it can fly high and see far off and these are the anointings over the church age and brother brandham shows them around the Throne of God because the Throne of God is where the life is because God is the life amen so they were guarding the throne and he takes us back I mean all the way back to the Tabernacle in the wilderness and when God would set up the children of Israel to Camp around that amen each of those tribes would have a standard that standard was their flag on the flag would be a symbol and they would have four main four main camps or tribes around and with them was an other two associated with or another three associated with them right right no another two there was three to make 12 I think I got it so around each of them was the standard of Judah the lion the ox the man and Dan the eagle with the camping with the standards around the Throne of God which was in the Tabernacle was the lion ox man and Eagle in heaven around the throne was the lion ox man and Eagle amen guarding the way to the tree of life amen this all has to do with the Tree of Life this all has to do with life guarding the keeping the way to the tree of life was the cherubims with the four faces the four anointings what were the four anointings doing it it at first we used to think through the church ages that those cherums were there keeping them away from the Tree of Life but that's not what the scripture says they were keeping the way of the Tree of Life they were preserving a way back to life they were making sure the path stayed open amen and those four anointings amen now brother bam said are the four gospels amen around the book of Acts because what is the book of Acts he said the book of Acts amen is when amen is when Christ came to his throne where was the throne in the book of Acts the throne came into the heart of man he said when did it come into the heart man at the day of Pentecost so now the Throne of God in Acts amen was the day of Pentecost when when Christ came into the heart of man and what was keeping the way or guarding the way or leading the way to the throne it was those four gospels you pass through the four gospels then you come to the book of Acts amen amen more puzzle pieces so now brother bam takes those four go gospels and puts an anointing upon each and showing on the Book of Matthew is the lion anointing the king anointing and when you read Matthew you can see it so easily you open it up and it starts with the lineage of the House of David amen showing here comes the king through the lineage of the House of David and it starts right in the beginning there's a lion anointing you go to the Book of Mark and Mark is talking about the Lamb of God sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice you come to Luke Luke was the physician he was the intellect he was the Gentile and when you go to Luke Luke starts breaking down all the scientific facts between who married who and how the baby came and the angel and what it say and he puts all the pieces together even the way the book book of Luke starts it doesn't start like the other ones Matthew starts with a lineage because it's the book of the king amen it's the lion book uh Mark starts right Mark is so simple like an ox it starts right into the Gospel of Jesus Christ there was a man named John yeah but Luke is Luke writing to somebody oh the awfulness I have set down to record these things that we know to hold to be true so that it's the man anointing you can see it right from the beginning but when you get to John John doesn't talk about John the Baptist he's not talk about Zacharias he doesn't do a lineage John says in the beginning was the word he goes all the way back before there was an earth before there was any creation and because it's an eagle anointing it's flying so much higher than everything else from that perspective he goes all the way back in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in him was life and that life was the light of men oh praise God I'm so glad we had a prophet the prophet he takes everything and he put this is why I'm saying when you look at the message and you look at the Bible amen I'm telling you there's a thousand puzzle pieces there may be 10,000 puzzle pieces he talks about cherubs and Eden he talks about the Ezekiel cherubs he talks about the heaven he talks about the go Els he talks about the book of Acts he talks about a throne in heaven he talks about a throne in the heart and it's like what are all these pieces amen but all by the grace of God if he can take everything the prophet said and everything's in the scripture and put it together it makes one picture and it's a beautiful picture and here we come the last gospel the fourth gospel matches the fourth Beast which is the eagle and that book of John is so unlike the other three gospels it's so unique in so many ways that brother BM said he said somebody accused him said brother BM you sure read out of St John a lot I wonder why we were under the eagle anointing and so now when we look at John John's the Apostle of love his Epistles are the Epistle of Love brother brandham said the Book of John is a book of love but he also says it's the eagle anointing it's the eagle anointing on that book so when we look at John who's also a type of the Bride you've got to tie in the love the book of love with the eagle anointing and attach those two together and I hope we can find ourselves there now let's go to Revelation chapter 1 and look here in Revelation 1 verse1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw so we start right off with the Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation is the Capstone of the whole Bible and it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and brother Benham said this whole book is the record of Christ So This Book of Revelation is an unveiling of the entire Bible and it's the revelation of Jesus Christ because the whole book was about Christ it's the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass what do you mean shortly come to pass because this was written 2,000 years ago but you have to realize it was shortly come to pass from the time it was revealed which was in our age and he sent and signify it by his Angel unto his servant John I wonder who that angel represents which Angel cames and brings the revelation of Jesus Christ to John the type of the Bride we know that that's brother ROM amen so we find ourselves in the scriptures and then we see that then we go into chapter 1 and and we we see a description of of Christ in the midst of the seven churches which are the seven Church ages so it's Christ through the seven Church ages in the midst of his church amen and then we go to to Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 is a description of the seven Church ages coming down through time but at the end of the seven Church ages we go to Revelation chap 4 it's amazing it's another four again just like the fourth beast and just like the fourth gospel the fourth gospel is John the Fourth Beast is an eagle and the fourth chapter is a catching up for a greater Revelation not the Earthly things now now the Heavenly things and he says in John chap 4:1 after this brother BM says after what after these Church ages amen and brother later brother is going to tell us and before the tribulation so this is going to take place place at the end of the church ages and before the tribulation happens to be exactly where we're standing right now said after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was it as it were of the trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and I immediately was in the spirit and behold a throne was in heaven and one sat on the throne amen so now brother B says in Revelation chapter 1 from 1960 or I'm sorry Revelation chapter 4 said oh notice John being taken up immediately after the church age was a type of the Rapture Church immediately after the church age is over this Leota Church age then comes the Rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God and then he comes to Revelation chapter 4 uh part two which he preaches uh on January 1st 1961 the other one was January or December 31st so one was New Year's Eve and one was New Year Day 1961 he says there was a living creature what John represented what John represented the entire church was taken up I told you one person here in a vision can represent the entire body of Christ again he says in Revelation chapter 4 this is part one he says now notice he's finished his work in Earth and he on Earth and he took his church and now he sends the Judgment the world rejected him and he sends the Judgment he his church has gone to Glory John there on the aisle of patmas a Revelator to the church has been the type of the church which is lifted up into Glory come up hither so you say he represented the church to everyone that hears this word John represents him that's me I'm going to take that as me to everyone that hears this word John represents him amen John was the represent representative of the blood of Jesus Christ testimony of the word he was a witness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a personal fellowship with Christ and he represented the entire church that every man or woman boy or girl that ever believed in Christ except him on the same grounds he'll be summoned someday come up hither he got up before the tribulation remember the tribulation time hasn't set in yet this is being the time setting of the Judgment John is being showed now what's going to take place after the church age see to everyone that hears this word John represents him amen right sir and who is John the Apostle of Love who is John amen John is the one who writes The Gospel under the eagle anointing John is the one who gets caught up into Heavenly places and sees amen John is the one who starts the the the his gospel off within the beginning was the word amen and John is the one who gets caught up in the vision on the aisle of patmas and sees all the way to the end of time he sees from the beginning of time to the end of time amen and everyone that believes this word John represents him amen CU what has God done to the bride in this end time he's lifted her up to see amen all the way back to the mystery in the back part of God's mind from the beginning of time all the way to what's going to unfold in the end time and what's coming after praise God praise be to God Amen and now in The Invisible Union of the bride I I I I don't know how else to do this but just keep throwing out puzzle pieces amen I hope God's starting to lay them in the right place for you yes he says you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was so where did you come from wherever he came from is where you came from you were pre predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was oh praise God which which other age knew this which other generation understood these things and had this pronounced over them by a prophet and then he goes on to say he was that great attribute of God Called Love so what is Christ Christ is love what is God God is loveen that right that what Paul tells or John tells us in the epistle God is love amen God is love but he also tells us that God is the word so God is the word and God is love and Christ is the word and Christ is the attribute of God Called Love and then Christ's bride came from the bosom of the Father the same place by predestination that Christ came from and John is a type of her and he's the Apostle of love so what do you think we are we're part of that great love and that great love relationship and that great expression of the attribute of God's love that's what this whole drama is unfolding to show God's love amen so now let's go to John 13 together oh there's so many things that I want to get into and I don't know how God help us please now we're looking I want you to recognize we're reading out of St John so so when we read this I want us to understand John's the type of the Bride John's the Apostle of love John has a special relationship with Christ and this book is under an eagle anointing amen amen now look John 13:21 when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said this is the last supper this is after he's washed the disciples feet testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was leaning on jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved you want to guess who that was we all know because brother bam tells us and the gospels tell us that this is John John the youngest of the Apostles John that will outlive all the apostles John who will get caught up in the Revelation and see the end time John who will understand the mystery of those seven Thunders amen you see how John's the type of the Bride you see how you amen can find your identification in John and here is that same John who will receive the revelation of the seven Thunders see from the beginning in the beginning was the word all the way to the end this same John where is he in the last supper he's laying on the bosom of Jesus what a relationship that this John has to Christ it's unlike any of the other disciples and he has a title that none of the other disciples have and that title is he whom Jesus loved and we'll find it all through the Book of John that's the title that is given to John says now let's read it again now there was leaning on jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it would be of whom he spake now Peter is not going to say h Jesus who is it no he goes to the one with the special relationship one that's closest Peter amen Peter brother B said Peter is Faith John is love amen he said Peter was burly with faith and he was bold and he was out there amen but is Burly and bold as he was out there with his faith he knew that it took something else to get this divine revelation this hidden secret amen and so he would he would motion to love because brother Braham said Faith worketh by love so here is Faith and he's calling to the one whom the Lord loveth and he says would you whom the Lord loveth with love would you with love ask him who it is amen when we climb this ladder of the Statue of a perfect man what is the goal what are we trying to get to what is the Capstone it's charity it's love and and and love i' say it like this love is not a virtue love is a person the attribute of love the person of God the person of Christ amen whom the bride came out of his [Music] bosom it's it's not if I could if I could say it without getting it wrong it's not like acquiring love it's almost like reconnecting with love it's almost like love coming back together amen amen so now Jesus he laid in jesus' bosom one of the disciples Simon Peter therefore beckoned unto him hey yeah asking that he should ask who it who it should be of whom he spake he then lying on jesus' breast saith unto him Lord who is it Jesus answered he it is to whom I shall give a soop when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the soop he gave it to judas's scariot the son of Simon and after the soop Satan entered into him then said Jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly what did what did John receive he received a private Revelation from Jesus Christ amen yeah amen that the other disciples didn't because it said the when he got up and left the other disciples the disciples around the table all wondered why he left and some thought it was to take care of some business and they didn't even know why he left amen but Jesus said one's going to betray me and they all began to be concerned who it would be and Peter says Peter knew John could get it from Jesus how did Peter know that and John who is on the breast of Jesus he's embraced with Jesus he's connected to Jesus he's over the Heart of Jesus and he says who is it and Jesus says whomever I dip the so and hand it to and then he just dipped the so and handed it to Judas amen you know what there's going to be an antichrist and Judas was the Antichrist amen but the Antichrist was right in their midst and nobody knew right in the church amen right in the church was the Antichrist and nobody knew who the Antichrist was but John received the revelation of how to identify the Antichrist and this bride in this day has received the revelation of how to identify the Antichrist and everybody was confused about Judas but this this John was not confused about Judas because he had received the key to understanding who the Antichrist was not the name it's this one and this one but the key to understand and this bride has been given the key to understand Judas would eventually reveal himself is that true and after he betrayed the the Lord with a kiss they all then knew who the Antichrist was but there was one who got a key before he declared himself amen and we know that this Antichrist is going to Incarnate in a pope and he's going to he he is going to declare himself but before he declared himself there's already one on the bosom of Jesus who's already been told who that Antichrist is amen why because of love what Peter couldn't get John could amen why because of love amen amen praise be to God brother B says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed but God's great mystery what the Eternal God has had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given right down to his church what was once God God's God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her amen what is she she's in the relationship like John was yeah you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church he's letting her know the Secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife all right now look by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of God how is God now taking this little bride this little wife and he's taking her up next to him up close to himself he's embracing her and he's Whispering the love Secrets Earth not the flirters they don't get anything amen but this one that's the that that's the the recipient of his love and he says how is it coming how is this all coming by his grace and brother BM tells us in the in the message titled the message of Grace he said think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters you can't have Grace without having love so what is it that this great grace and favor that God now wants to whisper the love what where does it come from it's his love expressed it's his love his grace is his love so why is he Whispering the secrets because of love yeah you can't have Grace without having love they're twin sisters that's exactly right before you can have Grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't see so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters love and grace so if if you believe you're the recipient of his grace you are the object of his love because love and grace is Twin Sisters you can't have Grace without first having love so how is it he's Whispering these love Secrets by his grace because of his love why because John was the one whom the Lord loved and he got the secret again in Christ is the mystery God revealed he said but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it this mystery is only revealed to one yeah and that's his beloved bride amen she is what the object of his love She's the recipient of his grace that's why for me we can say you know once we once we're able to realize that God has given me a revelation of this messag amen all of a sudden every fear and anxiety and every worry should vanish out of the window because nobody else receives this this is a special relationship this is Grace that's based on love and it only comes to the whom the Lord beloved it's only the whom the Lord love only those who are drawn up close to the Lord and lying on his breast are the only ones that get these secrets and if all of a sudden he's going to reveal these secrets to you and your heart is going to open and you're going to say I don't know that I can intellectually understand it but something in my heart is exploding right now that I know that what that Prophet is teaching is nothing but the truth amen and all of a sudden you realize you should realize you're a recipient of that Grace that only the bride gets these love Seekers this Revelation is only given to one girl it's not given to the flirters it's not given to the rest of the town it's only given to one and it's the one that he's drawing up close and Whispering the secret that's the one he [Music] loves praise God I want to I want to look at this in the Book of John so if you could just bear with me I want to go through a little quick Bible study if I can amen and let's let's look at Matthew let's turn to Matthew we're going to go we're going to go Matthew Mark John Matthew Mark Luke John we're going to pass through those and I want to look because I want to I want to show you the same story told it in three different places and I want you to see how the Revelation is different to John so Matthew 26 let's start there Matthew 26 verse 6 so Matthew 26 and6 now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an albaster box very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor so this is the principle this is the story where this woman anoints Jesus with this fragrance and and they think it's a waste so let's pick the story up now in Mark Mark 14 it's going to be the same exact story Mark 14 and verse three and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of nerd very precious and she break the box and P it on his head and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why has this waste of this ointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 p and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her got it same story let's go to John 12 John chapter 12 and let's look at verse one then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead and there there they made him a supper and Martha sred but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikner very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then said one of his disciples Judas a scariot Simon's son which would betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a th and had the bag and bear what was put there in same story told three times what's the difference the difference is John has a special Revelation where everybody else knows somebody said something but who is it that said it when he come under the eagle anointing amen the one he loves he said it was Judas the scariot there's no more mystery of who this mysterious group is or who this mysterious person is and when we get into the seals now there's no more mystery of who the souls under the altar are we know that they're Jews who are these 144,000 in Revelation 7 who are these white robed ones who are these two witnesses amen John under the eagle anointing the one who the lord loves he gets the special Revelation and when nobody else gets the name he gets the names who's in Revelations 11 everybody argues but the bride knows it's Moses and Elijah amen who's this that's under the altar crying out how long oh Lord and the white robes were given they're the Jews amen amen from the time of Christ all the way through they're the Jews amen praise God Amen in every other age under every other anointing it's a Myster mystery yeah there was somebody who said this yeah there's somebody under the altar yeah Somebody's Crying Out yeah there's two witnesses yeah they're there we know they're there but who were they it's John who knows who they were cuz it's the bride who knows who it is praise be to God why oh my goodness brother B says in the fourth seal now when the lamb had opened the fourth seal sto there and there on the fourth seal now who opened at the lamb was anybody else worthy no one else could do it the lamb opened the fourth seal and the fourth Beast the living creature Like an Eagle said to John come see what the fourth mystery of the Plan of Redemption has been hid in the book cuz the lamb is open and in other words what he was saying here's the fourth mystery here and if we go to revelation 6: seven I'll just read it to you says and when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast what's that eagle come and said come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed after him amen what's so significant about this because under the other anointings there was other horse riders amen but it never tells you who the horse rider is a white Rider went on a white horse one went on a red horse one went on a black but under the eagle anointing he gets a name and his name is death and Hell follows after him why because it's under the eagle anointing now what was laying there as a mystery is now unveiled they knew there was a horse rider but it looked like could it be three different Riders amen a rider on a white than a rer no but under the eagle anointing the prophet comes say it's been the same Rider all along and it's the Antichrist and he's moved from White Horse to Red Horse he got off the red horse got on the Black Horse and he got off the black horse on the peir horse but under the ministry of the fourth Beast under the anointing the the Holy Ghost anointing over the church through a prophetic Ministry which is Eagle anointing he now tells you who this has been all through the church ages what Matthew couldn't tell you what Mark couldn't tell you what Luke couldn't tell you now under the eagle anointing under the ministry of John the bride now you can know it's Judas a scari he's the Antichrist he's the horse rider he's also the one that will portray Jesus betray Jesus Christ amen I hope we're not just seeing John I hope we're seeing ourselves let's go back to Matthew 26 let's do this one more time because it's fun you know when brother B says when he opened those seals he opened the entire Bible right it's going to take us the rest of our time on this planet to keep unlocking what was opened under the opening of those seals and I don't think we're going to come to the end of it I think we're going to still be discovering as we move on Matthew 26 verse 50 this is Jesus when they come to arrest him in the Garden of Gethsemane verse 50 says and Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear somebody cut off somebody's ear now we know it was somebody that was with Jesus and somebody that was a high priest servant that's all we know let's go to Mark 14 so we went from Lion now we're under the ox anointing we're moving through the church ages Mark 14 verse 46 Mark 14 and 46 and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by Drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear it's Ox anointing let's go to Luke Luke 22 Luke 22:48 but Jesus said unto him Judas betray us thou the son of man with a kiss when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him Lord shall we Smite with the sword and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear it seems like through the church ages we keep getting the same information on the seals we know there's characters we know there's actors we know something about them we know some information one that was with Jesus and one that was among them and one that came and one was a servant of the high priest and we know that there was a sword and we know he's got his ear cut we know we know the symbols we know all this information but we don't know who it was but let's go to John now John chapter 20 I'm sorry John chapter 18 John chapter 18 and verse 10 then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and smokee the high priest servant and cut off his right ear the servant's name was malcus amen not through the church ages but under the eagle anointing amen under John John got the Revelation John declared the Revelation the the book that's the Book of Love brother B said this is the St John this is the gospel of love and he's he wrote the Epistles of love and he's the Apostle of love the disciple of love the recipient of love the one whom God loved and this book is under an eagle anointing brothers and sisters this is where we're at this is who we are this is identifying what age we're in and who we are now we know it's Moses and Elijah that'll take the gospel to and and it will be after the church is caught away and we know who the church is amen they're the ones that receive this love secret nobody else but only the bride will receive this love secret of the revelation of the Seven Seals and the Mystery of God being finished she's the one who's going to take the Rapture now all the rest of them who rejected or never had a chance to hear they're going to remain who's going to go in the Rapture who's going to go in Tribulation we know we can name them Mrs Jesus Christ is going up bride's going up church is staying we now can name it we can separate it we know who the false Vine is we know who the True Vine is we know who the souls under the altar are we know who the 144,000 are we know who the white robed ones in Revelation I mean my goodness it's so clear to me now no wonder brother Brenham was always reading out of St John oh praise God let's go to John chapter 20 now now can you identify with John let's let's look John chapter 20 verse one the first first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepil and seeth a stone taken away from the Seiler then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved who's that that's John the type of the bride and saith unto them they they have taken away the Lord out of the separer and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple that the Mystic ious one cuz the bride's been the mystery all the way through the book amen and that other disciple and came to the Seiler so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the Seiler and he stooped down and looked in and saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the Seiler and seeth the linen clothes and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also the other disciple which came first to the Seiler and he saw and believed amen for as yet they knew not the scriptures that he must Rise Again from the dead before they even realized or remember the scri scriptures they rise from the dead as soon as John who's a type of the Bride who's the Apostle of Love who's a special relationship with Jesus who's under an eagle anointing as soon as he steps in and he sees the napkin he sees the clothes Peter saw it it doesn't tell us what Peter thought but Peter went away but we know he doubted because he was unbraided by the Lord for his unbelief but when Peter looked in it said he believed he believed why there was something special in him that could believe just upon seeing the empty seple he didn't need he didn't need like Thomas to touch this the the the prince in his hand and thrust his hand into his side when he saw that Seer he believed belied amen why I'll tell you why cuz Faith worketh by love he was the recipient of love he was the special object of Love which gave him a special Grace and he believed because Faith worketh by love God we love him because he first loved us it's reciprocating his grace is bestowed upon us because he loved us we have the capacity to receive the truth by grac and Grace is love am we're in that special relationship with Christ let's go to Revelation 21 Revelation 21 verse three Simon Peter saith unto them I'm sorry John 21 what did I say to me John and Revelation about the same thing anyhow anymore it's all coming together as one let's go sorry John 21 I turned the page once and I heard a lot of turning I said something is bad wrong these folks have big Bibles with big print John 21 verse three Simon Peter saith unto them I go fishing they say unto them we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus said to them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast thy net on the right side of the ship and you shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of the fishes therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved amen you see the pattern that disciple whom Jesus loves saith unto Peter it is the Lord he was the first one that could recognize the Lord why he was in the he was in a Covenant of Grace he was in the relationship of love he had laid in the bosom of Jesus Amen there's something special about John and there's something special about the Book of John amen amen amen I just personally believe that the Gospel of John is the bride's gospel amen God so let me keep on reading cuz this is really interesting therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter it was the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he G his Fisher's coat unto him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea you see Peter has that Burly bold Faith that'll just launch out and just take it amen but he needs something to help that faith and what does he need love because Faith worketh by love amen this is why this is why Peter and John were going to the gate beautiful amen one day and and and you know what John never speaks when when you see all these encounters with Peter and John and Peter and John and Peter and John John's hardly ever speaking when they go to the separer he stands he looks in stands back let's Peter go first but after Peter he goes down and he sees and he believes now when Christ comes on the scene here in at the at the lake amen now he says it is the Lord and when love identifies the Lord Faith goes in action and jumps overboard and swims the land faith and love Faith worketh by love John Peter didn't heal the blind man without love love love may not have been the spokesman that day but love was there amen with faith amen praise God let's go let's look at verse 20 here in the the same chapter chapter 21:2 and before we read that I want to to take you through a little um a little discussion that Jesus has with Peter now Peter swims to shore I mean Peter absolutely loves the Lord but he he swims the shore he's a type of Faith he comes to the to the land and now Jesus starts looking at Peter and he asked Peter three times Peter do you love me Peter do you love me what was it Peter needed what was it Peter was missing what was the missing ingredient in Peter Peter was bold Peter had Faith Peter could take the bull by the but what Peter needed was love amen after he had had Faith after he could receive a revelation amen of who the from the father of who Christ was in Matthew 16 what did he need he needed love and he says now he begins to question him Peter do you love me and he says Lord you know I love you feed my sheep Peter does thou love me more than the and he was grieved he said you know I love you he said feed my Lambs he's now beginning to tie Peter down by love amen and love will have Peter living for others because living for others is looking heaven in the face serving Christ and his sheep serving his people is the expression of love and what Peter needed was to come in contact with love and be tempered by love and be moved by love because Faith worketh by love Peter had dogmatism he he knew that this was I mean even after they all left and Jesus says will you go also he says uh where to whom shall we go thou alone have the word of life and we believe and we know that that that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God he had Faith amen but that Faith was cutting people's ears off trying to kill them fighting over who was the greatest in the Kingdom amen disputing with Jesus Christ himself whether or not he'll suffer amen Faith was was was doing a lot yeah but it needed to be tempered by love because Faith worketh by love don't you love the word of God don't you love the scriptures how uh for years these have been separate pieces but it's all coming together and painting one pie picture verse 20 now after Peter goes through this questioning Jesus tells him when you're older you'll go where you don't want you'll led by those who lead you where you don't want and he starts to talk about his crucifixion how he'll die and then Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper we know who that is yes and said Lord which is is he that betrayeth thee that's the one that we're talking about now Peter seeing him saith Jesus Lord and what shall this man do and Jesus sayto him if I will that he tar till I come what is that to thee follow thou me why because John's the type of the Bride amen he's going to be there till the coming of the Lord that's so beautiful this scripture has a dual purpose a dual meaning and we'll discuss that in a meaning but he says if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad among the Brethren that the disciples should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true who testified to the well look at the top of the page John this is the Gospel of John the Epistle of John this is the one who wrote these things and T and we know that his testimony is the truth why because he's love he's under the ego anointing and he knows the truth amen and can testify of the truth in Revelation chter 4 brother BM said Peter said what are what are what are you going to do with him that fellow that's going to happen to him he said what is it to you if if he sees me coming and he let him live to see it after the rest of them was dead and gone John lived to see the coming of the Lord rehearsed in power the whole scene set from his time until the judgment is over and the Millennium is issued in John saw every bit of it and the Millennium over and the kingdom age started so he keeps his word doesn't he amen he says what if I amen and they misunderstood it and they made it a natural thing and it was going to be a spirit spiritual thing and John was there Amen on the aisle of patmas and he was caught up in the vision he was there amen between the church ages and the tribulation and their door was open in heaven and he heard a voice say come up hither and he got he come up higher and he saw the lamb take the book he saw the seals come off the book he he heard the seven Thunders he saw amen the tribulation period he saw the Battle of armagan he saw the Millennium set and he saw the new heavens and new earth descend why cuz he's a type of the Bride why I'll tell you why oh my goodness I got two more scriptures a couple more scriptures I want to get to oh I want to get to this one let's go to this one right now let's go to First Corinthians sometimes I just don't know how to express it all 1 Corinthians 13 this is why he says this to me this is just the way I catch things 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I can move mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing everything else will fade away but charity is going all the way to the end and here is Peter talking Faith talking about love where what if he endures why because faith is going to make it or love is going to make it all the way to the end and Faith which worketh by love will go all the way to the end too but it's going to take Love Without Love it's nothing amen but with love it will endure praise be to God Amen now let's turn together to Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chap 10 and verse 8 this is after John here's the seven Thunders John has got the revelation of the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries revealed in the Seven Seals and he's already heard it John knows it he heard it he was going to write it but he was told to seal it up but John has already received the revelation of the Seven Seals which are the seven Thunders and after he got that Revelation he hears a Voice verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went to the angel and I said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand now listen this is the same book brother B says in Revelations 5 was sealed with Seven Seals and no man could touch it nor look upon it nor read it same book and brother says the book of life is it's the title deed of all Redemption it's the marriage certificate it's the Bible it's the revelation of the mystery of God that book in Revelation 5 is sealed in Revelation 10 the mighty Angel comes down with an open book in his hand and now John is told to go to that angel which brother bandam says is Christ to go to that angel and take that open book that's been unsealed and not just take it but to become one with it to eat it to bring it inside of you brother B said don't just come this far and say I believe the message you take the message you take it into you amen you feed on it and you become one with it and you identify with it and it'll be sweet as honey in your mouth why because when you receive the revelation of the word it's absolutely thrilling but when you go to live it it's the same life Jesus Christ LED it's rejection and Scorn and ridicule and misunderstanding but then he says verse 10 and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations tongues and Kings prophesy again what anointing is John under the eagle anointing which is the prophetic anointing here's what brother Brenham says back in the message as the eagle stirs her neck asked said no sir Papa Eagle they look just like him they believe the same thing he does they look like him yes sir they're made like him they're built like him and he knows they're genuine Eagles oh my that's what God wants genuine Messi yes he is messiah messiah is the anointed one and we are his children which which have a lesser anointing as Jehovah Eagle is Great Eagle and we're eaglets he's Messiah and we with the same anoint oting are Messi amen anointed Messiah means the anointed one are you anointed amen what with the same spirit that he is Anointed with we have it in measure he has it without measure he was God manifest in flesh we are sons of God parts of him coming on what is it take the book take the open book take the revealed word take it into yourself Beed on it eat it eat it all up amen take all of the message in and become one with it digest it let it become you that's what happens to our food our food becomes us amen eat it until the message becomes us until the message starts to manifest in flesh our food when you go and eat food that food is going to come into a fleshly manifestation is that right it's going to make cells it's going to make hair make blood cells it's going to it's going to move your body make Muscle why the food is coming the manifestation this message has to come to a fleshly manifestation but in order for that to happen you've got to take the book from Christ and you've got to eat it up amen amen why and then prophesy again why you mean prophesy again this doesn't mean that we're all going to have prophetic Ministry that means we're under a prophetic Ministry we're under an eagle anointing and we're going to prophesy again means to prophesy what's already been prophesied we're just going to say what the prophet says amen cuz the prophet and the bride and the spirit will be saying the same thing am do you see your ident identification with John John's a type of the bride and a special relationship with the Lord now I want to look at just a couple things and we're finishing with this that brother Brenham said just one this this one time he says this he says it many times but I just pulled one quote he said John after we returned from the aisle of patmas out in the aian sea only thing he could say was little children love one another he found there was something real what did this experience on the patmas island do for him what happened on patmas he got the Book of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ was unveiled to him the opening of the seals the end time Mysteries the events the mystery of God fa he got all of it yeah and when he came back from that experience what was his main message love little children love one another why because God is love and they that know God know him our love he had come into something real love brings Revelation what brought Revelation to John special Revel ation none of the other disciples got special Revelation in the Book of John that none of the other gospels what was that it was love because he was the one whom the Lord loved amen so love brings Revelation because we receive these secrets by Grace but Revelation brings love God because when John came back he wrote the Epistles of love the most important message that he had was the Capstone amen charity without love it's nothing Faith to move mountains all knowledge to understand all Mysteries this is what Paul declares but if I have not love it is nothing amen John had re received the same Revelation he had seen he had seen the church ages he had seen the coming of the Lord he had seen the battle of Armageddon he had seen the Millennium he had seen it all and when he comes back the main message that he preaches is just love each other when it's all said and done everything have come out of that great resource of love and everything goes back to that great well of love and it's all about love love brings Revelation and Revelation brings love so I can't seeing Revelation bringing contention and dispute disagreement and hostility it didn't do it with John amen that's way Peter was when he had faith without love but Faith worketh by love it wasn't that Peter didn't have faith but he had to be brought into something else and he had to be United with John and him and John after the after the uh after the resurrection of Jesus Christ in the day of Pentecost Peter and John had to work together brother br says in the message desperations says now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in Galatians 5:6 that Faith worketh by love Faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is lov's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now if you don't have love you can't have faith what was what was God's incentive to do all of this for us love what is our incentive to believe God and give ourselves love it's a reciprocating love amen what brings the Revelation to our hearts God's love pure and simple it's God's grace which Grace is a twin sister to love why do you see what you see because of love because of his love for you why is the book open to you why does the message seem to resonate in your heart why don't you stumble over why can you accept it when thousands can't accept that God sent a prophet thousands can't believe Millions can't believe that the seals are open they can't recognize the coming of the Lord why for you it's not a problem why because that's his love to you that's Grace and if you're a recipient of that Grace and that love amen then the reflection of that of getting caught up like John was caught up to go through the open door to see the opening of the seals to understand the Thunders and see the sequence of all the way to the end time and I believe that's what we've been given in this day amen by the opening of the seals and the message after everything has been declared to the bride she has seen from before the beginning to after the end and what does that Vision produce it produces the Apostle of Love who writes the Epistles of love and when he gets to the point he can't preach anymore he has one message amen he'll sit in the corner of the church and when he's asked to testify he'll say the same thing every time little children love one another Beautiful cuz everything else will come to not and prophecies will cease everything else will eventually be finished but love charity Will Never Fade Away praise the Lord amen I'm so glad that I can say by his grace that I'm a recipient of his love I can see myself in the Book of John I can see myself in the Apostle of love not because of my great love for him but because of his great love for me what does it do in me my goodness when it all comes down to the end I I mean the end end end I'm not going to care that I want an argument Right In fact when it comes down to the end then then I might be pretty embarrassed I won that Argent right right because of the way I want it yeah comes all down to the the end I want to be like John I just want to love everybody God will sort it all out I don't have to sort it all out it's not up to me I just want to declare this great truth he's told me who the Antichrist is I know John could write it John could speak it John know and John wasn't afraid to say who cut the ear off and whose ear got cut off and who the 144,000 is and who's under the altar who the two witnesses are and who the bride is and who the foolish virgin is and who the false amen he just had the truth but he wasn't arrogant and hostile he just says just love everybody and just love each other God will sort it all out amen I'm only here to prophesy again not here to win arguments and I'm certainly not here to convince people amen that doesn't work I'm just here to prophesy again and whoever is a recipient of his love will connect to the word and they will reciprocate his love amen and I'm so thankful for the love of God let's all stand musicians if you'll please come I hope that God help put those pieces together CU It All To Me the more I study the scriptures and the more the message opens to me everything links together because you know what the word is it's God it's God do you know what love is it's God amen you know what Christ is he's God you know what the bride is she's part of the same thing when it all comes down to it it all comes back to one thing and it's just God it's life it's love it's the great Fountain of everything in the end it all comes back to the same thing expressed in a family man there's nothing else to strive for but that we're going back to the original amen and that's all I want that's the desire of my heart but I can see myself so clearly in the scriptures like never before I can see what time what age what gospel what anointing what love that we're aligned with praise God Amen praise be to God I tell you if you're here and maybe sometimes things are a struggle for you don't feel like you have the revelation of the word listen let me tell you it's not just a bunch of intellectualism brother B says it is an understanding you have an understanding but that doesn't mean you have to understand all the 10,000 puzzle pieces in detail but what you need is God to show you the picture amen the picture on the box amen that makes all the pieces make more sense amen and listen I'll tell you the secret this is I'll just put you in a little secret just lean on his bosom and say would you show me the picture don't fret don't fuss don't don't try to go out and get a bunch of understanding don't don't strain don't make your brain cramp yeah don't do it just lay on his bosom that's right in that special love relationship with him get really close to him and say I can just imagine John if you're laying on somebody's bosom your head is down here so when Peter beckons to him and say ask John would just you know when you look up at somebody it's kind of pitiful it's not arrogant it's not demeaning it's kind of and won't you just get up close to the Lord and just give him that look and say Lord Jesus would you show me the revelation of this would you reveal yourself to me listen it's his great desire to do it when John asked him he said immediately there wasn't we don't have any notion in the Bible that he thought about it it took him 30 minutes and he just said whomsoever I dipped a sof and hand and then he dipped the sof I mean it wasn't complicated let's not make it complicated let's just lean on his bosom and say if there's anything in the message that's stumbling you there's anything that you feel like you need to know better just lean on his bosom and say who is it would you show it to me and he will he'll give you the key of Revelation because it works by love brother Rim says faith is a revelation and Faith worketh by love so Revelation worketh by love it comes by love it worketh by love it's demonstrated by love thank God man let's just bow our heads and thank the Lord dear heavenly father we thank you God for you are so good to us Lord God when we look at John I don't see John at the Last Supper reclining with his head on your bosom is one that you love God somehow I'm able to see myself there God there's no way I could do that in my own flesh with my own ability with my upbringing and God it's only by grace that you allow me to feel that I can be in that place God I I want to take advantage of the love that you've shown to me and the great grace that you've given in my life Lord and I just want to recline on your book over your heart I just want to say Lord would you reveal more to me would you open more understanding would you show me more of your great drama your great picture so that I can see because God it was your pleasure it was your joy to give special Revelation to John I believe it's your joy to whisper the love secrets to your bride and God we're leaning against you now asking God would you whisper the love secrets into our ears so that we would know you better and would you bring a greater love a greater manifestation of Love out of our Lives give us the ability to love everyone sinner or Saint whether they love us back or not but Lord let us just be so grateful for the love you bestowed upon us help us just operate out of a position of Charity of love we love you father we ask that you would manifest yourself in us help us Lord to take that book and eat it up not to leave some out but to eat it up become one with it and give us the strength by love to have the faith to prophesy again give us the courage and the wisdom to share this message these truth just like your Apostle John did he shared the truth what what Matthew Mark and Luke couldn't he said what the previous ages couldn't say cuz it was veiled in a Ministry a mystery this bride can say it help us Lord to prophesy again we love you father we ask that you would help us and we thank you for your great love and grace that you bestowed upon us help us to live and operate by that love in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all brother Ben I want to live just the way he wants me
