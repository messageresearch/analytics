brother branham says in questions and answers on the seals he said all that's in the book holds that mystery the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you understand that now see the book doesn't say now leave fails to be saved in this church age ormond never or whoever know it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is now remember saying it's revealing the mystery while it's calling the names so as it's revealing the mystery it's calling you and revealing the mystery is calling you it's calling your name not not chad and not larry not bob not susie not any of these names it's calling the real you down on the inside it's giving the revelation of the mystery peeling back the mystery of god peeling back the mystery of christ and something in you says i reckon that's it that's me he's calling me i'm coming to him and she said master it's you oh and this day i want to ask you a question who are you looking for who are you looking for who are you looking for and what do you expect to see i'll tell you be looking for the one that can break the mystery and call your name look for the one that can open something up that that draws you and says that's the truth that's me that's my identity that's who i am that's the lord amen it's the lord that's calling me somebody will come to church and hear a preacher somebody will come and hear the lord somebody will hear a man speak a couple thousand words amen and get a little bit hoarse amen and then they'll go home and say those were good words and that that was neat how that come together but somebody else will go beyond the horse voice somebody else will go beyond the vessel standing in the pulpit and they'll say god was talking to me god was asking me questions god was identifying where i was at and god was calling my name
