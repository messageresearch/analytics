amen there are some that have had their eyes open and they can see him and they can see him where he is and they can see him in the form that he's in it's always the form that throws him off it's always the form that brings confusion amen but it's him just the same amen when they were walking with Jesus Christ on the road to Emmaus he the scripture says he appeared to two others in another form he was in another form their eyes were withhold and they couldn't tell who it was but it was the very same one amen it was the same person it was Jesus Christ began to speak to them and discern and share the scriptures with them amen until he broke the bread a certain way and their eyes were open they knew who it was and he was in another form and they couldn't tell who it was but it was the same one he was there amen praise be to God and when the Jesus broke the bread it didn't open their physical eyes it opened their spiritual eyes and they could discern who it was when he returned amen when he resurrected amen and Mary was in the in the garden looking for him Mary's looking for him amen where have you laid him she's looking for a dead corpse she's looking for the one that was nailed to the cross amen and here he is standing alive amen resurrected alive but she assumes he's the gardener Mary knew what he looked like amen Mary had been with him she had served him she had talked to him amen she knew what he looked like so he's standing here in another form in the form of the gardener because he is the gardener amen and he is the seed and he is the fruit and he's standing as the gardener amen and and she doesn't know who she's talking to she's asking the gardener where Jesus is and the gardener is Jesus [Music] where is Jesus he is Jesus but he looks like a gardener and she assumes he's the gardener she thinks she's talking to a gardener and she's talking to Jesus Christ some people that think they're talking to church members they're talking to people who believe a message but they don't know what's behind those people they don't know what this word is this word that we're giving is Jesus Christ it is him he is the word she said please sir tell me where you've laid him and I'll go get him and he said Mary when he called her by name she knew who it was she said rabboni Master amen and fell at his feet amen when he called your name all of a sudden you knew who this was that was speaking to you who's present who's here who was in that prophet and who's in The Bride amen amen just because multiples the multitudes don't seem doesn't mean he's not here when everyone sees him that's not the fearing that we're looking for that's not the coming and that is exciting to us amen although that'll be exciting amen because we return with him but the one that's exciting to us is the one that's going on now when he's coming and taking us in a Rapture and catching us away word by word by word until finally we make the final translation
