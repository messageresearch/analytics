========================================

do not discount the pure simplicity of the receptiveness of the gospel of jesus christ indicating your your marriage to him indicating your relationship to him indicating that he did love you indicating that he has chosen you that is the very basis and way that he expresses his love to you see you if you want all the flowery fillings and cloud9 fillings and whatever else that's fine you know i want more of those but that is not what my relationship is based off of my relationship is based off the fact that i have a pure understanding a proper understanding as the prophet said that god himself has chosen me and he loves me even when i fail him every day he loves me and i know that he loves me is because he has came by my way and he has whispered his love secrets and he has expressed himself to me and there is no other reason that he would express himself to me if he did not love me it is that simple don't discount it don't get confused in your mind because when you get confused in your mind about whether he loves you or not you will automatically start operating in a in a realm of fear and then you fall back on your plan and your works program let me know how that works out for you it'll bring more anxiety more depression more xanax that's what that would lead to but if you can simply come before him with a clear conscience and a clear acceptance acceptance that he loves me because he has told me he loves me you say well i've never heard an audible voice that he came down and says i love you listen to a tape [Music] you want an audible voice there's your audible voice listen to a tape and when he comes and he says good evening friends and something of you goes tell me more that's him telling you that he loves you because it's impossible for you to have that reaction unless he first loved you and chose you it's impossible many people may try to fake it many people may get the intellectual conception of it but i'm talking about a true marriage i'm talking about a true love for that word that when it cuts when it comes and it cuts and it slices and it dices and it strips you down raw you'll still come back to it and say give me more tell me more
