Lord that you have drawn us together again we thank you for your divine Grace your mercy your Plan of Redemption that's working in our lives God as we come now to this part of the service Lord where we look into your word we pray that you would give us eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to perceive for God unless you do that we can never do this on our own Lord but we're asking you to open your word to us that you by your own hand would break the bread of life that you would feed us as the Sheep of your fold God we're trusting in you we pray you take take the preeminence take this vessel under your control and Speak Lord your words and guard my mouth Lord not to say anything you don't want said but Lord may I release myself into your hands and I pray that you would take the preeminence now that you would work your work this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all while we're standing let's take our Bibles and we're going to go to the Book of Romans wanted to remind you too that this this um this afternoon will be our communion and feet Washing Service and so we'll have that this afternoon and then also we'll have the annual vote this will be for the trustees and Sunday school superintendent and that'll take place right at the beginning we'll do that early on so you want to be here on time for that let's look at uh the Bible here in Romans chapter 9 let's look together Romans chapter 9 in verse 8 says that is they which are the children of Flesh these are not the children of God but the children of Promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and God bless you as you take your seats amen as you can see we're going to be continuing on with the same thought we've been on for a couple Services now and uh I I've got a title that I'll share with you after I read a quote here in just a moment uh but I just wanted to say that uh I read really really appreciated the Wednesday night service I hope you all who weren't here had the chance to listen to it it did me a world of good and and uh I the more I meditate on it the more I'm ashamed of myself Amen in the flesh we just have nothing to offer in the flesh there's just like like the Apostle Paul said that in me that is in my flesh is no good thing and I can't believe how many times that I acted like talked like felt like there was something something good when I should have realized there was nothing good there the only thing good is what God has planted on the inside and so we thank God for that we appreciate brother Ben yielding himself and surrendering to the will of the Lord so I feel like that's how we grow the way up is down and it was a good opportunity for us all to grow now as we look into this subject that we've been continuing on here with Jacob and Esau and me don't forget that we're looking looking at uh the the way that we're looking at this is Esau as the natural man or the carnal man or the outer man and we're looking at Jacob is the spiritual man or the Inner Man the the one that's predestinated and here it was uh it's we've read this scripture before but I just want to highlight a few things in verse 11 it says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that is such a consolation friends before they were born before before they had the chance to act out anything before they could have done good before they could have done evil before they could have confessed anything the right way or confessed anything the wrong way before they ever had a chance it says having uh be neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated my goodness before they did anything right or wrong before they were born before they did good or evil God had already declared let's go back to Genesis 25 and and pick up the story there that we've been dealing with we're going to spend a little time here in the uh Genesis 25 and 27 Genesis 25 and let's start at verse 21 in Genesis 25: 21 says and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter and a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob amen so we've been reading through these scriptures we understand them we've talked about this how how she finally the promise had come to her and she had conceived but but in the conception it was a good thing but in the good thing there was some turmoil going on within her there was a war inside of her and she wondered if it be so if if this is a good thing if I've conceived if the Lord's answered the prayer what is going on inside of me and that's when she found of the Lord that there's two Nations there's two peoples there's two different kinds within her and that explains so much us after the New Birth why are we under turmoil why do we have so much going on because there's two brother B said you can't be in two bodies at once but you can be you have two Natures at one time the old carnal nature and he says as long as you're in this flesh you're going to have an old stick sticky Cocker nature that that's going to bother you a amen but but we we went through all of that and looked at that and and we begin to that begin to come home such a reality for me that that is what we we are dealing with that is what we're struggling with that is really where our struggle is amen I don't really have a struggle with anything outside of me amen the struggle I have is inside of me and if I can win the struggle inside of me there's not going to be a problem outside of me amen it's never what happens to me it's always the way I react to it that's the problem and that's what God is watching for amen and we're constantly being tested in those things but God has given us enough word that we can begin to understand what's going on we begin to realize why am I struggling so bad why am I reacting the way I'm reacting what's going on and you realize that's the old nature that's the old man amen he's still struggling to live he still wants Dominion he still wants to rule but by the grace of God Amen the Elder Shall Serve the younger the new birth is going to conquer and win the day am so all these things begin to to give us understanding and now I would like to read this quote I've read part of it I'm going to go a little further in the last couple Services it's from 1960 in the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God he says these two boys if we notice their nature one of them was a spiritual man that was Jacob and the carnal man was Esau but they were both religious and that same thing has took place all down through the age the carnal and the spiritual I I want you to I would like to remind us that when we talk about the carnal and we talk about the spiritual we're not talking about the wicked and the and the clean living they're both religious that's the deception that even in my carnal nature amen because there's a desire to worship God it can act in a very religious way and still not be right and that's where the decep ction even within ourselves comes sometimes amen so he says both of them were religious that's the same thing as took place all down through the age the carnal and the spiritual Esau represents the man of the earth natural religious inclined but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb a past the things of the world the carnal things but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it Jacob one purpose Jacob had and that was that he longed for the birthright no matter how he got it it just so he got it and that Spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today and it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the carnal man the carnal believer no one could say they wasn't both religious they were they didn't say they that that one served an idol and the other one God they were both Servants of God oh it gets so close to home but he says now I love this he says it's coming to a head now now the spiritual believer in the carnal man I say it's coming to a head but it's coming to a head right here amen this is where Christ is going to conquer this is where he's going to have dominion and this is where the old nature this is where the the sin that was embedded into us at the fall this is where it's going to be conquered in Christ the word is going to have dominion praise God then he goes on to say now if you notice Jacob had one thing that he wanted because according to the word the blessing and the good things laid in the birthright and Jacob that was his only objective and the only thing he had in mind was get that Birthright praise God that's what we want to look at there there's a statement brother bam makes here that I want to take for a title he said but Jacob let me go back and read the whole sentence he said Esau represented the man of the earth natural religious inclined but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it it he never was in him to be able to climb past the things of the world the carnal things now when you talk about things of the world the carnal things brother vandom is not equating that to wickedness because he was a religious man but it was the natural the carnal the physical the fleshly things he can never climb past he says and I never climb past the things of the world the carnal things but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it and so for the the title I'd like to take it was just so easy for Jacob it was just so easy for Jacob and I've had such a fun time looking at this subject of why it was just so easy for Jacob amen this this came up in a conversation uh last Sunday around our table we were having some fellowship and somebody made the statement and it was something that stood out to me too this quote this part of the quote and uh I really didn't think anymore about it we talked about it but then it just kept rolling over and over and over inside of me until all of a sudden it landed somewhere I knew this is what we're going to preach because I got so excited when God opened the little picture for me you know Jacob when there was there was a war in the womb now there was a struggle going on but this is before either one had Consciousness Esau wasn't aware of what the struggle was about Jacob wasn't aware of what the struggle was about they weren't yet born but yet there was already something going on there was already the plan of God beginning to work and and there was already a struggle and then when Esau was born Esau was first and he came out first but but attached to his heel with his grip on his heel amen and and it they called him Jacob because Jacob means a planter but it also means one to overreach or overtake amen he had something in him at Birth amen before he could talk before he could think before he could reason before he could do anything there was some nature down inside of him that wouldn't let Esau get ahead of him he grabbed a hold of his heel and was hanging on for their life because why he wanted to surpass he wanted to overreach he wanted the place Esau had he wanted the birthright he wanted the firstborn he wanted he wanted all of those things he wanted it before he knew he wanted it praise God friends there was things that we wanted all of our life but we didn't know what we wanted we didn't know what was in us and what was driving us and why we were dissatisfied and why we could never settle down and there was something driving us why religion never quite hit the mark we tried churches and we tried different things try to live right and then fail and all we didn't know what was driving us what was in us but whatever was in Jacob when he was born was in us so here he comes out a heel Grabber saying no you're not going to get ahead of me I want the promise I I want the birth right praise be to God am mean he he longed brother B said Jacob his only objective the only thing he had in mind was get the birth right and the question was where did that desire come from why did he want it so bad what was in Jacob when Esau would so easily give it away when it came to his life or his Birthright he would take his natural life and give up his birth right amen why was it that Jacob was willing to go through any extent possible to get the birth right there was something different inside both of those boys it was predestination it was the predestinated plan of God it was the seed of God it was the thought of God it was the word of God that was driving those two boys it wasn't that Jacob was more calculated it wasn't that he was wiser it wasn't that it wasn't that he was more religious it wasn't any of that but there was something already in him that made him want that Birthright that's why he's holding on to that heel coming forth oh praise be to God brother bham says and there came there come Cain and made his offering he worshiped he went to church he's just as good as the next fellow Esau was the same Esau in his character was a better man than Jacob more of a gentleman he loved his father and the thing that he done but God chose Jacob so God didn't choose Jacob because of his character his nice attitude his beautiful physical features and he chose him before any of that manifest he chose him because we we learned in the message we chose him because Jacob was a part of him amen right so there was something that was always part of Jacob that Esau just simply didn't have there was something in Abel that Cain didn't have it was there from birth it was there from the beginning let's continue on and look here at verse um what verse do I want to look at uh 27 I'm sorry let's go to verse 29 and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I'm faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what prophet shall this Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swore unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright so we've we've looked at this and we see that Esau so lightly gave it up because to him the car he could never move past the carnal he never could go past the natural and for him the the the end of the carinal the end of the natural was death there was nothing beyond that that was the limit that was the barrier and when he come to the point of death he said well what good will a Birthright do me after I die but Jacob had something else inside of him he knew that birth right was everything it had to do with the word it had to do with Christ it had to do with eternal life it had to do with the promise to Abraham it had to do with everything was in that Birthright and how he knew it I don't know how he knew it but he knew it there was just something in him that knew it and craved it and had to have it and Esau could never reach past the carinal but it was just so easy for Jacob why because he already had the desire from the moment he was born before he was breathing before he took the breath of life he had a hold of that brother's heel and so now we see there was a prophecy and we read in Romans how before they were born before they had done good or evil that according that the purpose according to election might stand he said the younger Shall Serve the older and Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated he was chose they were chose from before the foundation of the world and now they come forth and they begin to manifest what's on the inside and Jacob he's got to have that Birthright but he doesn't know how to get the birthright because the birthright is going by the firstborn of the lineage amen so he's stuck in this conundrum he doesn't know and I and I wonder sometimes the thoughts that Jacob had how do I get the birth how how much did he contemplate how much did he desire it how much did he think about it how many times did he feel like oh if I would only been born first oh one minute earlier why why why not one minute earlier and all of these thoughts that went through his head remember all these Bible characters were men of like passions like we are they weren't a whole lot different than you and I they just lived in a different era and he's wondering how can I get this birth right what could I do and then he starts probably I'm just dramatizing but he would start to think you know Esau's a hunter he could have an accident oh Jacob don't think like that do you think he was a human being or not maybe while he's out there a roving band of nomadic Warrior oh stop it Jacob that's you know that's not right no matter how much he thought about it he probably couldn't think of any good honest righteous way to get that Birthright and he probably felt bad for all the thoughts that floated through his mind on the ways that he could get the birth right if he was normal like you and I all I can say is if I was in Jacob's position I would have been struggling with thoughts you may not have been but if I had that strong desire I would have been struggling with thoughts so so in all the contemplation and all the reasonings and all the battle within himself back and forth on how to get it he had to have it he knew that everything lay in that promise and and everything lay in the birthright and it had to do with the promise and the word and eternal life in Christ and everything was part of that Birthright and so now he's contemplating on how to do it and I just want you to see how easy it is for Jacob in order to get the birth right all he has to do was cook some lentils not even knowing what he was doing fixing himself a lunch fixing himself a dinner he was soting pottage and he was fixing himself lentils and all the a sudden the circumstan of Life had worked in such a way that Esau had been in the field too long and hadn't got the game he was after and he was in a weakened condition and he come and he find his brother with food and and Esau could not stretch beyond the carnal he could not value the birthright with the right value amen and when it come down to his life or the birthright who orchestrated this event did Jacob orchestrate this did Jacob work out these details did Jacob put this plan together no from the be before the foundation of the world God wanted Jacob to have the birthright God knew that he would have it he was born with the desire for it but it was God who worked out the circumstances amen he didn't have to go and he didn't have to do any of these other odd things all he had to do was sod pottage of all his surmising and of all his planning and of all of his conflict within he probably never thought I'm going to get the birth right by soting pottage by cooking lentils but God always knew that Jacob was going to have the birthright and God worked out the circumstance till Esau came to him he didn't go to Esau Esau came to him and when Esau came to him he said feed me I'm at the point of death and there was something inside of Jacob he could not create the opportunity but when the opportunity came his way he could seize it because he had the desire for the birthright amen and and you would think that's not a good brother he should have just fed him and those are all the thoughts I have but God was working this out this was according to God's plan God would put that desire in Jacob to do what you and I would think wouldn't be charitable it wouldn't be brotherly kindness it wouldn't be brotherly love but God worked these circumstances out and presented Jacob with an opportunity and when God gave him the opportunity Jacob grabbed a hold of it again he said sell me your Birthright and I'll feed you Esau said fine what's it to me if I die it don't do me any good anyways and so he swore him his Birthright right and Jacob fed him see friends for Jacob it was just so easy I don't when when we go down this road and we start talking about this I I don't want you to think I'm thinking for all of Jacob's life was easy he had struggles he had challenges but when it come to getting the birth right it was just so easy why because it was his for the foundation of the world it was his to have it was his to take God had put him desire in him and then God would work the circumstances out to match the desire that was in his heart amen this was God's plan not Jacob's plan let's go to uh chapter 27 now and it came to pass pass uh yeah uh Genesis 27 verse one and it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were them so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am I and he said behold now I am old I know not the day of my death now therefore take I pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go into the field and take me some venison and make me Savory meat such as I love and bring it to me that I may eat that my soul may bless thee before I die so now Isaac because Isaac loves Esau he wants uh he wants a reason to bless Esau and he asks Esau to go and get meat and make savory meat for him from Wild game and and that he would bless him and and brother R says and uh does God ever change his mind about his word from 65 he says now notice the natural always tries to type the spiritual but as in Jacob and Esau it will not work it will not it would not when it come to doing good works I believe that Esau actually was a better man than Jacob in the sight of man he tried to take care of his daddy he was a blind a prophet and all these things that he tried to do but yet Esau didn't think about that being just carnal work he thought he could get in by by what he done do something good for somebody this is what's wrong with the Esau and us is that we think by being good and being nice and following the rules and keeping the order and doing good to all people that that that's going to be enough that that's what it's going to take but it's going to take something a whole lot more than that Esau didn't he didn't think about that being just carnal work think could got he could get in by what he'd done doing something good for somebody and brother said which was all right but Jacob his whole soul was to get that birth right and that's what God recognized in him spiritually oh I it's so it's so amazing friends cuz we stand in the same spot today we've got this old Esau religious nature that thinks if I just if I look good and I do good and I show up to church and I've got everything in order and I do what everything's told to me then all of a sudden I'm owed the blessing I I'm going to fall into the no God doesn't owe us anything if we do all the most perfect works in the world we're still deficient for what we owe him it will never equal the balance you can be perfect almost every day of your life which we know is impossible when hybrid Fallen flesh but let's say somehow you magically are able through a a supernatural strength of will to perform his word perfectly you're still in debt at the end of that it won't equal anything there's got to be something else that God's recognizing and it doesn't mean that we're supposed to do wrong and we're supposed to do evil works that's not it at all but there's something else that God is looking for and when Jacob and Esau were living this life amen Esau was a better caretaker for his father brother B said he did more Works he was a better man he was religious and all of these things that the prophet tells us but God wasn't looking at any of that he was looking down deeper and Esau despised the birthright but Jacob's whole soul was to get the birthright his whole soul had to do with Christ his whole soul had to do with the word his whole soul had to do with the promise and he didn't care what he had to do to get it he didn't care what he had to look like or what people thought of him he just had to have it that's what God is looking for and that and that friends that came easy for Jacob Esau could have never put that desire in his heart Esau could want the blessing Esau could want a good life Esau could want God to shower him with praise Esau can want all kinds of things and he can want it badly we'll see here he did did want the blessing he wanted it with all of his heart he cried after the blessing amen but but that was the carnal part amen he wanted to be blessed in the land and he wanted God to give him blessings and keep him and watch over him and prosper him and all those things but but down in his heart he couldn't go past the carnal and get to the real depth of the spiritual but for Esau it was just so easy or Jacob Esau couldn't put himself in Jacob's position and he couldn't give himself the same desire Jacob has when we read in Hebrews I'm just going to uh quote this scripture to you Hebrews 11:4 says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it him being dead yet speaketh says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrificed than Cain not by works by faith it was more excellent because it was by Revelation and by Revelation he offered exactly what God desired and God was not looking at the works what Abel offered was a testimony of what Abel believed 1 John 3:12 says not as Cain who is of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil in his brother's righteous what made Cain's Works evil amen remember he slew his brother because his Works were evil so that mean the evil Works came before the slaying of his brother so you can't say his evil work was the slaying of his brother no he he had evil work before he slew his brother and what was his evil work his evil Works were he offered a god according to his own carnal desire amen he was a carnal believer he and brother B said he loved God he had a desire to worship God and and he worked towards his sacrifice amen but it was called evil works and when God came to him and his countenance was fallen and he gave him an opportunity just even without Revelation if he would just follow after his brother it would go well with him he could not humble himself to the true word of God because he was stuck on the carnal and he could never reach past the carnal level to the spiritual level even though God was allowing him just in a carnal way to follow the revelation amen but when Abel Abel he didn't strain listen I Abel wasn't working he wasn't straining Abel wasn't I mean Cain did all the work he he built a beautiful altar he buil brother man said build a beautiful Church hun Stone Altar and he had all the beautiful sacrifice he labored and labored and labored but Abel was doing nothing just just waiting and waiting and waiting upon the Lord why because he could reach forward Beyond the carnal into the spiritual because it was already in him to do so and listen Abel did not give himself a revelation who gave him a revelation God gave him a revelation and by faith and where did he get the heart to believe and where did he get the ability to receive Revelation what works did he did how hard was it for him listen friends for Abel it was just so easy for Abel to reach beyond the carnal to the spiritual it was already in him to do it all he had to do was wait on the Lord and when he waited on the Lord at some point in time God all of a sudden opened his understanding and by faith he knew the sacrifice to give and by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice amen and God testifying that he was righteous when was he righteous he was already righteous why because the righteous are able to receive Revelation because Abraham believed God God it was imputed unto him for righteousness so now no wonder Cain got so upset Cain worked and he labored and he strived to be a good boy to offer to God to have a beautiful worship he worked to be accepted he watched his brother do nothing day after day day after day day after day he did it looked to him like he was just not even trying it looked like he was putting forth no effort that he wasn't even trying and and and Cain I mean he he has a religious nature he has a desire to worship God he knows it's the time of the sacrifice is coming so he's under pressure to produce something for God and he looks at his brother and his brother seemingly doesn't have the pressure and he can't correlate these two so no doubt no no doubt Cain got in his mind how it was going to work on sacrifice day who was going to be accepted and who wasn't going to be accepted but Cain was in for the shock of his life when he offered everything beautiful and had it arranged just right and all of a sudden Abel comes along amen with a little Grapevine brother bam said wrapped around a little lamb and dragging it dragging it up to the Eastern side of e Eden right in front of the gate amen and he come dragging and bleeding and and brother M that didn't heue a stone out didn't do anything he rolled over A Flat Rock Amen threw the lamb down on it shoved his knee on it and found a sharp rock near him somewhere and started hacking that lamb to pieces and it was bleeding and and kicking and crying and dying amen it was a mess amen and when we got and when they got done I'm sure Cain was over here and all of his carnal religious religion looking at that and saying there is no way yeah that is going to work there is no way that kind of religion there's no way a amen because why he couldn't go past the carnal to the spiritual but for Abel it was just so easy he didn't have to spend money he didn't have to labor he didn't have to do all he had to do was go to the flock and grab a sheep and and bring a lamb along and and all the resources were already there yeah yeah amen no wonder Kan kan's countenance fell he was disappointed and he was discouraged and he was not understanding it this is the difference between the carnal and the spiritual believer these things still happen today friends I mean sometimes we in the message for so long and we serve the Lord for years and years and years and God will save somebody bring them in and all of a sudden before you know it they got Revelation upon Revelation and it's so easy for them and we're sitting there looking at how come it's so easy for you amen don't let that old carnal nature slip in right and say but I I've been here this many years and I've read this many books no just praise God that God found somebody else that can reach beyond the carnal amen it's so easy to slip back in to that old carnal nature so for Abel I think it's safe to say for Abel it was just so easy for Jacob it was just so easy why because it was already inside and when the time came they didn't have to strain they didn't have to press they didn't have to work when the time came all they had to do was receive Revelation and what Revelation they received the one that God gave amen I don't think Abel if I mean we know they didn't have a written bible in that day but let's just say they did I don't think Abel had to read his Bible through four times y amen and then deduce and calculate amen I think he was just meditating and God dropped it in his heart how hard was that how much work was that it's the grace of God now we come back to Esau his father loved loves him because he serves his father well and his father wants to bless him so he sends him after the Venison and let's look at verse 6 now chapter 27 and Rebecca spake unto Jacob her son saying behold I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother saying bring me Venison and make me Savory meat that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I command thee go now to the flock and fetch me from then two good kids of the goats and I will make them Savory meat for thy father such as he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat that he may bless thee before his death and Jacob said to Rebecca his mother behold Esau my brother is a hairy man and I'm a smooth man my father per Adventure will feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made Savory meat such as his father loved and Rebecca took goodly rayment of her eldest son Esau which were with her in the house and put them upon Jacob her younger son and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck and she gave the Savory meat and the bread which she had prepared unto the hand of her son Jacob now it comes time for the blessing the birthright has already been won without any effort from Jacob except soing pottage now it's time for the blessing of the father to be given and be passed down and he wants to give it to Esau but the the question isn't who does Isaac want to give the blessing to the question is who does God want the blessing to go to that's a good question you know Jacob never devised this plan Jacob never figured it out Jacob didn't even hear the conversation between Isaac and Esau he didn't even know what was happening Jacob was just living Jacob was just going on and doing whatever Jacob did on a normal routine this was his mother Rebecca she heard she developed the plan she called him and you she said here's what I want you to do this is the plan you're got to get that blessing now you go and get the kid bring it to me I'll make the Savory meat so he went and got the kid and brought and brought it to his mother his mother prepared the meat his mother took Esau's garment his mother put Esau's garment on him his mother took the goat skins and put it on his neck and put it on his hands she did it all and he was even worried about deceiving his father and said if per adventure and my father would find out it would bring a curse and not a blessing and she stood in the gap for Jacob and said let thy curse be upon on me Who provided this plan for Jacob this wasn't Jacob Jacob didn't do this amen God did this for him using Rebecca and even though he was doing something wrong and even though he was deceiving his father and lying to his dad he God provided an intercessor God provided one that would stand in the Gap Amen to preserve Jacob to keep the blessing Rebecca would stand there and say let the curse let your curse be upon me so that you can get the blessing how hard was this for Jacob I want to ask you how hard was it it wasn't hard it was easy his mom developed the plant his mom was going to be the Fall Guy everything was working to his favor why was it working to his favor because before they were born before they did good and evil God had said he goes and runs and grabs the kid brings it to his mom she goes to work she grabs the Garment she takes the Skins Jacob my goodness everything just Falls in his lap he walks in there amen and he begins to deceive his father I've brought your Savory meat I mean he didn't hunt it he didn't cook it look at poor Esau Esau's out in the field with a bow and an arrow he's stalking game he's hunting he may be getting rained on it may be cold he may be hungry himself he's got to shoot it he's got to gut it he's got to skin it he's got to prepare it Esau's working yeah I almost say he's working his tail off is that bad to say in the pull pit he's working Jacob's doing nothing I tell you being a predestinated child of God is the greatest privilege in the world the greatest privilege in the universe for all eternity there's nothing like it friends there's nothing like it it's God's choicing it's God pouring himself out it's God's family it's God's decision and God is orchestrating all the events and why do we just keep stipping into things why is it it just keeps happening to us how was it we bumped into the message why was it that all of a sudden out of billions of people on the planet we met somebody who would give us a message but how did that happen God was orchestrating that and how was it when Millions turn it away there's something down inside of you that would thump like that when you would read the word when you would hear the prophecy all of a sudden something in you would click and you would know that's nothing but the truth what is that that's not you it came so easy for [Applause] you we think it's hard because of the trials of life that's different than believing believing came easy Revelation came easy Revelation didn't come hard believing didn't come hard amen there's a lot of other things in this world that have come hard and that we've struggled with and Jacob had his own struggles but believing the word that didn't come with a struggle that didn't come hard amen that come easy wasn't just so easy for Jacob it's been easy for you and I praise be to God he goes with this deception to his father in verse let's go down to verse 27 26 and his father Isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son and he came near and he kissed him and he smelled the smell of his reignment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of the field which the Lord hath blessed therefore God give thee This Is Here Comes The Blessing therefore God give thee of the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let people serve thee and Nations bow down to thee be Lord over thy brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee and it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father that Esau his brother came in from his hunting barely got away with it no he didn't barely get away with it God was orchestrating the whole thing the timing was perfect you say if you got there one minute earlier the whole thing no it was all orchestrated by God brother BM said in questions and answers from 59 he says now look you here let me show you examples to be sure now we want to keep it in the scriptures while we're on this uh on these Spirits Esau was a far better man in every way you want to take it than Jacob was now Esau now he's going to talk about about Jacob he said God forgive me for this remark he's going to say some bad things about Jacob he was just a little sneaker that's all now you if you'll notice him what was he a little tattletail a big liar if I'm saying wrong God forgive me but he did lie and cheat there never was one like him hardly when he took them speckled sticks and even put them in the water to cause the pregnant pregnated cattle and sheep over there to bring forth speckled sheep and speckled cattle to get them on his own hands what did he do he put Esau's coat on him and a piece pie of sheep skin and everything else and went up there and impersonated Esau before his blind Father which was a prophet is that right why he was a little Shyer he really was he said I ought maybe I oughtn't to say to have said it that way see I don't mean it that way I'll take that back he he was I don't know you know what he was just think in your mind he he was a great man of God and I don't want to say anything bad about him but I'm just trying to point out little things that he did just look how sneaky he was a liar sure he was terrible but what was he trying to do look at Esau Esau was a good man moral a good church member today what did he do he was a hunter he went out course then that's how they made their living he'd take care of his herds for his father his daddy was blind a prophet the prophet of the Lord was blind and deceived by his own son a prophet Isaac through him came Christ you can call him Prophet Bible said he was and he was blind why didn't he heal himself and why didn't he know that that was that that was uh Jacob instead of Esau see God don't tell His prophets everything he just tells them what he wants them to know God was working out a plan then and he had to work in it if you'll submit yourself to God God will make you work right into his plan man starts to say he was a prophet he says why didn't he heal himself why was he blind why did blindness come to Isaac because God knew how to get the blessing to Jacob amen God was working the whole time why who what inspiration inspired Rebecca I don't know she was moved to come up with a plan of deception and she was willing to stand in the Gap and some times I wonder was it because she knew the prophecy when she inquired of the Lord is that what motivated her did she know that the promise was to the younger and that's why I don't know I can't say for sure but some way she was moved when she heard she instantly went into action and her plan was a good plan and it worked and the timing was just right the fact that she would say he'll smell his clothes here's a garment feel his hand here's the hair here's the Savory meat here's everything we need and it worked perfect you you know even at first amen Isaac wasn't even totally giv over at first when Jacob come in he he he talked to him and he says art thou truly Esau he said truly I am I am thy son Esau I've brought you the venison you asked for and he said come here to me and he smelled him and he F him he says thy hands are Esau's but thy voice is Jacob's but yet although he is suspicious God knocked out a suspicion why God was working a plan so that so that Jacob could just step into what God had for him yeah without work without strain just to walk into it let's go to Proverbs 16 together Proverbs 16 and verse 9 a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his steps I don't know about you but I had a lot of devising when I was young a lot of plans for my life a lot of directions I knew I would go and accomplishes that I make but I can tell you this a man deviseth his way in his heart of a man devises the way but the Lord directeth his steps my steps were not directed by my devising of my heart my steps were directed by God's predestinated plan let's go to Philippians chapter 2 Philippians chapter 2 let's read verse 13 in Philippians 213 it says for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure you know all the all those good works we take pride in that wasn't us it is God that worketh in us both to do and the will of his good pleasure if we ever if we ever keep the word of God it was the spirit of God in us amen anointing the seed that was in us to perform the word it wasn't us it was God and so we can't we can't take credit amen just because I mean just because I stopped sinning and I stopped a sinful lifestyle and I I turned to the Lord that wasn't me that was all him it was him uh it was him working in me both to Will and to do of his good pleasure I and myself would have destroyed myself let's go back to chapter 1 here in Philippians chapter 1: 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ who's begun the work he begun it who's going to finish it he's going to finish it who's the author of our faith he is who's the finisher of our faith he is amen we're not The Originators we're not the one doing the work he's the one doing the work the only thing we can do is surrender to him and the only reason we have a heart to surrender is because he's already put it inside of us hey guess what Jacob wasn't the only heel Grabber I was born a heel Grabber amen I was born an overtaker I'm not going to be left behind amen what I'm not going to miss out I'm not going to miss the birthright I'm not going to miss the blessing and where did that desire even come from it did not come from my parents it wasn't passed down genetically that is not where that desire came from that desire came from a seed Gene of God that he planted in my soul before the foundation of the world and knew that it would come forth in this season and then I I would be willing Amen to give up whatever Amen to have that word what was that that was him and no matter what desire we had no matter how much Jacob desired the birthright no matter matter how much it was in him to have it unless God orchestrated all of the details he would never have it it didn't it wasn't just wanting it amen it wasn't just the ability to receive amen that that had to work he had the ability to receive he had the right desire from birth he had something in him planted there by God Amen that was there but that wasn't enough because that alone still couldn't that still couldn't have the birthright on its own it took God not just working inside of Jacob but it took God working outside of Jacob to bring these two things together to accomplish God's purpose in his life and what did Jacob have to do nothing it just came so easy for him am oh praise God let's go back to Genesis 28 we find in Genesis 27 that when Esau comes in he's sorely disappointed he's so upset and hurt by what happened with his brother he vows to kill him after the morning of his father is over he he and then he weeps to his father and says father is there not yet one more blessing do you not yet have a blessing for me and his father said what more can I do I mean it's it's as if Isaac uh relinquished amen he realized this was God I've already given the blessing he has the birth I've already given the blessing what what can I do and he's crying out for more why because Esau is still relying on the carnal and he's still seeking the carinal he doesn't realize it's all over with it's all done he's got the birthright he's got the blessing you are a finished man you are not chosen he is chosen and you're not but he's still religious and he still thinks all the good works that he's done should equal something this is a carnal believer he's still thinking all that I did and the venison I got and I took care of you all these years and I've gone to church and I raised my family and I didn't lie and I didn't steal it still should be is there not yet a blessing and he doesn't even recognize he's a finished man he's outside the promise the promise of Abraham doesn't belong to him anymore he's not in the lineage of Christ he's no longer part of the word but still crying for his not not that the birthright not to forgive me but just bless me yeah yeah I do not want to be that kind of believer amen I want to be one that strives for the word for the reality for the promise for the spiritual things God God loves the bless his children we know that and God will shower and has showered and I believe will continue to shower blessings upon me but if he doesn't shower physical blessings on me that's not what my heart is Desiring the most I'm craving eternal life I'm craving Christ I'm craving the reality of God that's what's in my heart that's what I've got to have whether I'm comfortable in this life or not comfortable in this life whether I get corn from Heaven whether the Dew of Heaven falls on me and the corn of the land makes me fat whether all of that works out or not I have got to have eternal life I've got to lay hold on Christ himself and where did that desire come from it didn't come from my lineage and my natural lineage that comes from God so after he finds out that Esau Jacob finds out Esau's threatened his life and he's angry he flees and his mother comes and works another plan when I really started looking at it I realized how little Jacob did now his mother's going to try to save his life because his brother wants to kill him so she goes to Isaac and says Isaac I these all these girls around here Vex my soul none of them's good enough for our son why why don't you send our son back to my country and so that he can find a wife and Isaac said that's a good plan and and and he doesn't realize amen that God is still working she's not being straightforward with him she's not being completely honest Isaac now brings Jacob in and blesses him and sends him off to find a wife that wasn't Jacob's plan that was God's plan now Jacob leaves and he stops and he's tired let's go to chapter 28: 10 chapter 28 verse 10 and Jacob went out from berseba and went towards Heron and he lighted upon a certain place and Terri there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of the place and put them for his pillows and lay down in the that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father the god of Isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou go whe whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of and Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven Jacob was running now from the threats of his brother he was sent by his father to go find a wife and in the route he gets tired he journeyed as much as he can Journey that day and he just happens to stop in a certain place and this is going to become bethl which means the house of God before that it was L Lu Z and he just stops there for no reason he just stops there and he lays himself down and while he's laying himself down all of a sudden in the dream Heaven opens what did Jacob do to earn this dream right and all of a sudden he sees a ladder amen coming from Heaven to the ground and Angels ascending and descending on the ladder and all the sudden God speaks from heaven and God says hey I'm going to bless you and I blessed your father Abraham and Isaac and now the promise I promised to them I'm promising to you and by the way whereever you go I'm going to be with you and I will stay with you all the the way until I bring you back into this land I'm going with you and I'm bringing you back into this land and my promise is on you and I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you and I'm your God and you're going to get the promise and you're going to spread out of their land and you're going to become as dust and what did Jacob do what did Jacob do he did nothing he laid down to fall asleep and when he woke up he said surely this is the house of God and I knew it not I didn't even know where I was laying down I had no idea this was a special place I just laid down to sleep and all of a sudden God came God opened the heavens God spoke the prophecy praise God and we think we found the message and we found the truth and I was a seeker and I was a Searcher and I was looking for this and I was looking for that you know what we were looking for we were looking for the most convenient church that gave us exactly what satisfied us if we were seeking at all that's what we were seeking for we didn't find the message we didn't find I mean it found us what did we do what did we do amen what really when we think about what did we do to be witnessed to what did we do to hear something just a some strange way we heard something we heard a name or somebody mentioned something or or how did it happen I mean how did it happen that we just decid to go this way one day and we heard this or we we took this job and met a person or we we went to get a haircut from a certain Barber amen or we looked up an old phone book and found a church I mean how does this happen how hard is this how much work does it take it doesn't take work it takes the predestinated plan of God to hunt out the seed of God and make sure that you you come into the house of God and you didn't even know it amen this I I'm in the the place of God and I didn't even know it and God's promising blessings He Knows My Name he knows who I am and he has a plan for me and I didn't even know it for Jacob it was just so easy he goes down to laan and finds a wife and we know there boy some trouble starts some trouble starts and you know he works and going to get a wife the wife of his choosing but his father-in-law pulled a little Switcheroo on him and he got the older daughter and then he had to work seven more years for the for the one of his choice and then we know all of these but then we know that he makes a plan with laan so he can start Gathering some wealth because he's been working for these daughters and he doesn't have anything and laan is is really uh he's pulling a good one on him and I think it's wonderful that God knows exactly how to train us Jacob was the one pulling all the little deals he was the master Shyer so who should he have to go to for a wife but the more Master Shyer sometimes God makes us face ourselves so he's got all these tricks but even in that God was blessing him remember when he comes to Laban and Laban comes hunting after him when he leaves he runs away and and he tells laan what have I done what have I done wrong you've changed my wages these 10 times you kept changing it and what would happen is they would make a deal that all the ring stri all the ring stri cattle the goats and the Sheep they would go to Jacob and all the solid colors they would go to laan then they started having more rest strength so then then laan would change and say spotted now it's spotted now you have the spotted cattle then all of a sudden they started coming out spotted yeah and he kept changing it but no matter what he changed it to God blessed the efforts of Jacob and it started producing so that Jacob actually laan's Sons started getting upset and the reason that Jacob knew he had to go is because the sons were getting furious because they saw that Jacob was stealing all their father's wealth and these boys were going to be left with nothing Jacob wasn't stealing it every plan they came up with worked in Jacob's favor I'll take ring strike okay ring strike no no no no I no now now you get spotted okay I'll take spotted and how was it that the birth rate just changed yeah God said I'll be with you withs soever thou goest it was time to come back into the land the circumstances the Press got so hard it was pressing him back to the promised land God was orchestrating that too when he goes running back laan gets angry cuz he stole away without permission and he ran and laan starts to pursue him and as laan comes near to overtaking him God comes to Laban in a dream and says you be careful about that boy say nothing about him neither good nor bad so when laan come after him with his servants Jacob couldn't defend himself Jacob couldn't do anything with his father-in-law God had already done it for him everything came so easy for Jacob I don't mean he didn't have struggles it don't mean he didn't have Strife don't mean he didn't have family tensions doesn't mean but when it really came to the plan of God everything just happened he didn't make it happen it just happened it's not what he did it's what happened to him now as he's he de God deals with laan Laban leaves him and now he's going on to the land and and they catch his word that his brother's coming with 400 I think it is or whatever armed men they're coming after him and and he remembers the old promise that I'm going to slay and and and he's frightened for his life and he divides his company into different arrangements and he goes by himself over the brook and when he's over the brook what should happen he's there in agony he's there in distress he's there in worry and and everything is is coming to a head now between him and his brother and he doesn't know what's going to happen and he's going to try to appease his brother with gifts but he doesn't know if the gifts will work and over here in this strain I mean he's in agony and no doubt he's pacing up and down by the side of the creek then all of a sudden what should happen then a man should appear Jacob didn't make that man appear Jacob didn't know where to go he didn't know what door to knock on he didn't know where to get help he didn't know where the rescue squad was he didn't know where to find God Amen but in the time of need God came to him Amen in the form of a man and he wrestled with an angel till the break of day and then he wrestled with that angel and the angel said let me go he said I will not let you go till you bless me amen and he reached down and touched the hollow of his thigh amen and it strength the sen you thereof so that from that day forward Jacob halted on his leg he had a different walk because he said I met God face to face amen how did Jacob go to that meeting how did he arrange the meeting where did he send for the itinerary what what what what office did he send an email to what door did he knock on he didn't have anything to do with it he was just moving but God had a plan for his life and as he was moving God would come down and God would come to him in his time of need and God would arrest him see how easy it was for Jacob what could he have done how could he have made it happen how could he have figured all of this out how could he have orchestrated his life this way he could have never done it on his own it was gone that's not just for Jacob that's for all of us sometimes we think we've really done something we haven't done anything we think well we've made sacrifices and we've left jobs and and we've made moves and listen we haven't done anything it's he that worketh in us both the will and the do of his good amen a man's heart devises his way but the Lord directed his steps Jacob didn't Jacob didn't figure out how to get the birthright he didn't figure out how to get the blessing he didn't figure out how to get his wife he didn't figure out how to save himself from his brother he didn't figure out how to change his walk he didn't figure out how to change his name he didn't figure out any of this God already had it figured out before the foundation of the world and knew every Junction of time that he would inject himself into Jacob's story to keep Jacob turning right when Jesus Christ was here he was he was walking by the Sea of Galilee and he needed disciples so he said I think I'll take some resumés and I'll set up a little table over here by the side of the market and we'll start doing open interviews because I need some disciples no he knew exactly where his disciples were he knew before he came in flesh where they were he knew who they would be and he knew where to find them so one day he's walking down by the fisherman cleaning out their Nets and he looked to Andrew and he looked to Peter and he says hey come follow me you know what the Bible says they dropped their Nets there was no interview process there was no debate there was no dialogue amen God knew where to find his disciples and what was inside of Andrew and Peter what was inside of those men they were working with their livelihood they were supporting their family no doubt they had obligations no doubt they had things they had to pay for they didn't know maybe how two meals later was going to come how they were going to provide amen but it didn't matter there was already something inside of them when they heard that voice say come follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men there was something in them that let them turn loose of the fishing that you realize that wasn't just dropping some cloth amen they were dropping their life they were dropping their livelihood they were dropping their ability to care for themselves what was in those men that gave them the ability to turn loose of everything they knew they were fisherman from the time they were babies their father was a fisherman their grandfather might have been a fisherman oh yeah something happened inside of them at the voice of the Lord calling when he called to them specifically and said you follow me something inside of them where did that come from he couldn't get the Pharisees to do that you couldn't get the the chief Elders to do that you couldn't get numerous other peoples to do that but at one word from this man they dropped their net and followed him he went down a little further and he saws the sons of Zebedee James and John and they were there working too and he said follow me they did the same thing they left their father they left their boat they left everything and followed him why because they were predestinated to follow them it wasn't their great sacrifice it was inside of them to sacrifice amen and he's a good God he puts inside of us am mean he worketh in us both the will and do of his good pleasure he puts inside of us a seed Gene of God to believe he puts inside of us ears to hear amen and then when we just do what comes natural for the seed to do then He blesses us for our obedience and it wasn't us it was him that's how wonderful the savior is that we serve he puts in you he worketh in you both the will and do of his good pleasure he directeth your steps he for ordained every Junction of time he put inside of you something to believe with and then when you believe and you surrender then he showers blessings in you for obedience What A Savior what a plan I tell you there's nothing like being a child of God there is nothing better there's nothing greater there's no accomplishment in life it's the greatest thing we will ever have ever will ever can ever experience it's God working in us it's God protecting us it's God leading us it's God defending us it's God working in us and then it's God praising us and showering us with blessings wonderful it's benefit upon benefit upon benefit upon benefit and we walk away from something like that and think we did something on and brag about it and tell people well I get gave up this to have this and I sacrifice oh my goodness I'm so tired of that esol nature I'm so I'm so sick of that one in me that's always trying to take credit for what God's done God did it beginning to end he foresaw before the foundation of the world he orchestrated all the events can you imagine can you imagine Jacob amen talking to the the the sons of laan over there his brother-in-law and he's over there bragging you should seen that trick I pulled on my brother Esau you know Dad he was a little suspicious at the beginning but I smoothed it out and we pulled off this plan and I wonder if he had the nerve to say my mommy came up with this plan and and I I never even thought of such a thing I had no idea the question is what would how would the conversation go later if it was us yeah right yeah I said and then I did and then he said and then she said and then I said and then and all a sudden it looks like it's a blessing for God to have somebody as wise as us and as gifted as we are that's the way we make it sound God's so lucky to have me cuz I figured this out and I said that and just at the right time I just said you know word fitly spoken you know as apples were gold God help us God help us help us to recognize how good he is to us how much he loves us and what he's done for us let's just surrender more and even the ability surrender comes from him Jesus says in John 15:16 he says to his disciples you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he may give it you he said I've ordained you you haven't chosen me I chose you and or ordained you yeah that you should go forth and bring forth fruit so I have already ordained you to manifest my life yeah and the fruit that you bring forth I've already ordained that it shall remain and if you ask anything in my name ask father anything in my name he'll give it to you amen can you imagine Peter coming to the end of his life and he starts to go through his achievements I brought forth fruit and that work that I did it remains to this day that wasn't Peter that was God said I've ordained you to bring forth fruit and I've ordained that your fruit will remain not because you did a good job not the church isn't still standing and going years after you founded it because you did a good job founding it because he ordained you to bring forth fruit and he ordained that fruit to remain when the whole world was curious about Jesus and not sure about his identity Jesus asked a question to his disciples whom do men say that I am they said some this some this some that and he says but whom do you say that I am and and Simon says Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God and he says blessed are you Simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you Peter couldn't brag about his Revelation it didn't come from him it came from the father it's amazing that Peter after he'd be chosen by God he didn't choose himself God chose him God gave him the authority and the power to cast out devils he sent them two by two and he he ordained them and anointed them with the power to go forth and told them exactly what they do and they went and did it exactly like he said and it worked and they came back rejoicing that Devils were subject unto them they had meetings and campaigns and they were closely associated with Jesus until Peter's heart became lifted up and he became proud and he began to think that these were his achievements and that he was a good guy and that even if all forsake you yet yet I'll not forsake you he didn't realize every bit of what he had was the grace of God every work that he done was ordained of God his calling was ordained of God the ability to drop his net and respond to that calling was the grace of God Amen the fruit that he bore the casting out Devils it was all by God's word by God's grace by God's ordination it wasn't by his works and he gets to the point where he thinks he's such a good believer that even when Jesus says you all forsake me he said I'm not going to everybody else might but you don't know who you're talking to this is Peter the fisherman who's probably going to be the head disciple we've been talking about it on the side he's still stuck in carnality but oh praise God he had an encounter in an upper room one day after God let him fall on his face and realized what he was in his own and then God restored him amen by the by the seaside amen and then he he fills him with the Holy Ghost and he comes out preaching and we come to acts three let's turn there together and read this I love this Acts chapter 3 acts chap 3:1 now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an Al and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew that it was he which sat for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at at that which had happened unto him and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto them into the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel you at this or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power or Holiness we have made this man walk the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of our fathers had glorified his son Jesus whom you delivered and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but ye denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murmur to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of Life whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yay the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all Peter finally got to the place where he realized where it all came from and he says why do you look so earnestly on us as though we did something by our own power we didn't do anything amen amen oh I I hope we can get to the place where we can really talk like this am because I mean if if God uses you to open blinded eyes and you say the prayer and you lay the hands on and you touch the man who was lame from his mother's birth and he leaps out and goes running I mean I wonder how we would retell that testimony I wonder how we would say I wonder who would get the glory at the end of the day I wonder who would look like superch Christian after we told the testimony or can we tell it the way Peter tells it don't look at me as though I did something I didn't have anything to do with it this was all done and listen he didn't say it was done because I believe God I believe the word of God he said this is done by faith in his name now let's go back and look at it verse 15 and killed the Prince of Life God ha raised him from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yay now look at this the faith which is by him where did they get the faith to believe they got it by Christ Christ gave them the faith to believe it was faith in him and it was Faith by him praise be to God that's giving credit where credit is due you know how hard did Peter have to work to be called he was just washing Nets and Christ came to him how hard did Paul when he was Saul persecuting Christian how hard did he work to be saved and have an encounter with Christ he didn't work at all he was going on a on a h Carnage uh Rampage of persecuting the church and on the way Christ came to him appeared as a pillar of fire smoked him to the ground spoke to him sent him to a place where he would get the word sent ananas to him to speak to him the word and he says go thy way and tell him he's or go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and for Kings what did Saul do to earn that position nothing what did he do to become the the the great Apostle to the Gentiles what did he do to earn the right to to write most of the New Testament he didn't do anything amen he found himself called in Antioch that the spirit of the god came and they selected out Paul and Barnabas and sit them on a missionary campaign he went by the will of the Lord he tried to go to one city the spirit of God stopped him sent him somewhere else amen and directed his steps and he went all over amen and God added to the church such as should be saved amen amen what did Paul do nothing what did he do to write the New Testament nothing he just kept doing what God told him to do then he got arrested when he got arrested am me he was thrown in jail when he was thrown in jail he still had a concern for the saints that were out there and he started writing them letters he didn't know he was writing the Bible he was just doing as God directed him step by step Paul wasn't saying I'm going to write the Bible they're going to need a Bible amen for 2,000 years they're going to need to know what I taught he was directed by God he was led by God and that is not Paul's words anyways that's the words of Christ we hold Paul in great esteem but Paul was just doing what Paul was led to do and most of the time he didn't even know what he was doing he was just going along amen he was carried along sometimes amen even sometimes against his own will amen he couldn't take credit for his success he couldn't take credit let's look at one scripture let's look at acts 13 acts 13 and verse 46 in Acts 13:46 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and you judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation to the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed how many believed all the good ones the ones who really paid close attention to Paul and didn't squirm in their seat when he was talking the ones who were literate and had already read the Bible through now you know who believed the ones who were ordained to eternal life they're the ones who believed why did they believe because they were already ordained into eternal life God had put it in them to believe and he knew when this Junction would come and he knew that they had something in them that they could believe so would it be appropriate for the Apostle Paul to say they were greatly affected by my preaching and by my preaching 50 Souls gave their heart to the Lord no as many as were ordained into eternal life believed it was all ordained by God it was orchestrated his footsteps were guided and the ones that would believe when Paul preached were already determined before the foundation of the world at the end of the day all Paul really could say was Lord thank you for keeping me me thank you for helping me not to go astray and not to fall not to fail God thank you for your grace in my life and thank you for keeping me true praise God in Matthew 11 he says if you will receive this this is Elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear amen he that have ears to hear how do you get those ears to hear how do you get the eyes which can see and how do you get the ears which can hear what do you do to earn it what do you have to do do fast and pray do you go to church a bunch do you read a bunch is that how you get the ears to hear no those ears are predestinated ear there nothing wrong with praying there's nothing wrong with reading there's nothing wrong with praying for revelation but praying for Revelation won't produce Revelation if you're not ordained to Revelation brother B taught us to pray for Revelation above everything we should pray for revelation we should earnestly seek it more than anything but if it's not ordained for you to receive doesn't matter how much you pray for it you're not going to receive it because it's only for those who are ordained to receive it so even after prayer and God gives you a revelation it wasn't your Hour of Prayer that did it it was the ordination of God in your life and the ability for you to receive that doesn't mean we don't seek that doesn't mean we don't lay aside time we should do all of those things to quiet ourselves and get the flesh man put the put to rest but you realize at the end of the day it wasn't all your striving you didn't earn something you didn't finally come to a place through hours of prayer that you finally earned a merit badge and God said check check check he's now worked hard enough I'll bring a revelation yeah amen no we see Revelation hit the children of God all through the Bible and it was times they weren't working it wasn't they weren't laboring to receive it they were just walking along they were going down on the road they were washing their Nets they were doing whatever they were doing and all of a sudden they got blindsided by the word of God praise God let's go to Matthew 13 Matthew 13 13 Matthew 13:13 wherefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear I feel blessed friends they couldn't see they were blinded they couldn't see no matter how much they strained they would have never seen because they were blinded but blessed are your eyes for they see in the b in Proverbs 20 it says the hearing ear and the Seeing Eye the Lord hath made even both both of them I say thank you God for making in me a seeing eye and a hearing ear and a heart to perceive that's the grace of God brother Bram said I want to go back and read this part of the scripture here in verse 15 for this people heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes that they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes hear with their ears should understand with their heart and I should and should be converted and I should heal them so conversion has to do with hearing seeing and understanding amen and brother bam said in the patas vision when he preached the church ages he said now while we are talking on Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by Revelation and you can only be saved by Revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost he might say the pastor says so the Bible says so them are truths the church says so that's true but you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectuals amen so what does it take to be saved you have to have eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to perceive and understand you have to be able to receive Revelation on the word to be saved amen that's right how many have received Revelation on the word how did you get it it came so easy you just believed listen I I'm not saying that living a Christian Life is easy it's not easy it's hard but receiving Revelation is easy eating the book is sweet in your mouth living it is bitter in your belly it it may be hard to live it may be hard listen we don't we you know by the grace of God what our struggles what our struggles are our struggles are struggling with this flesh to Reign it in and bring it subject to the word we're wrestling with ourselves and we're fighting with a fallen world but to believe we're not struggling to believe that's just given to us of the father it comes so easy we just believe you know what started all of our struggles believing believing the word and recognizing I'm off the word and now have the responsibility surrender to the word and ask God for help and not let this flesh go astray and wrestle with it all the time and bring my thoughts subject to Christ and bring this body subject I'm struggling all the time like Paul was saying amen I'm tempering in all things I keep under my body lest when I've preached to others I should be a cast away he was struggling with himself but he was not struggling to believe amen right Abraham was struggling he struggled with the with the tensions with law he struggled with making a few mistakes he made a few missteps he didn't always get the word word right but he believed it amen he wasn't struggling to believe he believed it he may not have always acted it outright he may have took his father along he may have took law long he may have he may have backslid into gerer he may have lied to aimc he may have done all of these things but he did not disbel because it was given to him to believe and it was imputed unto him for righteousness because he believed we may not we may struggle with ourselves we may struggle to live we may have bumps and bruises and ups and downs and fail and faults and all of that and we may be really wrestling with ourselves all the time and really struggling and really groaning under the load groaning under our own flesh groaning under a world and a fallen condition but one thing we haven't struggled for is that's to receive revelation we didn't struggle to receive revelation we just received Revelation cuz he gave it the spiritual things was so easy for Jacob Esau couldn't go past the carinal but for Jacob it was just so easy why he didn't strain he didn't push he didn't fight he didn't pull amen when it was the appointed time God just made it happen amen let's go to John chapter 4 John chapter 4 is the story of a Samaritan woman Outcast of the Jews and she's living in Samaria which is not well thought of by the Jews and in Samaria she's living a vile life a compromised life and she's not well thought of with the Samaritans she can't work her way out of her hole she begins a dialogue with a man who comes by her way to sit on the well one day and start conversing with her he starts to tell her about a water she can drink that if she would drink it she would never thirst again a a water of eternal life and she starts to ask questions about the water and then she wants the water and then he says go get your husband and she says well I don't have any husband and he says you spoke well because you've had five and the one you have now is not your own and then she recognizes all of a sudden her eyes open and she says I perceive you to be a prophet you know why wasn't the Pharisees called him beah but she called him a prophet and then when she found out she was a he was a prophet she had a question in her heart and that question wasn't about her future or whether everything will come right in her life her question was how do you worship God I'm confused about religion I've been taught this Jews have been taught that the Baptists say the Pentecostals say uh uh the Catholics say but how how do you worship God and he begins to tell her how God wants to be worshiped and in spirit and truth and he's seeking such to worship him and then all of a sudden another little light bulb goes off on her and she says you know when Messiah comes which is called Christ he'll tell us all these things and Jesus looks at this woman and says I that speaketh to you and me and she just stands there looking at him and at the same time his disciples walk up and they're curious to why he's speaking to the woman but they didn't ask him and she's standing there for a moment and we go to verse 28 it says chapter 4: 28 the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and say to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ amen this is a woman who's been trying out religion she's she's not she's not a heathen Infidel because as soon as she comes in contact with a prophet she wants to know about worship this is a woman who was meditating on God this is a woman who wanted to worship God I don't think she was pleased with her lifestyle she was stuck in her lifestyle here she is and she there's no way in the world her reputation shot her condition is set she cannot work her way into righteousness there's nothing that this woman can do amen but God had needs to go by Samaria he knew where she was and in the right Junction of time he would come and sit on a well at the hour that she would be coming to the well she wasn't finding anybody he was finding her she wasn't hunting he was hunting she wasn't finding he was Finding and he began to speak to her on a spiritual level and something inside of her started to respond amen when when he began to speak on a spiritual level to even his own disciples amen he talked about eating my flesh and drinking my blood and my body is meat and he's speaking on a spiritual level they go to a carnal level and they start saying how can this be and how can we eat his flesh and drink his blood and the many of them walk away from him here's a woman he starts speaking to her on a spiritual level about water you can drink and never thirst again eternal life and shows the sign of a prophet and instantly she goes from carnal to the spiritual level why for her it was just so easy amen it just came easy she didn't strain she didn't fight she didn't go to Theological Seminary she just went to the well one day to get water like she did every day and on this day there happened to be a son of man there a Prophet The Son of God was sitting there and he begins to talk to her and as he talked to her something inside of her kept thumping and thumping and thumping and realization upon realization was coming to her and she asked the question you know messiah's coming and he says I am he and something in her went thunk amen she didn't need to ask the pastor she didn't need to ask the priest she didn't need to pray about it why it came so easy to her all she did was dropped the old religious water pot went running into the City and some come see a man that told me everything I've ever done isn't this the Christ she didn't need to get she didn't get need to get a party of people to agree with her yeah amen she knew it he told her and she knew it brother BR says in the message identification of Christ in all ages said look at the little woman see she had fallen from God's thoughts he's speaking of the same woman she had fallen from God's thoughts she could be she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven she turned around that statement just does something for me she had representation in heaven she turned around amen years later somebody come to her and say that's such a good story how you turned your life around and you went down a different Road and you made other choices that wasn't what saved her all her choices ruined her but when God came to her and spoke the word and something in her come alive amen how could God come to her how could she receive when thousands would reject why she receive because she had she had fallen from the thoughts of God she was a thought of God trapped in a body of Flesh she had fallen from the thoughts of God God never forgot about her he always knew where she was and he always knew how he would C catch right she had fallen from the thoughts of God and she could be redeemed because she was a subject she had representation in heaven she turned right around in John 8 verse 23 Jesus says he said unto them ye are from beneath I am from above you are of this world I'm not of this world I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if you believe not that I am he you shall die in your sins what do they need to be saved to believe in him how can they believe unless it's given to them to believe this woman could believe because she was a thought that had fallen from heaven and she had representation in heaven brother bam says and going beyond the Camp so they deny his word deny his baptism deny his power deny his signs and with Creed or tradition again of wearing turned around collars and everything making themselves Creeds and so forth they're trying to they're trying to upon good works they wasn't ordained to life to begin with they had nothing to believe with what was wrong with these Pharisees why couldn't they believe when they saw the sign when they saw the works there was nothing in them they had nothing to believe with they didn't have representation in heaven they had no C Gene of God but this little woman she had representation in heaven and she had a c Gene of God inside of her she had something to believe with that's how she could believe and brother Ram goes on to say this and who is this MDC said then after you recognized the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other things you have then been formed into the living living image of the Living God you heard from your theopen me if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting when you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food and you left the others you've been formed you've been born again what cause all of that you heard from your theophany how was it I could believe this message how was it I could recogniz cuz I had representation in heaven there was something on the inside there was something that connect to Something in another world it wasn't me it wasn't my brain it wasn't my will it wasn't my strength I Heard From Another Dimension a voice calling me amen I heard from my theophany you know what that means that means I have a theophonic before the foundation of the world was ordained to be there something to believe with amen I didn't believe with my brain I believed with the c Gene of God that was in my soul it wasn't what I did it's what he did it's not what I orchestrated it's what he orchestrated so how could we take credit for it all we can say is thank you amen let's turn to Romans chapter 3 I'm going to read just a couple more scriptures and we'll close Romans chapter 3 Romans 3:23 Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of Works nay but by the law of Faith righteousness was imputed unto Abraham because he believed we are saved because we believe how did We Believe by what law by the law of Faith now let's go over to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that nut of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast where is boasting then it is excluded I'm saved by grace through faith and that not of myself it was a gift of God he put something inside of me to believe with and he had a voice on the other side calling me and these two came together he sent his word to connect to the word inside of me what did we do listen when when we really think about it when it comes down to it it came to us so easy friends we don't want to trivialize or marginalize your life there's been hard things in life and walking this road has challenges to it but it's mainly hard because of the carnal flesh it's mainly the reason it's difficult and the main struggles with that but the reality is it came so easy came by grace through faith and that not of myself it was the gift of God brother BM says here in anointed ones at the end time now I want you to know this is sure and and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and I determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happened as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spake through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God I love that can we say the same thing about us I didn't find the message I'm not the one who believed the message it was God in Me it was God who ordained it and God who found me and God who orchestrated it on in the seventh seal he says now remember let me exhort you again this is coming to the end of the seventh seal and I want you to think about even the seventh seal in our lives because the seventh seal in our lives is that mystery of God Christ living out in this Tabernacle of Flesh now remember this is at the end of the seventh seal let me exhort you again don't say thank you to anybody at all don't say thinking some minister or something some Mortal man there's anything good about him CU there's not I don't care who he is there's nothing good to any man that's right if there's a whole bunch of trumpets laying here and one of them had to sound out a certain music it's the man them trumpets are perfectly mute it's the fellow that can sound the trumpet that knows what he's going to do that picks up a trumpet the trumpet has nothing to do with it the sound comes from the intelligence behind it that's right so all trumpets are the same all men are the the same all Christians are the same got that there's no great man among us we're not great men not great women we're all brothers and sisters all the same in the same bracket we're no great one don't make one greater than the other when not a thing at all to do no sir but we're just all human beings don't try to interpret the things don't try to do anything more than just live a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ everybody understand that now amen love him with all your heart could you not love him when he's done so much amen he's coming to the end of the seventh seal amen and don't say thank you to no man as if man has done this of man did this and man did man didn't do anything man ruined himself God's redeemed man this is all God's doing listen there's individuals in this church that God has gifted to write songs how hard did you work to write a song how many years of school did you go to and and you got lyrics study and listen the majority of the time it just comes or it comes slowly or it comes fast but that song was given to you there's some of us that are called to sing you know your ability to sing you didn't make yourself a singer you were born able to sing if you've got natural Talent natural ability some of us can play instruments you know that's the grace of God and I know it I paid for guitar lessons when I turned 18 for one solid year of guitar lesson I paid 420 something I knew I knew the exact change and at the end of the one year I couldn't play nothing I would pluck out she'll be coming around the mountain when she comes and I did it poorly if God has given you a natural ability that's from God there's some Among Us God's called to preach the gospel you know that inspiration you cannot preach without inspiration and you can't work up inspiration and without inspiration you're dead in in the water I've been dead in the water many a day I spent Friday and Saturday Saturday night dead in the water amen until God supern naturally drops an inspiration in my heart and when drops an inspiration in my heart then it's easy then all you do is search the Bible and to find all the scriptures you know what it comes easy friends you say preaching that must be hard no getting yourself out of the way is hard dealing with your emotions is hard keeping yourself subject is hard amen opening your heart to people that's hard but catching inspiration that's easy that's something God does I've spent hours reading nothing would come I've had Saturdays where I read three four message two or three not three or four two or three whole message books nothing would come read my Bible nothing come pray nothing come cry nothing would come it was one Saturday driving home in the middle of night deciding that if I woke up in the same condition I went to bed and I think it was one or two in the no three it was after 3 in the morning I said I'm going to play a tape and when I turned left from Stuart Road on the Blue Lick Road and I went down over the hill like a little Whisper of a wind came in in one little scripture and from that I went to my office and I wrote down a couple of things went to bed woke up about 3 hours 4 hours later and all of a sudden all those little scriptures I wrote down I found them on my computer and I come and preach that message do you think that I have any right to take praise for that you think you should say thank you to any man the man was failing one book two book three book inspiration Bible reading prayer the man was failing but it was God God gives the ability God gives the talent God gives the song God gives the Ser God gives the right word at the right time to the right person to give him Faith to believe God ordains your fellowship God gives you that that unction just to send a text or make a phone call that wasn't you that was God praise God Amen when we come to the end of this to the end of the seventh seal we might get to the place where we say let's say thank you to nobody let's just thank God because everything that was happened was him orchestrating him doing and for us it came easy how is it you can sit in a service and you hear something you've never heard before you hear a quote in a way you've never heard it and it thumps in your heart and out of your mouth goes amen and all of a sudden you know you know that's true but you don't know how you know that's true because but you know that that's the truth you know why cuz it came easy for Jacob those spiritual things came easy am amen we get ourselves in the way we rob God's glory and I don't want to do those things anymore so tired of Esau so sick of him always trying every time something good happens ES tries to stand in front every time God's going to take a snapshot of his glorious work Esau's trying to get in the picture trying to photob bomb the shot I don't think it's just me oh God help us just to lay ourselves aside and say look what God did look what God did look what God did look what God did help me God I I can say is help me God for us friends it has come easy for Abraham Abraham's just a regular guy as far as he knows he doesn't go to a temple one day and become a priest and decide he's going to become the patriarch of a of a new lineage of a faith seed no God comes to him and tells him I want you to go here he didn't conjure that up he didn't think it up he just happened to believe it and even in performance it wasn't that great of a performance but he still believed it then he went to Heron and from Heron God spoke to him again and then he went to the promised land and God met him when he crossed into the promised land and then God met him again and then then God met him in the form of mkdc and blessed him and then God met him in the plains of mammory and and and confirmed the promise and then when he went to ailec and messed up God went down there and defended him through do you think Abraham's going to stand up when we get to the to the other side we're all in the marriage supper and ABR was going to stand up and say listen let me tell you what I did I he had no clue he couldn't make God come to him all he could do was live and God came when God wanted to come and God came where he wanted to come and for Abraham it was easy hey we've all lived our life but we've had Junctions of time when God has interjected himself he's delivered us he's changed our Direction he's opened the word to us in new ways and he's delivered us from ourselves and from sickness hey he knew when he would do it he knew how he would do it he had it orchestrated before the foundation of the world we can't share any credit for that at all because it's him that worketh in us both the will and do of his good pleasure all we can say is thank you God for me it came easy believing came easy when I first first introduced to this message the me believing the message wasn't convenient it cost me a great deal it cost me friends it cost me family it cost me reputation it cost me greatly but it still came easy the believing part I couldn't help I didn't strain I didn't work it was inconvenient there was even times I tried to not believe it because the believing was so inconvenient for me that it would have been much easier not to believe it but no matter how much more convenient would have been there was nothing I could do to change what was inside of me I believed it and I couldn't help but believe it for me it came easy amen why CU God ordained it Jesus said to the to the to the multitudes therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father thank god brother B says oh let's sing it again this wonderful old Hymn of the church I love him I love him I just can't get enough of saying that because he first loved me he loved me a poor deliberately blinded sin loving wretched drunkard son in the gutters and he stooped down by his grace I had nothing to do with it he chose me the brother BM decided he was going to be the prophet of the age did he decide he'll have a Healing Ministry to the peoples of the world did he decide that he would do great healing campaigns and heal multitudes did he decide that he'd have his picture taken with a pillar of fire did he decide that he would get caught up into a consolations of angels no that just happened to him he didn't make it happen he didn't work his way up to it God knew when and where and how and God orchestrated all of that that wasn't brother brenham's doing that was God's doing amen he didn't make himself to be the prophet of the age he didn't earn it by Merit or by degree amen he was just living a life as a little boy amen a poor humble boy from a poor humble family and all of a sudden you brother bam didn't make himself have a vision he didn't make himself hear a voice in the popular tree he didn't make himself see am me the bridge spanning the Ohio River he didn't do any of that for him that came easy that didn't make his life easy he had difficulty in life but you understand that came easy Visions just came amen the word of the Lord just came God injected himself on the scene and made it all happen amen how could he at the end of it take credit he said' don't say thank you to any man this has been God I was only standing near when he did those things I hope that God will allow me to get to the place where genuinely from my heart I can say the same thing that it wasn't me friends it's not been me I didn't believe this message there was something inside of me that believed this message and I learned after I come to the message that that was the real me that was intended to be me but it wasn't my brain that grabbed the concept it was my heart that latched onto the word because why I didn't find the message the message found me I didn't find Christ Christ found me I didn't deliver myself he delivered me and I'm not the believer he's the believer inside of me we call ourselves Believers I'm a believer I'm a Believer but the reality is the Esau of me is not the believer only the Christ part of me is the believer that was ordained before the foundation of the world the attribute and part of God that's the believer in me and that's what makes me think thank ful for me it came easy I didn't have to go to school Seminary I didn't have to pay any money what did you do to become predestinated what did you do to have a c Gene of God in your soul for us it came easy friends it's just God's doing why is it we can move past the carnal of religion and move into the spiritual what is it that's crying and hungering for more of God what is it that wants the truth and only the truth and what is it that wants to see him so clear so unveiled in this day what is that that's God working in us both the will and the do of his good pleasure and all I can say is thank you God thank you God for all that you've done for me let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come please you know there's people on this Earth that don't have a c gen of God and they could strain and strain and strain and strain and they'll never see the message the way you see it they could read and read and read and read and they'll never get the unveiling of Christ but friends for us it comes easy we don't strain we read we pray we study because we love it but it wasn't the abundance of study that brought Revelation it was the grace of God Amen he gave us eyes to see and ears to hear and our heart to perceive and he has redeemed us imputed unto us righteousness because we believed and we believed by grace and that not of ourselves is a gift of God where is boasting then I'm a message believer I'm bride of Jesus Christ hey we should be thankful so thankful and so sincere and so loving to God that we can even say those things but they should not bring one ounce of Pride cuz what did you do to make yourself Pride what did you do to make yourself elect redeemed nothing we should say it with the utmost gratitude I believe we should say it by faith we can say it but we should say it with the utmost gratitude and sincerity and deep heart sincerity but not Pride as if we made ourselves bride or we're bride because we're the best some of us were the worst but he knew where to find us when we were at our worst he knew where we were we had representation in heaven and we had a sieging and there was Christ the word here hunting us out I'm glad he came to my well are you glad he came to yours amen I'm so thankful that I can say I believe this message I can say it by Grace not by effort not by will I can only say it by Grace but I thank God that I can say it and mean it from the depths of my heart amen let's just bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus God I am so thankful for what you've done God when we look at Jacob and Esau we see Esau could never be what Jacob was he could be a good man he could be loyal to his father he could be a good Christian he could be religious he could do so many nice wonderful things but he could never be what Jacob was God and Jacob he may not have been able to be as nice as Esau as kind or as sweet maybe but he had something Esau with never had he had a seed of predestination God we recognize we're not the best we're not the nicest we're not the sweetest we're not the most loyal we have failed in every category we can fail in we can't earn it by Merit Lord we can't deceive you all of our works are as filthy rags there's no boasting in US Lord take it all out of us for Lord we stand here recognizing that it's your Grace your grace and your grace alone but oh God I want to say thank you thank you for giving me eyes to see you're the one who made the Seeing Eye you made the hearing ear God you're the one who gave Revelation to me God you opened my eyes you open my ears you gave me a heart to perceive it's all you're doing and before the foundation of the world you're the one who wrote my name on your book I didn't write it there you wrote it there I didn't send the sacrifice to redeem myself you came as your own sacrifice to redeem me I didn't find myself in a lost condition and pluck myself up you found me in a lost condition and pluck me up there's nothing I've done you've done it all just want to say thank you Lord Jesus thank you God for doing what you alone can do and Lord help us to be forever grateful forgive me of my pride forgive me for my arrogant attitude forgive me for speaking like Peter spake but help me Lord as you demonstrated your Prophet coming to the end of the 7 SE help me to say there's no good in me there's no good in me at all the only thing good is your word Lord I pray that as we yield ourselves to you that you would take us Lord may you mold us and make us and perfect us and bring us into your very image and use us For Your Glory you have a glorious purpose you want to achieve in this end time help us not to get in your way help us not to hinder or limit the beautiful work that you're doing but help us Lord to rest in your hand and let

in sweetness and sincerity and may you continue Lord to bring us into your image step by step we love you father and we want to say thank you God lord it feels so unfair for so many who struggle so
