========================================

for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aund of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the tomorrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the heart is desperately wicked who can know it the word knows it absolutely the word knows it amen and that's why we still believe in fivefold Ministry and that's why we believe in live preaching of the word that God can anoint a man that take the sword of the word and cut you under till he separates your spirit and your soul because the heart is desperately wicked who can know it but the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so that when the word starts getting close and encroaching in on your problem don't get offended at the man that's preaching amen look at it and say woe is me God help me to be right with your word if you're pointing that at me I take it Lord fix me oh God humble me help me to surrender amen America is one of the hardest places in in the world to preach the gospel because America was based on Rebellion the spirit of patriotism and the spirit of America is a spirit of rebellion and it's one of the hardest places in the world to preach the gospel because there's rebellious Spirits in America and there's a self uh uh uh there there's a such a sense of self ability in America we've always been on the top we've always been able to figured out we led the world and all that but God is beginning to Humble America now because she's not going to be on the top very much longer amen sometimes what we need is just Contrition and humility and surrender because the word of God is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's why we come for preaching we come for encouragement for instruction and righteousness for reprove and rebuke we come for heart surgery sometimes things are so deep in our hearts wounds from when we were children Scars From the Past habits that set in generational things that were laid into us so long ago that we don't understand what happened rejection complexes that came from parents amen neglect that we suffered or Abus there's some things so deep in our heart we don't understand what's going on Amen but the grace of God he'll he'll take a man under his control and put the word of God in that man's mouth to come down and start to dive deep down into the heart and start to expose there's a problem problem here we've got to go deeper there's an issue laying here you got to go deeper something's laying there that's a problem we got to go deeper until that can be rooted out given to God and the coal can come and Purge and bring life and then he can say and now who will go for me say I'm here I'm here and I'm ready that's what I've always wanted was to serve you I've always wanted to do your will that's the purpose friends that's God's great desire
