coming and pressing and I I just knew I had to do it tonight so I think God for his leadership amen so we're going to do that we're going to have the scrolling text overhead we're going to I feel to play it in its entirety that's why I had the shorter song service so we don't go too long this evening because we know there's school tomorrow and you'll have work early in the morning so we're going to play it in its entirety we're going to have the scrolling text overhead but if you have a tablet or if you have a phone and you like to follow along on your tablet or your phone it's uh 1959 so he he preaches my life story uh under that title three times in the table but it's the last one it's 1959 April 19th so 59- 0419 if you're using the table app and then we're not going to begin right at the beginning I'm trying to shave a little time off we're going to begin at paragraph 21 so if you're on the table app you can just scroll down to paragraph 21 and that's where we'll begin so I also wanted to remind you all that tomorrow night we'll start the church age Bible study for those who'd like to attend and me we're doing this for some of the new Believers and some of the uh the young who haven't been through it yet but it's open to anybody who'd like to come that starts at 6:30 we're going to try to be done by 8:30 I'm going to try to keep it within a 2hour window to the best of my ability so that we I we all have a lot of things we have to do so we're going to we're going to do that 6:30 to 8:30 amen let's stand I'd like to read a scripture and pray together let's turn to Hebrews chap 11 I also wanted to give you an update on sister Joyce Wy she's been gone for several weeks she went to Arizona to uh be with her sister because her sister's husband was passing away they knew that he was passing the time was short she went down there so she could be with her sister and I think it's ended up being more than three weeks maybe going on four weeks but she's due back tomorrow she says she misses everybody and can't wait to see everybody so she appreciates your prayers but that's a little update for sister Joyce let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11 and let's look at verse 8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is gone amen you'll see why we read that when brother B goes to his opening scripture so let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord that we can gather together tonight we thank you Father that your Holy Ghost gives us leadership Lord and and I believe by your leadership you've called us to play this tape tonight I know it's for a purpose Lord and I'm excited Lord to see what you'll speak to our hearts and what we can gain Lord from hearing this testimony once again Lord I I pray that you'd bless each heart and each life Lord may we open up and receive from you that special portion you have for us tonight and may the word take effect in our lives we ask this blessing in Jesus Christ's name amen amen while you're standing let's turn to Hebrews 13 because we're going to start right when brother brandham goes into his opening scripture so I want you to go ahead and turn to Hebrews 13 and he'll start reading at verse 12 you can go ahead and have your seats with that amen I know many of us have heard brother bram's life story but not everybody has and for me when I started thinking about it I know it's been at least a few years but I think several years since I've heard it and so I every time I play a tape I always preview it I read the book and I and I didn't at all I didn't let myself read read any lines out of it because I wanted to do it fresh with everybody today so may God bless you brother Franco you can go ahead and turn on the tape anytime now I wish to read for a text this afternoon just to start off the life story found over in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter and let's begin here about I'd say about the 12th verse wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go therefore to him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now that is kind of a text for you see if it's a life story or anything pertaining to a human being we don't glorify that and especially a man's past if it's been as dark as mine has been but I thought if we read the scripture God would bless the scripture and my thought is that here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now I know that you're very fond of Los Angeles you have a right to be it's a great beautiful city with its Smog and watmore yet it's a beautiful city fine climate but this city cannot continue it's got to have an end I've stood in Rome where the great Emperors in the cities that they thought they would build Immortal and dig down 20 ft to even find the ruins of it I stood where the Pharaohs has had their great kingdoms and you dig down in the ground to find where the great pharaohs ruled all of us like to think about our city and our place but remember it cannot stand when I was a little boy I used to go to a great maple tree in my country we have a lot of hardwood and then we had this maple trees the sugar maple and what we call the hard maple soft maple this great gigantic tree it was the most beautiful tree when I would come in from the fields of working the and and Harvesters I would love to go to this big tree and and sit down under it and and look up and I see it's great Mighty uh uh branches Sway in the wind great huge trunk and I said you know I believe that this tree will be here for a hundreds and hundreds of years not long ago I took a look at the old tree it's just a snag for here we have no continuing City no nothing here on the earth that you can look at will continue it's got to have an end everything that's mortal has to give away to an immortality so no matter how good we build our highways how fine we make our structures it all has to go for here there's nothing can continue just the Unseen is what continues I remember the house that we lived in it was an old log house chinked with mud I perhaps maybe many never seen a house chinked with mud but it was all chinked up with mud and the great huge logs that was in the old house I thought that house would stand for hundreds of years but you know today where that house stood is a housing project it's so much different everything's changing but I used to see my father he was a rather a short stocky man very strong and he was one of the strongest little men that I knew of I met Mr CS a fellow that he used to work with in the logs he was a logger and about a year ago and Mr CS is a very good friend of mine Deacon in the First Baptist Church and he said Billy you ought to be a real powerful man and I said no I'm not Mr CS he said if you took after your daddy you would be he said I seen that man weighing 140 lb load a log on the wagon by himself it weighed 9 100 lb he just knew how to do it he was strong I'd SE him come into the place to wash and get ready for dinner when mother would call him and we had an old apple tree out in the front yard and then there was three or four small ones along towards the back and right in the middle tree there was an old Looking Glass had been broke Mar large one and had been tacked on the side of the tree with some Nails bent in kind of like what some of you cartenders listen in would call coat hangers it had been vent in to hold the glass in its place there was an old 10 comb how many ever seen an old 10 the oldfashioned tin Combs I can just see it and then there was a little wash bench just a little board with the little sling leg beneath it tacked against the tree a little old half sulfur pump there that we pumped the water out and we washed at this old tree and Mama used to take meal sacks and make towels anybody ever use a meal sack towel well I'm sure I'm feel at home now and those big old rough towels and when she'd give us little kides a bath she'd feel like she's rubbing a hide off every time she rub and I remember that that old meal sack and she pull some of the strings out make little tossel to kind of decorate it up how many ever slept on a straw tick well I will say how many ever know what a shuck pillow was well brother Glover I'm at home now sure know straw tick well hasn't been too long since I just come off of one it was oh it's good sleeping cool then the winter time they take the old feather bed and lay on it snow and then have to put a piece of canvas over the top of us to cause the snow blo in the the the cracks in the house you know where the old cadboard shingles would turn up you know and the snow would sweep through it and oh I can remember that very well and then pop used to have a shaving brush ah now this is going to get you it was made out of corn Shucks a shaving brush with corn Shucks he'd take mother's old Li soap that she had made fix it up and put it on his face with this corn shuck brush and shave it with a big old straight razor and on Sunday you take the um the pieces of paper stick around his collar the wor cellid collars and put it around the collar like this to keep the the the lather from getting on his shirt collar did you ever see that done why my my I remember a little Old Spring down below where we used to go get a drink a water and get our water out of an old gourd Dipper how many you ever seen a gourd Dipper well how many of you is from Kentucky anyhow well just look at here at the kyans well M I'm right I thought it was all ois and Aries out here but look like ky's moving in well they did strike ARL in Kentucky few months ago you know so maybe that's some of them's coming this away and then I remember when dad used to come in and take his wash for dinner and he'd roll up his sleeves them little short stubby arms and when he'd pull up his arms to wash thr the water up on his face the muscle just wed in his little arms and I said you know my daddy will live to be 150 years old he was so strong but he died at 52 here we have no continuing City that's right we cannot continue now let's take a little trip all of us there's every one of you here that has a life story just as I do and it's good to stroll down memories Lane once in a while don't you think so just go back and let's all go back for a while back to similar experiences as a a little children and now the first part of the life story I'll just give it a little touched because it's in the book and many of you have the book I was born in a little mountain cabin way up in the mountains of Kentucky had one room that we lived in no rug on the floor not even wood on the floor it was just simply a bare floor and a stump top of a stump cut off with three legs on it that was our table and all those little Broms and pile around there and out on the front of the little old cabin and Waller down looked like where a bunch of possums have been wallering out there in the dust you know all the little brothers it was nine of us and one little girl and she really had a rough time amongst that bunch of boys we have to respect her yet today from the things that we did in those days she couldn't go with us anywhere we'd run her back she was a girl so she couldn't take it you know so so we had and all remember that back behind the table we had just two chairs and they were made out of Limar just Old Hickory uh saplings put together and the bottom of them laced with Hickory bark did anybody ever see a hickory bark chair yeah and I can hear Mama yet all later on when we got into a place where she could have a wooden floor with those babies on her lap like this and rock in that old chair just bang didy bang didy bang on the floor I remember to keep the little ones from going out the door when she would be washing or something she'd lay a chair down and turn it kind of catac cored across the door to keep the little ones from getting out when she had to go spring to get water and so forth and mother was 15 years old when I was born born dad was 18 and I was the first of of the nine children and they told me that the morning I was born now we was very poor just the poorest ol poor and we did not even have a window in this little cabin it had like a little wooden door that you open I doubt whether you ever seen anything like that a little wooden door that open instead of a window you keep keep it open in the daytime you closed it at night we couldn't turn on the electric lights or even burn kerosene in those days we had what you call a grease lamp I don't know where you ever know what a grease lamp was well what do you and you ever buy burn a pine knot for just take a pine knot and light it and Lay It Up on a lid it'll burn and that's smoked up a little bit but they had no franch or anyhow to smoke up so it just the cabin got the smoke in it drawed good CA there plenty of roof up there for to draw through so it um and I was borned on April the the 6 19009 of course you know that makes me a little over 25 now and so uh the morning that I was born mother said that uh they opened up the window now we had no doctors it was a midwife just and that Midwife was my grandmother and so when I was born and my first beginning to cry and and mother wanted to see her child and and she more more than a child herself and when they open up the little window just at the break of day about 5:00 and the there was an old Robin sitting by the side of a little bushes you all seen the picture of it in and my book of my life story an old Robin was sitting there just singing for all that was in him I've always loved Robins now you boys out in radio land don't shoot at my birds you see they're they're that my birds did you ever hear the legend of the robin how he got his red breast I'll stop here a moment how he got his red breast there was a king of kings was dying one day on a cross cross and he was suffering and no one would come to him he had no one to help him and there was a little brown bird wanted to take them Nails out of the Cross and he kept flying into the cross and jerking on those Nails he was too little to pull them out and he got his little breast all red with blood ever since then his breast has been red don't shoot him boys let him alone he was sitting at the side of the window a chirping as the robin singing and Dad pushed back the window and when they pushed the little window door back that light that you see in the picture come whirling in the window says my mother and hung over the bed grandmother didn't know what to say now we are was not a religious family my people are Catholic I'm Irish on both sides my father is strictly Irish Brandon my mother is Harvey only her father married a Cherokee Indian so that broke the little line of the blood of the Irish and father and mother did not go to church and they married out of the church and they had no religion at all and back there in the mountains there was not even a Catholic church so they come over in the early settlers two Broms come over and from that sprung the whole generation of Broms as the genealogy of the family and then she opened when they open this window and this light stood in there they did not know what to do dad had bought him Mama said a new pair of overhauls for this event he's standing with the his arms in the bib of the old overhauls like the Woodsman and loggers used in those days and it frightened them well after i' got up maybe 10 days old or something they taken me up to a little Baptist Church called posum kingdom posum kingdom Baptist Church that's quite a name there's an old circuit preacher the oldfashioned Baptist preacher came through there about about once every two months on uh the people would have a little service together theyd Go sing some songs but they had preaching ever so often on the circuit Rider they paid him each year with a sack of pumpkins and a few things like that you know that the people are raised to giveing and the old preacher came by and there he offered prayer for me as a little boy that is my first trip to church at the year of about something a little over 2 years old the first Vision taking place well they had told around in the mountains there that this light came in so they tried to figure it up some of them said it must have been the sunlight reflecting on a maror in the house but there was no maror in there and the sun wasn't up so it was too early at 5:00 and then all they just passed it by and when is about uh supposed to be near three years old now I have to be honest there's things here that I do not like to say and I wish I could bypass it and not have to say it but yet to tell the truth you must tell the truth if it's on yourself or your people be honest about it then it's always the same my father was a long way from being a religious person he was a typical Mountain boy that drank constantly all the time and he had gotten in some trouble in a fight and there had been two or three men almost killed as they fighting shooting and cutting one another with knives at a some kind of a party up in the mountains and dad had been one of the Ring leaders of this fight because that had had been a friend of his that got hurt and hit someone with a chair and had the man had a knife out and he was going to cut Dad's friend on the floor with this knife through his heart and dad took his part and it really must have been a terrible fight because they from all the way down to burksville many miles away they sent a sheriff up after Dad horseback so the man was laying at the point of death might be some of his people listening in I'm going to call his name will yarberry was his name probably I think some of them is in California of his boys but he was a bully great powerful man killed his own boy with a fenra so he he was a very powerful and Wicked Man and so there was a great knife fight between he and dad and my father almost killed a man so he had to run and leave Kentucky and come across the river to Indiana and um he had a brother that lived at the time in Louisville Kentucky it was was the assistant superintendent of the wood Mosaic Sawmills in Kentucky in Louisville and so Dad come to find his older brother dad was the youngest of the boys of 17 children and so he came to find his older brother and while he was gone for almost a year he could not come back because the law was looking for him and then when we had heard from him by letter signed by another name but that he told Mother how it would be that she'd hear from him and then I remember one day the spring this little cabin was just behind the house and and during that time after there's 9 11 months difference between me and my next brother and he was still crawling and I had a big rock in my hand and I was trying to show him how hard I could throw this rock and the old mud where the spring had run out out of the ground and made the muddy ground and I heard a bird and it was singing up in a tree and I looked up to that tree and the bird flew away and when it did a voice spoke to me I know you think I could not think and remember that but the Lord God who judge the earth and the heavens and all there is knows that I'm telling the truth that bird when it flew away a voice came from where the bird was in the tree like a wind caught in the bush and it said you'll live near a city called New Albany and I've lived from the time I was 3 years old until this time within three miles of New Albany Indiana I went in and told my mother about it well she thought I was just dreaming or something later we moved to Indiana and father went to work for a man Mr wathan a rich man he owns the WAN distilleries and he owned a great shears is maled millionaire and the Louisville Colonels and baseball and so forth and then we live near there and dad being a poor man yet he could not do without his drinking so he he went to making whisky in a in a still and then it worked a hardship on me because I was the oldest of the children I had to come and pack water to this steel to keep those Carls cool while they were making the whiskey then he got to selling it and then he got two or three of those Stills now that's the part I don't like to tell but it's the truth and I remember one day from the barn coming up to the house crying because out at the back of the place was a pond where they used to cut ice many of you remember when they used to cut ice and put it in sawdust that's way Mr won kept ice out there in the country and father was a a chauffer for him a private chauffer and when uh this Pond was full of fish and when they would go to cutting the ice and bring it in and put it in the sawdust and when the ice melted in the summertime as it went down it was kind of clean I suppose more like a lake ice and could use it not to drink but to keep water cold put it around the buckets and their milk and so forth one day packing water from back out at this pump which was about a city block I was squalling to who wouldn't have it because I'd come from school and all the boys went out to the pond fishing I just love to fish and so they uh all got to go fishing but me and I had to pack water for this Ste of course my that had to be mom is prohibition and um I it was such a hardship and I remember coming along there with a stump toe I had a corn cob wrapped under my toe to keep it Out of the Dust did you ever do that just put a corn cob under your toe like this and wrap a string around it it holds your toe right up like a turtle head almost you know sticking up you could track me everywhere I went with this Carn cob under my to stumpage you know didn't have any shoes to wear so we never wore shoes sometime half the winter if we did we it was just what we could pick up somebody would give us and clothes of what somebody charity would give us and I stopped under this tree and I was sitting there just squalling it was in September because I wanted to go fishing I had to pack several tubs of water with little molasse buckets just about that high half a gallon cuz it's just a little lad of about 7 years old and I P him a big tub and then go back and get a another two buckets and come back pump it that's the water we had and there go to run off a batch of that corn whiskey that night these men with Daddy up at the house and I was crying and all at once I heard something making a noise like a whirlwind something like this I hope it isn't too loud going just a noise like that well it was awful quiet and I looked around and you know what a little Whirlwind I believe you call them little Cyclones in the fall of the year they pick up through the corn field you know the leaves and so forth in the Autumn there the leaves had just began turning and I was under a great white popular tree stood about halfway between the barn and the the house and I heard that noise and I looked around it just as quiet as it is in this room not a leaf flowing nowhere nothing and I thought where's that noise coming from well I thought must be away from here just a lad and it got louder and louder I picked up my little buckets and squalled a couple more times and started up the lane I was resting and I got just a few feet from that out from under the branches of this big tree oh my it made a whirl sounding and I turned to look and about halfway up that tree was another Whirlwind caught in that tree just to going around and around moving those leaves well I thought nothing strange about that because it just in that time of year and the Autumn why those whirl winds come little we call them whal winds and they uh and they pick up dust you see them on the desert like that same thing so I watched but it didn't leave off usually it's just a puff for a moment then it goes but it had already been in there 2 minutes or more well I started up the lane again and I turned to look at this again and when it did a human boss voice just as audible as mine is said don't you never drink smoke or defile your body in any way there will be a work for you to do when you get older why like this scared me to death you can imagine how a little fell fell I dropped those buckets and home I went just as hard as I could go scream in the top my voice and there was copperheads in that country snakes and they're very poison mother thought coming alongside the garden I'd perhaps got my foot on a copper head and she ran to meet me and I jumped up in her arms screaming hugging her and kissing her and she said what's the matter did you get snake bit look me all over I said no mama there's a man in that tree down there and she said Oh Billy Billy come on and she said did you stop and go to sleep I said no ma'am there's a man in that tree and he told me not to drink and not the Smoke Drink whiskies and and things and I was packing water to a moonshine still still right then and he said don't you never drink or defile your body in anyway that's immoral you know and my child Young Manhood with women and to my best I have never one time been guilty of such the Lord help me with those things and as you go along you'll find out so then don't drink or don't smoke or do not defile your body for there will be a work for you to do when you get older well I told that to Mama and she just laughed at me and I was just hysterically she called the doctor and the doctor said well he's just nervous that's all so she put me to bed and I never from that day to this ever passed by that tree again I was scared I go down the other side of the garden because I thought there was a man up in that tree and he was talking to me great deep voice that spoke and uh then sometime about a month after that I was playing Marvels out with my little brothers out in the front yard and all at once I had a strange feeling come on me and I stopped and sat down the side of the tree and we were right up on the bank from the Ohio river and I looked down towards Jeffersonville and I seen a bridge rise up and go across that of the river span the river and I seen 16 men I count them had dropped off of there and lost their lives on that bridge I run in real quick and told my mother and she thought I went to sleep but they kept it in mind and 22 years some then the municipal bridge now many of you cross when you cross there crossed the river at the same place and 16 men lost their life building that bridge across the river it's never failed to be perfectly true as you see it here in the auditorium it's been that way all the time now they thought I was just a nervous which I am a nervous person that's true and if you ever notice people who are are inclined to be spiritual are nervous look at poets and Prophets and look at William keer who wrote that famous song There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins did you ever you know the song I stood by his grave not long ago brother Julius I believe I know no yes that's right was with us over there and his grave and and there after he had wrote that song the inspiration left him he tried to find the uh the river to commit suicide see the spirit left him and people like uh uh poets and authors and are not uh I mean prophets look at Elijah when he stood on the mountain and called fire out of the heaven and called rain out of the heaven then when the spirit left him he run at a threat of a woman and God found him pulled back in a cave 40 Days Later look at Jonah with enough inspiration when the Lord had anointed him to preach there in Nineveh to a a city with the size of St Louis repented with sackcloth and then when the spirit left him what happened to him we find him up on the mountain after the spirit left him praying to God to take his life and uh you see it's inspiration and when these things happen it it does something to you then I remember coming on up I got to be a young man I'll hurry to make it within the next little bit when I got to be a young man I had ideas like all young men I going to school I found I'm little girls you know I was real bashful you know and I I finally got me a little girlfriend and U like all little boys about 15 years old I guess and and so uh oh she was pretty my she had eyes like a dove and she had teeth like Pearl and neck like a swan and she she was really pretty and another little boy he uh we were buddies so he got his daddy's old Model T Ford and we got a date with our girls we was going to take them out riding we got enough about two gallons of gasoline we had to Jack the back wheel up to crank it I don't know where you ever remember that or not you know to crank it but we we going along pretty good and so I had a few Nickel in my pocket and we stopped at a little place and got you could get a ham sandwich for nickel and so oh I was rich I could by four of them see and after we'd eat the sandwiches and drink the coke I started taking the bottles back into my surprise when I come out women had just start falling from Grace at that time for from Womanhood my little Dove was smoking a cigarette well I've always had my opinion of a woman that would smoke a cigarette and I haven't changed it one bit from that time on that's right it's the lowest thing she can do that's exactly right and I now the cigarette company could get after me for this but I'm telling you that's just a stunt of the devil it's a biggest killer in sabotage this nation's God I'd rather my boy be a drunker than to be a cigarette smoker that's the truth I'd rather see my wife laying on the floor drunk and a see her with a cigarette that's how now this spirit of God that's with me if that is the spirit of God is you my question you smoking cigarettes is got a slim chance when you get there because that just every time you notice it on the platform how he condemns it it's a horrible thing keep away from it ladies if you have been guilty of that pleas in the Name of Christ get away from it it breaks you it'll kill you it it's a it's a cancer by the carloads the doctors try to warn and then how they can sell you that stuff if you go down to the drugstore and say buy I want to buy 50 cents worth of cancer why they come lock them up but when you buy 50 cents worth of cigarettes you're buying the same thing doctors say so oh this money mad Nation it's too bad it's a killer it's been proved well when I seen that pretty little girl just acting smart this cigarette in uh Han that like to kill me cuz I really thought I loved her and I thought well I'm called a woman hater you know that because I'm always kind of against women but not against you sisters I'm just against the way modern women act that's right good women should be packed long but I can remember when my father's still up there running I'd had to be out there with water and stuff see young ladies that wasn't over 17 18 years old up there with man my age now drunk and they'd have to sober him up and give them black coffee to get home to cook their husband's supper oh something like that I said this was my remark then they're not worth a good clean bullet to kill them with it that's right and I hated women that's right and I just have to watch every move now to keep from still thinking the same thing so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored she's my mother's a woman my wife is and there lovely and I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect but if if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she is a good wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but a a honory one or no good one is water in his blood and that's that's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and children if you've got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean send you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother they talk about the illiteracy of Kentucky Mountain you sit this your dog patched St some of them old mammies out there could come here to Hollywood and teach you modern mothers how to raise your kids you let her kid come in one night with her hair all messed up and lips lips what do you call it makeup stuff they put on their face and her dress all squeezed to one side and been out all night drunk brother should get one of the limbs off the top of that hickory tree and she'll never go out no more I'm tell she if you had a little more of that You' have a better Hollywood around here you're in a better Nation that's right it's true just try to be modern that that's one of the tricks of the devil now this little girl when I looked at her my heart just bled and I thought poor little fell and she said oh you want a cigarette Billy I said no ma' I said I don't smoke she said now you said you didn't dance they want to go to a dance and I wouldn't do it so I said there's a dance down there what it call SI of more Gardens and I said no I don't dance she said now you don't dance you don't smoke you don't drink how do you have any fun I said well I like to fish I like to hunt that didn't interest her so she said take this cigarette and I said no ma'am thank you I don't smoke and um I was standing on the fender they had a running board on the Old Forge you remember I standing on that Fender steing in the back seat she and I and she said you mean you won't smoke a cigarette said and we girls has got more nerve than you have I said no ma'am don't believe I want to do it she said well you big oh my I want to be big bad Bill so I I sure didn't want nothing said I wanted to be a prize fighter that was my idea of life so um I said I couldn't stand that so I said give it to me I hand I said I sure where I'm or not got that cigarette out and started to strike the match I know you're now I'm not responsible for what you think I'm just responsible for telling the truth when I start to strike that cigarette just as much determined to smoke it as I am to pick up this Bible I heard something going I tried again I couldn't get it to my mouth I got to cry and I throw R the thing down and they got to laughing at me and I walked home went up through the fields sat down out there crying and and it was a terrible life remember one day dad was going down the river the boys my brother and I we had to take a boat and go up and down the river hunting bottles to put the whiskey in we got a nickel a dozen for him to pick him up along the river and dad was with me and he had one of these little flat I believe about a half pint bottles and there a tree had blowed down and dad this man was with him Mr darn Bush I had his he had a nice boat and I wanted to find favor with him because I wanted to use that boat it had a good Rudder mine didn't have no Rudder at all we had this old boards to paddle with if he'd let me use that boat so he done welding and he made the Stills for Dad so uh he they throw their leg up across that tree and Dad reached in his back pocket and pulled out a little flat bottle of whiskey hand it to him and he took a drink hand it back to Dad and he taking a drink he set it down on a little sucker on the side of the tree that went out and Mr darn Bush picked it up said said here you are Billy I said thank you I don't drink he said a Brandon and don't drink everyone died with their boots on nearly and he said uh brandom and don't drink I said no sir no dad said I raise one sithy my daddy calling me a I said hand me that bottle I pull that stopper out of the top of it determined to drink it when I started turn it [Music] up I hand the bottle back and took off down through the field as hard as I could crying something wouldn't let me do it see I could not say well I was any good I was determined to do it but it's God grace Amazing Grace that kept me from doing those things I wanted to do it myself but he just wouldn't let me do it later on I found a girl when I was about 22 years old she was a darling she was a girl that went to church German Lutheran her name was brag b r u m b a c h come from the name of Bram ball and she was a nice girl she didn't smoke or drink or or she didn't uh dance or anything a nice girl I went with her for a little while and I'd then about 22 I'd made enough money to I bought me an old Lord and uh I we'd go out on dates together and so that time there was no Lutheran Church close they moved from Howard Park up there and so there was a minister the one that arain me in the Missionary Baptist Church Dr Roy Davis sister Upshaw the very one that sent the brother Upshaw over to me or talked to him about me Dr Roy Davis and um so he was preaching and had the First Baptist Church or the U the uh I don't believe it was the first Baptist BST church either it was a Miss called the Missionary Baptist Church at Jeffersonville and he was preaching at the place at that time and we would go to church at night so and we' come back and I never did join church but I just like to go with her because the main thought was going with her I just might as well be honest so then uh going with her and one day she is out of a nice family and I begin to think you know you know I oughtn't take that girl's time it isn't it is isn't right because she's a nice girl and I'm poor and and I my daddy had broke down in health and I there was no way for me to make a living for a girl like that who had been used to a nice home and rugs on the floor I remember the first rug I ever seen I didn't know what it was I walked around the side I thought it the prettiest thing I ever seen in my life how would they put something like that on the floor it was the first rug I'd ever seen it was this one of these I believe it's called called matting rugs I may have had that wrong some gu like wicker or something is laced together and laying on the floor pretty green and red and big rolls worked in the middle of it you know it was a pretty thing and so um I remember uh I made up my mind that I either had to ask her to marry me or I must get away and let some good man marry her somebody that would be good to her could make her a living and could be kind to her I could be kind to her but I I I was only 20 cents an hour so I couldn't make too much of a living for and I with all the family we had to take care of and dad broke down in health and I had to take care of all them so I was having a pretty rough time so I thought well only thing for me to do is tell her that I I she I I just won't be back because I thought too much of her to Wreck her life and to let her fool along with me and then I thought if somebody could get a hold of her and marry her make a lovely home and maybe if I couldn't have her I could I could know that she was happy and so I thought but I I just I just can't give her up and I I was in an awful shape and day after day I'd think about it so I was too bashful to ask her to marry me every night I make up my mind I'm going to ask her and what is that butterflies or something you get in your all you Brethren out there probably had the same experience along that and a real funny feeling my face would get hot I didn't know I couldn't ask her so I guess you wonder how I ever got married you know what I wrote her a letter and ask her and so uh now it wasn't Dear Miss it was a little more you know on the love side than that it was just not a an agreement it was I I wrote it up best I could and I was a little afraid of her mother her mother was she was kind of rough and uh but her father was a gentle old Dutchman just a fine old fell he was the organizer of the Brotherhood of the Treman on the railroad making about $500 a month and damn times and me making 20 cents an hour to Mary's daughter I know that would never work and her mother was very she's a nice lady and she uh she was kind of one of these high societies you know and prissy like you know so she didn't have much use for me anyhow I was just an old plain SAS for ass country boy and she thought hope ought to go with a little better classy boy and I I think she was right and so um but I didn't think it then so I thought well I don't know how I can't ask your daddy and I'm sure I'm not going to ask your mother and so I got to ask her first so I wrote me a letter that morning on the road to work I dropped it in the mailbox the mail we was going to church Wednesday night and as on Monday morning I tried all day Sunday to tell her that I wanted to get married and I just couldn't get up enough nerve so then I dropped it in the mail box and all at work that day I happened to think what if her mother got a hold that letter oh my then I know I was ruined if if she ever got a hold of it because she didn't care too much about me well I was just sweating it out and that Wednesday night when I come oh my I thought how am I going to go up there if her mother got a hold of that letter she'll really work me over so I hope she got it I dressed it to hope that was her name hope and so I said I'll just ride out here to Hope and so and I thought maybe she might have not have got a hold of it so I know better than to stop outside and blow the horn for her to come out oh my and any boy that hasn't gotten nerve enough to walk up to the house and knock on the door and ask for the girl ain't got no business being out with her anyhow it's exactly right that's so silly that's cheap and so I stopped my old forge you know and I had it all shined up so I went up and knocked at the door mercy your mother come the door I couldn't hardly catch but I said H how do you do Miss from she said how do you do William I oh William and uh and she said will you step in I said thank you I stepped in inside the door I said is uh uh hope just about ready and just then here come hope skipping through the house just a girl at 16 and uh she said hi Billy I said hi hope I said you about ready for church said just in a minute I thought oh my she never got it she never got it good good good hope never got it either so it'll be all right cuz she have named it to me so I felt pretty fair and then when I got out of church I happened to think what if she did get it see I couldn't hear what Dr Davis is saying I look over at her and I thought if maybe she's just holding it back and she's really going to tell me off when I get out of here for asking her that and I couldn't hear what Brother Davis was saying uh and I look over at her and I thought my I hate to give her up but and I I The Showdown sure to come so after church we started walking down the street together going home and and um so we walked to the old Lord and it's all along the Moon is shining bright soon I look over and she's pretty boy I look at her I thought my how I would like to have her but guess I can and so I walk on a little further you know and I look up at her again I said H how you feeling tonight she said oh I'm all right and we stopped the old fort down we start to get out snow around sidewalk around the corner go to her house and I was walking up to the door with her I thought you know she she probably um never got the letter so I just might as well forget it I'll have another week of Grace anyhow so I got feeling pretty good she said uh Billy I said yeah she said uh I got your letter oh my I said you did she said uh-huh well she just kept walking up never said another word I thought woman tell me something run me away or tell me what you think about I said um did you uh did you read it she said uh-huh my you know how a woman can keep in suspense oh I I didn't mean it it's that way you see see but anyhow you know I I thought why don't you say something see I kept going on I said did you read it all uhhuh so he almost to the door and I thought boy don't get me on the porch cuz I might not be a able to outrun them so you tell me now and so I kept waiting and um she said Billy I would love to do that she said I love you God bless her soul now she's in glory she said I love you said I think we ought to tell our par the parents about it don't you think so and I said honey listen let's start this out with a 5050 proposition I said I'll tell you daddy if you'll tell your mother rooting the worst part off on her to begin with she said all right if you'll tell Daddy first I said all right I'll tell him Sunday night and so Sunday night come I brought her home from church I she kept looking at me and I looked it's 9:30 is time for me get going so Charlie was sitting his desk typing away and Miss Brownback sitting over the corner doing some kind of a crocheting you know or them little hooks you put over the things you know I don't know what you call it and so she was doing some of that kind of stuff and hope kept looking at me she'd frown at me you know motion to her daddy and oh my I thought what if he says no so I started out through the door I said well I guess I better go and I walked to the door and and uh she started over the door with me she'd always come to the door and tell me good night so I start the door and she said aren't you going to tell him and I said I said I'm sure trying to but I I I don't know why I'm going to go to do it and she said I'll just go back and you call him out so she walked back and left me standing there and I said um Charlie you turned around and said yeah Bill I said uh could I talk to you just a minute he said sure he turned around from his desk Miss BR back looked at him looked toward hope looked at me I said uh would you come out on the porch he said yes I'll come out so he walked out on the porch I said sure is a pretty night isn't he said yes it is I said sure been warm certainly has looked at me and I said I've been working so hard I said you know me my hands is getting callous he said you can have her [Music] bill oh my you can have her I thought oh that's better I said you really mean it Charlie he said I said Charlie look I know she's your daughter and you got money and he reached over and got me by the hand he said Bill listen money ain't all things that's in human life he said I said I said Charlie I I only make 20 cents an hour but I love her she loves me I promise you Charlie that I'll work till these the calluses wear off of my hands to make her living I'll be just as true to her as I could be he said I believe that bill he said listen bill I want to tell you said you know happiness don't all together take money to be happy so just be good to her and I know you will I said thank you Charlie I sure will do that and it's her time to tell Mama I don't know how she got by but we got married so when we got married we didn't have nothing nothing go housekeeping I think it had two2 or three do so we rented a house it cost us $4 a month it was a little old two room place and someone give us an old folding bed I wonder if anybody ever seen an old folding bed and they gave us that and I went out to Sears and roll bus and got a little uh table with four chairs and it U it wasn't painted you know and we got that on time and so then I went over to Mr Weber a junk dealer and bought a cooking stove I paid. 75 cents for it and a dollar and something for grates to go in we set up housekeeping I remember taking a painting a shamrock on the chairs when I paint him and oh we were happy we had one another so that's all necessary God by his Mercy and his goodness where the happiest Little Couple could be on the earth I found this that happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with a potion that's lotted to you and after a while God came down and blessed our little home we had a little boy his name is Billy Paul it's in the service right now here and uh a little later from that about 11 months he blessed us again with a little girl called Sharon Rose taken from the word of the Rose of Sharon and I remember one day I had saved up my money and I was going to take a little vacation going up to a place Papa Lake to fish and on my road back and doing this time I'm leaving out my conversion I was converted and was ordained by Dr Roy Davis and the Missionary Baptist Church and had become a minister and had the Tabernacle that I now preach in in Jeffersonville and um I was pastoring the little church and I no money I pastored the church 17 years and never got one penny I didn't believe in take there wasn't even an offering plate in it and what tithings I had from work and so forth had a little box on the back of the building said little sign on it in so much as you have done the least of these my little ones you have did it unto me and then that's how the church was paid for we had 10 years loan to pay it and was paid off less than two years and I never took an offering of no kind and then I had few dollars I saved up for my vacation she worked too at fine shirt factory a lovely darling girl and her grave is probably snowy today but she's still in my heart and I remember when she worked so hard to help me to have enough money to go up to this Lake to fish and when I was coming back from the lake I begin to see coming into Mishawaka South bin Indiana and I began to notice cars that had signs on the back said Jesus only and I thought that sounds strange Jesus only and I begin noticing those signs and his own anywhere from bicycles Fords Cadillacs and what more Jesus only and I followed some of them down and to come to a great big church and I found out they were Pentecostal I'd heard of Pentecostal but they were a bunch of Holy Rollers they laid on the floor and froed their mouth and everything that they told me about so I didn't want nothing to do with it so I heard them all carrying on in there and I thought believe I'll just walk in so I stopped my Ford and walk walked in and all the singing you ever heard in your life and I come to find out there were two great churches one of them called a PA of JC and the PA of w many of you people might remember those old Argan I think they're United call now I called the United Pentecostal Church well I listen to some of their teachers they were standing there oh they were teaching about Jesus and how great he was and how great everything was and about a baptism of the Holy Ghost I thought what are they talking about and after a while somebody jumped up and started speaking with tongues well I never heard anything like that in my life and here comes some woman up through there running just as hard as she could then all of them got up and started running I thought well brother they sure ain't got no church manners screaming and shouting and carrying on I thought what a bunch this is but you know something about it longer I sit there the better I liked it there was something seemed to be real good and I began to watch him and it went on I thought I'll just bear with him a while cuz I I'm close the door if anything starts just rational I'll run out the door I know where my car is parked just around the corner and I begin to hear some of them preachers as Scholars and students well I thought that's fine so it comes supper time and said everybody come to supper but I thought wait a minute I got $1.75 to go home and I that's all I had for gasoline money just taking that to take me home I had my old Ford it was a pretty good old Ford it wasn't backslid it just like this one out here just wore out and it I actually believe that Ford would go 30 m an hour but of course that was 15 this way and 15 this way you see but it together you had 30 and so it um I thought well that night I think I would go out and after the I stayed for the night service and all he said all of the preachers regardless of denomination come to the plat on well there's about 200 of us up there I went up and so he said now we haven't got time for y'all to preach he said just walk by and say who you are and where you from well it come my time I said William brandom Baptist Jeffersonville Indiana walk by I hear all the rest of them calling themselves Pentecostal Pentecostal Pentecostal PFW PC PW I walked by I thought well I guess I'm the ugly ducklin so I sat down waited and that day they had fine young preachers out there and they preached powerfully and then they said the ones going to bring the message tonight is I believe they called him Elder and the ministers instead of Reverend it was Elder they brought an old colored man out there he had one of these oldfashioned preachers coats I don't guess you ever seen one long pigeon tail in the back you know with a velvet collar and he had just a little white rim of hair around his head poor old fell cannot like this you know what he stood there and he turned around and where all the preachers have been preaching about Jesus and the great how great he was and so forth that old man took his text from over in job where was you when I laid the foundation of the world or when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy the poor old fell I thought why did they put some of them young fellas up there to preach great the places packed in jam and I thought why didn't they do that so then uh this old fell instead of preaching what was going on down here on Earth he begin to preach what was going on in the heaven all the time well he Tu him up at the beginning at the beginning of time and brought him back in the second coming down the horizontal rainbow I never heard such preaching in my life about that time the spirit hit him he jumped about that high and clicked his heels together thrown his shoulders back went tipping off that platform said you haven't got room enough up here for me to preach and he had more room than I got here I thought if that'll make an old man act like that what would he do if he got on me I don't know maybe I need some of that while he come out there I felt so sorry for the old fell but when he left I was feeling sorry for myself and I looked at him go off there I went out that night and I thought now the next morning I'm not going to let nobody know where who I am so I went that night I pressed my trousers I took went out in the cornfield to sleep and I went out and bought me some stale rolls you bought a whole bunch of them for a nickel there's a hydrant down there I got some water so I know that would last me a little while so I got me some water and drank it and went eat my rolls and come back down another drink of water went out in the corn field tuck the two seats and laid my little sear sucker trousers in there pressed them on the seat and that night I prayed prer all night I said Lord what is this I got into I never seen such religious people in my life and I said help me to know what this is all about and the next morning I got on there invited us for breakfast of course I wouldn't come eat with him because I had nothing to put in the offering and I just went back and the next morning when I went in my I eat some of my rolls and sat down and there's got on a microphone and i' never seen a microphone before and I was scared of that thing so they and had a little string hanging up here and hanging down one of drop mics like and he said last night on the platform there was a young preacher here a Baptist I thought uhoh I'm good for working over now and said um he was the youngest preacher on the

honey a whole string of invitations them people he said they're not holy rollers are they I said I don't know what kind of rollers they are but they got something that I needed see I said that that's one thing I'm sure I said I've seen an old man 90 years old come young again I said I never heard such preaching in my life why I never seen a Baptist preach like that I said they preach till they get out of breath and bend their knees Plumb to the floor and come back up catch your breath you can hear them two blocks away still preaching and I said I I never heard such in my life I said they speak in an unknown tongue and the other one tells what they're talking about never heard such in my life I said will you go with me she said honey when I married you I will stick with you until death shall separate us she said I'll go she said and we'll tell the folks and I said you tell your mama and I'll tell my mama so we I went and told Mama mama said well sure Billy whatever the Lord's called you to do go do and so miss brombach asked for me to come up well she said what's this you're talking about and I said oh miss brumbach I said you all ever seen such people she said quieten down quiet and down I said yes ma'am I said I'm sorry and she said do you know that's a bunch of Holy Rollers I said no ma'am I didn't know that I said they they sure are fine people she said the very idea you think you'd drag my daughter out amongst stuff like that said ridiculous that's nothing but trash that the other churches are throw out she said indeed you'll not drink my daughter out like that I said but you know Miss brumbach down in my heart I feel that the Lord wants me to go with them people she said you go back up to your church until they're able to afford a parsonage for you and act like a man's got some sense said you're not taking my daughter out through there I said yes ma'am I turned around walked out and hope started crying and she come out she said Billy regardless of what mama says I'll stay with you bless her heart and I said oh that's all right honey I just let it go she wouldn't let her daughter go with such people as that because it wasn't nothing but trash and so I just kind of Let It Go was the worst mistake I ever made in my life one of the worst a little later few years after the children come and one day we was they come up a flood in 1937 there came a flood and our I was was on patrol at that time and I was trying my best to bring the people out of the flood houses tearing down and my own wife tuck sick and she was real real sick with pneumonia and they tuck her out the regular hospital so full we couldn't put her in there so we taken her out to the government where they had a room out there and so then they called me back out and I always lived on the river and caught a Boatman so I was trying to get the people rescue him from the flood and then I want they called me said there's a house over on chest the Street's about ready to go in there's a mother and a bunch of children in there I said if you think your boat your motor can get into them I said well I'll do all I can and I shooting those waves of D could broke up there and oh my the just washing the city out and I would give it all the juice that I could and finally down across the alleys and through the places and I got there close to where the old Levy was the water pouring through and I heard someone scream I seen a mother stand out on the porch there's that big rollers going through like that well I went on up this way as far as I could and hit the stream and come back and got on that side I got my boat stopped just in time to tie it around the pillar of the post of the door post or porch post and I run in and grabbed the mother and got her in there two or three of the children and I Unum my boat and got her to back come out way down below and got her over to the shore about a mile and a half across the city I got her to the shore and now when I got over There She

hats and brother SAR and bought me one yesterday first one I've had and ever had it like that one of them kind of western hats and I thought I was going down along through the Prairie of singing that song There's a wheel on the wagon is broken sign on the ranch for sale and as it went along I noticed an old covered wagon like a old Prairie Schooner and the wheel was broke of course that represented my broken the family and as I got close I looked there stood a a real pretty young girl about 20 years old white flowing hair and blue eyes dressed in white I looked over at her I said how

home tired from work or something I caught her by the hands of I said honey I seen Sharon down there I said she made a pretty girl didn't you she said yes Bill she said Bill put her arms around me and

it'll be all right Bill she said just promise me you won't weary no more and she said won't you sit down and I looked around and there's a great big chair and I remember I tried to buy a chair now in closing I tried to buy a chair one time we just had them old old common wooden bottom chairs from that breakfast set we had to use them all the chairs we had and we could buy one of these chairs that let back in the back like a uh I forget what kind of easy rest chair and it cost $17 you could pay $3 down and a dollar a week and we got one and all when I come in I'd work all day and preach till midnight around streets and wherever I could preach and and I one day I got behind on my payments we couldn't make it and it got day after day and finally one day they come and got my chair and tuck

I went to the door and my chair was gone she told me up there she said you remember that chair bill and I said yes honey I remember that's what she's thinking about was yeah said well we won't take

in the room she started patting me she said you go make me that promise bill promise me you won't marry wor no more I said I promise you and when then she patted me two or three times and she was gone I jumped up and turned on the light looked everywhere she was gone but she just gone out of the room she isn't gone she's still living she was a Christian Billy and I went to the Grave here some time ago packing a little Little Flower for his mother and sister just on the Easter morning and we stopped the little fellow started crying he said Daddy my mom is down there I said no honey no she ate down there sister ate down there we got a folded over grave here but way across the sea there's an open grave where Jesus rose and someday he'll come he'll bring sister mama with him I'm on the battlefield today friends I I just can't tell anymore God bless you let's bow our heads a minute oh Lord many times Lord I'm sure people don't understand when they think these things come easy but there's a great day coming when Jesus shall come and all these Sorrows will be wiped away I pray heavenly father that you help us to be prepared and that last promise when I kissed her on the cheek that morning and I'd meet her there that day I believe she'll be standing at that post screaming my name I've lived true to that promise sense Lord around the world in all kinds of places trying to bring the gospel getting old now tired of wore out one of these days I'm going to close this Bible for the last time God keep me faithful to the promise Keep Your Grace around me Lord let me not look at the things of this life but live for the things that's beyond help me to be honest I don't ask for flower bed of ease no Lord when my Christ died there under suffering all the rest of them died like that I don't ask for any easy thing just let me be honest Lord truthful let people love me so I can lead them to thee and someday when it's all over and we gather around her the evergreen trees I want to get her by the hand and walk her up to the show the people of edgeless Temple and all the others it'll be a great time man I pray that your mercies rest upon each of us here and those who are here Lord may not even know you maybe they've got some little love one across the sea Yonder if they've never fulfilled their promise may they do it now Lord amen been a long time since I listened to that you know the message didn't come without a price and then our Salvation didn't come without a price this message didn't come without a price and we can't pack it without a price I thank God somebody was willing to pay the price man God wouldn't let that man go wrong because he loved that man but he wouldn't let that man go wrong cuz he loved me see how much God loves us I thank God I thank God for a man who would surrender himself wasn't easy and he didn't do it right wasn't wasn't going about it always the right way but God kept him lined up to protect that gift for me and you he learned he said the way of a transgressor is hard should have obeyed but the grace of God restored our brotherr the mercy of God would let him meet his wife in a dream to know that they're okay even in chastisement God is still tender and merciful even in correction he still loves us I can't wait to meet him when we get to the married supper of the Lamb I can't wait to say thank you for staying true he said Lord just let me be honest not asking for a flowy bed of ease when my Christ suffer but just keep me honest and keep me true how many of you want to pray the same thing Lord I I can't expect it to be easy it never was easy but Lord please help me to be true cuz without you we can't do it ourselves now you see what brother Brenham opened with the scripture here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come we must go beyond the camp and be joined to him just as we close can we turn to Hebrews 13 together been many years I don't know how many years but many many years since I heard this testimony really it impacted me I remembered most of it maybe not all of it but it hit me with impact again tonight and I thank God for dropping in my heart to play it when you listen to that what's the point of fussing about the message what's the point of having our own ideas and fussing and striving and pushing and pulling what's the point what are we doing God wanted us to get the truth and God watched after that man and when he stepped to the side he corrected him so hard so hard so that he would stay true to the word so that we would have a pure message amen I thank God I thank God and all I want if God will help me I just want to be true I know I can't do it by myself I can't do it in My Own Strength I know I've failed a thousand times but oh if God will just help me I just want to be true true to the end and stay true to his word I want to follow the example that God gave us in his Prophet what an example what a life that we saw lived for Christ and he was honest about it he didn't tell us just the highlights he told us the good parts and the bad parts the successes and the mistakes told us where he went wrong and he told us what God did for him and he didn't take credit for anything he gave it all to God he took credit for his mistakes but not for any success what an example God gave us you know what I want more than anything I want to follow that example I want to walk in that same path I want God to help me be true be humble be sincere stay honest and I can't do it by myself I thank God that he loves us let's turn back to Hebrews 12 and I just want to look at this and I was just had this thought even about the correction that the prophet went through he was corrected he was wrong he disobeyed the Lord he listened to his mother-in-law and he suffered greatly for it but I don't think God ever quit loving him but and Hebrews chap 12 verse 1 says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run the race with patience let us with patience run the race that is set before us looking into Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God we have a great cloud of witnesses one of those Witnesses is our brother Brandon and seeing that we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin that does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and how do we run looking un Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him who hath endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your mind what's Paul saying Paul just got through with Hebrews chap 11 by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Enoch by faith then he gets down to the end of this and he starts to say who through faith subdued kingdoms brought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of line quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised the life again and others were tortured not having Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scorings yay moreover bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens of caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that without us that they without us should not be made perfect right after he talks about the Affliction and the torment and the destitute and affliction and goat skins and he tells us seeing that you have this great company of witness went before lay aside the sin and the weight that so and let us run the race with patience look at the examples that we've had we surely can endure the little things we're enduring now then he goes verse three now let's go down here for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds you have not resist resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scores every son whom he receiveth there's an interesting transition that takes place in the scripture here it's fascinating said consider him Jesus verse three who endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds he said don't get weary resisting sin for you have not resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation was speak unto you as into the children my son despise not the chastening of the Lord immediately he goes with us resisting sin and don't be weary keep pressing right to the chastening of the Lord what are we supposed to not get weary in we're supposed to not get weary and God bringing us back to the path correcting us when we go wrong chasing us why because he loves us he chastened the prophet cuz he loved him he says let's read now again in verse six for whom the Lord loveth he chasten and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for who for what son is he whom the father chasethe be without chastisement where of all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed telling us lift up your hands strengthen your knees walk on a straight even path unless that which is lame be turned unless your own limping drive you off but he says rather let it be healed said oh God let my limping be healed keep me on the straight path Lord if you you have to chasing me you've chasen me you had to chasen the prophet you chasen him but oh God that's your love for us that was your love for us to keep us where we needed to be thank God that the prophet was so honest about his life so

that God would chasen him and correct him and help him and encourage encourage him and gift him and teach him he would do all of that cuz it was so important but you know another role that's really important to play that's the role of an end time bride there's got to be a people on this Earth that come into the stature of a perfect man there has to be a people on this Earth a many membered bride there must be according to the scriptures according to the message there must be a people that come to the stature of a perfect man that come into adoption to bring about the fullness of adoption and in doing so there has to be a people who are the very reflection of Jesus Christ in Flesh on this [Music] Earth he can't give up on us amen just like he couldn't give up on brother bham because he had to fulfill that purpose he can't give up on us there's a purpose for us to fulfill and he can't let us go on into error and he can't let us keep doing he has to correct us and bring us back to the purpose it wasn't just for the Prophet this is for you and I this is God's tender mercy and love I thank God He Didn't Throw the Clay Away he couldn't throw the Clay Away because this lump of clay was predestinated to manifest The Life of Christ in the end time will he break it yes will he smush it back down on the wheel yes and will it hurt yes but oh praise God nothing is going to stop his predestinated person purpose for us and I believe with all my heart with everything that's in me there is going to be a people on this Earth that will be so much like him they will be him the Potter
