little bit ago and uh meetings went really wonderfully so thank you all for praying and he's uh ready to come home he misses everybody i think the feeling is amen you'll be happy to know a few of you said amen so that's good well always an honor and a privilege to come be with you for a little bit this evening i uh like always i have such a wonderful time walking with the lord with inspiration and then i get just nervous so bad it's amazing how many things you can think to say right brother on before you ever come to a pulpit and then it's amazing how your brain just goes blank and you're like i don't know what i would possibly say and so it's just an interesting thing so i've just uh i've had a wonderful time i do appreciate the opportunity the lord gives me to just spend that little time kind of close the world off you just shut the door you say hey let the world go by whatever happens happens i'm just shutting myself in with him for a little bit there's just nothing more more happy no other place i'd rather be than that so everybody feel good okay so if it's okay we're gonna it's a little bit of a different uh um i can tell i feel a little different today so it's a i like to do bible study if that's okay just something really simple i have a request from my daughter and she hates it when i say i i have anything you know she doesn't like the fact that i bring up her name she said daddy will you just preach something simple tonight and i says okay okay so i already had my subject before she said that nonetheless but uh it could be a little bit of a simple subject but it's something that gave me a lot of joy as i've been looking at it for the last couple days and just feeding on it and and i hope it can be a blessing to you is my prayer and i don't want to go long i know it's a wednesday night and everybody's maybe tired but there's just nothing that gives us more joy in life in the word so if you could turn in your bibles to revelations chapters 8. revelations chapters eight and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour and then the next verse first thessalonians 4 13 i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words if you will just bow your heads for a word of prayer heavenly father lord we just come before you lord this evening always with grateful hearts father lord it is our greatest honor and privilege to know that we have been called out by your grace and father the world is in darkness but your children are not in darkness father lord we are children of the light and we continue to press towards that light and father i just want to submit myself to you and the people tonight father would you come down and do those supernatural things that only you can do you can take an ignorant person like myself and you can use my lips and you could speak just those things that you want your children to know father i pray that you would do that and lord may you just encourage us one another father lord if there be any amongst us that's down father may you lift up their heads and may they be able to look up and realize their redemption hath drawn nigh father we sure love you we thank you for these opportunities we pray lord your blessings upon brother chad father as he travels home bring him home safely to us father lord may we be able to say like those that came from armas did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way so father god continue to break the word and only the way that you can do it and lord open our eyes that we can see thee we love you we thank you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated i uh uh i have a little title for tonight um and i have a powerpoint so sorry i did i did put a powerpoint okay there there we go uh i have a little thought here tonight that i'd like to talk to you a little bit and kind of has happened by some different things that i've seen and some things that i ministered the last time that i was here and my title for tonight is into the light behind the veil into the light behind the veil and i i'm opening my scripture obviously with the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about the space of a half an hour not a full half an hour but about the space of a half an hour and i'm bringing your attention to for to second thessalonians to shout the voice and the trumpet brother bam said he does all three while he is descending and so the reality of it that that we would be quickened we would be caught up at that time when he comes back and i am i i want to just start real slow and real simple to get to this thought and so here's where my my daughter gets her wish this is a very simple scripture that all of you know and i hope you know but i'm finding out that this is a vitally important scripture for us all in the day that we live in thy word is a lamp until i feet and a light unto my path pretty simple but the reality of it is the word is always shining the light in a few steps ahead of you and you must continue to walk in those few steps that's being right in front of you and the first john 1 5 says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin this is a basic scripture that you know also well this is i would say probably one of the most known scriptures i would say amongst message believers along with jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so these two immutable scriptures that god never changes and the reality of it is he continually unveils himself and he continually is shining a bright and shining light and he expects and requires his children to consistently and constantly be walking in that light wherever that light continues to move and i begin to find that there's something that i realize there's there's quite a spirit to always want to just stop and find comfort and rest where you were and not continue to move where he is and um i uh oh well let's just keep going if that's okay and i'll say some other things here once we i lay some more foundation and feast of the trumpets brother braham says oh father if there's a person here this morning that just taken some superstition some theological influence or some theologian's word which is contrary to the word of god and they don't know the real christ the real holy spirit it isn't revealed to them the word yet oh oh how the word is to be in this day they see only a tradition they're living in the light that's blinding like the greatest robbery that has ever been done in the world was in england it was caused by a false light and the greatest robbery your church has ever had has been when they've taken a denominational light and refused the genuine light of the bible the christ so the greatest robbery that ever happened in the world was caused by a false light and the church fails in its commission to continually walk in the light by a glare of another day so we look at this and just continuing this up we see that when when enoch was building the the the pyramid in the wilderness remember i spoke about that there was a there was a third walk to enoch's journey and the first uh 0-65 he walked as other men walked he did his own thing but at the birth of his son methuselah he began to walk with the lord and we all know what he was doing for those 300 years brother banham said he was building a pyramid he was a prophet of god and he could look up into the heavens god's first bible and see the stars and see that god was in the stars and how god's entire expression in the bible was first written in the stars and being a prophet he could take what he saw of god and bring it into a physical form upon this earth but it only took him up so high what he could bring into a physical manifestation was the the body of christ right and he brought that into a place but yet he was still in this dimension but then it came another point in enoch's journey where enoch walked with god again and if you go read that you'll find that that is true he was walking with god through seven church ages yes but he began to walk with god again and that beginning to that walk took him into a body change that was a capstone ministry that was a third pole ministry that was the unveiling of the mysteries of god the seven seals loosed the seven thunders uttering their voices and it brought a dimensional change for enoch and so when i was looking at this i'm realizing that you can never stop walking in the light as he is in the light and we know that brother branham was the seventh angel to the seventh church age right now brother brandon made a call and he said i'm building a platform for someone else to come upon right so when anybody says that you always kind of think of an eighth messenger well i believe in an eighth messenger it was jesus christ christ was that eighth messenger brother branham was laying a platform for another one to come so that brother branham can say i must decrease he must increase follow the lamb wherever the lamb you must wherever the lamb goes you must go wherever he goes you must continue from this point on so brother branham wasn't ever trying to draw people to himself or get a church or get a group of people all gathered together that could believe all the stories and believe all the miracles and believe all the tying up of the loose sins brother branham was gathering a people to point them to a person jesus christ to take them into the fullness of the word and fully possess the land that they were ordained to take that's the open book that was the ministry of this that was brother branham's commission and that was his goal to see to it that he could properly hand this woman off to this man in a marriage and in a union and so i this is this this is where it gets strange for me and you all know i'm strange so i have embraced that fully um so the last time i preached i said something sorry let me just take a drink of water i had um i said some things that i did not even know that i had said until after i had said it and then it started to come together for me and now i'm not a highly detail-oriented individual that's not my nature my nature is i notice things i see big pictures but then when it comes to the details i bow out and i say there's many other brothers more qualified than me but for some reason he started to draw my attention to some mathematics and i shared this with the brother that for some reason me a guy who's not that great with math or the ability to put all the details together i'm seeing numbers jumping out at the off the page to me and i don't know why and if you remember what i had said was i said now um i was telling the story of lazarus and i said you know look here comes the seventh seal coming in the fourth day lazarus in the grave okay lazarus corruption had set in here's the seventh seal coming on the on the fourth day and and what if you play out the story a little bit well what is seven times four brother brian 28 right he knew it he wasn't stalling he knew it so it's 28 7 times 4 is 28 and so then i began to look and my wife was the one who reminded me she said do you realize where your scripture came from tonight because you said i have i want to draw special emphasis to this scripture well i just read the scripture but i didn't notice the verse the master has come and he calleth thee is verse 28 and it's the coming of the lord and it's the coming of the lord at certain time and he's coming in secret and he's calling a woman martha to come unto him and martha he gets asked the question have you recognized your day and its message and she when she recognizes her day and her message she realizes the present tense i am is here now we're not waiting for him to come and when she recognizes her day in the massive message she goes quickly on behalf of of the lord jesus christ to her sister mary and bids her secretly saying the master is come and he calleth for thee and so i'm odd i'm like wow that is so interesting because in my heart i wanted to take from what i said the last time into the seventh seal and here i'm realizing 28 uh here we are this is all coming together so i want to take some time and just look at some mathematics are you okay with that do you think that that's bible do you think the prophet of god said god hides himself in mathematics okay good notice how mysteriously and how mathematically it fits right into the scripture exactly now i want you to remember he is bringing this out in the beginning of the seventh seal exactly you believe in god's mathematics if you don't you're sure lost if you get lost you'll you'll get lost in the word if you start putting your fours or sixes or something besides just the mathematical words running in order you'll sure have have on your scene a cow picking grass up in the tree on top of a tree somewhere you'll certainly run out because god does not his whole word does not does run completely in mathematics yes sir perfect most perfect there's no other literature written like it and so perfect in mathematics okay can i keep going amen bible study not knowing brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god reveal not knowing of course being spiritual you you watch spiritual things not knowing this god knows it but if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second pole and the third pole is at hand see brother bannon begins to sing the song the second poll has been manifested and remember the song goes up an octave higher did you notice the spirit took the song same song and picked it up an octave higher like that the next pole is at hand amen now i put that picture not for you but for me because i do not understand music at all but we can see that an octave i guess there's seven notes right and a key is that right and then an octave would be the same notes just in a higher pitch right which would technically be an eighth note if you're moving from the first seven notes into the eighth right am i okay with that music people are shaking their heads i got it halfway close so brother branham is noticing and christ is the mystery of god revealed here that the second poll is over we're going into the third poll ministry and so we're entering into the eighth we're going into an octave higher the eighth uh an eighth note we'll put it that way and i had um i just so yeah i'm very transparent i had a dream and i had a dream the other day and these numbers like i'm not i'm not drawn to this stuff so i don't understand and i started i started talking in my dream to some brothers and then and i was talking to these brothers and one of the brother i knew two of these brothers and so one of these brothers he was saying brother i have a hard time with you keep saying eighth day you keep saying eighth day i said well i understand you're probably tripping up on the terminology i said it's just terminology you're tripping up on he said well i can't see anything other than seven church ages i said okay i understand that but remember that's in time i said if you and i took a pen and i took and i remember this whole thing i took a pen i said now look one has a starting point and an ending point two a starting point an ending point three starting point ending point four starting point ending point five six seven i said but eight there's no beginning and no end it just continues on so it's not back to a time limit of days it's back into eternity back into the mind of god back into that which has no beginning and no ending time is blending into eternity here and so i i was just interested that you know i don't do stuff like that i don't think numbers or dream about numbers but i began to realize you know eighth day is another one of those scarecrows that scares people anytime you say eight and we're going into the eighth day but jesus stood up on the eighth day of the great feast and said come unto me right he stood up and proclaimed his hour and his day and that he was here now and so i would like to continue if this is okay after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter now i want to stop you in this and look at this john in revelations 4 is saying after this after what is the question after what was after seven church ages after seven church ages there's a voice calling him to come up higher now here's my question did the voice did not say go up higher the voice said come up higher now jesus said i come quickly i come quickly i come quickly through the the first seven church ages right and then he comes to the seven church age and he says i'm at the door knocking come unto me right so if any man will open the door i will sup with him and and commune with him so here he is he's calling you calling you calling you now when noah went into the ark god said come into the ark he did not say go into the ark the bible says he said come into the ark if he said come into the ark where was god god was in the ark he was bidding him to come in unto him he didn't say go into he said come into and here in revelations 4 he's saying come up hither and when he comes up hither immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat upon the throne he finds himself in before the throne and if you keep reading down through there the seven golden candlesticks there's the four and 20 elders we are back in the same scene of the tabernacle in the wilderness everything has been brought back to this point still okay still cruising with numbers so um brother branham obviously in uh the cloud and then brother chad preaches the cloud on wednesday after i preach come on the masters come and call us for thee and i had uh this with about four other things that i just felt to stop when i stopped and i didn't go into it and then so brother chad goes into the cloud and the brother brother ben brings out that you're the words in the book and better not add to it or take away from that great revelation see it's not so much i i agree we also don't want to be found adding to this revelation let's say put it this way we don't want to add to this word because we are the words in the book and we are the expression of his desire but we also don't want to take away so many times it's so hard for us to realize that we are a part of this great plan of god and we are the expression of his desire and so many times we just have a hard time realizing the importance we have in the picture of christ but i just want to continue with this now february 28th is when brother branham was caught up into the cloud 1963 now remember february 28th now if we continue on here these are some things brother brother franco help me with in getting some of this uh information um now weather-wise was a magazine and here's what i believe that meteorologist said he said the cloud lay right at the base of the region of exclusion that's a fancy way for saying it was too high for moisture i believe for water drops and ice particles in that layer where temperatures are so warm that saturation vapor pressures exceed ambient pressures ain't that that sounds smart if this if this was in fact the aftermath of the thor explosion persistence of circulation of con and of condensate for nearly four hours of downward draft would be of considerable meteorological interest means it ain't possible and us meteorologists would love to know how that's even possible so basically saying there's no moisture up that high guys it can't happen this is something we've never seen or never observed right so just want to continue dropping that thought in there there's no moisture up that high now in the science magazine it appeared again and it was obviously the 28th of february and the cloud it was just a red part and the cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset and i believe it was 28 miles in the air something close to that so it happened on february 28th it stayed in the sky past sunlight for 28 and um and i believe it was 28 it was 28 miles high now the number 28 which brother chad had brought this out before and some of this is just review i understand but obviously the number 28 is also the cycle of for a woman right her cycle is 28 days so it's a cycle of life and it just repeats over and over this cycle of life so 28 is the cycle of life and obviously this uh this this cloud appears in life magazine um and it appears on may 17th may 17th clearly the same day that noah went into the ark right so it was salvation for noah and his family but it was judgment for the world when that cloud came down it was calling me up higher but for the rest of the world he was the judge executing judgment upon all those that would reject the word of god right so he's doing both at the same time just continuing you know these pictures the so there was a cloud over um if you took the picture you could see there's the high cloud of mystery there's there's the cloud and then there's the rain there's a rainbow that was caused by the moon we all remember that um and what's interesting is the moon follows the same cycle of 28 days so this 28 days is a cycle that continues on from one uh from a new moon to another new moon right and for a lady it's a cycle that continues but remember it was 28 miles high it's too high for water moisture and uh it's just not possible possible meteorologically speaking so i had said something here the last time too in regards to that cloud about how in hebrews it says we are compassed about by a great cloud of witnesses and uh i wanted to to just drop this in here it says when he and acts it says when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said you men of galilee why stand you here gazing into heaven this same jesus which was taken up in the form from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go up he went up in a cloud he returns in a cloud and now there's two witnesses there that are rebuking those that continue to stand there looking at the cloud wondering what's it all about now remember this is not moisture it's too high for moisture and the bible says this that your know you not uh for what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little while and vanisheth away so god himself likens you to a vapor that's here for a short period of time and then it goes away and this vanisheth away is a greek word that means to vanish away or to snatch out of sight or to take out of you or to make one unseen in hebrews obviously we went through this in a great cloud of witnesses that are you know you not that you're compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses so then a brother texts me and says uh brother did you know brother branham said this in uh or from overseas and when i found i said praise god now i'm starting to see a picture here develop he says you see you say brother branham is that mythical he says no sir i'll show you in the scriptures here in a minute when he began to go up they only seen him but the old testament saints went with him for the bible said that he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men and i can see him as he goes up and joins with his church two angels of that band that were playing the music come back there and said ye men of galilee why stand you looking up for this same jesus that was taken up is coming again certainly they hurried back to join the procession and down through the skies jesus and the old testament saints went they passed the moon they passed the sun they passed the stars so those two those two uh witnesses came out of that cloud these were the two witnesses saying why stand you here gazing so the cloud was made up of the old testament saints that resurrected with jesus 2000 years ago so then continuing to follow this through what a resurrection that that was what a resurrection that this is what all is represented in this cloud and the reason why i'm asking this question is simply put because it the question is not to you what was the attraction on the mountain the question to you is what is the attraction on the mountain because truly it is the veil truly it is something that is a stumbling block for so many but for us it is the very gateway to bringing us into our promised land but it all comes down to a recognition of what is this all all about right so i want to look at this from a veil so y'all okay it's a little quiet i know it's a little different i'm sorry it's just a little different now brother branham says in the unveiling of god he says if a man walked through that veil it was sudden death okay it was sudden death now it's death not to go through it okay it was death before you went behind that veil now it is death if you do not go through it if you can't break the veil of tradition break through that wall of denomination to see god in his power it's death once where it was death to go in now it is death to stay out the whole mercy seat is setting in plain view anybody can see it the veil is rent glory to god the whole mercy seat comes into plain view so this is a very big statement where it was once death if any man should go behind the veil once the veil is rent you have to go and i want to bring this with that silence right so i had caught this the other morning when i was thinking about esther and obviously again i don't think i've been here preaching for the last six months or i don't mention esther so i thought hey let's just bring up esther again so here's the reality with esther esther had a um i i'd like to dramatize it a little bit for you you know she had uh she had lived her own life she was a um she lost her mom and dad she was taken up into the the raising of mordecai so she had no choice in the matter she was she had a just a life that was putting her on a certain path and a certain time came along she was a beautiful woman and she was taken because of her beauty she was taken into the presence uh to be a queen for the for the for the king and as she was there you know obviously they went through a purification process and she had nothing she could do about it it was out of her control they took her through a whole purification process there was nothing she could do about it and obviously the only thing she began to do was she didn't add anything to or take anything away from the instruction of haggai so she was the literal fulfillment of the instructions that haggai was giving and that was exactly what the king was looking for but it came to a certain point in time where she had come to a time where mordecai said for such a time as this if you do not go in unto the king you will surely die you see the parallel now she would die if she didn't and she would maybe die if she does but this one she had to make a choice this one she wasn't ushered in and brought in by the guards this was her own choosing she makes her own choice in this walk right because thou has chosen the harder way thou has walked in thine own choosing now has picked the correct and precise way right it is my way so esther was brought to a decision point now it's death if she doesn't and it's possibly death if she does but we don't know now just thinking if you went back in time and you're looking at the scene when uh when god was in his or when the king was on his throne he's working he had all probably all the scribes and he all the advisors there lots of people there advising him you had his maybe someone with refreshments there you probably had another person with a fan and they're fanning and you had all of these people around there you probably had the walls lined with guards and you probably had guards at the front and everywhere the whole throne room there's activity but what do you think happened when all of a sudden esther walks in do you think it went silent do you think the scribes kept writing do you think anybody kept doing anything do you think everybody was in awe and shock what is going on they were so awed by what is happening in this complete silence here comes esther now what's so beautiful about it if you notice esther continues to probably keep her eyes on the king she's probably not looking around she's keeping her eyes on the king and she's looking for one thing one action one movement she's waiting to see him lift that scepter and extend it to her in mercy and accept her and and he did and when he extended the scepter and accepted her in mercy what does he say he says esther what is it that you want i'll give you up to half of my kingdom you're a joint heir with me come sit with me on my throne help me rule right so in that moment of silence esther's going in behind the veil and she's meeting the king and she's finding out she's accepted and she is joining her with the king so in looking at that it was death if you didn't it was death if you did now it's death if you don't and noticing this moment of silence with esther and now where are we at so in continuing to look at this uh this these veils brother banham says here he says now in the seventh seal how how is he going to do it that's what we don't know isn't it we don't know it's even the time for all these things it's the ushering in of the millennium notice the breaking of the seal was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half an hour now it is great what is it it has hushed heaven there wasn't a thing that moved for half an hour now a half an hour might not be long if you're having a good time but in the suspense between life or death and life it seemed like a millennium it was so great jesus never mentioned it none of the rest of them john couldn't even write it no he was forbidden to write it here see there's just he just didn't write it but it was it's just in silence so looking at this journey to the throne because remember my my thought is back into the light behind the veil we recognize that there was uh there was a lion the ox the man and the eagle that were encamped about the old testament tabernacle here and everybody had to come in through the east and continue westward and you had to go past the the altar you had to go through the inner court and in the inner court was the seven golden candlesticks and it was a scary thing to think that you might have to pass the seventh golden candlestick to go into the shekinah light it's a very scary thing but i like i said the last time and i will repeat again the tying up of the loose sins was not the message that awakens the bride and there has to be something that you can realize is before you that you have to continue to walk into it is a scary scary thing to leave the light of seven golden candlesticks but it is exactly what he was calling us unto he was calling us back to the throne and it was death before you went in there now it's death if you don't go in there either way someone's going to die either you're going to die to your will and god's will will be done or vice versa what happens here so as we see this the the the the approacher is coming past the seven cold golden candlesticks and he's coming before this veil now the veil in the old testament tabernacle is made out of badger skins right badger skins and one thing about a badger is they're meaner than the devil himself if you know anything about badgers they're about the only thing that'll take on a lion they're so verocious and they're so aggressive and uh those badger skins guys guess what it's you um uh there's there's really you have no enemy other than you the one that you look at in the mirror you're your greatest enemy brother branham said he was his greatest enemy and the one you're looking to overcome is you and uh so i find that after the seven golden candlesticks the last enemy to be defeated as jesus was in the garden of cassette to me he said not my will but thy will be done father because thou has chosen the harder way the narrow way the house walked and thine own choosing it it is my way so what are you doing you're dying out to your own ways your own traditions your own comfort zones and realizing he's bidding me come i better start moving because he wants you back behind the veil and so continuing to look at this in exodus 26 looking at this veil this is this is just what caught me this veil it says in exodus 26 1 moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twined linen blue and purple and scarlet with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them the length of one curtain shall be eight and 20 cubits it's 28 cubits and the breadth shall be four cubits and every one of the curtains shall have one measure the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another so let me break that down for you it's 28 cubits high okay okay and there's there's there's a uh there's two four cubit wide um veils okay and they're five veils thick okay so 28 cubic ti and if you measure the width here you're eight eight cubits wide and there's five curtains sewn together okay you okay all right 28 there will be silence in heaven for the space of a about a half an hour okay now the seventh seal appears in the what chapter the eighth chapter which is also appears also this eight appears technically in revelations four because it's after seven church ages we are going into come up hither eternity but then this question begins to come what is the five and i sat there for a few minutes until we know this i mean five is grace okay but there's two curtains there's grace on this side and there's grace on this side grace grace so 28 cubits eight cubits wide two curtains screaming grace grace sound familiar so let's see where grace grace was it's in zechariah it's a story here about zerubbabel he said the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is waked out of his sleep and said unto me what siesta and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick of all gold with a bowl on top of it and seven lamps there on and seven pipes in the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so where is he he's back uh before the throne room and the two olive trees one one upon the right side of the bowl and one upon the left side and so i answered and spake unto the angel and talked with him saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts thou who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone therefore with shouting screaming grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came into me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his hands shall finish it the capstone and thou shalt know the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you so what was those two screens of five curtains grace grace the capstone amen so god in taking his elect out of pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word here comes the headstone crying grace grace amazing grace the headstone here you are like this see on there see how it was way wide down here let's talk about the pyramid it was real wide here at the base and it keeps getting closer and closer the ministry well after a while here here's luther justification justified here's wesley sanctifica sanctified bunch here comes the pentecostal restoration against gifts but now god is taking from here honing out a bunch to take a ministry just exactly like the word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride see take her up so i find it interesting i i can't understand exactly why i look at these these numbers the way i am and he continues he says the headstone crying grace grace that's passed from death and creed into the living word of the living god god's only provided plan for this age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something that's made alive seated now in heavenly places what does he say next in present tense this is not past tense this is not future tense this is now in present tense a word age back from after this seven golden candlesticks seven church ages now into a word age a bride age an eternal age back with christ himself behind the throne the veil has been rent we see the 28th day what it was the coming of the lord brother brown said revelations 10 here he comes as a mighty angel descending out of heaven on a cloud with a rainbow upon his head and he screameth and seven thunders uttered their voices the veil is being rent exposing the mercy seat it's once death if you didn't go now it's death if you don't you cannot stay where the seventh golden candlestick was if the veil is rent and he's calling you into the inner of the holy of holies you understand what i'm saying it's not possible anymore there might have been a time and that's the problem brother brahm says the foolish version becomes dilatory they become relaxed there's no more crying out in the spirit there's no more reaching out in the spirit there's no more longing to walk with him there's no more earnestly desiring contending you know paul was called up to the heaven of heavens and when he came back he still said i'm contending i'm earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints having not yet apprehending i press toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus there's something in the bride that continues to walk in the light as he is in the light so that we can have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses up all our sins amen so we don't stop we keep going we recognize that he's calling us he's bidding us to come the master has come he calleth for thee okay now let's see what i got here i'll just go to this now the breach between the seven church h's and the seven seals it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age all the loose ends that those church ages have ever have been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broke the myst and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ the one that brother branham was building a platform for setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember the seventh angel is on earth at the time of his coming okay so so here here's what i want you to look at and here's where i'm kind of basically coming to the seventh angel is coming down when the the seventh angel is here at the time of his coming so when you looked at this and he was breaking the seals this is the seventh angel this is the mighty angel i'm sorry the mighty angel coming down to loose the seven seals right now in that cloud remember the the seven angels made up the wig right brother bam said that the seven the seven angels make up his wig and also brother bam says one man can represent an entire generation right okay so what was represented in that wig white wigged one was the dead saints okay these dead saints were basically represented in that coming of the lord okay now brother branham was also caught up into that cloud so you have the dead and the living caught up at the same time turn in your bibles back now to thessalonians 2 thessalonians verse 15 for this we say unto you the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel in the in the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise okay the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet him together caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall ever we be with the lord so here is a resurrection of two the dead saints and the living at his appearing in the cloud so brother branham 1963 he gets caught up into the cloud here's one man representing an entire generation in the cloud as the living then there's also the seven gold there's the seven angels to the seven or seven church ages represented there as the dead saints that have been risen right so now you have both of them represented at this coming so then i go back and i look here to john please now turn back to john seven no 11. so if you look at chapters 11 verse 28 okay and when she had said so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee okay as soon as she had heard that she arose quickly and came unto him so what you find here is there are two arising there's a dead one and a living that come to him at this coming this is the coming of the lord it's found in verse 28 but it's also the time when lazarus the dead one is rise but there's also another one that's arisen and it's mary mary also recognizes his coming and she's caught up to meet him he comes she speaks is spoken to her secretly right and she leaves the house of misery and she meets him not out in the in the in the house of misery she goes out he comes halfway she goes out halfway there they meet mary is also risen at this coming so i don't know if i'm making any sense at all i i hope that i am it's just these pieces are starting to come together a little bit for me and i don't think i'm putting so many things that far off like i used to that now i'm seeing what is all this what does all this mean what is this what was this cloud not what was the attraction what is this attraction on the mountain is this my coming up too am i represented in brother branham when he got caught up into the cloud do you know the brother banh says about elijah he said elisha told elijah he said i want a double portion of your blessing he said if you see me going you will have your request so elisha never left his side elisha continued to stay with elijah wherever elijah went elisha went and they remember he's following him and he strikes the water in the jordan's part revealing the 12 stones they could pass through get to the other side of jordan elijah is there elisha's right beside him and here elisha goes up in a whirlwind not chariots of fire chariots of fire were there but it was a whirlwind that he got caught up into and we know that elisha saw this dimensional change because if you look at it remember when it's a dimension the the ferry the chariots of fire is another dimension they could see because gaze of the was the servant to elijah right and he could not see he said master we're compassed about with the enemy he said oh lord open his eyes and when he opened his eyes he saw that other dimension and that other dimension there was chariots of fire all around right so elijah sees elijah go up in a whirlwind then elisha elijah sorry takes his mantle casts it back down and what does elijah do elisha wow it's all right he rents his clothes he rents his old ideas he rents his traditions time for that to go away time to wrap myself in this mantle and move forward it's the opening of the word elisha went into it now he's coming back throwing back the same mantle and we know it's a mantle that he wrapped himself in because he takes that same mantle and he strikes the river jordan and the river jordan parts way and reveals the same path could it be he's riding that trail one more time could it be that elijah the spirit of elijah is now on elisha the bride and now she's wrapped in the mantle of god's word and she's going forward partying the water before him separating the way and showing the path that has been hidden in the word it looks to me like it it looks a lot like it and it's just a beautiful type for me to be looking at because remember brother balaam said may he crown my ministry with what may i be found clothing wrapping a bride in the word for your coming remember that he said that may you crown my ministry with clothing a bride in your word and so here's elijah throwing down the mantle and here he is wrapping himself in that same mantle parting going over jordan and going back and then so if you continue to look at this what i'm finding out is this secret mystery of his coming continues to go on and on but very quietly god's not making a lot of ruckus it's not a lot of noise and it's very simple it's very humble but it's the opening of the word and it just continues to open and continue to open so brother franco had made the comment he says you know brother it'd be really awesome if today was the 28th of september he did he said i'd have goosebumps all over if i knew it was the 28th but brother franco it's the 29th it's the 29th okay let's read verse 29 as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him so 28 was the sign of his coming but 29th is the time of her going you understand okay okay so i i i don't understand why i'm doing that i really don't i don't understand why i'm putting these things together the way they are um i just feel like i'm putting some stones out before you right i don't know it's like some pieces of the puzzle i just want to put out before you maybe someone else will come and stand upon it and be able to really put it together so that you could see it in a little bit greater light and i just wanted to also bring your attention some things that i just been looking at different things solomon's temple you know solomon's temple was built in seven years six months and there was something very interesting about solomon's temple it was a the quietest construction site you ever did see in your life because there was not a sound of a buzz saw there was not a sound of a chisel it was quiet everything just came together god was assembling his great dwelling place in silence everything was coming together in silence remember god does great big things in silence he brings up the sun in the rising of the sun and what is he doing he's calling up two million will say water droplets or maybe uh lives i don't know maybe vapors maybe your life is but a vapor just a thought maybe he said that for another reason but it's the rising of the sun and he can call up two million gallons of water quieter than you can pump a glass full he's just doing a lot of things in in silence it's just quiet it's just simple and so now i'm finding myself i think i could be wrong but it sure looks a lot like it that we are now finding ourselves again right before the veil and the veil is being rent and it's exposing the mercy seat and it's a a we'll put it this way it looks to be that such a time as this the veil is being rent and now it must be that time where we must be it's so hard to say not motivated it's not motivated we must recognize the purpose of brother banham's coming in the first place was to call a bride and unite her with isaac right i just want to drop this in so eliezer and isaac right in rebecca did you know the bible said or brother banham said that the angel of the lord went ahead of eliezer by about a half an hour he went ahead to prepare the woman to get her ready for the space of a half an hour about a half an hour maybe 28 minutes is my guess but i think it was about 28 minutes and so here he is preparing her and if you remember when she comes back eliezer prays a prayer and he says lord may the one that waters my camel and gives me water and waters my camel may she be the damsel that thou has chosen and when he comes up he says only one part of it he says will you give me a drink and she says oh sure i'll give you a drink and your camel's a drink what is this she caught the unspoken part there was something inside of her that could catch what was not spoken but yet was the word of the lord there was something inside of her that could catch the things that was not a public show it was not out there in the open as brother branham took that knight or that sword and he and he rent the top of it and he says light has never shined in on this what's going on i think i think god is getting rebecca ready and if you remember there was a temptation all these numbers i'm sorry these numbers so there was a temptation for her the temptation came when eleazar said it's time to go i'm going we're going now my master is old it's time to go isaac is looking for a wife we gotta go and what was the temptation to her her temptation came from her own family saying stay with us for 10 days just stay 10 days see taste feel smell here imagination conscious reasoning affections emotions what were the ten the twelve spies but there was ten lying spies that were deceived by what they could see but joshua and caleb said we're more than able to take this lamb because greater is he that is in us than he that is is before us basically right so there was rebecca's little temptation she had to overcome the ten spies so now we're walking by faith now we're seeing the opening of the word now the veil is rent and now she arose quickly and came unto him stand please i did not want to be long i achieved my goal i achieved my goal i'm sorry it was a very different i didn't feel the same anointing like i usually do and you guys feel the same way i can tell but that's totally fine there's some purpose in it i know there's a purpose in it i know he didn't bring me to all these things for no reason i i know there was so now i'm just continually looking at all of these things and we'll see where god wants to continue to take us i do want to read one other scripture as if you would grab your bibles and it's in john chapter 7 and just showing you the most amazing story in a shocking story if you read john chapter 7 there his brethren jesus is brethren are getting on him because they want him to make himself public they want him to unveil himself he says you're doing you're doing things quietly why don't you go make yourself known right and so they they even say uh you know they went up jesus bid them to go up and in verse 10 he says but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast but not openly but he but as it were in a secret right and so as you continue on his coming to his tabernacle coming to the temple in secret quietly and then as he's there they begin to have an argument in the presence of jesus and the argument was if the christ were to come he would come and do this and this he wouldn't do it quite this way he would do it this way in this way they're debating the coming of the lord and how he will come in the very presence of the lord he's standing right in the presence of them in the temple and there's a debate are you going to come this way or should you come this way and he's standing right before them and in verse 28 jesus cried in the temple and taught saying ye both know me and you know whence i am and i am come of myself but he that sent me is true whom he know not so again in verse 28 here's the seventh seal himself making himself known in the presence of those that are still debating whether or not he's gonna come this way or is he gonna come like this pretty amazing huh very interesting how these things are happening so it's the 29th of september not trying to make too much out of numbers but are you going to arise at his coming and go meet him let's just have a quick word of prayer here heavenly father lord we just come before you lord we're so thankful for your word thankful for your truth lord we're thankful for these little things they they seem simple but lord you've always hid yourself in simplicity and you revealed yourself the same way and father i'm just happy that we are simple enough people to be able to receive how you come and the way you do things father i just pray that lord as we see the opening the renting of the veil and lord we are recognizing it's bidding us to come i pray lord that inside of us will recognize that you it's it's us your bidding and father we just thank you so much to see the things we're seeing and the time we're seeing them lord these things are going from a great mystery to something that was in the past to something we are now recognizing and seeing before us and father we just want to be faithful to walk lord you said you were asked once how may we work the works of god and you simply said believe on him whom i send and lord so many times we want to make it something other than just believing your present tense manifestation that's before us and lord god i just pray lord as time continues and you continue to walk with us and talk with us that you'll continue to whisper those little love secrets to us so that we'll clearly understand you and in understanding you we can see ourselves in you more clearly lord we sure love you we thank you for these times lord i just pray your blessings upon the people i pray lord that something was said that maybe could help somebody along the way lord and i just pray lord for our pastor may he return strengthened ready to go may his family return safely and all well and feeling good and lord we just love you and thank you for all that you've done and all that you continue to do with us we love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen well 8 30. that's early god bless you i uh i i didn't mean to be long tonight i honestly thought well 30 40 minutes should be about enough so i accomplished that goal was everything okay it was okay sorry just it was different and i told you like a bible study tonight and i my daughter wanted something simple so you all kids i hope you caught it it's the coming of the lord and he's bidding you to come and all of these numbers start to make sense as he's calling us behind the veil again brother you got a song oh how i long to be in love with you [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] living pure and
