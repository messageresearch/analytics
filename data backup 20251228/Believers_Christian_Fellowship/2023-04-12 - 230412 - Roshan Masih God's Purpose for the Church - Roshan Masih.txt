so I would like to read from the book of Matthew 16 17 and 18 so I appreciate your prayers your love and all your hospitality may the Lord bless you keep us in your prayer as the Lord of work is going on there a lot of mission work and we are really excited as the churches going to be completed this year so keep us in your prayer lot of things are going on and we are looking for that last seed and then we are going so we all are waiting for that great event amen which is already started in our lives amen because we are the rapture Matthew 16 17 and 18 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but by Father which is in heaven and I see also unto thee that the word Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it another scripture is found in Ephesians chapter 1 3 to 10. Ephesians chapter 1 3 to 10 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ accordingly according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abundant toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen may the Lord add His blessings upon the reading of his word you may be seated please a man so I would like to speak about the church last Sunday we spoke about the church how the church came out and the church has uh born came out from Christ Jesus which is not of Christ cannot be his church amen so tonight I would like to speak on God's purpose for the church amen and when we read Ephesians and Colossians these two books are wheels Eternal plan of God aboard the church amen the book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the body and the book of Colossians is the revelation of the head when we put these two books together amen then we see Christ The Head and the church the body amen so in Ephesians 1 10 and 3 9. so the Bible says this pension and fellowship the word it are used here when the differentiation of times the fullness of time comes amen then he will gather all things in Christ Jesus amen and I was searching the word dispensation and it dispensation is amen I have written here it means Minister things to different people dispensation it dispense distribute to give a man according to Webster the me dispensation meaning is dispense give two different kind of people this Punctuation is rightly dividing the word amen rightly dividing the word for the right group of people for their season how we can rightly divide amen when we give the word to the people according to the season because there is a word amen for the season and we have received our word which is the food for the due season amen so this Punctuation is dispense dispensing give out distribute amen so dispensation we have we know that there are seven dispensations of time amen so we see that Ephesians 1 10 and 3 9 is talking about the dispensation amen dispensation also mean arrangement arrangement and appointment and divinely appointed order amen divinely appointed order arrangement amen if God want to dispute distribute dispense something so there should be an order to dispense there should be an arrangement Amen to to distribute or rightly divide the word so we praise God that we have received the word according to our season so that's is rightly dividing our portion in our time amen that's why we know what God is doing right now what God is going to do in the future we know our scripture our professes amen so Ephesians 3 9 says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the word hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen so the word Fellowship is like economy of God like this also is like arrangement of God plan of God the both words amen it means dispensation it means Arrangement amen so God has something to dispense amen and he needs an arrangement and the administration in order to carry out this dispensing the very substance that God is going to dispense is himself yes God wants to dispense himself to the people Adam dispense himself that's how his bride came so God wanted to dispense himself to the people so God is going to dispense himself into man so he arranged and and administrated the church we have a great responsibility we are an administration of God to dispense the word to the right kind of people the word amen rightly dividing according to right kind of people right kind of word according to their season so the church is the central matter in God's economy and judge you in human term is God's business it's God's work Jesus said I am a man in my father's business so churches God's business the church is not just a group of Fallen people come together and now they are saved yeah we are Fallen we are saved but the church the meaning of the church is much deeper than this because the church is called out people for God's purpose and why God wants to dispense and carry out his plan through the church the Heavenly and eternal view of the church is much higher than just a group of people or or for fallen people who are saved by grace church is the very Central matter of God's economy in God's Administration Amen in God's dispensation in God's arrangement in God's governmental stewardship he has eternally planned the church in Ephesians 3 11 says according to the Eternal purpose 311 Ephesians which shows that the church is not an accident church was in God's thought in The Eternity past as I was talking last Sunday that church did not come accidentally but that it was planned by God in eternity the church is Central the church is eternal because it was in the Eternal thoughts of God Amen amen and God wanted to bring a church amen through that church he can continue his work continued dispense his word to the people so Ephesians 3 19 tells us that the church will be filled with the fullness of God it says that amen you might be filled with all the fullness of God so in God's thoughts God's plan the church he is going to erect or build will be filled by God then Collision Colossians says nine two nine four in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily so God wanted to fill the church with himself according to Ephesians amen 319 the church will be filled with the fullness of God and that fullness of God dwelled in Christ's body in Christ amen so then all that God had bodily developed in Christ Jesus and this will be in the church all that was in God yes and God everything all he put in the church amen I mean he put that in Christ [Music] and what was in Christ everything he poured out in the church amen so the church will be filled with the fullness of God because it is the body of Christ in whom the very fullness of the godhead dwells the godhead dwells in US yes the deity is not in heaven but in the bride that's in US so God poor said poured himself into Christ and Christ's word himself into the church so God had bodily the fullness of God is in the church amen so no church and Christ United together Oneness and unity and harmony going back in the millennium to rule amen so there are three things which I would like to talk with you why God has established Church on the Earth three things we will see amen the first is that the church might have the sonship and that God might be expressed through this sonship because we all are called uh to the first born a man so when we receive Christ we become his children amen Ephesians 1 5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship we just read that what does the word sonship mean and what does it include sonship is birth and growth and adoption amen the birth plus the growth plus the adoption means Birthright amen so first of all we must born of God that's how we come in the church not Branham said uh be shaking hand or other things we have to be born because we are born in a family church is a family of God so by this Divine birth we we become the sun we become the Son of God because we have the life of God and after the birth amen God that's how God mingling With Us God's life comes in US and then after the birth we grow in Christ amen be mature amen and when we grow and grow then we at the end in July Birthright different thing and the birthright is different these are two different things we can have the birth but we may not have the birthright and Jacob they both had the birth but Jacob had the birthright amen so after the birth we have to grow increase in Jesus Christ his life should aborn increase grow in US amen so Esau had the life of the Sun but he did not have the sonship for the sonship includes both the birth and the birthright amen so that's why we have to be growing in the Lord amen Romans 8 14 to 17 you can write down can read all this later say there is a real difference made between the children and The Heirs the children are the ones who have only the birth but the ears have not only the birth but also the birthright first of all we must become the children of God then through growth we will become the ears amen so we may be a child without the birthright and therefore not have the full sonship like in physical but natural and spiritual type of one another when we were born of our fathers we received life from our father Yes amen but by the birthright anything our fathers have is ours so first we receive the life of the father later we receive everything Our Father owned that's an inheritance right amen so we have not only the life but all that our fathers are and have by spiritual birth we have received the life of God amen but by the birthright we will inherit all that God is and all that he has planned and accomplished everything what God was he poured himself in the church everything and of all this put together is the inheritance life plus the birthright and inheritance amen so the ideal inheritance is to inherit God himself and everything godhead everything what God created is our inheritance the Earth the heaven everything because we saw last Sunday he said rule have dominion over everything fish Over the Sea over the fall of the air Earth even creeping things everything is our domain so when a man when God is born into us he begins this mingling process mingling we and God becomes one when we eat a book when we receive the message of the hour amen when we become the message we become the boy voice for that age we become the written epistle amen living manifestation of the word of God put that this way he said the light that comes into him the man the person who received God is abort like this little white button on my shirt that's when God comes into the inner part of a man amen however this is only the start and then that life started to grow in us so there must be the growth if we have the birth but not growth then we will not reach to the birthright by this process our whole being will be when we grow will be saturated permeated with the a sense of God himself Glory so this is the real Holiness and the real sanctification sanctification is not just that we are separated from the word and we are separated from other things says God had chosen us that we should be holy Amen to be holy means more than to be separated unto God it means to be overlaid with God so you remember in the temple in the Tabernacle Ark and everything was covered overlaid with the with the gold God's nature and the woodage human nature Humanity so we must be overlaid with Christ with his nature amen God predestinated us unto this sonship through Jesus Christ and to himself amen so by this Township by begetting us as Sons sharing his life God makes us his expression and express himself through us why God comes in us why that life he started in us that we may be living expression of God so that's what I am talking the church is his sonship we are his children so we share the same life and that life is that we may Express God the token the life is to display brother Branham God wants us the church to be living expression of God that we may Express the life of God that is the purpose of the church amen so the first thing God wanted to have church is that he may Express himself through the people chosen people who are holy separated amen and they share the same life [Music] expressing that life amen said oh if God can get him prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he has got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but Christ amen amen so a prophet is saying that God looking for that kind of person the church that he may Express himself through them through the church but Branham said the threefold purpose is first to express himself completely God in Christ why God put himself into Christ that son in his son he may have the preeminence then Christ came and and we become Sons so now the same kind of preeminence God wants to see in the church amen second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them so this is Christ is the mystery of God revealed but Branham said God is looking for people the church that's his eternal plan yes that he may poured himself his life into them and they may be his expressions that he may completely amen could have the preeminence to express himself through them 156 paragraph and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position amen said rightly positioned we are going to talk later that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them amen so the purpose the church is on the earth that we may be his expression amen amen the same life and but I want to read another paragraph course that's a found in Christ is a mystery again he is expressing himself that is his purpose threefold purple that is his purpose that is why he died that is the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express his self in Christ then Express himself through the church amen and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity said the time is coming and which is now amen because we are at the end time waiting for his coming all the signs all the prophecy all the word which is given for this age before the Rapture everything is full of him so now we are here waiting for his coming said church is coming to that level her level where he I mean the church will fully completely Express that deity God had because God had bodily dwelled in Christ and the Bible says and that that God had bodily made well in Us in fullness in the church so God's purpose to build a church he said I will build my church amen we are just working yes yes we are helper help mate amen but he is the one who is doing his own work the son of man in US looking for The Lost One so we are his hand the church amen amen am said why he sent the Holy Ghost in the church because church is a continuation of the book of Acts we are the furtherance of the Gospel the same life God had established a church that we may have his life like we saw last Sunday amen when I come here so I already prepared a sermon to preach but when I preached last Sunday then Lord change my thoughts and put in my heart let's talk continually about the church so if I go with that subject which I already prepared whom studied nicely so I do not have to like labor work but Lord put these thoughts in my mind to let's go in the same direction so I I believe yes it will be a blessing to all of us amen so we are talking about God's purpose for the church so what is God's purpose why God has called you in the church because church is his administration to dispense his word what God wants to dispense himself his life that we may be living amen expression of that life and we impart that life to the to other people amen that is his purpose to build his church and he said I will build my church nobody knew a human so that's why it's not on human emotion that's not our program but he said I will build my church on the Revelation what Revelation godhead Jesus Christ is God all the fullness of God had bodily dwell in him so in that Revelation I will build my church and that God had boldly will be in the church and the church WIll Express manifest in part that life to other people amen so the next is the so he made us his son when we a man born again in his kingdom we became his sons and daughters children amen who children are children are the extension of the same life amen we are his attributes we are his thoughts his jinns amen we are Branham said a creature of Eternity we are just passing through yes test and trials and Temptation prove we will prove yes that we are the sons and daughters of God amen how knowledge is increased by life this is the time time has come yes to to prove with the life amen so God built his church that he that church be a living manifestation expression of his life and then when church becomes living manifestation when Church expressed his life God's life then that's the house second number God is going to defeat enemy the devil yes because that is second purple amen because when he said I will build my church then in the same breath in the same sentence he said the hell will be against the church I will build my church and the Gates of Hell in the same breath the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against the church so it means whether it is a judge that life that standard that expression of his life then the battle starts with the Satan God is going to prove through us amen amen we are his victory brother amen so we are here to we are here in the battle amen we are in the battle so God's purpose for the church is to deal with his enemy which is devil Satan chapter 1 of Ephesians we see God's purpose for the sonship and then chapter 3 Ephesians we see that enemy may be subdued and come to know God's manifold wisdom amen so God is not sorry that there is a devil there is a Satan disturbing us that is in his plan yes amen amen and God is going to show to the enemy his manifold wisdom through the church it says the Bible said through us through his church amen the enemy may be subdued and come to know God's manifold wisdom God is Not Sorry that there is such an evil one as Satan because without such a man God's manifold wisdom could not be manifested as barbaranam said there is a day and night sunshine and amen and in there is a contrast always amen so it is through all the troubles or originating from Satan that God has a chance to show forth his wisdom but Branham said he did not force Adam and Eve but God knows that they will fall and because they fell that's why God could express his manifold attributes amen his wisdom he's amen godhead father son Healy healer savior all attributes amen sport you have a car nice card and you are uh drive that car and that car never gives you trouble and you you are a good mechanic you can fix but you have no chance to show your wisdom that you can fix this so something like that but when something happened and you fix that and the passenger sees your wisdom so they appreciate and you are all said good mechanic so something like that God let the troubles come let the Satan do whatever he's doing uh on the Earth amen but if you amen when the problem comes in the car amen the people knew what a wonderful driver you are amen so the whole universe has been damaged by Satan but God needs such a one in order that his wisdom might be shown amen yes so what God wanted to show you wisdom his wise God so that's the purpose of the church that he may show his manifold wisdom to his enemy officials 3 9 11 to 11. and to make all menacing what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginnings of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ then 10 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he had which he purpose in Christ Jesus of the Lord God had a purpose God had a plan yes amen but that purpose and plan was never told to anyone he hid that in himself and then the Bible says he brought a church amen that through that church he might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God amen so God what he purple here hit in himself wanted to bring that in light that the people may see what was hidden in him what he hide Amen in himself so God wants to bring to life to all his creation the arrangement the dispensation order or economy of its mystery which before the creation of the world was known only by himself because he hid himself hid in himself this economy was hidden in God as mystery so but now God wants to bring to light this plan what he purpose in his heart in order that his manipul wisdom might be known to the rulers and the authorities through the church through US yes this is according to the Eternal purpose the Eternal plan which God purpose and planned in Christ God created man in his own image Genesis and give him authority to have dominion over all the Earth amen so the Bible says God created man in His image foreign that because God is invisible God amen so God created a man that man may represent him Express him image why God is bringing us into the image of Christ the church we are coming into the statue of perfect man coming into his image because we when we come into His image then we becomes the expression of His Image yes yes amen so if we are not in His image we cannot express his life so when God created a man he created in His image that he may be his expression so Man was created to Express God's image amen amen and then second thing God said have dominion praise God Amen the second thing is have dominion over all that everywhere so amen God wants us to come in to his image become his image and then have dominion accept you then he said subdue that because Satan was there so the next thing is Battle yes conquers the Earth and keep it keep it in order yes amen so a man was there for two purples to express the image of God to express God's life and then to bring Satan under his feet to control Satan to subdue Satan amen so the sonship is the Fulfillment of God's image when we become his son Adam was his son amen so son chip is the Fulfillment of God's image for it is by the sonship that we will eventually be in the full image of God to express him amen so but God not only created a man to express himself he also committed his full authority to man that he may subdue his enemy the church is built up by the sonship and through the building up of the church the enemy is just subdued and God's wisdom is displayed there is a real order amen the more life we have the more Life of Christ every time he comes in the church we receive his word we are receiving more life his word is life amen so we are growing we are receiving more life more life more life the more life we have the more we built up the more we grow amen and when we more grow in the image and the likeness of Christ in the fullness so we become the display to the devil says your life is a sign board advertising something so we become the display to the enemy so this is a real challenge to the enemy a shame to him but a glory to God because of our consecrated lives of a dedicated life of our holy lives amen is a glory to God but Branham said you are consecrated your holy life is a thunder to the devil devil Satan really scared when you live a real genuine life amen and God always wants a genuine article and Satan always defeated by genuine article amen this is the goal of God but it is also the target of the enemy because God's goal is that we may Express his life so that's why we are the target of the devil so we see that there are a lot of confusion in the confusion in the message churches but Branham said that devil is after you because he has not caught you yes yes so that's why because Satan attacked where the life is so we are Satan's Target and also we are God's goal and purpose Genesis 3 to Revelation chapter 20. there is a long record with many stories the serpent entered the scene in Genesis 3. Satan and it is not until Revelation 20 that the old serpent will be cast Bond and Cast Away in Revelation 20. so there is a sonship and there is a battle with the Enemy and that battle is always going on greatest battle that ever fought we are here for test and trials we are here for the battle because Roman says God is going to bring Satan under your feet Jesus Christ defeated him at Calvary amen yes so now he is going to do the same thing through us through the church amen so there is no need for us to be sorrowful and sad we must always be happy and praise the Lord for even a defeat our defeat because the battle is going on amen so when the war is going on there are many better but the victory is at the end though we though we lose many battles but it does not mean that Satan is a winner our defeat sometime we lose is just a preparation for a further victory even if the enemy defeat us he will eventually be defeated amen superbraham said demonology message Physical Realm in the eyes of Lord Satan has already been defeated and short and show him that he don't do not have no legal rights at all that Christ defeated him in our stead there at Calvary when he died amen unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift amen then again Christ is the mystery of God revealed Brahman said justified in his side we are justified in his sight yes why are we justifying we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this largest with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for the purpose and we are proof of his victory he died for this purpose and we are true positive proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that is his victory so what is God's victory but Branham said when we see he's coming down and lives in a church and it just becomes his impression expression so Prophet said that is his victory because God wants to gain some people who are totally completely surrendered to him amen so then God can express himself through them through those brothers and sisters amen so in God's purpose which he purpose in himself but now it's revealed by the opening of the word amen that he want to come down in US you Remember The God Who LED Israel as a pillar of Fire he was not happy God that is stay above one day then he told Moses that he must build a tabernacle The God Who was above them he came down among them in that Tabernacle so that's God's desire Fellowship he want to be one with us Jesus Christ Our Lord's last prayer is that we may be one as I and father is one amen so his last prayer is that's God's desire that is why he amen birthday Church on the Earth that comes from him his side his life in the church and then judge lived that life show the token amen so that is his victory we are his victory that's why babranam said if you do everything but you missed that life you missed everything [Music] You Preach you go to church you pay tithe you sing you play music whatever if you do everything but missed that life but brother upset my highlight method is the token and he preached that message many times amen token life Jesus Christ life amen he want to live in US he wants us to be his living expression when we live that life then we become his victory Hallelujah the church is Victory so I wanted to show and defeat Satan his manifold wisdom through us through the church that is the second purpose of God amen that Satan may be defeated through us the church and that could be happen only with the life amen when that life is there but Branham said it cannot be impersonated Satan can impersonate many things can imitate but he cannot produce that life God's life in US amen praise the Lord we are happy that that's not by our efforts we are not trying to live a life they just automatically when that life is in you amen that life will come into manifestation amen so that's easy amen so God created man in His image that he may be his expression and then God said have dominion over everything it means conquer fight bring everything in order amen so now the last thing which I want to uh share with you is when we started to express that life Christ mingled with us and we are in him and he in US we become one that is God's purpose that he may gather everything in Christ Jesus amen everything the church he's the head amen so that God God May gather all thing which is in heaven amen and on Earth all in Christ Jesus amen so God's plan is the heading up of all things in Christ amen so we have seen that the sunship is for the church to express it sensifies to express him because we are son when we have the life from the father there is only one way to become son or the children when we are born when we born then we have the same life amen the second is that the church might make known to the rulers and the authorities the manifold wisdom of God in defeating the enemy amen now the third I would like to take is the heading up of all things in Christ universally because there is only one Church that is Universal the bride of Christ universal church we all there is only one body amen so the church has to have the sonship in order to express his life then the Satan has to be subdued and cast out and of all creation has to be brought into the proper order and Oneness that is our ministry that is our purpose on the earth in Ephesians 1 10. says that he might gather together which means head up everything in Christ so it is God's Eternal purpose that in the fullness of the times he might head up all things in Christ in the fullness of time when the completion when you complete everything amen so when we read Ephesians 1 20 22 and 23 it says and his subjected all things under his feet and gave him to be had over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of the one who fills all in all amen so 22 verse is ah signifies the identification and Oneness of the church with Christ is the head over all things to the church which is his body amen so when we read Ephesians D chip versus and these verses are closely connected with Roman chapter 8 17-21 where it says the creation the nature is waiting for the sons of God for the manifestation of the sons of God amen so there are many sons of God today but the manifestation of the sons of God has not yet come the nature the creation is waiting for the sons of God that they may come and overtake and bring everything in order because everything is in disorder that is our ministry so in verse 20 and 21 Romans we read that the whole creation was made subject to vanity and waits to be delivered from the slavery of corruption so whole creation is in corruption in disorder in confusion at the Manifest manifestation of the sons of God creation will be delivered from the slavery of corruption in vanity into the freedom of Glory when our bodies are translated we will be glorified and this glorification is the manifestation amen the manifestation of the Son of God is the very glory of the sons of God and we are going to be glorified to whom he justified amen he's sanctified amen and to whom is sanctified he already glorified in God everything is finished completed amen so Romania tells us that the whole creation is the waiting for the glory of the son of God and then Hebrew 2 Hebrews 2 said that God now is going to bring many sons into Glory not one many sons coming into Glory when we are brought into Glory that will be the fullness of time amen the Bible says when the fullness of times come that he might gather together everything in Jesus Christ that he may be the head over everything Jesus Christ all in all that is a full will happen in the fullness of time amen then all creation and all things which are in heaven and on Earth will be headed up in Christ with his body amen his body is his church we are his body amen so we must realize that church is the only means used by God to fulfill his purpose and to settle all his problems there is many problems many problems sickness confusion and death when we see around us when we listen to the news or read the newspapers so we we are realized that everything is in confusion right nothing is in order all our political systems religious systems everything is gone the church is the very vessel Juiced by God to fulfill his purpose which is to manifest himself through Man by mingling himself with the man this is why God created Humanity amen but Branham said in the message identification and now when Christ left he Sanctified the church that the church might take his place and express the word of God amen so when Christ left he raised a church a group of people amen and we are the continuation of the same Ministry yes same life said that his the church might take his place and express the word of God amen so God's intention was to gain a group of people and when God created man in the beginning God created man to be his vessel God we are his vessel and God is our content we must be filled with God must be filled by the Holy Ghost because we are the temple of God we are the place of the Holy Ghost so we are the vessel amen the church is the vessel of God and God want to be in history want to fill that vessel by himself that he made well in them and that he may manifest himself through them by mingling himself with them God created man and as the vessels to contain himself that is what he showed in the beginning in the Book of Genesis amen but before God could come come into man Satan the enemy of God injected himself into men and then when Satan injected himself into man he brought confusion to the whole creation I would like to read prabhanam's quote Maris and divorce now listen one Interruption supposed the entire program now when human beings was running in continuity with god with the month with one man and one woman this woman sinned and it threw out the whole Earthly program out of continuity with God therefore one word added to this book or one were taken from it throws a Christian offered art of continuity with God throws a church out of continuity of with God throws a family out of continuity with God now we see being there the continuity is broken when man sin right right but Branham said God's program interrupted but God's program cannot be defeated interrupted now we see being that the continuity is broken then the lifeline was broken also the timeline was broken the Covenant was broken everything shattered so Satan injected himself into human and then the confusion the death came in the creation of God and creation came under the bondage of corruption in vanity because Satan injected himself God made us that he made Valley in US Satan is a perverted he cannot create so he perverted he perverted life he pervert people so he provided this corruption came from Darkness the darkness came from death and the death came from Satan so God has many problems when this Interruption came when the continuity was broken when men disobeyed the word and he has death sickness confusion corruption bondage and vanity in his creation even now the whole creation is croony Prime weeping waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that may come and deliver the creation from the bondage of Satan which is in the vanity amen God must liberate his creation from boundary and bring it into the order of Liberty by heading up all things under the hardship of Christ because only Christ can bring everything in order and we see that everything in the world is failed all government all political everything only Christ can restore everything so how will God recover his creation and fulfill his original purpose in creating man so how is God going to do that first of all we must see that Satan brought confusion because he he preached something said he always take the same subject that's how he create confusion so he created confusion Satan always con confused the people how he create Confusion by injecting himself into man as death Satan is death and God is life amen God is life and Satan is death amen so now how God will restore his creation Satan created all confusion brought to death damage God's creation there is damage everywhere because he perverted everything Satan amen so gods plan to restore his creation amen is to impart himself into us as life because Satan injects himself into amen and that's all that came so Jesus came he is our life he said I am the life amen so the life came why the light has come that he may impart his life amen so God's answer to devil the Satan is Alive amen the token yes amen amen the token what is token the pride has been paid token means somebody has paid the price somebody died instead of us amen and then that token it lamb is killed bloody sprinkled yes outside the door on the lintel and under that blood because death is outside Satan death outside its death a thought is coming so let me say so I was trying to hold it sometime I notice in the church in my place sometime people comes this is sometimes they said pastor this this month I do not want to partake in the communion I will take next time this is not the way we should approach to the table but Branham said when you come under the blood stay there it cannot be like sometimes you go outside and then you come back when you come under the blood stay there communion is only under the blood so when they sprinkle the blood under that blood they were eating the communion they were eating the lamb amen so that's the communion and that's the life amen that is the price so what is God's answer it's a life he gave himself and died for us but Branham said the blood cell was broken why to release the life Amen in the form of the Holy Ghost and that life that token has come back in the church to keep judge alive amen that is God's purpose amen so judge Ministry our ministry now on Earth is not to preach doctrines yeah we have the sound doctrines praise the Lord doctrines and Christ are two different things when we make circle around any Doctrine Doctrine means religion but Christ we cannot uh put Christ in any Circle amen he is more more than adopted that's why this message is not a bunch of Doctrine this mess Mighty Angel the life has come down amen it's a book amen so if you see that our ministry is not make circle that we believe this we believe this but Branham said never put full stop because Revelation is always coming coming Revelation never stop is keep on coming it's bubbling bubbling it's a fountain it's a life amen so that's why until now we believe what program preached and when we read more when we listen again again those men those stems sermon the more things more understanding is coming we are growing and amen and we are preaching I told to the church that I am not omniscient I'm learning so if I say something to you and that is according to my present understanding from the message because the messages keep on unfolding coming coming coming amen so we cannot stop anywhere so our ministry is to impart Christ I was reading about the missionaries I really want to know how they sacrifice their lives many missionaries they uh buried their children ah when they were traveling on the way great sacrifice I wanted to read about them how they uh they spread the gospel and I was reading somewhere when Wesley the messenger to the sixth churches amen he went to preaching and many places when he came back his brother Charles met him at the door and he asked him what you had given to the people he said I give Christ amen because Christ is life so Church amen comes out of Christ the same life that we may impart that life that we may give Christ Jesus Christ the anointed word to the people amen am said that day on Calvary now notice that Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast or Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the heads of the church to impart life that's what Calvary mean s that the Holy Ghost is given Holy Ghost God's life is given into the hands of the church to impart life so the gods answer to devil because devil brought death that is our last enemy yes yes amen so our ministry is to impart life and that life is Jesus Christ and that life is Lord few courts give the whole message to the people whole message is important and God will reveal what God wants to be revealed to them poor blind wretched people that they own Calvary how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that is the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived what is eternal life the life that he lived and when that life is in US Prophet said that is his victory amen amen amen the life that he lived the life that was in him in part to the church our ministry of Branham said the life that he lived that life he poured in that church our message to impart that life to the people amen impart that life to the people to others amen amen so when that life comes in US the Bible says that life is a light John 1 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men John 8 12 Jesus said I am the light of the world he who follows me shall be no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life when God comes as comes in us as life there is a light that shines within us as a light of life we shines that life shines because when The Candle is lit Jesus Christ said cannot be high when we express that life become like a city on the hill cannot be hidden but we show the light to The Traveler give the direction impart that life to the people amen amen God's way of restoration is Christ versus Satan life versus death light versus darkness and Order versus confusion that's why prabhana give us a message Cod Ed and auction of the church amen conduct order and doctrine of the church amen we saw the Earth and we noticed that everything was in order amen when God is there nothing could be in this order amen so when we are filled with Christ we will be full of life and completely walking in the light in the present tense message the light amen if we are not filled with Christ as life then we are in darkness because that life is life and that is why the message come as evening light it shall be light in the evening time yes amen so before Satan come into God's creation there was Unity and harmony and Order everything was good nice continuity was there but Satan came and he injected death in God's creation and darkness confusion disorder all things came so God's way of restoration and Recovery in Redemption is God recovers restore everything by life and that's God's own life not our life amen amen it looks like God is not working because we cannot see him but God is working silently in the lives of the people a man God is working silently and in a living way changing the lives of the people God's work are not like big shoe or something big God always works in simple City amen so when we receive God in us as our life he comes into us as the very light and under this light we are when we walk in light then we have Fellowship we are in unity we are in perishing we are in harmony amen so there is something living within us shining all the time and we are walking under this light amen so when that life comes that life is light and that light remove all the darkness because he has chosen us and brought us into his life amen to to to manifest his virtue his life amen that's in the Bible I mean there is a written there so by God has life when it life that life comes we becomes light candlestick lampstand amen a candle which is lit gives light to others shows the life amen amen so when light comes remove all the darkness amen so in God's purpose that through the church Christ should head up all things together but he can only be accomplished through the church because he has established a church for that purpose amen so this is that's why Jesus said my father are one that day you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I am Jew and you in me the Oneness and the Harmony and the unity amen so by the grace of God by the opening of the message amen we see that God's plan is to what himself into us as life yes amen so he is working himself in US as life God's purpose with the church is to work himself into us as life that we may be full of life because the word is in darkness yes rise and shine your light has come amen so that is God's purpose that's what God wants us to do because he said the bride the church knows what she wants to done with the word amen amen amen so this will be the fullness of time when we Express that life amen and we impart that life Christ and bride one no two amen husband and wife is one amen so the old serpent will be cast out into the Lake of Fire And even death I mean The Last Enemy yes amen will be Cast Away that's revelation in the Book of Revelation in the end it will happen amen so when that happened the creation will be liberated from the bondage of corruption in vanity and brought into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God but all this depends upon on on us the church all it depends on the work of God within us God is working out in a church as a corporate vessels amen in a group of people that it might be the life and the light to express and shine amen that we may shine his glory we may shine his life that we may Express his life with all the church God could never add up all things in Christ amen because first he shows that preeminence in the son that son sure shows that preem Eminence in the church amen he takes the same kind of Prim Eminence then that same preeminent is in the word what he shows in the church in US amen so then we together in unity and Harmony imparting that life amen because we have received that life then we are imparting that life to the people this will release all creation from confusion and bring into Liberty because we are working together God working in US what we are doing what is our ministry we are people are confused in the churches wherever they are God sent us a message with that message we bring the people in unity Harmony and move all the confusion we bring the people in order their lives in order the churches in order because the life the world has come that's how that's what God wants us to do amen so amen so when the sonship of God is fully fulfilled amen in US and we become the full expression of that life then God deals through us with his enemy amen ensures his victory and manifold wisdom to the devil amen yes yes because God wants to deal with his uh creature created creature through the other preach creature he created us amen it's in the Bible it's maybe psalm 8. that he put everything under man and he made man little lower than the angel I mean but we do not see that man but that's coming amen Jesus did that fulfilled in him amen so everything is coming into our control under our feet that kind of man God has created to rule amen so the second thing is we God want us to deal with enemy amen so then when we deal with the Enemy defeated him God defeated enemy through us he did that already amen but that life in US amen uh uh defeat Devil that's Satan so when we are in that kind of unity with God same life same word then we are going in the millennium then everything will be completed that is the fullness of time amen everything God will headed up in Christ amen Hallelujah so even today when we preach to the people and they believe the message receive the Gospel they enjoy that life they enjoy that poor taste of the coming Kingdom amen so we are his sons and daughters we have his life the church is the continuation of that same life is to impart that life amen Hallelujah must be born again sonship expressed the same life amen when we receive that life then we can impart that life and that life is Victorious Life Satan cannot defeat that life because when you have personal experience with that life Jesus Christ amen and that experienced life with Christ cannot be defeated amen that's what God is doing in us and we are happy and glad that because of the message we know where we are going we know we are on the right path right direction amen praise the Lord may the Lord bless you let's pray as the musician comes Heavenly Father thank you for your word we thank you for the great plan you had in your mind and you hid in yourself but you wanted to dispense those things to the people and for that very purpose you have raised us the church that we may dispense impart that life rightly dividing the word of Truth help us that we may be found faithful in whatever we say whatever we do because we are
