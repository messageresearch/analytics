========================================

church, it's it's very simple. Why would we WHY WOULD WE TRY TO DO THE MAGIC? &gt;&gt; When it's so simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID WHAT DID MARY DO MAGIC? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; TO THAT THE LIFE THAT she became actually the life house of God. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID SHE SHE JUST said amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; TO THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL. AND SHE REMEMBER DON'T FORGET HOW THAT message started. THE ANGEL CAME DOWN AND BEFORE HE TOLD her &gt;&gt; the message, he said, "Mary, I WANT YOU TO understand what is happening to you now. It's God's grace." &gt;&gt; DID THE ANGEL NOT SAY &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU ARE HIGHLY FAVORED AMONGST &gt;&gt; HIGHLY FAVORED MEANS YOU FOUND GRACE. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY AGAIN, NOT MERCY BUT GRACE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GRACE GOES BACK TO PREDESTINATION. WHEN GOD SAVED YOU, I'M SAVED BY GRACE, &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY FOR ME. &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE LOVED ME. Is that right? &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE FOR ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me say that again. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And I trust we can understand that proper because I think sometimes it's so important that that we that we really understand what happened in our day. That's why brother Adam called it it's the message of grace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He never said it's a message of mercy. &gt;&gt; It's a message of God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? BECAUSE REMEMBER IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN when the lamb was shed, it was shed for Adam and God was clothing him with that lamb skinin. &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY THAT ADAM WAS ON HIS WAY to hell. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HELL IS NOT CREATED FOR ADAM AND HIS RACE. &gt;&gt; HELL IS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO WHEN GOD SAVED YOU AND YOU CAN SAY I'M SAVED BY GRACE THEN YOU ARE NOT THAT'S WHY WHEN GOD IS NOT FEELING PITY for us &gt;&gt; we should not feel pity for ourselves &gt;&gt; AND SARAH FELT PITY FOR HERSELF POOR ME &gt;&gt; RIGHT &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT POOR ME SHE DEVELOPED a negative attitude right &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; amen church it will be very simple to be changed It will be as the prophet would say I believe it will be just a daily routine. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M NOT WAITING FOR THE CHANGE. I am the change. THE RAPTURE IS NOT COMING TO ME. I'M A PART OF IT.
