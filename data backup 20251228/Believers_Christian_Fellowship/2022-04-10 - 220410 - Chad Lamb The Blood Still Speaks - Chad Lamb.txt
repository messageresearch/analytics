would take the preeminence now as we yield ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of hebrews chapter 12. just uh want to remind you that uh brother ilia and i will be leaving on tuesday for poland and lithuania so we very much appreciate your prayers we'll be gone for 10 days and we've got several stops to make and several services to preach so just we ask that you'll be praying for us and hold us up in prayer we'll be sure thinking of you and praying for you all back here while i'm away the ministry

looking forward to hearing from him and then the following wednesday will be brother kyle brother kyle will be preaching for us on the 20th so be praying for those brothers we're praying for the services here and there and also i talked about the jonathan baumgartner i believe it was yesterday and his surgery was successful it went well the doctor was happy with it so he's he's in the recovery phase so don't forget to pray for him because a lot of pain and and for sister bessie as well they've got to go through the recovery the rehab and we just trust that god will keep them through it all amen uh we want to hear their testimony when they come out of that of what god has done for them now while we're standing let's look at hebrews chapter 12. we've looked at these scriptures we've looked at a few of them last sunday and and i want to keep going on this topic a little further hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 but you are coming to mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven into god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven man god bless you as you take your seats may god bless us as we read his word when we look at this i want to focus in on verse 24 and to jesus the mediator the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel and this is where brother branham uses that term the blood speaks and he and he makes the statement can the blood speak the blood speaks and he gets this from here in hebrews chapter 12 verse 24 that that we've come to this position that we've come to is not to mount zion and to the ordinances we've come uh to i mean sorry not to uh mount sinai we're not coming to mount sinai we've not come to the order but we've come to a new place we've come to mount zion to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and do the spirits have just been made perfect this is a this is a coming to a spiritual place amen not a physical not a natural but a spiritual place and to jesus the mediator the new covenant into the blood of sprinkling nobody says brother sprinkling amen it's not talking about the blood of sprinkling is a reference back to the old testament sprinkling of the blood and the spring sprinkling of the blood in the old testament was a sprinkling for purification so the the altar the things upon the altar all these things had to be sprinkled by blood amen blood mixed with water or just blood sometimes and the sprinkling of blood was for purification and so when it refers to we've come to the sprinkling amen and to the blood of sprinkling this is the blood of purification because this is what brings us purification and cleansing to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel so let's go back to genesis chapter 4 and read this out of genesis 4 as we lay our foundation genesis chapter 4 verse 6 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him i wonder what they were talking about they were talking about the reason one offering was accepted and the other one was not accepted and that's to been the pattern from then on between the false vine and the true vine when the true vine declares the truth the false vine instead of surrendering to the truth and repenting it tries to destroy either the truth or the vessel bearing the truth and so because it cannot destroy the truth they're always going after the vessel amen that's declaring the truth so that set a pattern that's why genesis is the seed chapter seed book of the entire bible it sets the patterns and the patterns do not change he says and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and so this is what paul is referring to when he says the blood of spring speaketh better things than that of abel and where brother branham gets these terms uh the blood speaks so the blood the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and we learned last time that it was crying against cain it was crying out against the the guilty it was it was a cry against the murderer against the guilty against the unrighteous and the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and he was crying out against cain brother branham says in the token i want to look at the the blood speaks um and for a title to this morning i'd like to take the blood still speaks if you take that for a title the blood still speaks in the token message brother brandon preaches the token several times he reads the token that title or just token and he preaches it i don't i didn't look up how many times but he preaches it several times and this time he says the blood speaks did we say does the blood speak can it speak the token speak yes sir if we'd look in genesis 4 10 the voice of the blood of abel cried out against cain we find out in hebrews 12 24 that the blood of jesus christ speaks better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speak it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking this is the first principle in the in the lesson this morning i want to hang on to i want you to grab and hang on to how does the blood speak it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking so the the blood of the blood of sprinkling which is the blood of jesus christ that was shed for us the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things how does the chemistry speak it's not the chemistry it's it's the life that was in the blood that does the speaking it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking the soul that was in cain that or in abel it was the life that was in christ that cries out better things than any again in the another one of the token messages he says it this way now we also find in hebrews the 12th chapter 24th verse that the new testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word that's the second principle we want to hang on to first that the chemistry doesn't speak the life that's in the blood does the speaking so the blood speaks so it's the life that's in the blood does the speaking and the voice of the blood is the word amen that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood now listen the way it says this is just the next sentence the voice of the blood is the holy ghost [Music] but i thought you said the voice of the blood is the word now the voice of the blood is the holy ghost boy that might tell you how different the word and the holy ghost are the voice of the blood is the word the voice of the blood is the holy ghost so hang on to that too so the chemistry is not what speaks it's the life that was in the blood does the speaking and the voice of the blood is the word and the voice of the blood is the holy ghost so hang on to that the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the old testament the blood spoke of guilt in the new testament it speaks of redemption in the old testament it speaks uh spoke of death and sorrow in the new testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven and that same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother are called out after his brother that had killed him the blood of jesus christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks so i think we believe that the blood speaks but it's not the chemistry of the blood it's the life of the blood the life that was in the blood is what's speaking and what is that voice what is the voice of the uh what is the voice of the blood voice of the life it is the word and it is the holy ghost and the holy ghost brings life to the word again in the token he says we find out the blood does speak it speaks in your behalf the the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood so now the life the the voice of the blood the life of the blood is speaking from in you the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood amen oh brother i wish everybody could see that if you can see what it is it's the life that's in you see that blood is identifying you with it it's the token what is it the blood was shed for you you've accepted and the life has come into you you have the token that's the holy spirit so now you have the token which is the same life that was in the blood amen that day when the blood was being spilled upon the ground that life amen is released amen and that life now has come back into us and that life is speaking it's speaking now it's speaking today and it's speaking on our behalf this is why brother branham says all the time when you begin to pray he said present the token with your prayer i mean when you pray you have to pray in faith amen we don't pray just hoping something would work out amen but we must pray the prayers that god answers for us are the prayers that we pray in faith and how can i have faith when i can apply the token which is the evidence that the fair has been paid for me that i've been redeemed and in this token is the voice that's speaking on my behalf and when i present the token my new birth the baptism of the holy ghost the life of christ in me amen when i can present that with my prayer then i have faith that will answer the prayer because the blood met all the requirements for me and there's nothing to keep the promise from me that's what my brother grahams are saying present the token with your prayer because it's the voice that's speaking for you it's speaking on your behalf you can't say god because i was a good boy will you do this for me god because i went to church every sunday no we couldn't have done anything but the blood did it for us and now the voice of the blood is in us amen which is the holy ghost and we're speaking on our behalf because we have nothing else to present we have nothing else to offer we have nothing else to present there's no other merit that we can give amen to get an answer to prayer or to build faith amen all of our righteousness is as filthy rags so it takes the voice of the blood that's speaking back out of us and say lord that life you gave me is your life and i present that with this request it's the only merit that i have it's the only thing that i have that i can present to you the life has come into you he says again in the token full obedience to the word brings god the word eternal in you i love the way brother brahm does this he doesn't he he mixes terms and interchanges terms so that we will never compartmentalize god that we won't make the word something different than god and we won't make christ something different to god we will make christ something different than the word and we won't make the seed gene something different than god and we won't make the holy ghost something different than jesus christ so he'll mix these terms sometimes in the same sentence so that we don't compartmentalize and say now this is the holy ghost over here and over here's the word and this is god and now this is the holy ghost and now this is jesus christ he'll interchange those terms he says full obedience to the to the word brings god the word eternal in you so does it bring god or the word eternal which one does it bring into me amen full of beings to the word brings god the word eternal in you and that is the token so what is the token the token is the holy ghost but here he says it's god the word eternal the token the holy ghost god word eternal when the word is in you it's christ in you so what's in you god the word eternal the token christ is the room for all of them praise god you know what it's taken decades to wash away denominational thinking let's turn to colossians you know this but i'm going to read this scripture i go back to very familiar scriptures but i do it in the context of what we're studying so not just to rehearse the same thing over and over again but it's always unfolding with greater light colossians chapter 1 verse 25 whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to a saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so what is this that's coming to you it's god it's the eternal word it's the token it's the holy ghost and it's christ but that is the hope of glory and he says in christ is the mystery of god revealed listen he said he said listen close now i want you not to fail to get this no other church no other sign no other fellowship no other government no other testimony no other creed no denomination is accepted outside of this god accepts nothing else but that christ in you the hope of glory what is it we're talking about the blood speaking on your behalf it's the only thing that's accepted nothing else is accepted but christ in you the hope of glory the only thing that god recognizes no fellowship no church no creed no denomination no nothing everything else is dead now remember last sunday we were talking about the blood uh and the blood life we i i stated what we're really talking about is life so if we talk about the word we're talking about life we're talking about the holy ghost we're talking about life we're talking about god god is life when we talk about christ that's life amen we're talking about life there's only one source of life there really is only one life everything else is dead even this life we're living is a reflection of life it's not life this mortal life is not life it's a reflection of life but life is zoe life that's life everything else is dead in comparison to that life that's why we were dead in trespasses and sin we were breathing in and out amen but we were dead that's why we've come to life because we were dead although we were alive this life is only a reflection of life that is life so when we talk about life that's life that's why when lazarus died jesus said he sleepeth because saints can't die and they misunderstood what he was saying because they're used to the carnal world the the mortal world that we live in and they say well if he's sleeping they'd do as well and brother baby said he had to speak their language so he had to say lazarus is dead and he knew full well lazarus is not dead but in their understanding of life and death lazarus was dead but in his understanding of life and death lazarus can never die because azeroth was a part of life in the beginning and that can never die lazarus was there in the eternal realms before anything was made before anything was spoke he was there so lazarus can never die there's no such thing as death amen to a part of god so really what we're talking about is life in the token he says but the true token of the blood speaking out speaks of a living resurrected presence jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever right living right now among us amen it speaks better from not dead forms and creeds but a living token of a living resurrected christ that lives in us so where does that blood speak for me from it speaks from within because it's the life that's on the inside let's look at galatians chapter 2. galatians chapter 2 we'll read verse 20. i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me now paul's saying it's no longer my life but this life that i live in the flesh is the faith of the son of god that's not faith in the son of god that's the faith of the son of god which is god's own faith which is part of the seed gene of god which was in you laying dormant waiting to be quickened now let's turn here to ii corinthians 2 corinthians chapter 4 verse 3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us this treasure is in earthen vessels and so the treasure is inside but god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts when he goes and begins to speak on the light shining of darkness it takes you all way back to the beginning in genesis when darkness covered the face of the deep and god said let there be light and so when god said let there be light the spoken word is what produced the light and now he says here for for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels i want to talk about light in connection with life here for uh just a few minutes and if you just wait with me patiently as this unfolds you'll see let's go back to john 1 the gospel of john chapter 1 and verse 1. very familiar but we will read this again in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men now this is the life that we're talking about in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen so the light shined in darkness and the darkness when jesus was the life and the life was the light of men and when he was the word was made flesh and one among us he was the light of life and they stayed in many state in darkness but when we were in darkness god called for the light to shine out of darkness and shined into our hearts and gave us the knowledge of god in the face of jesus christ and now we have this treasure in earth and vessels so now we've come to life by light and so this is the theme that i want to speak on for a few minutes let's look at john chapter 8. scoot over here to john chapter 8 and we'll pick this other verse up john chapter 8 verse 12. then speak jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so he said i'm the light of the world now jesus was not talking about the physical light he was talking about life and that life is the light of men he said i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so this is the light of life john 1 says he was the life and the life was the light and now he's saying if i'm the light you won't walk in darkness you will have the light of life so light and life go together and that's what we want to look at for a minute he says now in the message it is the rising of the sun and the first light was ever given on earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness and light and into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth and the message there is a man here that can turn on the light by the way referring to this message there is a man here that can turn on the light my whole perspective of this message has changed over the last couple weeks amen there's a man here that can turn on the light he says now what god separates darkness from light or light from darkness and you look at the gospel there's themes that run through the entire gospel into the entire scripture amen life and death runs through the entire scripture light and darkness good and evil there's two vines there's a contrast there's there's opposites amen there there is there's uh there's humility and there's arrogance there's all these things are painting pictures for us but the main theme through the scripture is life and death the main thing through the scripture is life and death this whole book is about life and death it's about light and darkness the whole book is about light and darkness the whole book is about life and death so everything we talk about everything we preach everything we do is about light and darkness it's about life and death and this again in this quote he says he separates death from life and he does it by his word so god wants to separate death and life amen because it got entangled in the garden the seed of life and the hybridization bringing death it got entangled and he wants to separate life and death and he does it by his word his word is what always brings this forth now light well now the seed was already upon the earth i believe god had planted the seed and just as long as the sun could get to that seed it began to grow and that's the reason it only taken days to bring forth these things because the seed was already in the earth and it needed all all it needed was light and that's the way god has today his seed is already here his word the only thing it needs is light on it and he is that light for he is the word and the word and the light is the same thing okay the word and the light is the same thing and the life was the light and it's the light of life and so the word and the light is the same thing and the life in the word is the same thing it all comes from the same source the word and light is the same thing the life in there is the light of the word see is the life the germ of life lays within the grain and in the grain the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the life out of the grain that's the way that christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do just like the life in the grain of wheat or whatever it is it makes the wheat do what it's supposed to do because it's the life that's in it then he comes to the message shalom he said that son is the word of god in the beginning god said let there be light and when the manifested word of god and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light catch that god spoke that there would be light amen and then when the word was manifested then it was light first god spoke it what if he did what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested vindicated his word was a vindicated light come into existence and that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated god's written word vindicated then it shows light it's a portion it's a portion is lit or put out for each age we find it in the church ages we find it in the old testament church age each time that there come a time for a certain manifestation of the journey there was a prophet come to the earth and the word come to the prophet and he made that word live and when the word was identified it reflected god and there was the age there was the light and that's the way the light comes today all right brother frank if you can bring up the whiteboard i want to look at the whiteboard for just a minute but i want to read this quote while that's coming up it says in the message turn on the light from 1964 he says no life can come outside of light now the word is light no life can come outside of light light produces light produces life there can be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be the only light can come by the word of god god's word is the light when it's manifested so no life can come outside of light and the light is the word of god manifested without the word of god being manifested there can be no light if there's no light there can be no life these are such basic principles but they lay all the way back in genesis at the beginning in creation because when god was going to bring life the first thing he had to bring was light the very first thing he did when he spoke was spoke light amen because nothing was going to come forth upon this earth until first he got light then he had to change the conditions of the earth so that the light could get to the seed amen so first he has to have light then he has to move things in a certain order to get the light to the seed when he gets the light to the seed then the seed springs to life so let's look at it this way in john 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word right so in the beginning was the word in him was life so where is life life is in the word is that right life is in the word over here let's say we have other word and we'll call these seeds all right now brother branham said every seed be before it come into existence was spoken word god spoke every seed into existence so in the original creation he says there were seeds under there and the fourth seal i believe it is he said from a previous civilization or something like that and he said there was those seeds were there but those seeds originated as the word and the word created the seed and as the seeds repopulated it was a continuation of the word of god so the word amen the seed was originally word god spoken word created the seed so if we talk a palm seed amen first god had to speak a palm seed and that spoken word would go into a manifestation and create the seed seed go into the ground it would create the tree amen there was life in the word so this word over here has life in it is that right but in the beginning of creation that word that was laying there those seeds were covered over in darkness no light could get to them and they were laying there in a state of death non-manifestation they were laying there under the water from something previous and now they're in a under judgment and they're laying there amen but there's life there's always life in the word so in the beginning was the word and in him was life so in order to get this word over here to manifest he's got to manifest this word which is light when god spoke the word light there was life in that word because then the word is life but when light began to shine it was manifested word all right and when when when the light now when the manifestation of the spoken word the spoken word was let there be light and the scripture says and then there was light so when it goes from spoken word to manifested word the manifested word is now the light and that light will bring the life to the rest of the word so it's manifested word but when the word is manifested i just draw it like this the life moves into that understand so the the word the life is in the word now when the word comes into manifestation the life of that word comes into the manifestation and the manifestation has life also and so when the manifestation of light comes all the way over here and strikes this word when it gets through the darkness and gets to the word it quickens this life that's on the inside and up comes the tree up comes the life what did it it was it was life all along this is why brother brennan said word comes to word life comes to life is that right and so he said word comes the word eagle the eagle life comes to life word comes to word amen and brother ben takes this uh this story of of the recreation of the earth back in genesis and he says that's our lives amen we come into this life under a state of judgment our earth is shrouded in darkness darkness of what we have eyes we can see light we can say it's a bright sunny day but we're under the darkness of the understanding of the word of god which has us shrouded in complete darkness but god knows how to bring that seed to life and he's got a word that has life in it and when that word comes in the manifestation the life comes with it into the manifestation and when that light strikes the seed that's on the inside of us life comes to life to quicken life [Music] [Applause] and so it's all about life now what life comes to what life it's the life of god that comes to the life of god word to word life to life is that right so when this manifested word comes in it quickens the life that's laying in the word seed because you're part of the word if you were if you're one of god's attributes his attributes are words they were thoughts words manifested word it's all the attribute of god which is word so now we can see this this progression of the word coming into manifestation and the word coming into manifestation as light now strikes a seed that's in darkness and brings that seed to light but praise god that's not the end of the journey now the life that was laying dormant under this word this seed this let's say the palm tree amen god had originally spoke palm tree under judgment now there's a palm seed laying under there but because it's a spoken word it has life inside of it amen but it's shrouded in darkness so god says let there be light amen that's the word then there was light that's the manifested word and it brings the life with it now when the darkness moves and the light hits this palm seed it springs the life on the inside to life and now that seed that germ that word springs to life and as it springs to life it becomes the manifestation of the word and now it is light and with its light comes life [Music] praise god the natural types the spiritual let's keep going here back to the message there is a man here that can turn on the light so life is only by the word of god made manifest life comes only by the word of god made manifest so how does life come by the word of god made manifest as long as it is just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word see that brings the word said so and then when it comes to past that is life in light amen the manifested word is life in light because light is the word made manifest light brings life light brings life you've got it that's why if we go back amen we go backwards and we don't have the word for our day being made manifest then it's not the light to quicken the seed for this day amen that way there's nothing coming to life until the word that is ordained for this season in time comes into manifestation and when that light when that word comes into manifestation it has the light of life and it can bring life to the seed that is supposed to come into manifestation in this day and there's no manifesting that seed without the light of life and the light of life is the word that was previously spoken coming into manifestation then it comes to this seed amen comes into manifestation and now that becomes the manifestation and becomes the light that's why jesus said back in john 8 i am the light of the world if you come to me ye shall have the light of life let's go to matthew 5. matthew chapter 5. matthew 5 and verse 13. now jesus is speaking to his disciples he says you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven we'll come back to this verse in a little bit but he says jesus says ye are the light of the world but he briefly said he was the light of the world but he was the manifested word in his day they were the seed that was ordained to spring to life in that day and when the manifested word became light on the day of pentecost that light come into them and sprung them to life and when they come to life when when the new testament church was born when the prophecy of joel was fulfilled when the things that jesus had prophesied when all of a sudden it came to life that life became the manifestation and became the light and jesus says now you're the light because you're the word for this day made manifest now you become the light let's go to galatians chapter 1. i want to look at the life of paul just real quick here in a couple of scriptures and take it as an example galatians chapter 1. and verse 13 galatians 1 and 13. for you have heard of my conversion in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above mine equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me not to me paul received a revelation of jesus christ is that true was jesus christ revealed to paul yes but god's plan was not just to stop with the revelation of the son to paul but now when the revelation of the son came to paul paul would spring to life and he was a certain seed for that day and when he met the pillar of fire on the road to damascus amen amen he saw the manifested word as light and the light come to the seed quickened the seed and now when the seed is quickened it's not now going to be the sun revealed to paul now it's going to be the sun revealed in paul now paul is going to be manifesting the sun the life of the sun amen let me read that again but when it please god who separated me from my mother's womb and call me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i confer not with flesh and blood so though it's amazing that paul now realized he did receive a revelation of jesus christ jesus christ the son was revealed to him but the purpose of the sun being revealed to him is so that the sun could be revealed in him so that from then on if you wanted to see the sun you needed to see the sun as it was shining and it was shining in the manifested word for that day which was the apostle paul let's go to acts 13. now we're not going to leave this with paul right we're not going to say oh that was amazing paul praise the lord the son was revealed in paul it wasn't going to stop there because the sun was then revealed in paul and when the sun was revealed in paul amen it was a light that was supposed to light and that light was to shine the gentiles because there was seed laying in gentile form and when that light shined on gentile form then there was life inside of that seed and that sprung to life and now the gentile church was born amen the beginning of the bride and now that began to shine the light and now the sun was revealed in them amen amen let's look at this in acts 13 verse 46. then paul and barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should be for salvation to the ends of the earth boy isn't it such a shame that when paul died the light went out no because the light is manifested word and when paul was a light paul was manifested word he was fulfilling the prophecy of a light to the gentiles that word was spoken now was alive in him and that light is the life that light brings the life and now when that light would come in contact with seeds that had life on the inside they would spring to life and now when they sprung to life now the light was shining from them because they were manifest manifesting the word for their day let's go to revelations chapter one i'm going to skip just a little bit here keep moving revelation chapter one i'm doing really good we're getting through stuff really well but i just want to hit to this point here now i want to go back to our our little drawing here i could just draw maybe the same thing in a different way now we have the word all right and over here we have a man and that's the best i can do i'll make him smile but in the man is a seed and in that seed is life is that right and that life will only spring to life when the conditions are right for life brother brahman begins to teach us this he says now there are certain seeds that come forth in certain times and under certain conditions you can plant the seed and shine the light on it but there's certain you know wheat grows at a different time than corn grows we know that around here amen so there's certain conditions that the seed needs and the seed will never come to life till it gets to the right conditions amen and so this but what springs the seed to life is always the light and now it's the light for your day when the conditions are right in your day and the light for your day comes to you it brings life to the scene so now i want to go back through this in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and in him was life all right so the the life is in the word but then when when it comes time the conditions god knows the conditions he knows the seasons he knows when to plant his seeds god is a perfect husbandman a perfect farmer he knows when to plant his seeds he never has his seed here in the wrong season that's why he didn't plant you in luther's day amen the conditions would not have been right for your birth and luther's day amen that's why luther couldn't come in our day amen god knew when to plant the seeds he knew how to get the full harvest he knew how to get all the production he knew how to do it right he's the perfect farmer amen so he brought you at a certain time so make yourself this little ugly figure that i made and that's you amen but in you amen is the seed of life but only the manifested light for your day will bring the seed inside of you to life so in our day amen god sent his word and the word became manifested manifested word and that was light and that light come down and hit this seed inside each one of us and when it died and when it did it brought us to life we died to the old man but newness of life now christ was birthed in us because life came to life amen what life the life of light came to us manifested word come to us and when we received the manifested word it brought the life that was in us waiting for that light and then it connected it brought life and now we come to life but now let's draw our little guy down here i'm sorry if you guys want to take up collection and send me to art class i might be able to do better in the future now when this when this word that was laying in here the light hits it it comes to life and it begins to manifest and what's the manifestation it is light and that light it becomes whatever god intended for you to be amen when that seed comes to life you begin to manifest the word for your day and as our life begins to line up to the word amen not we manifest whatever we want our own desires our own thoughts that's the wrong manifestation but when we come under the headship of the word the word for our day we come to life under that word and the life that's in us will only match the life of the light that came to us that's why the scripture says uh the eye is the the light of the soul if the eye be single and then the the eye be full of light but if the eye be darkness how great is that darkness and if our light be turned to darkness how great is that darkness amen because we have to be single which means focused we have to be singularly focused on the light and when we're singly focused on the light then we're full of that light but if our eye become dim because we're not focused on that light but we have other focuses as well then if our light becomes darkness amen now you say what's the big deal the big deal is you're the manifested light in this day and where does life come from it comes through light amen light of life light brings life you have to have the light of the manifested world to bring life so that's why we're implored we're encouraged amen we're admonished to stay focused on this word that god gave us focused in such a way not that i just read it amen but i read it and i say lord i want to be whatever this is that i'm reading i want to reflect nothing else but jesus christ and jesus christ has been made on a full display in our day so that there's no more mystery about who he is no more mystery about the word the full word has been given that's the light of the age that brought us to life and it's also the same light word to reflect so now the light that brought the seed to life this seed that came to life is a seed that is predestinated to live in this age and that predestinated seed that lives in this age was ordained to have a certain expression and that expression when it's manifested will be light that light is the manifested word that's why it's so critical that there's a continuity of life this word that we received let's put manifested word this manifested word that we received was light and in it was life and life came into us is that right so the life that was in the word was in the manifested word and that life came into us which was dormant word i'm just using terms that i understand dormant word to bring us out of dormancy out of sleep out of deadness into life and quickened us to life so when it quickened us alive it didn't quicken us to any life it didn't quick us to lay out the sea in life it didn't quicken us to american life it didn't quicken us to whatever your family name is i mean smith or miller it didn't quicken you to that life that's the life you lived before but it quickened you to the life of jesus christ and jesus christ is the word so the life we're supposed to live is the word life amen and when the word lives it's manifested word and manifested word is light and light is the only thing that brings life that's why when the when when the prophet of god takes the scriptures and begins to teach us how a man conducts himself how a woman conducts himself how a family is structured how a church is structured how i mean when he begins to lay all these things out listen friends what's he doing he's shining the light to bring life to the sea that's the light that brought life to the seed but there must be a continuity of life all the way through every expression so if it was life that came to you through the manifested word and it quickened life within you now what needs to come out of you is life what life light life what is light manifested word that's why he says if our light becomes darkness how great is that darkness because if our light become darkness then where is the light to quicken the seeds in this day like this is this is no longer a legalistic idea to the message this is no longer i'm going to line up so that i can live but now i'm going to line up so that somebody else can live i'm not just now it's not i got to get this all right because i got to make sure i'm right amen listen i was right before the foundation of the world i was always ordained to be right if i've got a revelation that i'm part of god i can no more be lost and god can be lost because god cannot lose a piece of himself so i am secure under the revelation of this hour and that security amen abolishes my legalistic tendencies i don't need to be legalistic to be right amen i just need i'm right why are you right he made me right i've been under the sprinkling of the blood amen the token speaks for me it speaks on my behalf i'm right because he made me right i'm clean because he cleansed me amen i'm ordained unto life there's there's no other way so the revelation that god gave us amen frees us from the legalistic tendencies [Music] and so the now the question of whether we're going to make it or not should already be answered so now the question of whether we're going to make it or not is not based on conduct oh if we could just make ourselves plug into that truth and force our flesh and our own mind to receive that in its fullness now my acceptance is not based on my conduct my acceptance is based on my faith my faith comes from a seed gene that i didn't put there he did the ability to believe so now me lining up to the word is not about finding acceptance with god and being saved and making sure i go to the rapture when i sprung to life that was all secure but now lining up to the word is an expression of love first and foremost he says if you love me keep my commandments so how can we do the works how can we do the works of the lord he said believe on him who got a sense [Music] and then you know one of the apostles i don't remember who it was it might have been paul or whoever said i mean he had a spiritual will acknowledge that the things that i write unto you they are the commandments of the lord so now he whom he sent you must receive whom he sent now gives commandments and those commandments are the commandments of the lord [Music] so now it's not paul's opinion paul says those are the commandments of the lord now they received paul because paul was whom he sent then paul gave commandments and those commandments of the lord and jesus says if you love me you'll keep my commandments now it has nothing to do with making it i've already made it has everything to do with me loving the one who saved me me loving the lord but now if my light which is the manifestation of my life becomes darkness how great is that darkness because it's the only light that's left shining do you realize how few lights there are in the world do you realize that this is the age of darkness and gross darkness upon the people but that there shall be light in the evening time where is that light where is that light what is that light manifested life you've been quickened to life to live a seed life an ordained life a predestinated life a faith life amen a word life that's what we've been born again to live not our own life his life in us now he quickened us so that he could reveal the son in us christ in you the hope of glory so now when that light becomes darkness how great is that darkness now it's not about i have to do this it's not about my church teaches i said this so many times i hope i pray i pray to the lord that nobody in this church ever goes to anybody and says my church teaches because when you start right there you're absolutely off from the very beginning because we're lining up to the word not to a church teaching we're lining up to our headship which is jesus christ the word we're not lining up to any church any group of people any system of man if we're doing that in our thinking we've got to break that from our thinking and say it's not what the church teaches it may be perfectly absolutely all right but it's got to go further than that it has to go with what the lord teaches what the word says what my headship says and i'm referring back to my headship not back to my church now if we all come into the unity of the faith unto the head and we all come to the headship amen church order is not a problem amen conduct order and doctrine is not an issue because we're taking it from the same head so now it's not what the church teaches we don't align with what the church teaches we align with our headship which is the word now let's look at revelation chapter 1 verse 9. revelation chapter 1 verse 9. i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and kingdom and impatience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see is write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus unto smyrna unto pergamos unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and ontale to see him and i turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks so the voice was coming out of the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and the seven golden candlesticks represent the seven church ages the seven church ages is the building of the bride right so he heard a voice the voice declared who it was but when he turned to see the voice what he saw was seven golden candlesticks showing where christ is he is in the midst of the seven candlesticks and where he's speaking from he's speaking from the midst of the seven candlesticks right so he's speaking out from his church he said i turned to see the voices spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as the flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last. the scripture that i want to focus on is the end of verse 15 which is his voice as the sound of many waters brotherhood says in the seal of god from 1954 he says now this great subject we had last night the first night before last was the church in the church age how that we seen jesus standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks to look upon as jasper and sardis stone the beginning in the ending reuben and benjamin see the seven candlesticks or the seven lampstands standing and a rainbow over it is a covenant and how he was appeared and his voice was the voice of many waters both christ and the church speaking together what is the voice of many waters both christ and the church speaking together let's look at this in revelation 17. the bible gives its definition of many waters in revelation 17. there's a description of the great sitteth upon the beast on seven hills and all of this and we'll find that in revelation 17 verse 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto you the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters so now we're going to get the definition of what many waters mean she sitteth upon many waters let's go to verse 15. he said unto me the waters which thou saw us where the horse sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues so what are many waters people many people nations peoples and tongues so the voice of jesus was the voice of many waters water many waters many peoples nations voices many tongues a multitude and a variety of people brother ben picks this up in the church age book from the patmos vision it says his voice was as the sound of many waters now what do the waters represent here in revelation 17 15 the waters without sauls are people multitudes of nations and tongues his voice was the sound of multitude speaking what is it it's the judgment for those are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the holy spirit all through the ages have testified to christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment against the sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preached the saving power of jesus who preached water baptism in jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the holy ghost who stood with the word more more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost down through the ages now what is the voice of the blood the word what is the voice of the blood the holy ghost where is that voice coming through it's the sound of many waters the holy ghost through the church ages has been speaking amen the word of god as it's been dispensed and as they speak it it becomes the light for the day and they begin to they begin to share the word they begin to exhibit the life and they begin to manifest the light and that light brings others to life and the voice of many waters is the multitudes through the ages that have been testifying of jesus christ he said and all of them were the voices the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost whose voice his voice but it sounded like many waters it sounded like many waters waters coming down through stream all bubbling over and running over the rocks and the torn it sounded like many waters many people but it was the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost it was still one voice it was one voice coming through many waters now in in the message revelation chapter four part three where the member says now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice and if you can't preach the people of sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher so don't make that last quote stop with just the pulpit there's a lot of ways to testify of jesus christ but live the people of sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it they say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet uh living they if there ever was a man of god it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get it all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you don't know well you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach this and to live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness how does that thunder thunder it's the life of jesus christ on display and it thunders out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil just like while you say if i could preach like billy graham or oral roberts or somebody a great influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that it's not always the sermon it's not always the mighty work you get all the theology you wanted to in all the seminary training and the devil just sit back and laugh at it but when he sees that life why does he fear that life because that life is light and that light brings life see if if no one if we had a message but nobody lived the message nobody else will come to light because it must be a living word that brings light and brings life the message must be lived amen for it to take effect it must be light for it to be light it must be manifest for it to be manifest it must be manifest from the seed when the seed comes to life it must manifest the life of the seed which is the life of jesus christ and that becomes light and that becomes the light of life and that's why the devil he doesn't want you to live the life amen he wants to trap you in compromise he wants to get you tied down in relationships tied up in all kinds of all kinds of things that'll tie us down and limit our expression but this is not the hour to be tied down this is to be hour to be set free because there's going to be a full display of jesus christ in a mini-membered bride to show what this message is all about this message is all about you and i coming to the headship and the life of the headship coming into the body and shining out through the temple amen through the stones clear as crystal shining where to the world amen what will it do it'll bring life to those who receive it and it'll bring death to those who reject it but we're not here to bring death we're not here to bring judgment i'm here to bring life i want to shine the light of life to bring life listen the vindication of the message is the life in the people god vindicated the messenger and he brought the message and the message came to wake up a certain seed and now that life has moved down into that seed that word that's come to life which is the bride she's come to the fullness of expression the hour for fullness of expression and she will be thundering out against the devil in sweetness and gentleness oh it may not be what we thought it would be maybe we it's not going to be what we thought the great showdown was going to be maybe you know the mount uh the mount zion showdown is not going to be uh some great exploit that we do some powerful sermon that we preach some but may it be the perfect life of sweetness and holiness sounding out say anything you want against him and he just goes right on do anything you want to them you know what i don't know what's going to happen next and i don't know what manifestation god's calling for next but i know one thing he's calling for us to manifest his life how it will all get together and what it will all be like i don't know but one thing's for sure it'll probably not be like what we expected and it probably won't be exactly what we imagined it'll probably be i mean you might have you might be closer than me but we're still going to be off so if you're closer than me you can be happy you were closer than me but you're still off and i'm still off but we live in a world that is going crazy i shouldn't say that it's not nice they're not going crazy they've already gone crazy i'm talking about individuals i'm talking about the world the systems the systems of men have lost it there is no there's no more order there's no more confidence people don't have confidence in their governments people don't have confidence in those that rule over them they don't have confidence in their political leaders they don't have confidence in their financial leaders they don't have confidence in their bosses because the corruption is so widespread it starts from the top down when the top begins to corrupt and the corruption enters the church then it enters the government when it enters the government it enters the private sector and now people will keep all kinds of funny books and it's no problem because the government keeps funny books where did you learn this i learned it from the united states government the world has lost its mind they've gone crazy and under the birth panes under the birth panes that this earth is under you know realize the birth pains are running they're coinciding with the maturity of the bride so what are birth pains pestilences wars rumors of wars natural disasters such as earthquake storms floods hurricanes tsunamis you name it have we seen an increase in any of those all of those what are they they're birth pains and the earth is groaning in travail and labor amen and they wonder they want to see the manifestation of the sons of god they want to come back into the liberty the sons of god the earth is an attribute of god and it one it wants to come back into its ought to be conditioned as much as you want to go back to your ought to be conditioned so the earth is groaning and travail just like you're groaning in travail you want to go back to a glorified condition the earth wants to go back to an even condition because under the headship of the son of god it was right at one point and under the fall of the son of god it became wrong and it's been wrong since and it wants to come back to the manifestation of the sons of god to bring the earth back into its right position that right so the earthquakes the pestilence the wars and rumors of wars and and tsunamis and earthquakes and hail storms and tornadoes and odd places and political unrest and economic crisis and i mean the weekend the list can go on and on and on and on and what is it doing it's indicating how close we are to the earth bringing forth a bright new world for a millennium but the timing of the birth pains are matched to the maturity of the bride because this bride when the bride uh when the bride leaves then there's only three and a half years for the earth the birth this bright new world completely so it's got to work its way up because everything's timed and hinged off the maturity of the bride all right so but neither can the earth go ahead and travail if the bride's not coming up to this point of maturity so when we see all the things that are going on something inside of us comes to rest there's something inside of us that begins to rejoice not at the catastrophe not at the loss of finances not at the loss of the world not at the loss of human life but at the at the condition of the birth pain showing the condition of the bride and how close we are amen to jesus christ amen sitting on the throne of david again we're so very close to that that when we see these things it brings us into further into our right mind [Music] everything the bible tells us everything the prophet told us we're seeing it unfolding before our very eyes and it's bringing a rest it's bringing a joy it's bringing a satisfaction it's bringing a peace it's bringing in anticipation and enthusiasm and excitement i hope that's what it's doing for you but what are those same events doing to the people in darkness in the world it's bringing greater fear i mean greater depression more mental illness it's bringing the the collapse of every system known to man riots in the streets and all kinds of things that are going on it's absolute chaos and the people are falling apart under the chaos losing their minds under the chaos and now we live in a world where that which is good is called evil and that which is evil is called good we're not waiting for that we're living right in the middle of that where if you raise your children according to the bible you are considered in some places a child abuser so the whole world under the birth panes is losing their mind losing their peace losing their joy losing their rest losing their security but under the same birth pains we're gaining security gaining rest growing in joy have a greater anticipation have a everybody else has lost any hope of the future we're gaining hope for the future we're on opposite tracks the world is law they've lost hope for another generation we we we're not banking on another generation i'm looking for a faith civilization to be established upon the earth and under that condition when we know who we are know where we are and know what all of this is about we shine a completely different kind of light than the rest of the world you want to talk about putting the bride on display i think she's being put on display i think the people you work with should know that there's something different about you than everybody else how could you smile and say good morning i mean didn't you hear what the president said didn't you hear this last deal and this and he said yeah shalom shalom what's shalomy said good morning but everything's falling apart and you can say but it is the rising of the sun this is not the end of my life this is the beginning of my real life amen this is what i've always wanted always long for this is what the christians have been wanting since the time of christ amen this is what the world has been trying to come back to since the fall in the garden of eden this is my greatest day you want to talk about shining light in a dark place when you take that attitude in that approach the world is getting set up this should be easier to witness than it has ever been at any time in our lives just live the life be happy be fruitful in your life live this word be good to your fellow man be honest in your dealings amen if you just do the basic things of christianity you're so far apart from the rest of the world that everybody notices we're not in the time now where you can live moral and be honest and work hard and blend in with the rest of society the rest of the society doesn't do that [Music] so if you love your wife and you love your children and you sacrifice for others and you're kind to the people you work with amen and you're always wanting to do for someone else over yourself and you're humble and you're hard-working then you're the oddest person at work i guarantee then you are the stranger in your place at work when you don't cheat on your lunch breaks when you don't cheat on your time card when you don't falsify your paperwork actually what happens is you create a problem for everybody else like your coworker is like man would you stop it your supervisor's like listen we got a status quo here and your life is exposing everything else it's shining light in the darkness and we're not talking about super spiritual gifts we're talking about just living a basic christian life what are you saying brother chad i'm saying the blood is still speaking i say today the blood is still speaking and it's speaking through the voice of many waters it's the holy ghost it's the voice of jesus christ to the holy ghost and it's still speaking and it may use words may use actions but it's still speaking brother remember said in the message life he said i want to speak on a subject for about 20-30 minutes of life life is what controls us we are known by the life that we live and it's been said that your life speaks so loud that i can't hear your testimony so therefore to live a sermon would much better than to preach me one the life you live shows what character you are your life always built your character and version in hebrews from 1957 he says and that's the way you are in your behavior of life tells what you are as we had i went through a lesson or two ago and methodist people wanted to declare when you shout you got it the pentecost will say when you spoke with tongues you got it the shaker said when you shake you got it the pennsylvania shakers and we find out that they're all wrong your life declares it your person declares what you are a man is known by his works and whatever your life is you've heard the old story your life speaks so loud i can't hear your words so whatever you are you are the life that you live shows what kind of spirit is in you and then you may impersonate the wrong thing or impersonate the right thing may i say you may impersonate a christian but there will by and by come a time when the strain will be put on then it'll show what you are a chain is strongest at its weakest link when christ the son of god was put to the test it showed what he was sure when you're put to the test it'll prove what you are your life always reflects what's on the inside of you by and by be sure your sins don't find you out this isn't the age to impersonate a message believer because the pressure's building by and by somewhere down the road that'll break you won't always be able to sit comfortably something's going to happen something will transition in your life or in the circle you circle with or somewhere around your life because god will not allow that thing to remain amen but what god wants is not an imitation life he wants the real life what we need is not a a copying or an imitating what we need is to come to the genuine new birth by the baptist holy ghost and be one of those voices that make up the voice of many waters not an imitating that eventually somewhere down the road will break but what we need is a living reality living through us [Music] we need the manifested word to quicken us to life so that we can become the manifested word which is the light of life the blood still speaks does it speak through you does it speak to your life i'll say this the blood the blood life the life that was in the blood is still speaking it's speaking through the token and the token is in the bride and it's the voice of many waters in our day again in the token brother branham said the life watch the life is took for the blood see the life is took see the life it took for the blood the blood was applied and the life could not come on the believer then for the life of the animal but see instead of a human being it was a super super superhuman being and that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of god the super super super super life that was in him comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner in the things of the world a church member and a denominational goer to a born-again christian filled with the spirit the life of god just flowing from you like sparks from an anvil as you walk catch this this get this mental picture brother brent's painting for us you're filled with the spirit the life of god just flowing from you like sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness and as the holy spirit moving speaking as the holy spirit moving and speaking how's the holy spirit moving and speaking from your life there you are he said like sparks off an anvil you see the old blacksmith when he's working and he takes out of the coals the molten hot metal and it's glowing red and he strikes it with the hammer and while having sparks fly everywhere he says that's the way our life's supposed to be as we walk through this life that light is supposed to go everywhere amen through every circumstance in life through every blow through every blessing through every defeat through everything let the light let the sparks come off in the gentleness and the sweetness and the life of christ let this message live [Music] let it be the living word the manifested word the the light of life to live out the life of jesus christ i want to end with two verses let's go to john chapter 7 and we'll finish with these two john chapter 7. jesus told his disciples he told the pharisees he said referring to john he said john was a burning and shining light why because john was the manifested word for his day and he said you were happy to walk in his light for a season but you didn't stay there john was the light jesus was the light the manifested word is always the light and what's the word what's the portion of the word to be manifested in this day it's supposed to be the bride the body of jesus christ connected to the head and the life of the head in the body on full display that's the hour that we live in in john 7 it says i'm going to read from verse 37 john 7 and 37 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified he said if any man thirsty let him come unto me and drink and out of his belly from within him will flow rivers of living water what is this waters of life it's all about life the life of the blood the life is in the word the the manifested light brings life and now we're talking about the rivers of life which flow from the throne of god let's go to revelation 22 to the ending of the book revelation 22. revelation 22 and 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely where's that living water coming from if you've drunk from him and received the holy ghost it's coming out of your belly and in the end the bride the spirit and the bride the voice of jesus christ through the holy ghost now with the sound of many waters the blood is speaking today it can speak for you or it can speak against you let's let it speak for us let's live the kind of life where there's a clear voice going out so that others can find their way to truth and come to life let's be more encouraged to ever to give him preeminence because that's what he's called for in this day but it's not preeminence for a preeminent sake it's preeminence because that's the life of jesus christ on display and that's what's going to reverse the whole order of this world and that's what will bring life and in the end of the book the spirit and the bride are saying which one said it did they time it did they say it did they say okay one two three let's say no it's the spirit in the bride the spirit and the bride they're saying the same thing she's not taking her own mind she's not speaking her own words she's not speaking her own doctrine when we come to the end time the spirit which is the voice of jesus christ through the holy ghost which is the voice of the blood which the voice of the blood is the word and the voice of the the voice of the blood is the holy ghost and now the word with the spirit is speaking and a lived life in a word in a preaching in whatever it is when you go when you go talk to a restaurant and mom and dad are in harmony and dad opens the door for mom and she walks in and the kids are smiling and you all sit down and everyone cares for one another and loves one another and there's a respect from mom to dad there's a love from cherries from dad to mom and all the kids are in harmony nobody's screaming nobody's yelling nobody's playing video games on their phone and they're all sitting there talking to one another and they bow their heads and they pray over their meal i'm telling you the blood is speaking it's speaking amen when a woman walks through a store dressed like jesus christ would be dressed if he was in your flesh and a man conducts himself and dresses himself like jesus christ would dress and he says hello the way jesus would say hello i tell you the blood is speaking and what's it doing it's calling seeds to life if there's a seed out there come to life if not if it's rejected god will take care of the rejection judgment will come but the blood is speaking amen it's speaking life it's speaking light it's creating an opportunity amen when you walk down the street when you walk through the store when you the way you conduct yourself at work and handle yourself as a family listen don't think of it in the negative thinking in the positive with a sister when when you walk into that store every man there knows you're right i'm telling you he knows you're right it's inside of him and every woman knows you're right that's why she can't stand you it's the truth inside not on her mind but deep inside she knows you're right and that's why every woman in there doesn't like you and every man in there will respect you get out of the way open the door for you help you if something falls what are you doing you're calling out come come the life is here it's available it's real the word is still present the blood is still here there's a voice speaking come when when you sit down to that meal and bow your heads a family in harmony you're crying out to everybody in the restaurant come you're you're at work the way you operate the way you manage yourself the honesty the integrity with which you have your christian walk on display you're calling to your co-workers come the life is calling out if there's any life come if there's any life come amen that's why compromise is so deadly it's so dark perverted word is such darkness and such death amen this isn't the hour to take our own minds but to come to the message and say god shape me to be exactly what this word says because i want a life that calls come i want to walk and a walk in this life that calls come come come come to the waters of life the contrast is becoming greater and i believe it will become greater yet and that's the that's the opportunity for the light to shine brighter because the bright the light shines brightest in the face of darkness and the darker it gets the brighter the light the contrast is a wonderful opportunity to cry come come come into the word come into the way that's right come back to the lord when you when you structure your family structure your life structure your home dress yourself conduct yourself speak like a christian speak like christ you're crying to everyone you come in contact with come come to the light come to the life there's light of life flying out like like the sparks off of an anvil come would anybody like to come we know they'll be the last one come in one day and when they come in nobody else can receive that light but as far as we know that's not happened so i said let the light go out let the light of life go out and find a dormant life and call it to life and say come compromise is death leaving the word is death darkness cannot mix with light darkness brings death i say i'm more determined than ever god helped me to stay away from all of the world and all of the darkness let me cling to this word and surrender to this word like never before and let my life come how many believe the blood is still speaking speaks on our behalf but i want it to be a voice that's calling come to some predestinated seed out there somewhere and how will they know the way when they see the word living in you a written epistle that's when they'll start asking the questions that's when they'll come to the word that's when the light of life will strike their heart but this message has to come off the book and into a life to shine the light of the hour to bring the light of life i say god let it be in this vessel right here let's all stand musicians if you would come i would just like to go on the record to say shalom brother branham comes to this place in 1964 and in 1965 and he starts preaching some interesting messages he preaches shalom and shalom he says is a good morning good morning he preaches it is the rising of the sun 65 he preaches there's a man here that can turn on the light he preaches turn on the light i think the light has come [Music] arise shine for thy light has come shine friends shine the light amen it's a good morning it's darkness all around gross darkness but in the evening time it shall be light this is our good morning this is our rising of the sun this is our bright and shining light this is our freedom this is our life it's come to us in this day this is not time to be sad because there's a man here that can turn on the light and that light is the light of life let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being here today to hear your word and to recognize our day oh god if it wasn't for your grace it would be impossible if it wasn't that your mercy came and grabbed a hold of me lord there's no way but i'm so thankful lord there was somebody willing to shine the light the day that i needed to come in contact with light and god you brought me to life lord i pray that you would help me forgive me lord for any compromise in my life forgive me for my own thinking for wanting my own ways and selfish desires help me to surrender to that lord god i want to shine a true light i want to exude a gospel light i want a life that christ come come to the fountain of living water and drink come to the source of life and be renewed come to light come to life lord live through me i pray wash away all lord all the things that still hold all the things that need to go wash it out of me and take preeminence in me lord god your blood is still speaking today it's speaking life it's speaking mercy it's speaking light to those who can receive it god i pray that your light would strike the seeds that they would come to life god if there's anybody here lord who realizes that they've been pretending trying to live a life but no assurance lord that they receive the light and come to light god i pray that they would surrender to you and receive lord the light of life that they would receive the baptism of the holy ghost and they would allow you to take full control of their lives that they would die to self that they would surrender and they would invite you lord they would invite you to take over their life take control and i pray you would give them an experience lord an experience where they would know something changed lord that there was from that day forward something changed something was different my desires it's no longer me trying but something in me is trying something in me is living god i pray you bring life under the power of your word under the light that wins forth i pray you bring life in this place life in your people lord life to those who receive the word god i pray you'll live your life through us may we be in this end time be a clear voice the voice of many waters and may it be your voice coming through our life we yield ourselves to you and ask you to take greater control in jesus christ's name where everything that i hold dear [Music] [Music] all i want to see is jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music]
