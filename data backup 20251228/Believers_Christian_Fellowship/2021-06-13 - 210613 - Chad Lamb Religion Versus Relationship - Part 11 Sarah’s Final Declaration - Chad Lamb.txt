for her prayers she's up she's walking around she's starting to feel better the pain is starting to subside and so by god's grace we'll get to see her here pretty soon so thank you for that let's look in genesis chapter 1 verse 27. if you notice we're having a hard time getting completely out of genesis but it's the seed of everything it's the beginning and everything that we see throughout the rest of the bible began in genesis and genesis 1 and 27 says so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed him and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless his word lord jesus we thank you for the privilege father of coming here today for we know lord at your grace and your mercy in our lives that has drawn us to yourself and brought us back to this time and god as we look into your word we just ask all that you would come yourself and with your own hands would you take the bread of life and break it for us lord that our eyes might be open and we might see it you who's breaking the bread for us and you who's feeding us lord with the fresh manna from heaven i pray god you'd have preeminence that you would open our eyes to see and give us ears to hear may our hearts perceive all that you're trying to speak to us in this day for this is the day that you're calling us to manifest your word to live your life to manifest your name upon this earth and god we need you we need your word we need your word alive inside of us we ask that you would bring quickening power to make this word live we ask for your blessings now in jesus christ's name amen you can have your seats let's stay in in genesis here we see that there was a commandment given to adam when adam was not yet put in flesh he was still spirit man and he was male and female and he had given a commandment that he should multiply and replenish the earth and so that was the word of god that was a commandment given to him and we know that that spirit man was taken and placed in a body of flesh in genesis chapter 2 and that god saw that he was alone and god said it was not good that man should dwell alone so god himself amen performed the first marriage and in order to find a suitable help me he brought up out of the ground all of his creation everything and brought it before adam and adam could not find a suitable help me out of all of that because adam's suitable help meet was within him he could only find something that reflected him that reflected his character it reflected his nature reflected what he was he could only have fellowship amen with a part of himself so god took and laid him down asleep and pulled from him a rib and you know he split the feminine and masculine spirit of adam and he from the rib he made a the woman and he placed that feminine spirit within the woman and then he united the two back together again amen in holy matrimony and he said it is very good and after he finished with this masterpiece then he took his rest praise god but then we know the serpent slipped in to disrupt god's masterpiece and let's look at genesis chapter 2 verse 16. chapter 2 verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat us thereof thou shalt surely die so god gave man one commandment that man he was told to multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over it and he was told one thing to avoid and that was this tree of knowledge of good and evil now we look at chapter three and go to verse six and we know this is the temptation of the woman and the serpent came and began to ask questions and began to tempt her with wisdom and ask her and begin to say verse four let's start at verse four and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doesn't know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was so pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so we see we've been talking about this quite a while but they were under a veil of innocency they they did not know they did not see and view one another if naked they could see one another naked but there was no lust there was no temptation amen for the nakedness of the other one because they were under a veil of innocency but when the serpent came to them and began to persuade her amen concerning this tree that they were not supposed to partake of amen he begins to entice her and begins to contradict the word of god and she begins to look at this tree and now her wisdom and intellect and reasoning begins to kick in and instead of just simple faith in the word of god she begins to reason it out because there is this commandment to multiply and replenish and surely i mean surely this is the way god wants to do it and surely the serpent knows what he's talking about and she was deceived thinking that this was a good thing amen she was beguiled and so now she partook then she gave to her husband and he took with her and then their eyes were open and they knew that they were naked and immediately they made themselves a religion a covering of fig leaves something they made themselves to cover their nakedness and when god came in the cool of the evening and he began to speak the voice of god began to penetrate the religion the voice of god began to penetrate all the all that they had made to cover themselves their own atonement their own covering their own shield for their own sin the voice of god began to penetrate that and adam hid himself in the presence of the lord and and god called for him and he said i hid myself because i was naked amen technically he was not naked he had fig leaves covering his uh his covering his sin his neckiness was covered but in the presence of god and the presence of that voice that voice penetrated his fig leaves and he knew that he was still naked before god and i thank god that he sent a voice of a prophet in this day which was the voice of god that penetrated our fig leaves amen penetrated our catholic and baptist and presbyterian fig leaves amen until he had no more comfort and man-made religion and man's system of covering for himself taking the word of god and fashioning in any way that was comfortable to him and then he began to dress himself and dress other people in a product that he had made what were the fig leaves the fig leaves were something that god provided but man had taken and perverted even god's fig leaves man can't get anything right imagine god saying what are you doing with my fig leaves shows you the foolishness of man the very thing that god made man begins to pervert it and corrupt it and and misuse it and he makes his own covering out of it but the voice of god penetrates that covering and i thank god the voice of god penetrates the cover i'm so thankful when i heard that voice amen i found myself naked was it a pleasant experience no it wasn't a pleasant experience that it caused fear and trembling absolutely amen there was times amen that i wished i hadn't heard is that the truth there was times that i wish i hadn't heard because once i heard amen the voice penetrated my fig leaves and i knew that these were no good for a covering and i had to throw away my religious ideas and throw away the traditions of my family throughout the traditions of my parents and how i was brought up and i had to come to that voice and that voice would provide a blood sacrifice and that voice would provide a covering for my nakedness the very presence of god that adam was hiding from was the very father who would provide for him a reconciliation back to a restored fellowship and there's many people who are hiding with fig leaves on amongst the trees out amongst the people in the garden amen they've hid themselves and they won't come to that voice because they fear the voice because the voice will bring judgment to their condition and they want to stay away from the voice of the father but it's the voice of the father that will come and judge you wrong but as soon as he judges you wrong he will provide a sacrifice for an atonement for you and clothe you in the skins of that substitutionary one and he will redeem you he will bring you back to fellowship with himself so we don't want to be afraid of the voice of god in this day in the pergam church age out of the church age book the prophet of god says the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself is that what the commission was multiply and replenish himself he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die so god he went through this whole act of separating out of adam his wife and restoring the two back to one and saying the two shall be one flesh and all of that he was given a bride to reproduce himself that's why she was given and so if we just think about this statement the prophet makes he was told to multiply and replenish and then then god in fulfilling his own word amen was going to bring about the necessary fulfillment of that word and the first thing that he would need is he would need himself in the form of a woman adam in the form of a woman adam and adam couldn't do it alone but adam in the form of a woman and now a uniting back together of the male and the female amen was going to be god's provided means amen and now god was god was working his plan but the whole purpose of separating out eve the woman and bringing her back into restored fellowship with adam the whole purpose was for adam to reproduce himself and if they never got to the reproduction amen for another son of god upon the earth she would have failed in her purpose is that right now i forgot to tell you my title i often forget but we're continuing on religion versus relationship part 11 but the subtitle is sarah's final declaration sarah's final declaration and we're going to go around the cow shed to get there so just hang on tight but we'll get there by the grace of god in the message wisdom versus faith prophet said eve come and said the lord god said the day we eat thereof that day we die then she stopped to see what he would say he said but listen my dear you lovely little thing see surely god made you for a purpose where is he striking her at god had never given that revelation yet of how and when and why but he says surely god made you for a purpose you know that's right you're a woman you were made for this purpose that's what it is you don't know it now but you were made for this purpose oh you're a lovely little thing dear look at those dainty little hands why sure you will surely but he said if we did we we'd die he said but oh you think that a good loving father god would do a thing like that what'd she do she listened to reason took his wisdom said it's a tree delight one can be desired of it she fell for it that's exactly and when she did what happened like it would to any woman as soon as you fall for it it finishes right there that's right now you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of god through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait she went into that so there was a there was a prophecy and the prophecy was going to have a fulfillment the commandment to multiply replenish but she wouldn't wait for the spoken word of god amen she was enticed to move ahead of the word of god by wisdom and by reasoning in the resume of the ages out of the church age book the prophet says with these principles in mind we start to trace the church through the various seven ages the birth of the church was at pentecost as the first adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of god and was undefiled for a brief span so was christ the last adam given a bride pure and fresh at pentecost and she remains separated and undefiled for some time and he goes to two scriptures out of the book of acts it says and the rest durst not man join himself to them and the lord added daily such as would be saved goes on to say how long this continued we do not know but one day even as eve was tempted and seduced by satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of the antichrist spirit first john 4 3 and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world and jesus said concerning his bride in the first age i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent revelation 2 4. it goes on in the quote to say the church was in that first age already a fallen woman he's showing a repeat of what happened in the garden already a fallen woman as satan had gotten to eat before adam even now had satan seduced the church the bride of christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused that fall what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans already that first age had turned from following the pure word of god they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government how did eve fall what was the fault of the woman in the beginning amen she started to think she had something to do in it amen and he began to entice her that through human effort through wisdom through knowledge and through understanding amen that she would produce the promise and she failed to wait amen and this church now under the deeds in the nicolaitans they began to move a church that was completely dependent on god producing his word they turned from god's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him dependent entirely upon god to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government to nicolaitanism which is organizing a human government within the church which is all governments do legislate for the people they did exactly what israel did they took the expediency of human government instead of the word and the spirit what happened what caused her to fall and then she began to think she had something to do with it and through human government through a structure through an organization through a church system and then they become begin to come up with a system by which they could serve god and fulfill god's word instead of remaining completely dependent on the spirit of god to lead the church then men got in and men begin to legislate and control and dictate then they started their schools and their seminaries and their educations and meant through wisdom and intellect and understanding started dictating to the church amen how to serve god and what pleased god what the interpretation of the word was and how you should do this and how you should do that and that that's not what god wanted god wanted a church that was completely dependent upon him to fulfill his word through them from start to finish and if eve would have stayed there if the woman would have stayed there all would have been fine but she began to listen to the wisdom of the serpent and the fourth seal brother bam says what is the organizational system the first number one church organized and we took the understanding of constantine at the nicene council we brought them women last night and showed how that eve the first bride before her husband ever got there she fell by disbelieving god's word in eden the spiritual bride that was born on the day of pentecost of christ before he could get to her what happened she fell at rome forfeited her virtue of the word for dogma amen if if adam was given a wife a bride to reproduce himself then christ through the pentecost was given a bride to reproduce himself it's the same thing continuing on so if there's a failure where's the failure the failure is staying virtuous the failure is staying pure and clean and virtuous and separated for him to come and fulfill his own word his way in his time from start to finish and when eve began to take on the wisdom and understanding of the serpent and began to by her own lust looking and by her own discernment amen no longer to the discernment of the word but by her own mind began to analyze the tree and could not find fault with the tree for it was good pleasant to the eyes good for food one to be desired to make one wisdom make one wise she was using her own understanding and by her own understanding she was listening to the serpent and then she began to think that this would be correct i've got something to do into this and it caused the fall then the first church came out under the baptism of the holy ghost amen by the spirit of god moving and leading the churches and the church and they begin to do the same thing they begin to listen to the enticement of the devil and begin to bring in wisdom and understanding in their own intellect and it began to tie down the church and move them into ways that was contrary to god's design now let's go to genesis 15. i want to pick up here and talk about sarah but i want to lay that as a foundation so we understand what we're looking at genesis chapter 15 we're going to begin reading at verse 1. after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and i exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house was mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying thus shall not this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and and said look now toward the heaven and toward the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness what did abraham do to be righteous believe the lord he believed what the lord told him in that day and that hour the promise for that hour he told him and he believed and it was counted unto him for righteousness then he told him what was going to happen he says but one of your loins out of you your own seed i shall raise up a son this servant won't be your seed your heir but one out of your own vows and so that was the promise of god now listen there was that there this was what god had promised to do this is what god had said he would do and if abraham and sarah can just hold still god will perform his own word but the problem is that they're going to move the same way this story has always been told down through the bible what happened to the woman and what what happened to the first church now begins to work in sarah and in genesis chapter 16 verse one after the promise is already given to abraham that he shall have a son of his own bowels it says now sarai abram's wife bare him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarah i said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarah of the voice of sarai and sarah abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes you see sarah is now doing the same thing that the woman did at the beginning what eve had done there's a promise given the promise is sure god will do it god will keep his word and whatever god said be sure that god will keep his word but now sarah she becomes the tool in the devil's hand just like the serpent was the tool in the devil's hand then the woman became the tool in the devil's hand now sarah is a tool in the devil's hand to try to disrupt this plan and she begins to use wisdom and intellect and reasoning and she begins to look at her own condition and and she blames god is that what she did verse 2 sarah said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing obviously obviously this is not god's plan because god has stopped me from bearing now take my handmaid this is her own wisdom this is her own understanding she's trying to get to the promise but she's trying to come according to her own design her own wisdom her own intellect and she's looking at her condition and the inability of herself to bring forth a child and she's beginning to doubt because of what her eyes see she begins to doubt because of what her eyes see she begins to doubt because of what she feels amen and and so now because she believes the word it's not that she doubts the word she believes the word but now she begins to say obviously obviously how obvious is it that the lord won't do it this way who says god won't do it this way just because he hasn't done it that way doesn't mean he won't do it that way just because you haven't conceived yet you had lived with your husband since you were a young girl they lived together as husband and wife for all of these years and there was never a conception that has nothing to do with the word of god amen that has nothing there's no limiting factor in god the physical condition the situations the time it means nothing to the word of god because the word of god is eternal and it's powerful it breaks every bond it heals it delivers the word of god will find its own way to bring itself to pass because the word has its own life i want to go on in genesis but i want to break right here hold your place in genesis and go over to read hebrews 11 with me we'll read one passage in hebrews 11 and jump right back to genesis hebrews 11 and verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called to go out to a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went see abraham had the kind of faith he didn't have to know everything before he obeyed you know brother branham calls this age the abrahamic age and the abrahamic age well because what's he doing he's calling the royal seed of abraham who have the same nature the same faith amen the same characteristics of abraham is going to be expressed in the seed of abraham in this end time this bright age is an abrahamic age and in the abrahamic age god could call abram and he would go out not knowing where he went because that's the faith that he's looking for the faith of abraham that will move out at the command of god without knowing what the destination is or how long the journey will be when we'll arrive and what it will look like where there will be food will there be a city will i have a house they didn't know any of those things all they know was god called him out and he eventually obeyed and he went out by the word of god not knowing what they would look like he had never been there before he didn't have any contacts there he didn't have any arrangements when he got there i could stay with aunt so and so and uncle this well he had nothing but the word of god to tell him to go and in this abrahamic age he will have a seat of abraham that will operate by the faith of abraham they'll have somebody who will believe his word even when you can't see in your own self how it's possible even when your eyes and your ears and your intellect and your reasoning and all the history that you've had upon this earth tell you that it's not possible there'll be something on the inside of the abraham see abraham's faith seed in the abrahamic age that'll say it doesn't matter what i see it doesn't matter what i hear it doesn't matter what i understand all that matters is he said so abraham verse 8 by faith not by reasoning not by intellect not by wisdom not by experience by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he so adjourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in the tabernacle and going in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is god you know abraham never stopped his journey because he was looking for the city of god he didn't settle down he didn't build a kingdom and he didn't build a walled city abraham never stopped because his pursuit was not for gay selfish gain his pursuit was not for himself but he was pursuing god and he was looking for that city a city that has foundations whose builder and maker is gone now verse 11 is what i want to concentrate on through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable if adam was given a bride to reproduce himself and christ at pentecost was given a bride to reproduce himself why was abraham given a bride to reproduce himself and until sarah oh just listen to me until sarah could believe until sarah through faith receive strength to conceive see until sarah's faith got to this place until sarah through faith could get strength to conceive seed that purpose was not realized the purpose was for abraham the promise was to abraham that abraham was going to bring forth a seed that there was going to be a promised deed through abraham but abraham needed sarah sarah was part of abraham and sarah could or abraham could have faith amen but until sarah had faith to receive strength to conceive seed nothing was moving forward in the program of god because everything moves in the program of god by faith and abraham had faith but sarah was part of abraham so the other part of abraham had to have the faith of abraham also abraham had enough faith to go out and so joined in a strange land not knowing where he went sarah just went along with abraham but there was going to come a time that it was going to require that sarah herself had faith amen that sarah herself had faith because when sarah herself could have faith then would bring the word of god to pass praise god adam believed his wife believed but she believed and reasoned because she was going to have to have faith to produce this promise christ was given a bride but before she could come to that place to conceive she was already a fallen woman there was no fault in christ there was no lack of faith in him but it was going to take something in her also because she was part of him and together they were wide and together it would produce the promise so sarah herself was going to have to have faith let's read that again through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised something happened between her offering hagar and this scripture being fulfilled is that true because it says here that she was past age but she judged him faithful who had promised but we just read in chapter 16 that she said the lord has restrained from me bearing forth seed now take hagar my servant she she wasn't judging him faithful who promised she was saying he who promised is not letting me have it so now maybe there's another plan and i think i can take this handmaid and give it to you something was going to happen to change sarah's faith to bring her faith to a higher level because she was not operating by the right faith in genesis chapter 16. there was going to require something she was going to have to see something experienced i mean something was going to have to get sarah into a better position because she was going to have to judge him faithful who made the promise but so far she was saying he was the reason it wasn't happening to her and so obviously it's not this isn't how he's going to do it so we're going to have we can't just sit here abraham and die we've got to do something what can we do well you know it's legal for you to take my hand mate and apparently that's how god may be that that's how god's going to fulfill his word by reasoning by intellect that's the downfall of religion all over the world that's the downfall of christianity everywhere we've got something to do in this we've got to figure something out and then god's not going to do it all he left something for us to do that's true he left something for you to do and that's to believe his word that's what he left for you to do believe his word and surrender yourself to his word and let him do what he promised to do because the only way it's going to be right is if he does it if you do it it won't be right if you do it it's going to become perverted corrupted somewhere along the line it's going to fall apart because everything man does and everything man touches falls into ruin but you've got a part you absolutely have a part that part is to believe what he said and surrender yourself to it wholly completely with no thought of your own with no reasoning with no holding back just believe the word and give yourself to the world and until you have the right kind of faith the promises is on hold amen is that right and sarah until sarah had the right kind of faith the promises on hold yes so sarah herself i love that word herself amen just bring it home today friends just bring it home sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered how did how did sarah herself receive strength to receive seed through faith something moved her faith from where it was in genesis 16 to where it was here in hebrews chapter 11. through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude as the sands of the sea for sure innumerable what was verse 12 verse 12 is the fulfillment of the promised word that god gave to abraham look at the stars so shall thou seed be verse 12 saying the now comes therefore therefore therefore what does therefore mean because because of what because she had faith and because through faith she was given strength to conceive seed because she judged him faithful who had made the promise to keep the brothers because of that now is the fulfillment of the promise between god making the promise and the fulfillment of the promise stood sarah amen and sarah through faith would receive strength to bring forth the promise praise be to god let's go back to genesis so god said i will raise you up a seed your seed shall be as the stars innumerable then god further clarified later he said out of sarah from sarah shall the seed be born so god god was promised this word from abraham he was given a bride to produce the word to produce the promised son and that promised son would bring the fulfillment of the word but it was going to be done by faith when sarah herself received strength it didn't matter how strong abraham was because when abraham was strong in the faith there was no conception but when when sarah through faith received strength to conceive now there was a conception amen let's go to genesis chapter 18. in verse 17 god comes to abraham to confirm the promise and there's a covenant made by the dividing of the animals and the pillar of fire passes through and he speaks and in verse 17 god says that you're going to change sarai's name to sarah because she's going to get a name change amen because there's an identification there she's a princess amen and she's going to bring forth this promised seed and god confirmed the promise and then in verse 18 it says and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory something is going to happen between verse 16 and the fulfillment of the promise something that is going to give sarah faith amen because in verse 16 she didn't have faith that she was going to conceive is that true and she didn't have strength to conceive in verse 16. she didn't have strength to conceive she didn't have faith to conceive she offered up her handmaid but she's going to get to the place that hebrews 11 declared that she through faith was going to receive strength and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and he looked and loathed three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them in the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and he said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray be fetched and wash your feet wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts and after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and abraham hastened to the tent and to sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and bake cakes upon the earth and abraham ran into the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress him and he took butter and milk and and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent praise god abraham in his is going to receive a visitation from elohim in flesh in this visitation of elohim and flesh it is god coming in a tabernacle of flesh and in that tabernacle of flesh he had dust on his feet that could be washed off by abraham he would eat the meat of a calf he would drink milk taste the butter amen he was in flesh but it was elohim and elohim was going to perform a sign it was going to be the sign of the messiah and he was going to show this sign because this sign is the one that we are going to recognize in this day he said where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him where was the tent behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women she could not possibly conceive in her natural condition therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh he's discerning her thoughts in the tent behind him this is the sign of the messiah because when jesus christ came he could do the same thing when the pharisees would come to him he could discern their thoughts and begin to answer their questions because he knew what was in their heart and now elohim in flesh he comes on the scene amen and now shares in the tent behind him and he's coming to confirm the promise but in confirming the promise he has to build faith and in building faith he's got to tell sarah it's not hagar it's not anybody else but it's going to be sarah your wife i'm going to confirm the promise through sarah your wife and sarah once again looks at her condition once again she looks at herself oh if we ever fail god it's by looking at ourselves friends if you ever look at yourself too much you're going to fail god you're going to fail to believe his promise in this hour because you're going to look at a body of flesh that was born through hybridization you're going to look at what comes through the union of your mother and father and what's written on your birth certificate but if you can look past that to what was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world if you could look to this attribute and the seed and the soul and not look to the flesh and have faith in what god said god is able to perform everything that he has said would be performed by the bride in this day there's nothing to hinder him there's nothing to stop him the only thing that stops him is a lack of faith because when jesus christ was on earth he would go into a city amen and he would heal all the sick that they brought to him in that city he would go to another travel to another city and there he could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief you say jesus christ he was limited jesus christ chose to move his program forward by faith that's god's chosen method that's god's chosen way amen so when sarah was struggling with faith he was going to show up in a body of flesh amen so that he can confirm the promise no it's not hagar no it's not anybody else but it's sarah and sarah when god was here in flesh sarah began to look at her old age shall i being old have pleasure with my lord and him also we're going to go back to living like young men and women and she laughed within herself the whole purpose of elohim being here was to get sarah to believe the whole purpose of elohim coming down in a body of flesh to perform the sign of the messiah was to get sarah to believe that she's the one and this word is true and the time is now and god has sent a prophet in our day and it was none other than god himself operating through that tabernacle of flesh with feet that could be washed and could eat amen it could converse with you and could walk down the road amen it was god tabernacled in a body of flesh and that flesh was his prophet william branham and he would turn his back to the crowd and begin to discern the thoughts of the people here and over here and in the balcony showing the sign of the messiah not to show off a sign not to show off the gift but to get to sarah to believe that it's you you're the one the promise is for you and the time is now why did you hear and see that sign why are you the one who got the tape and there's millions out there that didn't get the tape why are you the one who got to see prophet visit south africa read prophet vs south africa why are you the one that got to see 20th century prophet and deep call it to the deed millions have seen it millions haven't seen it millions have seen and rejected it but something in you said that's the truth that's god a man can't do that that's god and it wasn't done so you can say that's god and i've seen god in flesh and god come in flesh but god come in flesh for a purpose and that purpose was to bring sarah's faith up a little bit higher because sarah was doubting because of her condition praise god i hope we can stop doubting because of our condition it has nothing to do with our condition god has already sent a word to change our condition he had already brought us from death unto life abraham's seed was dead sarah's wound was dead but in the visitation of elohim he was going to bring a resurrection from the dead and this is a resurrection ministry this is a resurrection hour it's the raising up of the word it's the raising up of the bride everything was dead when elohim came to them the word had been laying dead for years the seed word that was in abraham has been laying dead for years the bride was stuck in formalism and reasoning stuck in an old thinking in an old condition that i being old can't bring forth life everything was dead when elohim and flesh came on the scene and the purpose of elohim coming in flesh was to quicken them to life to bring them back to the condition where the seed can be given and the seed can be received praise god there's so many that can see that god sent a mighty prophet there was a mighty work that was done and there was amazing discernment amazing healing amazingness amazing that it's like people know that there was an elohim there was a jehovah god who showed up on the plains of memory to talk to abraham and discern the thoughts of sarah and the tent behind him but they missed the purpose of that discernment [Music] you and i are the purpose of that discernment friends praise god verse 11. now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of surety bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord and at the same point at the same time appointed i will return at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laughed not who is she talking to god in flesh sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh now the discernment was performed on her now the thoughts of her heart were being declared openly and although she denied it there was a man there there was god in a body of flesh and a man there that could go beyond her words and know what was in her heart [Music] and i'm telling you there's a man here today that can go beyond whatever you say whatever your false confession whatever you're denying there's still elohim here and he can come now and he can begin to discern what's in your thoughts amen he can begin to break down what you're thinking amen and he's not doing he wasn't doing it to punish sarah he wasn't doing it to cast her away he was giving her the discernment so she would know that he was god amen because no man could know what i was thinking no man would know what i was thinking that has to be god and what did it do to her it gave her faith for a body change praise be to god brother banham says in the spoken word is the original seed he said and the angel showed abraham who he was that he was the word he said why did sarah laugh so he he called her forth and said i never but he said you did what that's gracie right there god would have slew her right there but he couldn't [Music] hey amen i don't care what you're thinking i don't care what you thought i don't care what you said what you've denied amen there's one thing that holds you in the plan of god and that's predestination has everything to do with where you came from and who you're part of he couldn't all see our stupidity he'd kill every one of us but he can't to kill sarah he'd had to take abraham because sarah was part of abraham they were one in union and to take the church and destroy it he can't do it because it's part of himself christ part of himself the word being made flesh amazing grace how sweet the sound couldn't do it you get it he couldn't kill her he couldn't take her life because she was part of abraham she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones and our mistakes don't say well i made a failure no don't make them abraham made failures too see but he couldn't take the church he can't kill the elected he can't take your life because you're part of himself you're the word the word is in you it's manifest itself proving itself love joy peace long suffering all the words of god you believe every one of them you believe every one of them work and god working through you you're a part of the word which is christ and we are taught that he is the word and we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone there you are you're part of christ an attribute of god a son or daughter of god come from god the only way you can be a son or daughter of god is if you originated in god if you've come from god you're a part of christ amen and we've thought all kinds of things amen and probably said all kinds of things we shouldn't say but he couldn't destroy us because there's a promise there's a promise and that promise has to be fulfilled and god made that promise to abraham it automatically included abraham's wife because those two are one and when god made a promise to him he made a promise that promise included sarah and he was going to use sarah to fulfill the promise and without sarah the promise was on haunt [Music] do you understand the church ages she'd gotten older and older and older and older until it looked impossible and that's when elohim come in flesh [Music] to bring the sign of the messiah to increase her faith to believe in the message the token he says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride in christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same how can he do it without his bride the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same listen the ministry of abraham and the mystery of sarah became the same so abraham was to bring forth a royal seed abraham was going to and then the natural was going to type that and bringing forth the promised seed of isaac that was his commission that was his promise that was the work god was going to do for him that was his ministry amen but his ministry became her ministry because they were one they had the same ministry [Music] and that ministry was to bring forth the promisee so god had to get her in the right condition let's turn to malachi 4. but we're coming back to genesis so don't lose your place there malachi chapter 4. malachi chapter 4 verse 5. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse god has left the second half of this prophecy to turn the children the hearts of the children to their fathers he has saved it for our day and he has sent the spirit of elijah and the prophet of brother branham and he's come to turn our hearts back to what we were in the beginning prophet of god says 1963 malachi the fourth chapter promises us that the last days that there would come forth the message that would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original faith of the fathers they promised it jesus promised it faith of the end time believers we see the original messiah sign notice if he's raised from the dead and the creeds has put him out all these years and denied that that truth then the thing that we've got to look for in the last days is a turning back to the original faith back to the faith of the early pentecostal fathers in jehovah jairo from 1964 he says and he was well told us and promises these things according to the bible in many places even the old testament promises it in malachi 4 that how it would be the last days would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers as the pentecostal fathers the original doctrine of the bible the original word that what it would do so what does it mean to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers he wants to bring him back to the original word the original new testament church back to what paul wrote back to what the apostles wrote back to what they meant when what they said he's going to take them back to the original doctor in the bible back to the original word and resume of the ages he says but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age and her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning thus saith the lord see when god was going to bring forth his promise of abraham's seed the promised seed it was god's word and that god god's word went and that word had to be fulfilled and god was going to have to get them in a condition amen so that they could conceive and bring forth a child so god shows up on the planes of memory and there's been so many things happen in so many obstacles and separations and and things that they had learned and finally he shows up and and it's elohim and a body of flesh and he's going to perform the sign of the messiah and in performing the sign of this messiah he's also confirming the promise and in confirming the promise when he confirms the promise he specifically mentions sarah because sarah is the key to fulfilling the promise that's why in this day when that prophet gone that prophet preached so much about the bride and preached the church would be the bride the bride the bride the bride because she's the key to the fulfillment of the promise amen our our last adam has already come he's already performed the word he's already done exactly what the word will say he will do he's already paid the price of redemption to buy back his lost wife and all of creation he's already provided his spirit amen that'll bring a new birth that'll bring a restoration to the church he's already done his work he's already done everything and now he's got to get this bride in condition she's the key so when when when god shows up in memory speaks to abraham he speaks specifically it's time now for you this child i will perform this word and i will bring through sarah and that's when sarah doubts because the discernment has to be done on sarah so that she'll believe and what does he do he turns them back immediately after the sign of the messiah after this episode and what else does he do he reveals the sixth seal to abraham because he shows him the destruction of sodom and gomorrh and he shows them that there'll be a remnant that will be saved out of that because he intercedes and all of that takes place right there in between what is it he's showing the sixth seal to abraham amen and at that time he does the he does the discernment he shows the sixth seal to abraham and then we know as the prophet told us when they wake up something was different maybe sarah looked over at abraham and screamed she may have thought some strange man is in my tents because he had been turned back young again and he looked at sarah said what are you screaming about go look in the mirror and then she screamed a second time because he came to show the sign of the messiah to take them back to their original marriage condition when they were first unionized when they were first brought together in marriage because that's what god has done he has restored the word back to the full word that was given through the apostles and the prophets he's taken the word back and he's taken the bride back he's brought them back to their original condition at pentecost that's what this message has done friends it's brought that it's brought the word and has brought the bride back to their original union their original marriage condition at pentecost [Music] and we know that's true because after chapter 19 which is destruction of sodom and gomorrah and the saving of lot and all that happens there you go to verse 20 or chapter 20. let's turn to chapter 20. genesis 20 and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelt between kadish and sure and sojourn and gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and a demon like king of garage sent and took sarah 90 years old he wanted her for his harem because she was so beautiful 90 years old he could have any woman in the kingdom he wanted but here come a fresh new 90 year old and he wanted her showing that the event and memory brought them faith to go back to their original marriage condition oh praise god i said god help me to deliver what's on my heart in the laodicean church age from the church age book prophet of god said now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers it was when he come and showed that elohim was hearing flash and elohim could confirm the promise and elohim could discern and then it was it was showing that the lamb was present to take the book and break the seals and loose the revelation thereof amen this this revelation this manifestation this presence of god among them through the sign of the messiah and the restoration of the word will bring them back to their original marriage condition and now they're turned back young again now she goes back to being the bride that she was at pentecost the word goes back to its original condition not old not weak not incapable of producing life but the word has gone back to fervency in life and its original strength and the bride is coming back with the word but still there's no conception amen they wake up they're young is that right they wake up they've been turned young under the revelation of the six seal and all that they're turned back at the same time and when they're turned back young they go back to their original condition back to what they were when they were first married amen when abraham was first given a bride fresh virgin bride and christ was given at pentecost a fresh virgin bride but she fell away by deception but god is going to restore to him a fresh virgin bride and brought them back to the original condition but now they go to gerrard and there's no conception yet that's right amen because when sarah was young and fresh and healthy and strong she still didn't conceive and when the pentecostal church was fresh and young and virgin she didn't come to the marriage either just going back to the original condition wasn't enough they needed something more oh stay with me friends don't think i'm saying something wrong it's right here in the bible amen they went back to young when they were young something happened at pentecost and before he could get to her she was already a fallen woman abraham sarah go back to young but they were young once before and didn't conceive but there was going to have to bring something to bring a greater faith amen that was going to hold her in that condition and give her faith and through faith she was going to get strength to conceive not just strength to go back young again but go back young and now conceived because that's what was missed back there and never came to the marriage supper it never came to the union but it's going to be different this time amen the spoken word is the original seed prophet said then from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ a beloved bride a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man made creeds with dogmas the word of promise in himself like it was in mary god himself made manifest he will act himself by his own word of promise he will act himself by his own word of promise sarah tried to act and it was wrong eve tried to act and it was wrong the first church tried to act and it was wrong but he's going to do it himself amen and she'll just hold still and trust him and have faith and believe him his faith in her will bring the promise upon her and he will do the work through her they just couldn't stay in the word long enough because couldn't trust him long enough probably god says by his he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the virgin womb a type of the spirit womb now so will the virgin now accept his word be it unto me as thou has said though it was said by an angel while it was yet the written word isaiah 9 6. now he's referring to mary amen the the eve had this promise she wasn't eve yet i don't i don't even like to call her eve we can look back and say that that was eve but at that time her name was adam she was one with her husband he said that he made them two male and female and called their name adam [Music] eve was the name she got because of her adultery she became the mother of all living both false and true vine but the woman she was in this place and she was that she was given the word they were given the word to keep but it's her own reasoning mixed in and mixed with the word and hybrid designed it and brought death sarah was given a word but her own reasoning slipped in and she hybridized it by offering hagar and it brought death the first church was given the word to keep amen but before he could come to that he could come to her amen to perform the word she hybridized it with man's reasoning and man's thinking and man's interpretation of the word and it brought death and god come to mary mary was a chosen elected seed so was the woman in genesis so was sarah she was predestinated chosen and elected there was a word that went forth but in order for god to fulfill his word he needed a woman in order for god to fulfill his word he needed a woman and so he come to this little virgin in nazareth and when he comes to this little virgin the angel appeared and said it's now time for the promise why do you think that angel showed up to her and an angel began to speak to her because the visitation of the angel was going to give her strength was going to give her faith to believe the word of god so god sent an angel at the time it was going to require this woman to have faith god sent the angel to her and says it's time to confirm the promise and she slips into that reasoning mode how can these things be knowing that seeing that i know no man i have never had relations with a man how am i going to conceive she asked a very natural question in fact the humanly speaking is a very reasonable question and the angel gave her a very unscientific unreasonable answer he said the holy spirit shall overshadow thee she asked a very biological question that actually had to do with cells and and cell fusion and cell multiplication she was a scientist and she said all my science books they tell me this is not possible so i'm looking for a scientific answer on how this is going to work and so the angel came and gave her what she needed she didn't need a scientific answer she needed to know that this was going to be the power of god amen as the holy ghost the spirit of god himself he's going to perform his own word in you and that was enough for this little chosen seed she didn't need any better understanding she didn't need a better explanation the explanation she got did not answer her question the explanation she got showed the true power of god to keep and perform his own word [Applause] and she said be it unto me according to your word she had nothing she could do to produce this word she could have read isaiah 9 6 all day long she could have read all the prophecies of a promisee she could have read genesis 3. amen but she had no power within herself to produce the word although she was the chosen elected one god needed a woman she was that woman but she had no power no matter how much she read it no matter how much she believed it she didn't have the power to perform herself when time is right an angel would come to give her faith that she's the one and this is the time what was the angel telling her you're the one and this is the time there's a group of people on the earth that's had a visitation from an angel and that angel has come to us through a prophetic ministry and that angel has come to us to say you're the one and this is the time and that built such a faith in those elect people that they could say be it unto me according to your word i can't do it but you can do it it's not my power but by your spirit i'm just yielding myself to you and you can do it there's nothing that the church can do to produce the word except believe him and yield to his word surrender in the message proving his word the prophet says now we say he's raised from the dead i didn't say it the word here said it they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in this last day the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts in sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not yet been born but it was a human it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty showing and jesus said as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in the day the son of man will be revealed what's the revealing of the son of man doing calling the bride calling her back to her original marriage condition back to her virginity when she was offered fresh from the hand of god same thing that the visitation and memory was doing to sarah amen see no more as a church see the bride is called in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what i mean it's a son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage so see fill your flesh you're starting to quote the scripture for yourself of all the flesh of mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man listen i want you to catch this amen that son of man that manifestation was to bring her back and unite the two together like they were supposed to be at pentecost but before he could come to her to bring forth the promised word she was already a fallen woman but there's going to be a restoration back so in the restoration back he's got to bring her back to the condition she was at pentecost and then he's going to unite the two together to bring the headship to the body to bring the marriage the union the uniting the invisible union of the bride in christ and what's it to do to manifest the son of man again what's it to do to reproduce himself the manifest it manifests the son of man again not church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing the spoken word is the original seed he says o people god bless you hear me i can't believe nothing but god's word i want it to be my life everything that i am i want you to do the same let your walks your talks your moves everything you do be in the word of god let the mind of christ come into you and that'll pregnant you with the word if you don't if you let the mind of the denomination come in you'll be a denominational impregnated if you do you hear what he said if you let the mind of the denomination doesn't even mean entering into a denomination or joining the nomination but you let the mind of the denomination command you'll be the nomination impregnated some people believe that i can only become denominational impregnated if i'm in a denominational church that's not [Music] true if you let the mind of christ come into you he can't deny his own word because he's god you be pregnated with the word and believe it i don't care if they put you out kick you out run you out and every door is closed you'll go just the same amen i got he says i got to hurry now christ is now taking himself a bride to be pregnant with his own seed word in her womb spirit womb in her mind and won't mix with any denominational trash with it she is a virgin to him that's why we had this mighty visitation that's why and when the seals were open that's why her heart was turned back to the the heart of the fathers the pentecostal fathers she was brought back to original virgin condition where the prophet of god would say those that are standing with the word and standing on this word every jot and every title you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ what's he doing he's bringing you back to your wedding condition so that he could unite the two together the the apostle paul he said i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy because i have espoused you to one husband but i fear for you lest you be beguiled as eve was begotten in your mind be deceived in your mind amen paul wanted to present a virgin to christ i've espoused you but i'm worried that you're going to fall out of this virgin condition by being deceived in your mind and that is exactly what happened to the first church so god had to restore he had to bring back the restoration of the bride true had to bring a bride back for christ [Music] and through this ministry he has brought a bride back to christ amen and she's not polluted in her mind but she's been washed by the water of the word that washed all the prostitute spirits away from her from the great and all her prostitute daughters so she could come back to a virgin condition by the grace of god and be united with christ let's take a look at genesis 21. god had showed up and talked to abraham so many times he told abraham to come out of his land he told abraham he was going to have seed he told abraham eliezer wasn't going to be a seed he told him sarah was going to be the one who produces the seed he had come on the plains of mamrie to show the sign of the messiah amen to bring the revelation of the word to bring them back to their original marriage condition and he was going to show they were turned back young by letting them go down to gerar king was going to desire her and god was going to rescue and preserve that vergency look at how the devil when when she's turned back to virgin again and she comes back to her youthfulness and then she goes back to her original marriage condition look how quickly the devil tries to enter in and disrupt the plan of god by them like taking her and corrupting her womb [Music] but although abraham now failed abraham was chosen amen sarah was chosen these two were one god through a ministry of elohim and flesh with the sign of the messiah and the revelation of his mind had taken them back to a youthful condition and now this whole deal with abimelech looks to threaten that so what does god do god comes on the scene and rescues him now because it's not going to happen this time it's happened time after time after time but god comes down on the scene this time and said it's not going to happen this time and this bride has been turned back to original condition at pentecost and been united with christ amen and don't think there's not a beamelec moves out there trying to move but god is watching this bride god's going to make sure no matter what decisions are made no matter what happens he is not going to let a beamelec move move on this bride and ruin the vergency of that bride he has restored her this is the time for the promise to be fulfilled and god himself is interjecting himself in a supernatural way to make sure that this time it doesn't fail then after all that he comes to chapter 21. amen and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken and sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him amen this time it's to sarah amen every other time to abraham to abraham to abram even on the plains of memory he came to abraham but then he included sarah but this time he comes directly to sarah this is a visitation of the lord and the lord visits sarah because this time it's not a public show this is the third pool this is the inner chamber this is the private union this is the confirmation this is the conception of the sea this is going to bring forth the promised side this is what it's all been about amen this is what the whole bible has been about because the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing and he gave christ a bride to reproduce himself but it got disrupted just like in the garden amen but god this time has come down in flesh to make sure that he would do something that would give them faith to go back to their original condition [Music] but after they went back to the original condition he still has another work to do and that work is not going to involve a tabernacle of flesh that work is not going to involve a public show that work is not going to involve a public discernment because this is the breaking of the seventh seal individually personally to the individual sarah it is not going to be a platform demonstration it's not going to be a manifestation that all can look at it's not going to be for everybody but it's for one person and one person only and it's the lord visiting himself to sarah and he confirms the promise to sarah and sarah conceives [Music] she didn't conceive until this visitation not memory that brought her back that brought her back to her youthful condition that brought her back to her emergency union to her mate but that didn't bring conception this private visitation with no details what happened what did he look like how did it come what was her sensation did she speak with tongues did she dance on the floor did she what did she do tell us more this is the confirmation of the promise this is the climax this is the greatest part of the story what happened she went into the little room [Applause] inside the tent she went to this little room where the pillar of fire was and she came on the other end changed something changed something was different she was now impregnated by the word of god the promise and her were now one what god had promised and her had now become one because the promised seed was now in her they were persons together as one you gotta say what happened i don't know [Music] what happened in there i don't know i can't explain it but i'm changed everything about me is different she had passed through the private meeting of the visitation of the lord to her personally and there she conceived on the promise and now she became the carrier of the promised word for that day now the very promise of jehovah now the very word was her she was manifesting the word the word was in her flowing through her and now she was going to bring forth the promised land because the whole thing was hinged on sarah praise god praise the lord i don't know about you but this makes me want to fly i am flying i'm in heavenly places i'm so far above laodicea right now it can't touch me so far above denominations they don't mean anything to me the criticisms of man and the light of this truth mean nothing amen the eagles are flying amen they're above the storm they're above the denomination they're above the criticism they're above it all because this revelation has resurrected us and lifted us into heavenly places and now the promise is in her her and the promise are the same thing because it's in her tabernacle of flesh now she's bearing the promise now she's bringing forth the promise praise be to god this is heavenly places and if this doesn't excite you friend might as well go to a ball game because this is the this is it amen this is the climax this is the time that god has built his whole word to to this time now and he has brought amen the sign of the messiah he has brought himself in a body of flesh to show us the son of man ministry to bring us back to what they were in pentecost back to the faith of the fathers and then when it was time he came to us individually because hebrews 11 hebrews 11. let's turn it let's just turn let's just read it we got time hebrews 11. hebrews 11 verse 11 11 11. i didn't even realize this is part 11. through faith through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive not strength to be turned back young strength to be turned back young came to the manifestation through the second full manifestation and the restoration of the word is that true the planes of mammary after that incident she was turned back young but it says here through faith also sarah herself herself herself one individual one person this revelation is to one person and one person only through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive when did she receive strength to conceive rev genesis chapter 21 when the lord of the lord came and visited sarah herself it's the private union between you and him it's the private meeting of almighty god in you it's the private thing that takes place in the little room when you enter into that little room in the tabernacle and you can't explain what happened but when you come out you know you've met the pillar of fire you know everything's been changed that god has revealed to you that you're the one down carrying the seed what was it it was the private meeting when the lord came to her and the lord and when the lord came to her [Music] then it produced in her of faith her she was given by through faith she was given strength it's going to take a supernatural strength to conceive on the sea but this strength is going to come when he comes to you when he comes to you through faith he's going to give you strength to conceive so many people have saw planes of mammary so many people can know that the seals are open amen but it's when he comes to you that he'll give you strength to conceive to do what to produce the son of man again amen god did not turn sarah young so she could go back to what she was at pentecost just to fall again by receiving denominational ideas he didn't bring her back to where she was at the beginning to not conceive to repeat the process over again but he brought her back through the visitation on the planes of memory he brought her back so that he could restore to her conception so that she could bring forth the promised word and in this hour we can shout we can dance we can be happy that there was a elohim and flesh that could turn us back to the crowd and discern thoughts that gave us strength to go back to be a pentecostal church to the original faith of the fathers that's wonderful but we can dance dance and shout now and i'm sure abraham was excited and sarah was excited but it didn't yet bring a conception and the purpose was the conception the purpose was that sarah was going to bring forth the promised son and i'm sure they got up that morning and they were dancing and i'm sure that they were excited and i'm sure that there was a jubilee in the camp but god wasn't finished yet [Music] that wasn't the end of the story yet because he did all that for a purpose to bring the promised son through sarah and until that purpose was finished god wasn't done working amen so in verse 21 he would allow him to go in garage so you and i would know that they've already been turned young so we wouldn't be confused about this process then after that he comes to her privately and doesn't tell us anything else the greatest part of the story the most thrilling part the most exciting part the one that changes every the one that makes this story worth retelling the climax is so anti-climatic brother comes preaching the seven seals amen and he's preaching the first the second and the third and they're thrilling amen you're getting excited amen the church has turned back to the original doctrine of the fathers amen everything's so exciting then he comes to the seventh seal and this is it this is the crowning this is the whole thing this is the whole bible this is the whole purpose of everything god's written and god's done seventh seal [Music] and it's so anticlimactic now we've come to the point of the whole week of services now we've come to the point of brother branham's entire ministry that's his ministry he's the messenger of the seventh seal that's what he said he's the messenger of the seventh seal his whole ministry comes down to this one message and he spends most of the message preaching the sixth seal and when he's done preaching the sixth seal he says i just feel a stop right there because when he had the vision of the third pool back in 1956 when he first tells it in 1956 he was trying to catch the rainbow trout the covenant fish the children of god and in the first pool that was going to be the sign in the hand and the healing and he pulled the lure amen and that attracted all the little fish so it would get the attention of the big fish and they all gathered around the lure then he says you've got to jerk it a second time and in the second pool which is discernment he pulls it clear out of the water tangles his line he's got a little bitty fish just like skin over the lure and he failed and he's talking about his failure and the angel said i told you not to do that then he gives him a baby shoe and he's trying to take this big cord and he's trying to shove it through this baby shoe and the angel tells him i told you you cannot teach spiritual things to to babes to pentecostal babes because brother bran was trying to bring them up higher in the word and he was trying to bring them to spiritual realities but they were pentecostal babes and they were not able to grow because you have to take the meat to grow and they wanted the milk so they refused to grow so they couldn't get this cord through the little eyelets then he lifted him up and he showed him a tabernacle a huge tabernacle and a crowd they were calling a prayer line crowd going out of the building and in the in the tabernacle was a little wooden room and in the little room he's still showing him three pools and in the little room you don't see brother branham on the platform you can't see anything a line of people this way and people coming out one by one this way and if you try to figure out that third pull all you're going to find out when you ask the people who were going through the little room is that they have no idea what happened but they changed and god told him he says this will be your third pool and it won't be a public show that's why when brother branham gets into the seventh seal he's breaking down the seventh seal and then he says i feel to stop before he gets into it he's reviewing he gets into the seventh seal he says i feel to stop then he starts going into parables and trying to remind you remember the baby shoe remember the tent remember the sword remember that and he goes to the sword and sabino came in when god put the sword in his hand at sabino canyon before in the tent he said this will be your third pool but when he gets the sword dropped in his hand he says this is your third tool and what was the third pool to do to catch the rainbow trout the covenant fish to bring them into the kingdom of god and so when he gets to the seventh seal he says i feel to stop why it matches the vision perfectly he had back at the end of 1955. it's come now a full seven year cycle to completion and at the end of seven years now we're standing here in the completion and when he's completing it he's just demonstrated the seventh seal because the lamb is the only one that can take the book and open the seals he's been demonstrating all a week that the seventh seal is here it's a person and he gets down and he doesn't explain it because he failed by explaining the first two and he's told this won't be a public show and then brother bam says now now it won't be broke to the public until that hour amen he didn't say it wouldn't be broke he said it wouldn't be broke to the public amen this seventh seal came to sarah and it wasn't a public show in revelation 21 or in genesis 21 he came to sarah and it wasn't a public show and it wasn't broke to the public until that time amen but there come a time she can only carry it so long amen and then and then it broke forth amen and the promised son came forth from her and there was no hiding anymore and now was broke forth [Music] praise be to god through faith sarah receives strength what is this third pull to do to bring you the faith to conceive to bring you back to what you were but if you go back to what the church was at pentecost that church fell so to go back to the church you were at pentecost amen in order not to fall you need something more to happen because that condition wasn't enough it was going to take the presence of god himself amen and not just coming down in somebody else but coming down to you personally and injecting his life inside of you amen until now you were the carrier of this promised son to seal the bride so that nothing else can get to her pentecost fell by taking another seat brother man said this bride won't fall she's predestinating that he's coming himself through faith sarah through faith sarah receives strength what does this personal revelation of christ reveal personally to you to do to give you strength without this revelation you don't have the strength to conceive all of it come down to give you personally as an individual a revelation then god himself will come to you to give you a revelation to conceive on this seed and then now you and the promise are one amen for the promise is alive in you amen that's the secret that's right brother brahm says now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what he had been revealed to him as though it was not so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body and the message choosing of a bride he says we find today that the modern church a modern world church the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnanted to give birth to sons one of them a denominational birth is going to give one day to these days a a world council of churches which will produce the world which will produce to the world the antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth i may not live to see it but i believe i will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she comes forth the world council churches and she'll give birth to her son the antichrist the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride what is she bringing forth the bride what is that that's the manifestation of this hour that is the word promised for this hour the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and his woman is one christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife were one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word amen that's all she needs now how many remember my title i said we're going to go around the couch yeah we're around and it's sarah's last declaration let's go back to genesis 21. genesis 21 we read in verse one where said and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah she had spoken for sarah conceived in barry abram's son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bared him isaac and abraham circumcised his son isaac being the eight days old as god had commanded him and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear me will laugh with me she said who would have said that abraham unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned i want you to pay attention here this word that's now coming from sarah is coming into maturity and as this word that's coming through sarah is coming into maturity it's going to come into conflict again and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking they're mocking friends the mocking is going on rest assured ishmael is mocking the sons of the bondwoman are mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac listen this is the final declaration of sarah what is it she says she says unto abram cast out this bondwoman cast out this denominational system cast out this false birth cast out all this wrong cast it out for this will not be heir with what's come from me this will not be aired with what's been produced by that private meeting with god himself when he came to me and i conceived and brought forth the word this has no part with that that has no part with this it's time for a separation sarah had got to the place when the word was coming to maturity she saw the mocking and said it's no more this is not going to happen anymore fault was it there was an ishmael sarah's fault whose fault was it there was an ishmael it was sarah's fault it was sarah's reasoning it was sarah's program it was sarah's handmade and sarah presented the handmaid but after she kept walking with god all of a sudden god began to reveal himself and reveal himself and reveal himself and he come on the plains of memory and show the sign of messiah he brought her back to the original doctrine and now he come himself to her [Music] and now she becomes so one with the word that the word is she's impregnated with the very promised word and that promised word becomes it comes forth from her and comes into maturity and now it's time that sarah says no more of this denominational garbage i did it it's me it's my fault i caused it can you say that my wrongs my wrong thinking my doubts about the scripture is all because of me it's my fault but i've come to a place now because i've been born again by the spirit of god and god has visited me amen in a third pool with the opening of a seventh seal to me and now i know everything i thought before was wrong everything i tried to do to serve god was wrong it was all wrong cast it out god cast it away from me lord cast out this bondwoman cast out her son it won't be air with this promised word this word that you've impregnated me with this word that you're bringing forth from me it won't mix i thought it could mix i thought i could do it but i'm standing here today realizing i couldn't do it all i did was make a mess and all of my efforts to serve god and all of my trying to figure out all i've ever done is make a mess but we're standing here today saying cast it out cast out the denominational thing cast out the efforts of man cast out the hybridization cast it out because this word that has come through a private impregnation it's everything this is it this is the promise this is the seed this is the whole goal and nothing else will mix with it [Applause] it is time for the bride to say separate cast out amen cast out hagar cast out the bondwoman cast out the denominations amen no more god no more our own thinking no more our own efforts no more our own plans no more on raising no more this thing you've given to us is the most precious thing to us it is everything that i now realize what i didn't realize then i now see what i couldn't see then i now see how perfect your word is how perfect your plan is how absolutely sure it is and now you've brought me this far i can say of my own lips cast out the bondwoman cast it out cast out the false cast out the hybrid amen it was her fault sure whose fault is it the churches but who's he going to use to bring for the son his bride [Music] we may have failed a dozen times but it doesn't change who you are may have had wrong ideas and wrong efforts and trials and failures and all kinds of attempts that fall into ruin but it doesn't change you're part of abraham you're part of christ this promise has to come through the predestinated chosen one no matter what sarah has done she was the predestinated chosen one she's the one that had to come through that's why god came down was to discern her [Music] so when the discernment happened to her she would say that's god it's got to be true god has come down and discerned you and discerned i with this word so you would know it's not a man it's gone that wasn't brother brenham that was god he was discerning everything that was in my heart bring me back lord to that useful position back to the church of pentecost don't let me stay there but bring to me strength for conception how will that strength come by a private visitation from god when he's revealed personally to you when he reveals personally nobody else may know about it nobody else experienced what you experienced no nobody else was there nobody else saw nobody else could prove it how could sarah prove it it was going to take a few months but what had happened to her changed her life and it became more evident as time came what went on that something happened to her there as the word began to grow inside of her i want to keep looking at this scripture just for another minute she said unto abram cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was grievous unto abraham's sight because of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bondwoman and all that sarah hath said and all that sarah hath said he's saying sarah is giving you the word and all that sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice now the voice is in sarah now sarah has the word now sarah has the voice even abraham's it's grievous i don't know but god is saying you listen to sarah and you hearken unto her voice for the things she says is right why because when you come into that personal meeting in the in the little room under the third pole the opening of the seventh seal to you personally he comes and injects another life in there gives you strength to conceive on this promised word and it begins to change the way you think it begins to change the way you talk amen it changed everything about sarah until now after this time now the voice is in sarah amen amen amen amen amen hearken unto her voice for an isaac shall thy seed be called turn with me to galatians chapter 4. galatians chapter 4. let's turn to verse 30. nevertheless what saith the say with me scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman should not be heir with the son of who said this scripture who gave the word of god that would be called the scripture it came from the voice of a woman it came from sarah the voice was in sarah amen and it became the word of god it was the scripture [Music] oh praise be to god now what did she have she had the word she knew the word she knew the right word she knew the right thing to say amen because she had come through this journey and now she says cast out the bondwoman and her son for he shall not be heir with my son and god said listen to her but paul picks it up and says what saith the scriptures he didn't say what saith sarah because what sarah said was the word of god [Music] amen praise god revelations 22 17. and the spirit and the bride say come now the bride has a voice brother bam said that god has a mouthpiece in this day it's not the churches but it's the bride and what she's saying will have been said before in the word she cannot add to it she cannot take from it she can't come up with anything new she can't just say words but she's been given the word by a prophet now the word has been burst inside of her now she's bringing forth the promised word for this day and now she's become under her messenger the final voice to the final age and what is she saying come that's it prophet got to the laodicean church age and he said in church book he says what they have been what they will say will have already been said in the bible and that is come out from among her my people and be ye separate what is she saying cast out the bondwoman that's what she's saying that's the voice that she has in this end time she's saying come come out from her come away come out from the the the and the harlots come out from the systems of man come out from all the hybridization come out cast out the bondwoman and her seed that's the final call that's going on the earth today his voice will be in his bride what they will be saying will have already been said in the word and that is come out from among her my people and be separate now she's saying come and the spirit and the bride says come amen separate leave hagar let hagar go come it's time for the bride to say god cast out this bond woman cast out the bondwoman thinking in my mind whatever caused me to think that was a good idea cast it out the thing that it's produced cast it out whatever caused me to think that this is the right way to serve you cast it out cast it away because now i've got something that's real i've got the genuine i don't need that hybrid i don't need that partial anymore it's time to say cast it out cast it away from me god cast it out of my mind cast it out of my life cast it all away from me lord all of my plans and all of my ideas and everything i thought i was serving you i thought it was right cast it out for now under the seventh seal i know what you've been trying to get me to believe all along i know what you've been trying to get me to do and trying to get me to say all along and i've come to that and now that's maturing and cast it all out because it only mocked the true word your hybrid spirit will only mock the true word your thinking will only mock the true word i say cast it out let the mind of christ be in us cast it all out and then say to everybody else come in the beginning the devil had to get a tool to work through so the devil got the tool that god was going to use and that was the woman in the garden of eden god he wanted to produce amen his seed his predestination seed upon the earth he wanted he saw that he foresaw and he wanted it so god had made a tool and that tool was the woman and the devil got in and used that same tool and corrupted the tool and used it for his purposes god had a tool to bring forth the promise to abraham and that tool was sarah and the devil got in and used sarah as a tool to bring a hybrid product but we saw god himself come down to bring it back in the beginning of the church age before the church they just started in pentecost at the feast of pentecost when the church was birthed it was birthed to be a bride it was birthed to be a tool that god would use to reproduce christ upon the earth and the devil got in and started to use that tool but we saw that god come down himself god come down himself amen to break all of the efforts of the devil away break the deception away to bring her back to what she was intended to be amen then he so wanted his plan to be fulfilled that he made a way where he would come his very self privately to you [Music] in producing you his own life and bringing you the prophesied word for this day he himself even when amen even when we were brought back amen through this ministry of malachi 4 brought back amen and all the abimelech tried to do their little things god come down himself and stopped it because he had a purpose and he had a tool and he wanted to use that tool to finish his purpose and the devil kept grabbing hold of that tool and grabbing a hold of a tool and grabbing a hold of that tool but in the end time he come down and he put the tool back in his own hand amen now he's going to finish his work that he didn't finish all in the days of jesus christ he left some now to do in and through the bride and now that tool's come back into his hand by her own free choice by her surrender to his will and casting down of everything that's contrary to it and that tool what the devil used to pervert and corrupt god is now going to take that same tool to woman and he's going to bring a restoration and a redemption what the devil used the woman to bring death god is now going to use the restored woman to bring back life and restore back all that's been lost and god wants to do it through you but i can't do it sarah couldn't do it first church couldn't do it and we can't do it what could mary do nothing what ability does she have none but when the angel came to her and began to explain her mysterious and misunderstood life her place in the scriptures and what she was called for she tried to reason but he overrode her reasoning with the word and when she overrode her reasoning with the word something inside of her connected with that word and she just simply said be it unto me god is restoring that tool back into his hand the one the devil used for perversion the one the devil used for corruption the one the devil used to bring death god is restoring that word to bring back the true word amen to bring back the real life amen and to bring back the life and all he's asking us to do is say be it unto me according to your word it's a word that he confirms and he produces himself abraham couldn't do anything what could abraham do to bring the promise nothing every effort fell in ruin what could sarah do nothing they couldn't do anything all they could do was believe in their belief in god the word he gave him for that day was accounted them for righteousness and when it came time god himself would come down and do the work well i'm telling you it's come time god himself has come down to do the work he has come down to confirm the promise he has come down to give the sign of the messiah he has come down to meet with sarah individually so she can conceive on this word and now it's time for sarah to say separate and cast out the bomb i don't know about you but i'm feeling it stronger than i've ever felt in my life saying god cast out this bond woman god cast out this wrong thing cast it away from me god it can't be air with what's inside of me this thinking can't be air with what's inside of me these feelings can't be heir with what's inside of me cast it out oh god let this word have preeminence let this word take position let this word be the only air let everything else be cast to the side that's the hour we live in friends that's the cry of sarah that's our cry and we invite anyone else to come leave the bondwoman system leave all the denominations and ideas of man perversion and corruption and adaptation to the lord bring it all back to the original there's a fountain here flowing with clean pure water come and drink abraham was a prophet so what would sarah be she's whatever he is so when sarah spoke sarah said a lot of things that weren't called scripture but when sarah said that thing was right god said you listened to her there's a lot of things we said that's not right but god is still going to use this bride to speak the true word that's been given through a prophet she's going to take what's been given and she's going to continue to give it out and god is going to back up what she says because what she say will have been said in the word before come out come out separate be joined to this promised word let's all stand musicians if you'd please come oh i love you all so much so thankful to god for this word friends this is more than a natural life this is eternal life oh god if my life it never goes on another day from now it's fine with me because i got a life amen that started before this and we'll go beyond that it's an eternal life the things of the world are fading quickly away there's not anything in there we want anymore amen we want it all cast away oh come from perversion it's been corrupted amen it's got to be purified i'm not holding on to the corrupted anymore i'm reaching now forth to the purify we've come so far down the journey like enoch walked with god so long until he got so far down the road he just didn't want to go back anymore i said god get us further down the road amen do we get to the place where we just don't want to go back anymore i want to get more on this side amen more of me lifted off the earth more of me flying in heavenly wraps so much of me up there so i just don't want to go back anymore are you feeling it is he drawing you higher yeah yeah say lord cast out the bondwoman amen and her seed it's time friends let's just pray lord jesus we thank you god you have done what we could not do ourselves any more than barry could have conceived on our own any more than sarah and abraham and their condition could have brought forth the promised son there was nothing they could do there was nothing that mary could do and there's nothing that we in ourselves can do but god at the right time when it was time you sent an angel to mary and when it was time you sent an angel messenger to us to declare to us that it was time and that we were the one oh god give us the faith that mary had to throw everything else away all her plans her fears the consequences lord in a moment she cast it all to the side and she took what you offered to her her position in the word and she said be it unto me according to your word god we want to say the same thing lord let me not reason or think god let me not scheme or plan but let me throw it all away and just simply say i believe it lord i receive your plan for me be it unto me according to your word change me god bring the password only you can bring to pass bring life in my womb lord i can't do it only you can do it but oh god i believe lord by faith in the word you've brought us back to a virgin womb so that you can bring forth your seed god let us stay under the washing of the water the word that cleanses and purifies lord if there's any who've not gone into the little room not met you personally not been quickened to life by your very presence i pray you'd let it take place now lord that there'd be no more reasonings no more schemings no more plans no more trying to bring the word to pass but may they now just under the manifestation of this word that's being preached in this hour may they just yield themselves to you and say god take me come in to me lord and bring me the conception i desire i tried and i can't do it but all i'm doing is saying here i am lord here i am bring that word here lord i seen you on the plains of memory i saw you turn your back to the crowd it gave me strength lord to go back to the faith of the fathers god bring a personal a personal meeting that you would come yourself to each individual life you would give strength to conceive on the seed and that it might bring forth a changed life that it might be now the promised word and the individual or persons together united as one and that this word now can be birthed through the church through the bride let it be unto us lord let us surrender like we've never surrendered before and believe lord with strength to conceive we love your god we ask that you would touch each heart in each life may your holy ghost lord go and interrupt the lives and the thoughts of each individual's seed may you go to them lord you interrupted mary's plans she was fine with that you interrupted that day when abraham was on memory whatever he had planned that day you interrupted his plans by a meeting he was fine with that you come to sarah privately in genesis 21 and whatever she was doing you interrupted it with your presence you came to her and she was fine with that lord i believe this morning you're coming to individuals by the preaching of the word lord which is your method for saving souls i pray lord that that word would come down now and find a resting place in the womb of your seed may you interrupt our plans lord and may we be so satisfied with that interruption that we can say be it unto me according to this word let me bring forth the son of man let me be part of this ministry lord let me bring forth the word

me [Music] according to your promises the truth that sets me free [Music] amen god bless you saints i think i've said before you can't do this is that true in your own flesh and your own human ability you can't do it but without you it's not getting done because there's one predestinated woman there's one predestinated seed there's one people on the earth that's going to fulfill the promise and you can't do it on your own but yet it's not happening without you so the only solution is to say yes to the word and surrender to it there's no other choice there's no other option you can't manufacture you can't produce it that's what's produced every messy situation all around us in our lives and and all around what's called the message well every mess that we've seen is because we tried to get to it ourselves we can't do it the love mess we have in our lives is we tried to produce our we can't do it there's only one thing we can do is say god [Music] i'm here whatever was preached today is me there's a witness in me said that's me that's me mama that mirror i looked in today at church it was reflecting i am that one not because i deserve it not because i've earned it not because i feel value but because i can't help it i believe it lord [Music] then just lay your life down to the world whatever else we're holding on to whatever else is distracting and complicating let's just throw
