so as God is is bringing back the word he's getting it more and more and more lined up to the original right and so that tone that came from Luther would attract a certain seed the Lutheran seed the tone as God would move down through time and the tone would come through Wesley it was there to there was a certain seed for that age to respond to that tone but if we still tried to play the piece reading from Wesley Sheep music nothing nothing nothing this here is waiting for something it's waiting to be moved it's waiting to be put into action it's got It's it's got a natural frequency that's laying here undiscovered and unrealized but yet it's there it's inherent to the object it's part of it it's built into it it's there already amen we don't have to put it in there it's already there so all we have to do is find the word for the age so that the seed and the word match together cuz brother B said in God's only provided place of worship he said if I taught you Methodist message it would take no effect on [Music] you it would have no effect on you uh this is bride time yes if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus T moses' message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are lay are are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows in so this thing is sitting here waiting One Church another church another church but one day that's it that's what I've been waiting didn't know it amen listen th this if this has never been struck before if it's never been plucked before this object doesn't even know how it resonates it's never been put in action it's never been struck it's never it's never been played I mean it's been cast it's been sent to the Earth but nothing's happened yet Amen to cause a sound to come out of it it doesn't know if it's an a it doesn't know if it's a b it doesn't know if it's a c doesn't know if it's a d it doesn't know if it's a g it doesn't know what it is and it's sitting here and it comes in contact with all these other things nothing moves but but one day it comes in contact with an eagle scream and then all of a sudden he says I'm an a I'm an a I know what I am I thought I was a Methodist I thought I was a Baptist I thought I was a Pentecostal I thought I was a Catholic but I realized I'm bride amen I'm part of the Bride because there was something that could awaken what I was inherent already built into me I had to come in contact with something that was the same as me so that I could resonate back what I heard and what I heard was matched to what I am and what I resonate back was a match to what I heard
