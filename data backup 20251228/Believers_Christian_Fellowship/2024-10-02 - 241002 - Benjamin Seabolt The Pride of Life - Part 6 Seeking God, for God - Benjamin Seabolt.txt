we just want to thank you for this opportunity that you've given us once again Lord that we can come into your house we can sing your Praises Lord for surely Thou Art Worthy of our Praises Lord and we have an opportunity as a select group of people predestinated before the foundation of the world to come and to look into your word this evening and to change our lives by the power of your spirit and by the power of your word to reflect the very image of the Living God on this Earth Lord may we not take that position lightly may we not take it flippant may we grasp what you have delivered into our hands and the opportunity that you've delivered into our hands and may we take full advantage of that Lord we would just ask as we would come to this part of the service as we so often do Lord father you know we're just Fallen Humanity Lord and it's one thing for fallen Humanity to sit and listen to the words of God that's no doubt our appropriate place but for a mortal to try to find the mind of God and speak the word of God to a people Lord we recognize that we have no ability to do that but Lord this is your way this is what you have ordained and that's why we stand here father and nothing else because if you said this is your way and this is what you want done then who are we to think that we have a better idea Lord so we would just commit ourselves to you both speaker and hearer and we would pray that that you would come and that you would supernaturally do this evening what you've ordained the purpose for this service to be we commit ourselves into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you I'll invite you right into the scriptures we're going to go to Psalm 105 take a portion of scripture there just greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ any visitors that we may have here this evening we certainly want to greet you bring you greetings from our pastor he's on his way back home right now he got me a little excited when he text me a couple hours ago he said that he was praying for me for the service and I appreciated that and then he said he was going to be in the air during the service I thought well wow he don't even know what I'm preaching yet and he's going to be in the air so I was pretty motivated until I realized that he was just going to be in the air traveling so hopefully I don't ground him but we'll be glad when they're back home Psalm 105 beginning in verse one says all give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him hymns I'm sorry sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous Works Glory ye also in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his face ever more God bless you as you would have your seats this evening that verse four is where I would really like to key in on this evening and it says seek the Lord and his strength seek his face ever more so we immediately realize there's a differentiation here of seeking the Lord and for the sake of a title this evening that's what I would like to maybe title this is seeking God for God because we understand that we can seek God for many reasons as brother random said you let somebody claim to be an atheist and let them really get in a pinch one time and get hurt and the first thing they want to do is cry oh God oh God oh God so we recognize that that's not the appropriate seeking of God that we want to do although we as Believers no doubt we get hurt we certainly want to do that I would never tell somebody not to do that I intend to do that myself uh given the opportunity which I hope never comes my way so that's not what we don't want to say that that's wrong but we want to come to a proper understanding that we can seek God for ourselves instead of seeking God for God and this is what the scripture is uh petitioning us to do is to seek the Lord and seek his strength it's encouraging us to do that seek the Lord seek his strength but then it adds something to that seek his face ever more which means even while you're seeking the Lord for his strength you should be seeking him for his face and if you're not seeking him for his strength in a certain situation you should still be seeking his face so seek his face ever more means continually not ceasing not necessarily for a certain situation I want to go through a very very familiar portion of scripture here this evening I do not intend to be lengthy I do not intend to teach anything deep this evening I would uh very much encourage you to pull this evening because I feel just very much at Liberty to preach this evening um I've got some notes here but um if we get to them great if we don't that's fine I just want to extend this opportunity for the gift to work if you have a need this evening just pull if it's not in my notes that doesn't make any difference that's okay we'll get to the notes another time but you know I usually lean a lot more towards teaching but I just don't fail to do that this evening um that's just just the way that I feel so I to encourage you just a pull whatever specific need that you have in your life I feel that the Lord can answer that this evening but we're going to go to Exodus and I would say don't turn there just kind of follow along and listen because there's so many scriptures here if you're trying to turn and follow along um you're you're probably going to miss what's being said so I would encourage you just just to listen and you know you can go back and write the scriptures down and read them later in the full context if you would like but it this is a simple enough thought I think you can grasp it just by listening in Exodus 2:23 and it says this is Israel as they're in Egypt after Joseph has died and there's a new king that doesn't know Joseph and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sigh by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage if you could lower the lights just a little bit more I'd appreciate it so we hear we see here in the scripture that the children of Israel are sighing unto God and they're crying unto God which I would dares to say there's nobody going to raise their hand and say yeah they shouldn't have been oning that like that's a bad idea we don't have a problem with this but the problem is they're signed by reason of their bondage and their Cry came up to God by reason of the bondage so it tells us why they're sighing and why they're crying to God they're not sighing and crying to God that there's a portion of scripture here Lord that you haven't fulfilled in our lives and we're really seeking you to manifest that they're sighing and crying because they're uncomfortable in their flesh they are suffering and they are sighing and crying wanting God to move on the scene and again I don't want anybody to leave here this evening thinking that you should not do that or that's something that's wrong or evil that is not the case um I preached a message a while back of it's not wrong it's just not right and that's kind of a theme here this evening this is not wrong but this is not what should be the priority if they would be seeking God and sighing and crying to God to fulfill this portion of scripture that said after 400 years you would deliver us with a mighty hand and where is that at in our lives we want to see you fulfill your word in my life if they would have been focused on that instead of just simply reaching out to God because they're uncomfortable they may not have been uncomfortable they may have found themselves delivered of this situation earlier and we know this is factual um I don't remember the numbers right off but I'm wanting to say it was like 32 or 39 years after the 400 years that they finally went out of Egypt that wasn't God's will that was their will will because they weren't seeking his face they were seeking his hand and that's the principle that I want to relay this has been on my mind I think I've even shared it with a couple of you all before at for several months maybe a year the difference of seeking God's face and seeking God's hand there is a big difference verse 24 and God heard their groing so even though they weren't necessarily what we would say reaching out for the right reasons God heard and God will hear you that's why I want to emphasize there is never a situation that it's wrong for you to reach out to God like when things go sideways reach out to God cry out to God scream out to God but just understand we're called to a higher plane we're called brother Rand says it's a shame that man won't seek out after God until he gets into a position of desperation he says it ought not to be that way but it's not until we get crammed into a corner or until you know we get a bad doctor's report or until you know something and go sideways that we didn't expect that we seek out with desperation to God but that's okay he'll still hear us so do it but let's let's seek his face ever more not just his hand when we're in trouble and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob God heard their groaning and he felt sorry for them because they were uncomfortable is not what the scripture says the scripture says God heard their groaning and God remembered his Co his word god remembered his word with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob that said I'm going to do something with this people so yes they're sigh yes they're crying yes they're uncomfortable and yes I'm going to deal with that but I'm going to deal with it because I've already made a covenant I've already made a promise I've already made a word about these people that I'm going to do something I'm going to do something not just because they're uncomfortable we move into Exodus 3:16 and it says go and gather the Elders of of Israel this is God telling Moses go and gather the Elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt and I have said I will bring you up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey so God speaks to Moses says Go Tell them I've heard their cries I see the Affliction that you're in in Egypt and I'm going to deliver you and I'm going going to put you unto a land flowing with milk and honey so he says what he's going to do about the immediate situation but he also tells them what his purpose is for that what he really wants to do Exodus 4:29 and Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all of the Elders of the children of Israel and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their a Affliction then they bowed their heads and worshiped my question is why had they not bowed their head before and worshiped because they were human just like me and you and just like the prophet said it's a shame that we Fallen H humans won't do what we're supposed to do until we get into a situation of desperation then they bowed their heads and worshiped this is verse 31 in chapter 4 after they heard what God was going to do they bowed their heads and worship Exodus 5 verse 20 next chapter and they met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from F pharaoh this is immediately after Pharaoh said you'll have too much time on your hand I'm going to take your straw away and you still have to make the same amount of bricks they stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the Lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savior to be a hoard in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us and Moses returned unto the Lord and said Lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou Hast sent me for since I came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all so in the chapter right before this all the people rejoicing all the people believe Moses all the people believe God they have their circumstances uh the Affliction increased and now all of a sudden they forgot that the Lord had visited them they forgot they believed Moses they forgot that they believed God and now they're saying God judge you because since you've came on the scene it's got worse you know why is because they were seeking the hand of God and not the face of God I would encourage you not to leave this story thousands of years ago in one chapter they went from Believers to unbelievers over straw he took away their straw and they had to make bricks without the straw which was harder and now their testimony their confession their status as believers went down the draam I would venture to say they had an intellectual conception they did not have a real experience with God but they had grasped something intellectually this sounds like it can improve my situation I've seen a couple signs and a couple wonders I'm on board with this I believe in this this is going to work until the straw got taken away now they're not only Believers they're cursing the very instrument that God is going to use to bring them out of this situation the very vessel that God has sent to them Moses in this early part of his ministry isn't in much better condition because he returns to the Lord and says Lord wherefore hast thou so evily entreated this people why is it that thou Hast sent me questioning his commission for since I came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all just for those of you who don't think a minister can ever get down and that we always float around on the clouds let the people resist the word one time sometimes we Scurry back to God and be like uh you sure that's what I was supposed to say cuz didn't really go over too well in fact I don't think anybody likes me anymore chapter 6 verse 1 then the Lord said to Moses now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of this land and God spake unto Mo Moses and said unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham and Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them so the people get upset they holler at Moses Moses gets gets upset can't figure out his commission can't figure out what he's doing comes crying back to God God in response does not act like a human he acts like God God does not coddle him God does not say all I'm sorry maybe you should have said it a little bit nicer a little bit different God says you will see what I will do I will deliver them out of the hand of pharaoh and I am the Lord I appeared to your fathers as God Almighty but I am now going to appear and be known by you and this people as Jehovah nobody has known me in this capacity before and I will also establish my Covenant with them to give to the land of Canaan the ca the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers and I have also heard the groanings of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my Covenant wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgment and I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will bring you unto the land concerning that which I will swear that I did swear to give it to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give to you for a Heritage I am the Lord amen you can see a theme in God's response settle down I'm going to do what I said I'm going to do and I'm also going to reveal myself to you and this people like I've never revealed myself to a person before I'm going to reveal you reveal myself to you as the Lord I'm going to reveal myself to you as Jehovah and in case you didn't get it the first time I'm going to reveal myself as the Lord and in case you didn't get it the second time when you come into this land you're going to know that I am the Lord three or four times he mentions this In this passage and Moses spake unto the children of Israel but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage they make their case to Moses Moses makes his case to God God comes back and says I'm going to do what I said I'm going to do here is my Covenant here is what I'm going to do and it's my desire to reveal myself to you like I've never revealed myself to anybody and they said life to I had a bad day today was rough like I don't want to hear it anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage made them say I don't want God's provided way I don't want to hear about God's covenant I don't accept you as God's messenger I don't want to hear anything you've got to say I don't want to know the God as Jehovah I do not want to know God as my Lord thanks but it's been a bad day has anybody found thems in anguish of spirit lately cruel bondage the reason you're tore up in your spirit is because it's Satan trying to get you to make this confession it's been a bad day I I can't handle the listen to a tape right now I just need to go relax like I need to clear my mind I I don't want to know what you're trying to do in this difficult situation right now I don't want to know you in the way that you're trying to because this surely cannot be of you I just need to go work this out I need to get my mind clear I need to get this settled saints of God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord if you find yourself in anguish of spirit if you find yourself in Cruel bondage if you find yourself in unpleasant circumstances it's because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord and there is one reason you're in that situation is because he's trying to reveal himself to you in a way that he has never revealed himself to you before if you don't believe that you are going to live a miserable life there is no other hope you've only got two options my footsteps are either ordered of the Lord and He is revealing himself to me through this or this is just happen stance this is bad luck this is something this is sin catching up to me from you know something I did when I was in third grade like you got no other options but negativity amen they find themselves in this condition and God just simply says you're here because I want to reveal you reveal myself to you as Jehovah as the Lord you say well what does that mean that you want to reveal yourself to me as Jehovah Jehovah seven compound pound Redemptive names of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra the Lord is my provider we like that right that's good it's okay you can say Amen we like that it's good if the Lord is your provider that means you find yourself in a situation you need the Lord to be your provider also known as a trial AKA bad situation also known as not your best day do you want him to reveal himself to you as Jehovah Gyra be careful what you sign up for right we as Believers may not even sign up for it and we get it anyhow but that's okay that's what we may not have read the fine print but that's what we signed up for Jehovah RFA the Lord is my healer if the Lord is your healer guess what I thank you you've got my point I don't need to dwell on it very long Jehovah Shema the Lord is present if you find yourself in the need of Jehovah Shema wanting to reveal himself to you as such it's probably because you feel alone the reason you feel alone is not because he takes satisfaction in you feeling alone the reason that you feel alone is he wants you to get down on your knees and seek his face and say Lord Lord reveal yourself to me like you've revealed yourself to me never revealed yourself to me before reveal yourself to me as Jehovah Shema reveal yourself to me that you are present in this situation he takes no satisfaction in the external circumstances that cause us grief what he takes satisfaction is is in the purpose behind that Jehovah Shalom the Lord is my peace I'm not faulting you if you didn't sign up for needing Jehovah Shalom to manifest himself in your life today like I don't ask for these things either I'm not signing up for extra credit the fact of the matter is we've got to come to terms with our purpose here on Earth and our purpose here on Earth is for him to manifest his Essence and his character and his being through us and a part of that is us not responding to situations that cause us anguish of spirit and uncomfortableness the way the world does because if we respond and we exhibit the same traits that the world does what good is our Lord to the world but when we find ourselves in conditions that the world find itself in and we respond with the appropriate response of Lord I don't even know what you're doing now but in this situation I could really use you coming on the scene and revealing yourself to me as Jehovah Shalom I need peace in this situation to have an understanding but I find too often what I do is I pray Lord take this situation away from me Lord remove me from this situation Lord change the picture change the situation that's not the prayer that he's after the prayer that he's after is seek my face not my hands his hands can come down and fix that problem in a split second not even his whole hand one finger his hand is capable his hands are worthy there is not an issue with the power of His Hands but that's not his purpose what if he would think about this for a second and those that those of you that's been on the road for a minute think if God would have came and removed every hard circumstance from you as soon as you ask him where would you be right now I'll tell you where you would be you would be the most impatient person on the face of the Earth that's exactly what our Prophet said he says the reason that we have to wait the reason that God can't come and fix everything as soon as we ask ask him is because if he would do that then we would become even more impatient with him the next time but he says it's only through patience that we possess life and he also says that it's th that patience is the process of character development that's why we find oursel in conditions that are uncomfortable and when we just pray over and over and over lord change this Lord change change this Lord change this move on my behalf let me see your hand his hand does not come I dare you I dare you instead of praying that way next time I dare you to ask him Lord what are you trying to get me to right now through this what are you trying to reveal through me what are you trying to reveal through me to my coworker to my family what is your purpose behind this and may I seek your face what is your will behind this may I seek your face and may I pray in accordance to that may I not just be running to you all the time saying please help me please help me please help me please change this but may I run to you seeking your face Lord what are you revealing to me right now Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner the Lord is my protector the Lord is my victory remember brother random says that the seven compounds name seven compound names of Jehovah applied to Jesus so when we take the name of Jesus and we give our life to Jesus it's not just five little letters it's a person that represents a character that represents God God is represented as our Victory how are we ever ever going to know the we pray all the time let the fullness of his word be in me we're the fullness of his how many times have we heard that the fullness of his word the fullness of his word has come well we automatically think of all the good things of that but in order for all the good things of that to be manifested brother brandom says God works in pros and cons in types and shadows in negatives and positives in order to express himself as a savior somebody had to be lost in order to express himself as a Healer somebody had to be sick he says this was his purpose in the back part of his mind he wanted to express himself God didn't just stop wanting to express himself the day me and you came on the scene brother brandom says our purpose here on Earth is to prove to Satan that we're not like the first Eve he says our purpose here on Earth is to be a tool used of God to express his word to manifest himself that's why we find ourselves in bad situations is so Jesus can be manifested we pray to be like Jesus to be more like him we pray these things and I believe we mean it but I think it's time that we come to an understanding of what that really means what we're really signing up for I think if we will grasp that we're going to be a lot more settled we're not going to be so easily shaken we're not going to respond to bad situations like the world does Jehovah Raha the Lord is my shepherd if you need a Shepherd probably means you're lost if you need a Shepherd it probably means you need a little guidance if there's anybody in here that doesn't need need Jehovah Raha I'd say you're on Shaky Ground yes because that's one of the first things we need to come to it's like I need some help I don't have this all figured out life's not going the way that I think it is I need somebody to guide me here cuz I've made four decisions today that did not turn out very well Jehovah tesu the Lord is my righteousness these are the seven compound names of Jehovah and this is what God almighty was telling Israel I want to reveal myself to you this way but every time a situation came up for him to reveal himself this way to them they immediately went from Believers to unbelievers they immediately went from followers of the Prophet to I don't even think you're a prophet anymore and if you are God surely ain't talking to you for me just like this back and forth back and forth back and forth one chapter I'm getting ahead of myself Exodus 14 they finally made it out of Egypt they come to the Red Sea they're rejoicing they've went out of Egypt they've had the Passover Moses our fearless Prophet is leading us we've got everything good going for us no more making bricks and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptian marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord appropriate response nothing wrong here and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us to die in the wilderness not the appropriate response remember Saints this was after they just sat and watched the nine plagues nine right don't crucify me if I get the number wrong they just watched all of the plagues strike Egypt up until the third plague and then none of the plagues touched them they have seen Supernatural Beyond Supernatural and now God's yanked them out of this land even to the fact they spoiled Egypt on their way out and now they come to a sea the Red Sea they've seen all of this they they've confessed all of this they come to the Red Sea they turn around Pharaoh's not even close yet they just see the threat of him coming they see the threat of something coming it hasn't even happened yet it hasn't even arrived and they're already unbelievers again wow they're crying out to the Lord which again is the appropriate response but the verse right after that reveals they're not crying out to the Lord Lord remember your promise remember your Covenant remember what you said you was going to do to us remember praise the Lord you said you were going to reveal yourself to us as Jehovah Raha you're going to be our Shepherd you're clearly leading us no that's not the response the response is we're all going to die and it's your fault Moses because there wasn't enough graves in Egypt you brought us out here so we could all be buried the flippy flippancy of their minds is I would say unbelievable but then I have something come up in my life that my day didn't go quite like I thought my day should go and I find myself scratching my head where are th Lord what's going on how did this happen remember brother Bram says everything that happened with Israel was just a type for us so we can sit here and point fingers at is at Israel all we want but all Israel revealed was me that's what the prophet said like it or not this is how flid I am it hasn't even arrived yet and they've already left the message they've already said that ain't a prophet wherefore hast thou dealt with us this far to carry us out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt the rebuking Moses as soon as they get done rebuking him they remind him oh yeah by the way remember I told you about this I told you what was going to happen I knew more than you did is what they're saying we told you this would happen saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear ye not watch Moses's response you remember Moses's response the first time he went running back to God like what about my commission what am I doing what look at Moses's response now Moses don't have all the answers but Moses has already been told to the Lord I'm going to deliver Pharaoh in your hands tomorrow Moses's response fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show unto you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today you shall shall see them again no more forever you can tell Moses is not the same Moses Moses has taken a step the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace amen thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians this is verse 30 and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore yes and Israel saw that the great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant Moses we're back to being Believers again it's a good day things are good enemies destroyed bad doctors report taken care of legal trouble I issue done car crash I was almost in I avoided credit card finally paid off keep pulling he can get specific put yourself in there I'm back to being a Believer again things are okay things are good things settled out a little bit family don't think I'm quite a fanatic I told him I didn't worship a man it's just God sent a prophet they backed off a little bit I'm not the black sheep of the family I might get a go to Thanksgiving back back to being the believer again next chapter so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to Mara they could not drink of the Waters of Mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Mara and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink they've just had the plethora of Supernatural experiences things are good the Egyptians destroyed in the Red Sea that God dried up 3 days later God can't provide anything for us to drink he parted the Red Sea which was water I think he has control of water amen we've got nothing to drink he's wanting to reveal himself to us and he's already promised he's taken us to Canaan two options here either I'm not as thirsty as what I thought I was and I really don't need anything to drink right or he'll provide me something to drink because he says he wants to reveal himself to me this way that's the mindset of a real believer if I find myself in in situations that there is a promise of God for I want to get to the point that I default to the promise of God and count the external circumstances as a lie even carnally the scripture says I have never seen the righteous forsaken I have never seen God's children begging bread if I find myself in a situation we've read things in the message we've read thing in the scriptures to where the last days there not promised to be beds of roses for the believer if I find myself in a situation I can't buy food I don't have food I don't want to default to being an unbeliever and saying Lord what are you doing you clearly are don't have this under control I want to default to the promise of God I've never seen the righteous forsaken and I've never seen his children begging bread I'm not going begging for bread and that doesn't mean that you have to go begging on the street corner to violate that scripture I don't want to be begging him for bread I want to approach him Lord this is your scripture I don't have food I feel that I'm hungry and need to eat but I will deny my hunger pains as being true and I will accept your word as being true there's two ways God can answer that either you're not as hungry as you think you are and you don't need to eat or he will provide you food unless you renig on his promise and you start begging but because once you start begging you've now identified yourself as not a child of God and you've forfeited your promise I don't know how tight that it will get I don't know what carnal circumstances we may face but I'll tell you one thing I do know for a fact is leoda has set us up for failure for that time period because Leia programs into us that we got to have three meals a day and if we don't have three meals a day we're starving we might die I'll remind you that Jesus went 40 days Jesus went 40 days with no food and he was a man that was not some super anointing that was a man that went 40 days without food brother brandom says you can't do that without water but you can do it without food you say well that's really carnal it may be and it may never manifest I don't know but I do know one thing if the squeeze gets really squeezy and really Pinchy and I don't have natural food to eat I am not going to turn into an unbeliever and I'm not going to beg them to release the hold on my debit card so I can buy food and I'm not going to be begging my heavenly father to feed me the birds don't do that the birds don't do that and he takes care of them how much more so a child of God so we have external situations pop up to test the promises of God I would venture to say the farther along the line we go the more external s situations we're going to find oursel in testing the word of God right down to our daily livings write down food to eat water to drink clothes to put on I hope I'm wrong about all that but I've just read way too many quotes and I've seen too many scriptures and I've seen the pattern before us in the scriptures I don't want to come to that point in time and all of a sudden forget everything God's done for me forget how he's provided before let me ask you this Saints how do you think you get food right now anyhow your debit card you think that's what's sustaining you is your debit card your ability to swipe a card and get something what happens if your card gets taken away and you have to use cash what happens if you don't have cash and I'll remind you how did you get that cash to begin with you say well I went and work for it I can go to work and get money and buy who gave you the strength to go to work who gave you the strength to get out of bed and even who gave you that job who gave you the strength to get out of bed and go to that job see it becomes so easy to us that we forget we think we're in control we think we we can sustain ourselves without the grace of God to get us out of bed every morning we couldn't even go to work to make a living to put money in the bank to swipe the card to get the food how about we start depending on him now rather than wait till things get back why don't we recognize his face in our life now rather than crying for his hand later and the children of Israel said unto him would to God we had died by the hand of the land by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we set by the flesh pots and when we did eat and we had bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger so they had a water problem Moses heals God heals the water through Moses few days later they got a food problem you're trying to kill us all with Hunger god reigns Mana down chapter 17 and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of sin after their Journey according to the Commandment of God and pitched in radm and there was no water for the people to drink we're back to another water problem Lord have mercy what are we going to do maybe the one who fixed the water problem before we'll fix it again and we're just going to praise God for him fixing that and believe that he's going to fix that nope verse two wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why ched ye with me wherefore do you tempt the Lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is this that thou Hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst Moses's position position is amazing he goes from savior one day to murderer the next and then he's savior the next day like I don't know how many masks that he puts on and off but it's amazing he's our Prophet he's our savior he's trying to kill us no he's not he's our Prophet he's our savior he's trying to kill us Exodus 19 and Moses went down from the mountain to the people and Sanctified the people and they washed their clothes and he said unto the people be ready against the third day so theyve made it through these problems they finally came to the Mount where God says this is where I was going to bring you all to worship this was my plan this is where I'm going to reveal myself to you Moses s Sanctified them washes their clothes be ready in 3 days and it came to pass when the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet SE exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God the whole purpose for God doing anything that he's done through this journey through this Exodus is now here we have finally made it to the purpose and they stood at nether part of the mountain and mount Sia was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it with fire and the smoke thereof descend ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mount quaked greatly Exodus 20:8 and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood a far off the question is why why when God said I'm going to do all of this for you and I'm going to reveal myself to you in all of these ways and the purpose is to get you to this one location so that I personally can come down and reveal myself to you and I will be your God and you will be my people and you will know me as my as I am known and you will know my Essence and my character and you will know me as your Shepherd and provider and victory there won't be any more middleman of Moses it'll just be me and you am and they've came through all of this and he keeps his word and he shows up no doubt about it the people did not back up and say I ain't going he ain't there they knew he was there they removed and stood a far off the question is why would you do such a rash thing the the answer is because when they were down in Egypt they weren't seeking his face they were seeking his hand so now that he finally shows up face to face they don't want anything to do with it are we seeking his face or are we seeking his hand if we spend every day of Our Lives seeking his hand to fix our problems when he shows up face to face we're not going to have nothing to do with the Saints it's going to be too scary but if we will seek his face from the beginning if we will seek to know him as he is not just in his delivering power not just in his problem fixing but if we will seek to know his purpose in our life and why are you doing this with me right now and I'm yielding to it even though I might not understand what you're doing I know you're doing something and I know you're revealing something to me if we will approach him with that mindset when he finally does pull the curtain back from our vision and allow us to see what he's been doing all along we're not going to run off scared we're going to worship him as he is and we're going to draw draw nigh to him and we're going to draw closer to him and we're going to say I'm going up into that mountain even if it would kill me because this is the purpose though he slay me yet I'll serve him we'll never have that confession if we continue on the hamster well Lord I got a problem with you f fix it Lord I got a problem will you fix it Lord I've got a problem will you fix it Lord this is a really bad one can you fix this one if we'll get on the hamster whe of Lord here's the situation what are you doing would you please reveal to me what you're doing would you please reveal to me what you're trying to accomplish maybe it's just you wanting to get me on my knees and ask you to reveal yourself to me in a way that I've never known you before it's a scary thought scripture says it's a scary thing it's a fearful thing to fall into the hand of a living God it's a fearful thing to pray that prayer Pray that prayer make me more like you with this understanding pray that prayer and really mean it you know I am convinced that God in his Mercy to us blocks our intellectual capacity when we start praying like that because if we intellectually knew what we were asking for we would never utter those words carnally we would never have the courage to do it it is only by a supernatural anointing for him to come down and block our brain waves and pray Lord make me more like you there is no carnal person that's going to pray that prayer that is a supernatural anointing because when we pray pray that he will am and it'll be the very next day and our response will be Lord what are you doing why are you trying to kill me it's because he's restored our intellects to us and now we're recognizing what we signed up for we're all very familiar with that story with that passage of scripture been preached on thousands of times no doubt but I don't want to leave it thousands of years ago Luke 7:26 but what ye went out to see this is a question Jesus asked them what did you go out to see speaking of John the Baptist a prophet yay I say unto you and much more than a Prophet this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before the you say well that's Malachi 3 that's not Malachi 4 you're right but there was a voice that came down on the Ohio River in 1933 and said as meaning the same way that John the Baptist foran my first coming your message will forerun my second so in order to know how the second forerunning and the purpose of the second forerunning is going to be we have to now go back and look at John the Baptist ministry which is defined in the scriptures behold I send my messenger before my great demonstration of the power of my hand to deliver you from all of your problems and give you a good easy life not one thing behold I send my messenger before my face shows up to prepare your hearts to receive my face as John the Baptist foran my first coming your message will forerun my second what is his what is his message what is this Forerunner to do what was brother Brandon's purpose Divine healing prayer lines no to prepare me and you to see the face of God 17th person that I baptized all at once I heard something say look up and I looked and here come that Pillar of Fire circling down out of the heaven stood right over where I was at and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming of Christ what happened after John the Baptist for ran what happened did not the very face of God show up what do we think happened after brother brandham forerun the second coming of Christ did not the very face of God show up we've got a picture of it Saints the very face of God shows up not so that we can continue to seek his hand not that we can continue to just seek his hand so that we can recognize there's been a change there's been a change I'm not on this Earth to just seek his hand to rid me of my problems I'm on this Earth to now seek his face which is present Psalm 28 a Psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come up against me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and F fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all of my days guess what if you're in his house you're going to see more than his hand this is the rapture scripture how many wants to go in a Rapture this is the rapture scripture Amen to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me I want to read this again for in the time of trouble for in the time of trouble for in the time of trouble expect trouble right trouble should not be unexpected if we are in a rapturing day in a rapturing age in a rapturing condition expect trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord this is not all things got bad I don't believe anymore this is things are Troublesome he's hiding me somewhere you all can't get to me he's hiding me somewhere the the world can't get to me he's hiding me somewhere The Squeeze can't get to me and while he's doing that I'm not there begging for him to show me his hand and deliver me I'm there I'm singing praises to his name because in spite of all of this I know he has hidden me someplace that's untouchable I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord here O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer [Music] me remember this is the ma the Rapture scripture David is confessing all of this he's proclaiming this is fact he's saying all of this is happening this is what's going to happen it's undisputable but you know what there's a big difference between David and Israel and David gives us the key in verse eight because when thou said seek ye my face my heart said unto me thy face Lord will I Seek You Want To Be hid in his Pavilion you want to be hid in his secret Tabernacle respond to the call in your heart that's driving you and pulling you now to seek his face you don't want any problems at the river seek his face now you don't want any problems during the squeeze seek his face now you don't want to be unwavered when the doctor hands you the bad report seek his face now you don't want to be unwavered when the panty dries up seek his face now you don't want to be unwavered when there's no gas for the car seek his face now if there's no gas in the car and I don't have means to put gas in the car that simply means I don't need to go anywhere because if I needed to go to somewhere he would put gas in the car or I'm just crazy for believing that but if he can pick Phillip up and put him somewhere that he needs to go without gasoline surely he can put gas in the car when I need to go somewhere unless I'm not supposed to go there I'm not going to be pay praying and begging God to put gas in my car so I can go world go entertain myself with the world that's right remember you have to have faith first brother R says it's the same faith that will take you in the Rapture is the same Faith you go go out and start your car with I'm not making this stuff up Saints same principle if I need to go he'll put gas in the car if I need to go he'll change my atoms I'm not in control of this he's in control of this David gives us the secret of why when everything goes sideways he says my head's above my enemies I'm in a secret place with God you all can't touch me I'm looking at his Beauty there's chaos all around me isn't he wonderful isn't he beautiful David did not arrive at that point except he says when my heart said seek his face I sought his face I hope we're catching what the Lord's been doing in our myth Saints we have left the age of just seeking the hand of God our prayer lives should not just be seeking the hand of God anymore s we are too far down the road if you believe an ounce of just what's coming over this local pull pit you have to recognize that God is calling us higher I believe God will fix my problems I will ask God to fix my problems but I am still going to believe him and I am still going to worship him if he don't fix my problems amen I am not on this Earth for myself I am bought with a price I am his to do with as he so chooses he has told me I am going to reveal myself to you as Lord not just as God Almighty I've said be it unto me according to your word I have said I'm signing up for you to use me to manifest to Satan that I won't fall like the first Eve that's not signing up for everything to be easy that's signing up to be used of God you're not going to sign up for that if you're just seeking the hand of God the world seeks the hand of God constantly and I'm not faulting them for that I say God help them in every way that you can help them but I'm not the world and I'm not just going to seek his hand I'm going to seek his face I want to know him as he has known and I I want to to to Define what I mean when I say Seek his face I his face is his person his his face is his person it is the very essence it's the very character of God it's the very truth of God going to close with these last couple quotes brother Ram says he was going to take them away from that old muddy water of Egypt and give them Living Waters out of a rock he couldn't do it until he made an approach they just couldn't do it by desire there had to be a provided approach they was going to see the Red Sea opened they was going to see the Miracles take place before they could see this thing they had to come through God's provided approach you see it Christian it's not because they desired to see it not because you want to see something happen if you want to see whether Christ is right or not come through God's approach to him then you'll know and this is where I really want to emphasize the the title of seeking God for God not seeking God for ourselves but seeking God for God if you don't want to get wrecked up in life quit pretending to be a Christian cuz you're going to find yourself wrecked up out here somewhere if I started to go home this afternoon and I cut across the field I'd find myself sunk down in a mud puddle somewhere the highway has an approach to Jeffersonville and I must go the way of the highway it's easy running if I'll just get on the road am die out to self come through the blood of Christ then you can approach the father and he will give you the Holy Spirit that'll make you a Believer because it's not you that's believing anymore it's the holy spirit in you somebody in here tonight has got to quit asking God to fill me with your Holy Spirit fill me with your Holy Spirit fill me with your Holy Spirit and get on the approach to God get on the way he has provided how about you die out to yourself and then ask him to fill you with his holy spirit don't ask him to fill you with your with his holy spirit when you still got your spirit in there brother Brandon says you've got to come in God's provided way and his provided way is death to self then and only then can he fill you with his Holy Spirit and then and only then can you truly believe the words of God because it's it's not you with a mental intellectual conception trying to believe something or trying to work yourself up into something but now it is he himself God in you believing his own word there's young people in here that needs to die to yourself and follow the word of God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ quit trying to have God have preeminence in your life when you have't came God's provided way repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then and only then do you have claims on the promise repentance death to self I'm wrong your word is Right you've got to start there before you can get anywhere with God there's marriages in here this evening that need some death to self quit asking God to fix your marriage when you won't die to yourself it's not God's approach it's not God's provided way there are job situations in here that needs fixed this evening quit asking God to fix your job situation when you won't die to self the approach to God is death to self whatever the situation is Don't Be invoking the Name of Jesus Christ over top of it when you won't first die to yourself that is not God's approach that is not God's way he has no obligation for that look before they could see Miracles they had to come the provided approach and before you can ever become a partaker of the Blessed Heavenly calling you have to come through God's provided approach not self- sustaining not saying I got this I can handle this it's a good day things are okay I'm in control not self- sustaining that is not God's provided way not intellectually but death to yourself and a rebirth again in Jesus Christ through the offering of his blood am amen he says quit pretending you're a Christian when you're not you're going to find yourself wrecked up and if you want to be a Christian a real Christian a born again Christian die to yourself first come God's provided way come through the blood that was offered for you Saints I'm concerned we've got so intellectual that we think we can get somewhere with god without coming through the blood I'm afraid we've got so intellectual in this leot toan age that we forgot that God himself took on a human body and shed his blood for our penalty I'm afraid that we have got so intellectual that we as brother brandom says we'll come and have a dry-eyed confession and expect God to fill us with his Holy Spirit and change our being and change everything within us and make everything okay and we won't even acknowledge the fact that he hung and died on a cross for me have we got so deep in the message that we forget God took on the shape of a man and paid our penalty and suffered and died and we're trying to be a believer and go in a Rapture and have the Holy Ghost and be the bride and we won't even acknowledge what happened on Calvary that he died for us surely if he died for me I can die to myself and say not my will but thine be done and if I need to repent and I need to be baptized in your name before I can lay hold on a promise of the Holy Ghost that's the least that I can do but we get so intellectual we think we can skip the sacrifice that was paid for us and we can say God sent a prophet and now everything's okay nonsense he says quit pretending that you're a Christian until there is something within you not mentally but something within your soul that can say yay and amen to every word of God you're you've not even started and it's not going to work he says you're going to find yourself wrecked up we've got people that needs to quit pretending your message Believers but when something goes sideways and you can't figure out what brother Brandon mean between these two quotes all of a sudden he's wrong and he's not the prophet and that you've got a better idea quit pretending how about we first come to death to self and acknowledge the fact I'm not self- sustaining and I don't even have a thought coming and there's no way that I can interpret the scriptures to myself and that I've got to have a angel from God to come and even tell me who I am I don't even know who I am if he don't send me an angel to tell me he says may they raise their hands not to me but to you and in doing so say from this day henceforth Lord I am taking myself up to the river of self-denial God Amen you want to get somewhere with god let's get up to the river of self-denial I'm taking myself up to the river of death you want to get somewhere with god let's come his provided way let's approach him in the right way I'm plunging myself beneath to lose every stain that's wrong with me all my habits and my uncleanness and my thoughts all my indifference my quarrels my argues my tempers and all these things I'm just going to plunge them right beneath the flood that when I come up I want to feel like the gospel said that I should clean ready with a pure heart are you struggling feeling that you're clean this evening are you struggling feeling that you're ready to leave this Dimension are you struggling knowing your heart is not pure quit pretending to be something you're not and die to yourself acknowledge that you're not self-sustaining and that you need somebody to help you come his provided way quit seeking his hand to make you feel better about yourself and seek his face so that you will know who you truly are no matter how how cruel my fellow man is I still want to love them see the world can't do this I want to enter into a fellowship with thee until I feel to my enemies like you did the world can't do this the world can't love their enemies humans can't love their enemies it's not in us to love our enemies we can barely love our brothers and sisters when they say something wrong about us that they didn't even know is wrong how about we have a little death to self and say any bad thing that's been said about me there's probably some truth to it that's true and before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power I'm closing real shortly just in a couple minutes stay with me before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power who wants to see a resurrected power 50% of you want to see a resurrected power praise the Lord I'm not trying to work you up but let's say Amen to the word of God who wants to see a resurrected power before you can ever see before I can ever see a new ministry take place myself before you can ever enter into a new fellowship with God there has to got to be a self dest self crucifixion am amen how many wants to see the third pole in your life where's the self- crucifixion the third pole in the prophet's life did not come without self- crucifixion how do we think we're going to have the third pole the fullness of the word in our life the power of the spoken word on our tongue if we don't come through a self crucifixion and we still keep going through life pretending that we're something we're not and we keep going through life that our entire prayer life is just Lord help me Lord help me God have mercy God help me God save me seeking his hand and not his face I wonder if we seek his hand so much and we pray for Revival if he would send it if we would welcome it I wonder if maybe we have the wrong idea of a Revival and I wonder if our idea of a Revival is God coming in with his hand and fixing all of our problems and getting us out of here because we're tired of suffering and things are getting harder and the economy is about to crash and the list goes on and on and on is that what motivates us Saints are we motivated just to get out of here why do we want out of here if you're a Believer and you get out of here you're going to see his face I hope that won't be scary for us I hope we can see his face now before we see his face then and that we can get comfortable with that no wonder belly Graham says we can't have a Revival well you can't have a Revival just on theology you you've got to have an old-fashioned god-sent sin killing Revival that gets people up to the Altar and they die out to self and to sin are we so message that we've passed that are we so deepen our teaching that we'll bypass that I don't care if it's a Revival just for a new birth or if it's a Revival for God to reveal something something more in his word to you it's going to come the same way a sin killing death to self Revival first you you want to know the intricate workings of the Rapture process it's going to come through a sin killing death to self you're on the other end of the spectrum and you just need a savior it's going to come through a sin killing death to self the process and the approach to God will never change then we can have a Revival but just to stand and say I accept Christ as a personal Savior and sat down that's mental okay let's update it a couple decades just to stand and say God sent a prophet that's mental the devil knows God sent a prophet he is not saved and he is not okay the devil believes more than most people I won't say that the devil believes God sent a prophet and he's not wishy-washy about it either he doesn't go back and forth when he can't understand some quotes the devil knows who the angel was brother brandom is trying to get us away from that mental conception the trouble of it is you're asking people to stand up and accept Christ as my personal testimony stand up like that and that's all they know about it worked up under a little mental enthusiasm the next thing you know it's gone the only way that man will ever first stay is for him to lay down there and die out to himself and be reborned again by the spirit of God and filled with the Holy Ghost one way one prescription has it changed since the day of Pentecost don't think that we're going to come to this age and Proclaim and testify we know who Malachi for is and we're okay no where's the death to self where's the indwelling of the Holy Spirit where's the real New Birth not pretending I'm afraid we've watered down the holy spirit so much we will take that quote where brother brandom says the holy spirit is just a temporal gift to get you through this life the real gift is that soul in there and I believe that and I say yay and amen but I want to remind you what he said the Holy Spirit was given to you to get you through this life you are not going going to get through this life without the Holy Spirit we should seek it desperately every day of our life unless you don't want to get through this life you think that you have the capability to withstand Leota and however million demons were loosed on this age on the Bride of Jesus Christ in your own capacity without the Holy Spirit and say oh well I've got the real gift of Soul inside I don't it's temporal I'll take it or leave it no you're going to find yourself in a house with the padded walls is where you're going to find yourself wrecked up pretending to be a Christian you desperately need the Holy Spirit I desperately need the Holy Spirit every day of my life just to get through life don't water down the spirit of God there was a life that was given for that the life of God was given for that the life of God was given to release that Spirit on me and you just so we could get through this life don't stand and say God sent a prophet and put an equal sign between that that is not the equivalent of having the Holy Spirit death to self to where you lay there and you die to yourself not only die to yourself brother brand says you die and you rot away so much there's not even a chance of Rejuvenation not just death but to completely run away to yourself all you say I went down there and there's a lot of power brother the whole floor was dancing the spirit and not enough Faith to hell to think you call that power that's not power that's blessings there's a lot of difference between blessings and power I want to say there is a lot of difference there is a lot of difference between the hand of God and the face of God the hand of God will alleviate your temporal situation the face of God will change your Eternal destination and it will change your entire life as the musicians would come this evening let's Stand Together brother Brandon says the devil can't receive the holy spirit because if he did he'd be your brother he would have to be saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost then he'd be your brother so you see he couldn't do it he couldn't do it he says Judas couldn't go to Pentecost cuz he had have been their brother he couldn't he couldn't go to Pentecost what happened at Pentecost the important thing wasn't when they came out of the upper room the important thing was what happened in the upper room death to self 120 people got in a room and they died to their self he says no no you just went to the borderline and came back lusting for the things of the world you never never went all the way over into Canaan you see you never went across Jordan the death to self this is why Israel didn't want to go across Jordan into Canaan 2 million of them died they didn't want to go across Jordan it wasn't that Canaan wasn't over there Canaan was over there it's not that the whole Holy Spirit isn't here Saints it's here it's just do you want to die to yourself 2 million people came to a mountain and God fulfilled his end of the deal and they said not for me they had to die off through the Wilderness looking across Jordan the prophet comes and says Jordan represented death to self it's no wonder they wouldn't go to Canaan they wouldn't die to themselves in Egypt they wouldn't die to themselves at the mount why in the world would they die to themselves to go into Canaan we want our atoms changed to leave this Dimension and go see him face to face but we won't even die to ourselves to have his holy spirit working in our daily lives now we think that we're going to want to see him face to face I'm telling you if it was possible for a make believer to go in a Rapture and see God face to face it would terrify him and he wouldn't be comfortable there he'd say send me back but if we will approach God the right way the great and Dreadful day of the Lord will not be a dreadful day to us it will just be a great day to us that's why the scripture says that this message is not given to everybody this message is just given to those who look forward to his coming that don't fear his coming if you're s let's bow our heads please if you're sitting here tonight and there is still an a a speck of fear in your soul fearful of Christ appearing there's an answer for that there's a solution for that you don't have to leave this building with that fear you can leave this building looking forward to his face appearing how awful would it be for God to have done all that he has done and given us everything that he has given us and brother R says we now live in a free age a free age free from Fear free from condemnation free from even our human genetics in our DNA how how awful it would be for God to have extended all of that to us and the least and the the best we can do is come and say Lord will you fix my problems will you help me today things are going sideways I'm I'm not faulting anybody for doing that I'm just saying let's come up higher Saints that's not the purpose of the message the purpose is the message was to prep prepare the way for his face to come to us so that we can see him as he is how awful it would be for him to extend that to us this evening and us still leave here with fear in our heart how awful that would be for him to extend that invitation to us this evening and we would walk out of here with without accepting him as our personal savior who died on the cross for us and paid the penalty how awful for him to extend the invitation to us to come and accept his name in water baptism and we would refuse that and go on about our daily life how awful for him to extend that invitation for his very Spirit the spirit of God to come and indwell us and change our change our very being in our daily lives and we say no I know he sent a prophet I'm okay I believe what he said I'm good how awful for him to extend that to us and we would not come and die to ourselves and say Lord fill me with your spirit every ounce of my being change my life amen how awful if we have been extended the grace to believe this message and we've came through that process and we find oursel washed up and dried up and in a rut and no overcoming power in our life to where our children can't even look at us and know whether we're a Believer or not how awful to continue in that situation when it's as simple as coming back and saying Lord I need your Holy Spirit to make it through this life I need your Holy Spirit to be the mommy I'm supposed to be and the daddy that I'm supposed to be I cannot do it in this condition and in this age I've got to have your Holy Spirit Saints he has given it to us but he is not going to fulfill his promise if we will not die to ourself and if we will just continue day after day to seek his hand to fix our problem when he has given us invitation to seek his very face how awful it would be to turn that away since he has loved us so much to send us a message and to come and to not only do that but to have his face the picture taken of his face we don't have to wonder about what the purpose was we know the purpose I say let's continue to seek his hand in our daily life but let us seek his face ever more let's pray together precious Lord Jesus father we bow with grateful hearts with Humble Hearts with Thanksgiving of what you've done for us Lord father and I pray that as we stand here this evening as your word has went forth that it would not return like bread upon the Water but that you would go now and that you would manifest and that you would vindicate and that you would accomplish what the purpose was Lord father you know what you laid on my heart before I came to this pull pit father and I do not ever want to be guilty of pulling on the emotions of people [Music] people but Lord you have told me that there is young people in this building that need a new birth and they have got to hear the gospel in its Simplicity and they have got to know what the next step is and that next step is death to self father there are marriages in this building that need death to self there are men making decisions as fathers that need death to self father your word has went forth your word is the answer I pray that you will give us the grace to receive it and to act upon it and to Humble ourselves and to do what is needed and not to be cold and not to be starchy Lord and not to have a dry-eyed confession and just say I'm a Believer Lord but to know that we know that we know that we have met the very face of God in our Liv Liv Lord may we not leave here the same way that we came in I pray and ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless [Music] you seek ye first the kingom of God and his right rightousness and all these

if you leave without it it's not his [Music] fault and if you have any faith in me whatsoever as a minister I don't say this to be spiritual but I'm telling you what he told me before I came to the pull pit there are young people in here that need a new birth kids it's not good enough just to believe God sent a prophet and it's not good enough just to believe what mommy and daddy say you've got to know him for yourself and that's here for you tonight if you want it from the youngest to the oldest if you're old enough to understand the words coming out of my mouth it's available for you tonight don't think you got to figure it all out before you move you don't have to come up here if you want to come up here you're more than welcome to but you don't have to leave here without knowing god almighty as your lord and personal savior couples you don't have to leave out of here with marital problems the fix is here tonight [Music] backslider you don't have to leave out of here in that condition the fix is available tonight if you're dry and in a rut and you need a fresh filling of the Holy Spirit don't be ashamed of that we need a refilling the only shame is saying you don't need a refilling but it's here for you tonight if you need it if you leave without it don't blame [Music] him again I'm not one to pull I'm not one to push I'm not one to say you got to do anything you don't have to leave your seat you got to do what God tells you to do if God tells you to seek him there seek him there if he tells you to come up here and seek him come up here seek him if he tells you to go home and seek Him in your prayer closet you do that but just know the answer is here tonight you don't have to leave without it the only question is if you're going to die to yourself if you will die to yourself you can have whatever your heart desires God bless you as we would sing together brother Blake seeking first the kingom of God and His rightousness and all these things shall be added
