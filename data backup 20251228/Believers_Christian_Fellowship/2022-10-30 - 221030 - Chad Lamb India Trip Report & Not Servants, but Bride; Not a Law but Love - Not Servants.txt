my savior a part of his word is angel Ina sing that who I am doing brother Joseph I'm a part of my day free destination well it's good to be home um definitely homesick for the people the language barrier there makes it pretty difficult to to have kind of a humble feeling but there's still a fellowship there with the brothers even though you may not understand half what they're saying or what you're saying to them greetings from the people in India we had several ministers to send greetings and greetings to the people of India who are streaming or watching um I want to thank every one of you for praying for the trip we had a good trip there was some obstacles in our bodies from the travel that wasn't very pleasant but knowing that everyone was back home praying really helped us out me personally my feet and ankles swelled up like like a bloated animal alongside the road when we got there so I was like oh this can't be happening I don't want to have this deal with this all week but after a couple days it subsided so I knew that everyone was praying um I'm grateful thankful the Lord to have an opportunity to go to India experience of a lifetime much different than than anything around here um and being the above average size that I am uh it was easy to be a celebrity with the children over there you know it wasn't too long after the first service before they were surrounding me and holding out their phones and taking pictures because I'm a giant they don't see him so that was good but uh brother Branham talked about being a celebrity of heaven and uh the people over there really make you feel like that there's definitely a love for the ministry and uh it was it was very humbling um obviously the language the food the physical environment um the travel the travel and the traditions and the music are all different all all extremely different but uh there's the same brotherly love there's the same Unity um the Same Same Love of the word and the same Hospitality I've joked around with a with a few people that have had me over at their house about being being a victim of hospitality in their home but India it takes the crown I mean they they they send it in waves you don't if you're done eating you're not donating someone will offer you more you tell them no they'll back off and then 30 seconds later someone new will come up and offer you some more so it's it was wonderful uh I don't know that uh [Music] it is a lot of what I think it's going to be like when we get there just everybody loves you just and all the all the faces of the people are bright and full of life and it was just wonderful to be there and seeing them worship and and being a part of it um my responsibility there was to take lots of pictures and videos and bring that report back to brother Franco which he said I did a good job so we'll see how that goes when brother Chad comes out with everything um I'll let him do most of the speaking on the on the report I showed my children I showed the children in my class this morning that there's a video on YouTube that that the people of India did so they got to see it if you want to see it it's it's a glimpses of sham tarazi convention so you probably won't remember that but but it's out there and I think he's also got the uh of the other sermons up also so that's it for now it's good to be home I really missed every one of you and missed my missed my class and uh being around the children there was uh it really made me homesick so it's good to be home Lord my heart desire always to burn with Spirits fire purpose is to worship you alone the Lord I've been won't you worship and adore to be a fragrance offered to your throne oh I live your name your your whole Jehovah you're the greatest [Music] so far away and cold and yet for me your love is still the same Lord I'll bend my knees [Music] to bow down holy holy Jehovah hello oh you're The Great I Am The Reason ye let's Stand Together As we sing that chorus again [Music] your name in your name Jehovah [Music] oh The Great I Am the reason I am my comfort let's sing that chorus without any music I Lift Your Name your holy holy Lord [Applause] Glory my

your blessings over all we say and do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you can have your seats for a few moments I'd like to give a bit of a trip report brother Frank if you would have liked to pull up that first PowerPoint slide I'd like to say thank you for everyone for praying it was we certainly felt your prayers we needed it but we thank God for the support we had from back home as brother Joe was saying it was uh it was wonderful I appreciate all the brothers who ministered while we were gone Brother Kyle and brother Nathanael and brother Noel we appreciate those Brothers also I talked to brother Emmanuel yesterday and he and sister Mimi are traveling back now they should be home this evening so we want to continue to remember them in prayer also I don't want to forget this I have a special note here I brought back some candy from India I always like to try to bring back some candy for the children so there's a little table set up beside the welcome desk there that has some uh Indian candy amen so all the children are welcome to have some afterwards once the children have some then everybody's welcome to have some but the children get to go first amen also somebody when I was there gave me a big bundle of keychains that they've had made that they only believe in the spirit and the bride say come and there's a couple different keychains there and they wanted to give that to the congregation so that's on the table as well so anybody who wants to pick one up you're welcome to that after the service so we just thank God that we're here thank God that we're home uh also I just wanted to say right from the beginning I'm wearing a brand new suit that brother Roshan and his family bought for me in India and I was really so blessed by that nobody's ever bought me a suit before and we stopped at a store and brother Roshan said we're stopping by a store and he says I'm going to tell you the rules that's like rules why do we have rules and he said I don't remember all the rules but basically it was just do what I say so and so we went in and he said from him and his family they wanted to buy a suit and as a memory from them and and I really appreciated that and then I was terrified I've never bought a suit before in my life my wife buys them all and I've never picked out my own clothes and all of a sudden I don't I like this is going to be a Monumental disaster I don't know what to do so luckily brother rashawn's wife Pamela she helped me and when I got home Angie said that's the exact color I wanted you to have I said well thank you Lord God was working on both ends so I really appreciate their Hospitality as brother Joe is saying they were so kind to us everyone was so kind to us they they take the cake for hospitality and so they were a real treat to have and I really appreciate what they've done for us and everybody was that way everywhere we went they wanted to give gifts they wanted to give food they wanted to treat you good and it was really nice to be with the Believers there and we really enjoyed that also brother Joe's outfit is a gift from Brother Rashon and his family so they took care of him too they said we want to buy you something I said brother Joe you're never going to find Clues to fit in here and sure enough they had clothes that fit him I could not believe it and so it worked out really really good so we just appreciate how good that they were to us everybody was the same way they were so hospitable and friendly and kind to us uh the trip started off just a little bit rough for me and I just saw the grace of God right from the beginning I'd woke up Saturday night if you remember we left Sunday evening and I preached Sunday morning and then brother Joe and I caught a plane about nine nine PM Sunday night out of Detroit and I woke up in the night somewhere in the night three or four o'clock in the morning and my my face was aching I had an abscessed tooth and I knew I had problems with the tooth because I went to the dentist a couple months ago and they found all kinds of affection around some roots of my teeth and they prescribed three root canals for me I had the first root canal done a couple months ago then you have to wait five or six weeks I had the second root canal done I don't know five weeks ago or whatever and I knew I had a third root canal scheduled for next week and so when I was there the doctor was telling me the the Dennis was telling me how they had to spread them out and I said well I'm going to to in India and she goes you're going to India I said yeah and so she goes you know when you get on the airplane that can flare up that can make that worse I said okay and so she says I want you to take penicillin with you and so she got me a prescription for penicillin so I filled it and I didn't want to fill it but it was only five bucks I said praise God I'll take it along so I threw it in the bag well I woke up in the night and it was just it was I've had an abscess tooth before I've had root canals before I knew what it was and it was killing me so I knelt down and prayed and I said Lord I you know you know I'm going to India and I said I don't know what to do I said but Lord if this subsides if if the pain goes away I'll go on the Indian and sure enough it did after I prayed for about an hour it went away I went back and laid back down I got up I preached I had absolutely no problem so I said I'm going so we got in the car and we went and wouldn't you know it on the way up there it starts flaring up again jaw starts swimming starts hurting and we got there early to get through security and all that and I told brother Joe I said work there's a steakhouse in in this terminal I said we're gonna go eat a piece of meat because this is the last beef we're gonna have for 12 days so when you go to a Hindu country who believes their mother is a cow they don't allow you to slaughter cows so so we were we were eating the meat and it kept getting worsted to meal I couldn't eat on this side I had to chew carefully it was getting worse and worse and worse and and all of a sudden you start having thoughts should I get on this plane what what happened what happens if you wind up in India with an abscessed tooth and pain that you can't bear I just say knock it out I mean just take it but so I'm having all these thoughts should I go should I not go but I remembered back to what I prayed in the morning and I said if it eases up and the pain goes away I'll go on to India and it did and so I told brother Joe that what was going on and you know he looked at me I don't know what he thought but if I was him I know what I would think don't do this to me so we're sitting there and all of a sudden I looked at Joe and I said well you can't blame the devil for trying can you and I just determined to go on you know so we did we went on we got on the plane I went ahead and took a first round of antibiotic and wouldn't you know it it started getting better and on the plane ride it got better it still hurt but it got better the next day it got better and by the third or fourth day it was gone amen and it's still gone and I thank God for that and it wasn't the antibiotic because I quit taking it so I'm not good at taking medicine I'm terrible at it and you have to take it at certain times when you eat and don't eat and I couldn't figure it out there's no time there was no time we didn't eat I mean did we ever go an hour without eating only when we slept so there's no time to take it on an empty stomach so I quit taking it and God just absolutely took care of it and and I knew that I knew that was just the devil and I knew it was an attempt right in the airport right we're getting ready to get on the plane there was always this temptation to turn back and this fear that started coming and I just resisted it and pushed through and God supernaturally took care of it and nobody knew that I was up Saturday night with tooth pain I kept that a secret to myself just me and God but God was good God was absolutely wonderful to us and now that I look back on the trip I know I know it was the enemy and I know it was a deterrent because God was so blessed us through the trip and it was so fruitful and it was such a blessing that I needed to go and I needed to be there and God really put his hand upon us and took care of it so we really appreciate you guys praying I really means a lot you may not have known how earnestly we needed your prayers but we sure did but God was super faithful to us I've learned some good lessons through that just to trust God if God answers a prayer and you pray like that trust him it'll be okay amen so God was God was really good to us we had good flights everything worked out great we got there and and started our journey and so we just we thank God for that when uh this is the first time I've ever been to India and so it was a it was a new experience for us but brother rashawn's a friend from way back with known Brothers short Sean for years he's been coming over for years he's preached here several times he's been a good friend and we've worked together to help him with some of his Outreach and Mission work for a long time so I really wanted to go see him and go see the work that he was doing and he had asked a few times but it finally worked out this time so he lives in the state of Punjab which is up north in India and so you can see where he's at there I think yeah you can see and and so it's a nice area it's a really nice area it's an agricultural area so it was good to be there and we got there and he gave us the next day to rest and so we went over and looked at the church project that he's working on brother Rashon started his church in his house and he added on to his house to make a little sanctuary in addition to his house and now they've filled up that Sanctuary they've Spilled Out into the street they've got people sitting in the balcony people sitting all over the in the sanctuary and people sitting out in the streets every service so they've outgrown their sanctuations they're building this one that's bigger and they've moved it away from his house and it's out by the main road that comes into the town excuse me so he's really hoping to do more Outreach and having that location he believes will help there's many people who've wanted to come to his church but they there was no room for them so there's people who went and travel to come because there's no place to sit and there's people who felt uncomfortable coming into his home for church and so he knows that there'll be many more people join in once this is done so he's working on that it happened to be that while I was there they were going to pour the concrete for the ceiling they were going to put the ceiling on it and if you look all these little sticks underneath are holding up the forms for the concrete and they looked like sticks they're little trees and it's holding all the forms in place then they stretched all the rebar across it and they're going to pour the concrete on top so when we were out there I knew what was underneath me it was all those sticks so I kept trying to move away from people you know I think in pounds per square inch foreign but it was fine they had rebar stretched the whole length I mean nothing was going to go anywhere but I just couldn't quit doing some calculations in my mind so but while we were there he asked us to pray over them the capping off of the building and the next phase of the construction and so we had everything word of Prayer [Music] things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] it was an exciting day for the church there to see the construction moving forward they had they were pumping concrete up through the ceiling and it was a busy day a lot of work was going on and this is the day after that we arrived foreign footage on all the um photography and I really appreciate him coming along he did a fantastic job and before we even got back he had transferred all the files over to brother Franco before I got back brother Franco already had a PowerPoint done he just put every picture and video in there and I just had to sort through them delete reorder and all that and they did a great job so I appreciate their help it was very fantastic the brother Joe was great to have along he was great to travel with and he did a fantastic job uh this is the fellowship hall that they already built they already finished this this has restrooms in it has a kitchen and a store room where they store stuff and the outside little Fellowship area there and that's where they're currently having church we'll show you a picture of that later because we had church here on Sunday and so they're having church here while they finish the building this is the front of the property they put a fence around their property so they put a a brick wall fence completely around the property they were able to buy one acre of property and to build this and have the fellowship home and this is the front fence that they put in they made it a little bit nicer because it's the front and have an entrance on either side but this is the advertisement they were advertising for the convention that they were going to have here on the 25th and they had these posters banners and billboards everywhere like everywhere we drove they had these Billboards and I started getting nervous I thought this is a big deal like I thought we were coming over for services and and they posted this everywhere and they told me they've been in inviting everybody and and you know I'm just praying God give me wisdom on how to take these services and and I learned as I was talking to brother Sean that this is really a big convention for them because it's the first time that they've had a place where they can gather all the message Believers in Punjab in that area they've never had a place or a facility where they can get any more than a couple hundred together at a time so they had invited all the other message Believers and all the other churches and they were planning on coming and they had testified to everybody in their neighborhood and all their friends and put Billboards and stuff everywhere and we're Gathering anybody that would come and and they expected to have quite a few denominational Believers there because the the Christian Community is such a minority in India I think it's only 2.3 percent of the population of India that whenever the Christians have an event they all come together they don't divide much on denominational barriers because they're a minority there's so few they do things together so they believe there'd be quite a few denominational Believers there and a lot of the message Believers so I mean everywhere we drove even in the next Village is over we saw Billboards and Banners and posters and I I said go on I started praying God help me you know I didn't want to disappoint anybody and also it was it was it was the first event that they were going to have on their new church property and it was like an introduction of the church to the community because it's on a main road coming into town they wanted everybody to know that they were a Christian Church where they were and they want to invite everybody to see it as an Outreach and as a witness to the whole area because he says there's not any Christian churches in that Village or some of the neighboring Villages and he believed some Christians would even gather and he could have a chance to testify and witness to them so it was a way to introduce the church to the whole community in the region and a way to gather all the Believers together in that area for the first time ever so it was a much bigger meeting than I thought and had more significance if some of you may remember that brother Jiva rotten and Marla booty he was here a couple years ago and stayed a little over a week with our family and he's there on the left and some of his boys traveled with him and they played some of the music for the meetings so it was good to see him he lives quite far away he lives in the southern part of India but he traveled up because we've stayed in contact and he wanted to have Fellowship so he came up for the meetings and then this brother to the left is brother Samuel bumbaca he he lives in Hyderabad he lives quite a distance away but he came in for the meetings and him and I got acquainted he has been through the covet era he started coordinating Zoom meetings for The Minister's meetings and they had asked me to do one of those meetings over zoom and I did and him and I got acquainted as he coordinated that so it was really good to get to meet him in person and shake his hand and have fellowship and we had some wonderful times of Fellowship brother Joe I didn't know it but he was in the front seat because he's got the longest legs they keep putting him in the front seat and uh so he got front row seats for an exciting ride everywhere he went but he shot a little video of of riding through the streets in India and just see if you can notice any traffic laws let me know if you or if you see what might be a violation of any write them down it's a um I'm glad I wasn't in the front seat because sometimes what I do is just close my eyes and pray that that we don't hit anybody but they're excellent drivers brother rashawn's oldest son henok which is Enoch for us but hanuk in in Punjabi he uh he just started learning to drive recently he was an excellent driver and he drove us everywhere we went and so we felt secure with him but I told him I said if you can drive here you can drive anywhere in America you come on over you you'll be fantastic I mean everybody takes turns before they pull out we stay in our lane I mean it's easy so you have to be a skilled driver to drive here but yeah there's there's many times when it gets to be quite oppressed and there's pedestrians and people on bikes I just close my eyes in the anxiety goes away you just see the conditions for um several of the days we were traveling for meetings we would travel an hour and a half upwards of close to two hours and this is the way to travel so it's not easy travel traveling is quite difficult the vehicles are a bit smaller and roads are rough and so traveling is is is quite a deal when brother Joe said in the traveling he meant the traveling it it's quite exhausting quite tiring but the people are wonderful and the fellowships we had were great this is the first church that we visited this little church was packed out this is brother a Jeep Messi's church and he brother Ajit was a Pentecostal Minister just several years ago I think like five years ago and they were witnessing to him he had a brother-in-law that came to the message that kept witnessing to him then he got in contact with brother Rashawn and they shared the message and after a while he comes to the message shared it with his whole church they baptized I believe about the whole church and this church was established I think if I remember correctly about five years ago and so we came here to minister and you can see part of the service okay [Music] again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] they really worship they really love the Lord they really love the word and really respond to the word and really worship but the music style is Eastern not Western it's totally different and for brother Joe and I I mean we couldn't even clap we didn't even know what to do we just we just listened because it was totally foreign to us something that was completely new but it was very interesting just to see and you think about the great worship services that we'll have on the region Beyond when everybody worships the way they Worship the Lord before it'll be wonderful to hear the Africans and the Indians and and the Americans all worship God so it was quite interesting you can see they had the building packed out this is us standing to read the scripture but these little guys to my right were really sitting like on my feet I mean we were packed in from as close as we could I was glad that I'm not an evangelist I don't need to move to preach I can stand still because there was no moving you would have stepped on somebody or trip and so it was packed in and it was it was it was a really good service really good atmosphere the next day we we traveled to brother Aaron George's and we had two Services there and this is the morning service and this is the evening service I had a nice Fellowship nice time there at the church great response to the word and they're so appreciative of the word and and they really respond well and they're really grateful I think this is the church where brother Joe and I probably had our picture taken about 1 000 times maybe one thousand and two hundred I don't know but somewhere in the excess of a thousand every family came up family by family we had pictures taken so I've learned just to stand and smile and not move so that's what I do I learned it a long time ago in the Philippines so it's it's a trait that works so you just stand there and and we had a good time but we got to shake hands with a lot of the Believers and meet a lot of the family so it was really nice the next day we traveled somewhere else you hear some Believers showing up in a truck a truckload of sisters coming to the meeting and the church here was too small to house everybody so they had a wrecked an attempt and had the services in the tent they were having special services and this is where we were this day this is brother butaram and so he also recently came to the message brought us church and he's got a dynamic Ministry he's he's witnessing to a lot of the Sikhs and the Hindus and having a lot of conversions a lot of testimonies of healing and Supernatural things that the Lord's doing as a sign to the unbelievers and bringing them in and so he's on fire I think he's been uh I think he received a message like three or four years ago and he's out evangelizing everywhere and he's doing a great job this is part of the service well that club wasn't that blood that was a creative blood cells God himself and now through that blood making propitiation for our sins is the believer takes all of his sins away from angels [Applause] Zoe the next day which was Sunday morning we had church at brother rashawn's this is where they're in the fellowship hall now they put a little covering over one half of it and then they they have the service in there you can see in all the churches the women sit on one side uh the brothers sit on the other side most of them sit on the floor they have a few chairs in the back and so it's it's really unique just things we're not used to and you go and see it and they worship they respond to the word and it's really wonderful brother Joe because he was a special guest gift getting pushed up to the front we know brother Joe likes to sit up close but this was really close this is closer than he's used to being and so he's a little uncomfortable up there but he was an honored guest and a special guest and he kept sitting up on the platform so it was nice I told everybody I brought the smallest guy in our church with me so I got a few few funny looks at that and then I told him he was My Bodyguard so they probably think we're the land of the anakins you know but but it was nice to have him there watching my back he could watch the crowd if anything happened he would have sprung into action I know it so here we are at the service brother Sean brother Rashaan uh translated for every service so we had eight Services while we were there and he translated for them all he's great to work with he's just such a Harmony and a unity and he does a fantastic job I told him I said if I say anything wrong just fix it up I said I'll never know but he said no brother somebody will tell on me so so we had a good time together here's their Sunday school class all their Sunday school kids gathered there together it was neat to see them I was glad we got a picture of that and here they are practicing for a song this was Sunday Tuesday was the convention Monday was a day off for us so I got a clip later of them singing their song so they were cute and uh this is this is brother Joe having his pre-breakfast drink they told us that coconut water this is a young fresh coconut coconut water is really good for the health so every morning they cut the top off of a coconut cut a hole in it put a straw in it and we drank a whole coconut so we're gonna water every morning and it was good I liked it but your belly kind of sloshed a little bit after that you got a full belly of coconut water but but it was healthy so we got a picture of Joe ready for church this is Tuesday morning and he's so put together and he looks so nice and he's ready to go to the convention and they went ahead of me and I came in later and when I came in the tent was blazing hot baking and Joe had no tie his sleeves were rolled up shirt was on collar unbuttoned and he was Fanning himself with some paper so he looked nice before church but when I got in there it was a different picture he was in full-blown survival mode although I got a kick out of that here's the front this is the same front of the church that we looked at before but they erected a tent uh the tent to the right is for shoes everybody check their shoes they don't wear shoes into their church and so I preached Barefoot all every time but one day one day they wanted me to keep my shoes on and I was like I like preaching Barefoot I thought they have a mat up there and it's comfortable and I think could we put a mat here and kick my shoes on and get comfortable and just stay all day you know but it was it was good so you can see the Billboards up there and they they chartered buses churches that were hours away charter buses whole congregations game whole message believing congregations came like I said it was the first time they've all in that region been able to gather together in one place at the same time so it was a real exciting event for them to have Services together to worship together have Fellowship together and you know I didn't realize this at the beginning but as they kept explaining more of it to us I began to realize what what a interesting and unique time this was for all the Believers that were there this is a song special [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] what's up [Applause] [Music] good day [Music] please [Music] [Applause] the name of it is [Music] amen so the kids song I could sing along with but it was nice because they really worship I mean whatever and that that song special with a young girl was singing that family was singing together brother Sean lean Dover started translating the words that that brother wrote that song He's a minister and he was with us a couple days earlier when we preached and I had preached a sermon on the tree of life and he wrote that song just after that sermon and that song is about there's two parts to the tree of life he and she male and female there's two parts to the tree of life he and me and those were all the words and the people were really responding to the song and really enjoying it and I had no idea what the song was about and he leaned over and tell me and it was a real blessing and the people were really worshiping because I was so unique I the music was so unique because it's instruments I've never heard before playing the way I've never heard I saw somebody get up to sing a special one time they looked back to the musicians and they said f sharp and I said I have never heard one of our musicians as long as they would ever say F sharp before I don't know if we normally play or singing that key but it was interesting for me so it was it was really neat to see him worship and and worship the way that they worship amen this is Brother bhutaram the church we were at that was Under the Tent he gave a testimony here in um in this testimony the the man standing next to him is part of his church a man that they prayed for that was healed and if you see in his hand he's holding an envelope and the envelope says MRI and CT scan on it and he's holding two scans in there one scan is where they found that he had a brain tumor and he'd went to three different hospitals and they all wanted to operate immediately they didn't want to treat it they wanted to operate on the brain tumor and and he didn't feel comfortable doing that and he wanted to pray so the church started praying and fasting together and asking God for an answer and the answer came through a sister who had a dream that he would be healed and sure enough the Lord completely delivered the man and they went back to the same doctor and got a second scan after some period of time and the scan showed he was completely clear no brain tumor so he came to the services with both scans in his hand so that was amazing to see and then he had a sister from his church stand up and she was standing there and he was sharing another testimony she had had a new liver disease and she had gotten jaundice really bad they went to the hospital and the doctor said there's nothing that we can do for you they sent her home to die and so she went back home and they started praying the whole congregation started praying together and she started recovering at home she got completely better she has no more problems no more symptoms and she's totally whole and she was standing testifying to the people that the Lord has healed her amen so this was a really good meeting and good testimonies because it was such a mixed audience there the majority of the crowd were message believers they were had gathered together for this convention but there was a still a good portion of people that were denominational Believers some seek some Hindus just people from the community that were there even the police came and sat and listened because they had registered with the local municipality the police came to make sure everything was in order they grabbed seats they sat they listened and I said praise the Lord it must be okay it must be fine so afterwards when we were fellowshipping and visiting one of the police officers came over towards me and and he kept taking out his phone and taking selfies with me and he said to me and take a selfie and get another pose have somebody take his his phone and take pictures of us together so I looked at brother Joe I said I don't think he's going to arrest me I think we're friends and Joe said yeah I think you're fine I think everything's okay now so we had a good time so it's such a mixed audience it was encouraging for the Believers but what a testimony of God's power and a living God that went out to that congregation they told me afterwards that they had over 2 000 people there and I'm a horrible judge of numbers I was thinking like half that or less and so they said they they served I think upwards of 2500 people in the morning because they served a meal after the morning service and a meal after the evening service and then after the evening service they served around 2 000 people so you can see it was quite quite a crowd and I was totally stunned when I when I was going over there and they told me that they were gonna have a convention I had no idea the scale I had no idea what was going to happen and I'm glad I didn't know until after I got there but the Lord absolutely supernaturally blessed us I didn't know what to preach I didn't know how to preach with a mixed audience like that you've got the majority of her message Believers some are denominational Believers some aren't Christian at all and it's like what do you say I mean what do you say and God just give me an inspiration it just dropped in and I just began to preach that inspiration and afterwards brother Roshan we were going to lunch brother Marla booty said brother Chad he goes I don't know what you're going to preach the next service because there's two services this day he said you preached the whole Bible you said you were from Genesis to Revelation I said I don't know brother I don't know and brother Rashawn said he said that was the perfect message to preach to Believers and to introduce for those who aren't Believers he said it was perfect and I had no idea what to preach I had no idea how to handle this situation I was really seeking God for answers and God just given inspiration and we went to the pulpit with it and God I mean God just took us from Genesis all the way to Revelation and it was just perfect and I said Thank You Lord uh so thankful and so happy what God did this is the kitchen where you fix food for 2 000 people you can see the size of the pots for the evening meal so that was a massive Endeavor and they did a fantastic job this is the first time they've ever put together a convention like this the first time they've ever hosted as many people and the brothers that did it outstanding job they coordinated and they planned everything and the Lord really blessed their efforts it was a real success here's the tent they set up on the other side of the property and this is how they fed the people they had them all line up and sit on the floor they all got a plate and the brothers came along and dished food out to everyone and got everybody fed in a convenient way and they fed everybody who was there they fed breakfast to some who had traveled a long distance and got there early they fed lunch to a really large crowd and suffered to a really large crowd and they did a fantastic job here's the evening service under the lights the tent was huge I asked them I said how many people can fit in this tent they said three it'll hold 3 000 people because when I looked out there I mean it looked like there was still room for other people and they said 3 000 people and they said they had over 2 000 there this is the where they served lunch and dinner to the ministers this is all the pastors and all the ministers that have gathered together from all the churches some of these ministers are denominational ministers most of them are message believing ministers but then we come to brother Victor this is a really interesting testimony and this is one that was really a highlight of the trip for me this brother is a denominational pastor and he lives about 30 kilometers from Brother rochon and we had a brother there that had traveled quite a distance and and he's a brother who's familiar with our church and by the way so many people send greetings I there's no way I could tell you how many and all their names but so many wanted us to greet the church and thank you for your stand in the word and for your support and they really have been blessed but he was one of those and he came and he wanted to be in Fellowship in the meetings he's a friend of brother rashons so we met him and we talked and he wanted to take us all out to dinner and there was a certain place he wanted to go but brother Rashawn said it's too far away and takes too much time we can't go and so they were trying to figure out where to go and they finally decided there's a place not too far away about 15 kilometers from brother rashawn's in the next city so we went there and we went to a KFC and so we went to a KFC in India and it was good I enjoyed it and so we went to the KFC and but it's it's like a little food court you go into the building and there's a couple different restaurants there's a Subway there's a KFC there's a couple things I couldn't pronounce and there was a few restaurants there so as we're walking in there's a large group of us walking in several ministers some other believers and their wives and this man pulls up on a motorcycle with him and his wife and his two sons and I noticed him when they pulled in because they went right past us and parked and we all went inside and brother Roshan and brother Jiva ratnam were outside talking just before they went in so we all went in and they were outside and he come walking up to them and he said later he told us he said he goes I just thought they look like pastors and he asked him he says are you pastors and they were shocked they said yeah we are pastors he said I'm a pastor and so they they greeted one another they introduced themselves they came inside and we all got acquainted with them they introduced them to all of us and we talked to him and he says I moved into the area four years ago to pastor this church and he said I haven't met one Christian Pastor in four years that I've had no fellowship and I've wanted fellowship and he said when I saw them brothers I just thought they were pastors and he says you could ask so many people you have a 99 chance of asking anyone are you a Christian Pastor they'd say no and he said I don't know how I knew I just knew and I asked and they were so they met they made contact they exchanged contact information and brother Rashaan invited him to the meetings and so well brother Rashawn and I were on the platform uh just before we went to the pulpit to preach in walk brother Victor and his wife and his two children to the meetings so we were so happy so we had the morning service we came back to the evening service and in the evening service they had moved him up to where all the ministers the ministers saddle to the left side of the platform and when I walked up to the platform he was the first one I saw so I I greeted him and he was really happy and smiling and so I could just see him just off the left corner of my eye and while I was preaching that second service while I was preaching I was preaching about the bride and the characteristics of the bride and she reflects uh the characteristics of Christ and I was going through all of that and this brother was having a good time in church I mean he was waving his hand he was getting excited and he was enjoying the service and so he was so excited after the service he came up to talk to us and he and he was saying he loved the word he said he loved the preaching and he was just really excited about everything that he had heard that day both services and then he began to share with us something else he said that day outside of KFC he said I wasn't going to go eat there because it's a little more expensive than what we wanted to spend we were going to go somewhere else and me and my wife taught and decided we were going to go to another place to eat he says I don't know why but I just had to come here and neither one of us wanted to come here it was more expensive we just had to come here and brother tan May wanted to take us all out to eat somewhere else but it was too far we couldn't go so we had to settle for coming here to eat and we both wound up here at the same time and that's where he met the first Christian pastors he's met in four years got contact information came to the meetings and then he told us this he said after I asked him if they were pastors when we walked into the building he said an audible voice spoke to me and said these are your friends and he went inside and he told his wife he had to go back outside and see who said that to him it was so loud and such an honorable voice and there was nobody and he said I believe it was God speaking to me tell me these are your friends so so I don't know what God's going to do with Victor but I was so blessed by that testimony and by his response to the word so pray for Victor brother Rashaan contacted him they made contact Victor and his wife and his children are going to come over and spend some time with brother Rashawn and his family sometime next week or within two weeks so just be praying for him I was so excited about this testimony and what God can do after the meetings we got together for a picture brother Joe and I brother Rasha and his wife and his three sons brother Hannah brother Titus and brother Moses so we really enjoyed their family their family was very sweet very precious very good to us and we really enjoyed our time in their home the last day that we ministered we left on Thursday but Wednesday we had a ministers meeting so this is The Minister's meetings at brother vikram's church and we traveled there as well and had the minister meeting I preached for the for The Minister's meeting and we got a picture afterwards of the brothers brother Rashawn told me that they were about 10 to 15 Brothers short because the brothers the day before were at the meetings until late at night traveled home and got home in the wee hours late hours and night wee hours in the morning and couldn't make it back but this is a normal monthly ministers meeting that they have with all these brothers plus an additional 10 or so more so it was a great opportunity to meet all the brothers like like I said even you probably can't tell but I have socked feet on it was great preached in my socks again we left all of our shoes outside and we all come out to get our shoes the people in the congregation had taken the shoes of all the ministers and Polished them all and I looked at my shoes they looked brand new I haven't polished my shoes since I bought them and so I I was really blessed by that and I was really thankful for that so if you look at my shoes today after church they look nice but it's not my doing the brothers there took care of us so that was the trip we thank you all for praying it was a busy time with a lot of services but we saw fruit you know it's always hard to leave home it's really hard for me to leave home it's hard to leave my family it's hard to leave the church and there's a lot of responsibilities a lot that I worry about and it's just hard to travel it's just really grueling our flights were brutal the times were brutal our bodies didn't react well to it it's really hard to travel hard to minister I had eight services and I was thinking if I stayed home it had only been three it's like what am I what am I doing and I could have slept in my bed and you know all the other things but I really felt God pulling us to go and when you go and you look back and you see fruit you see immediate fruit it makes it all so worth it then you realize that God was in it that pool was from God the results are God's but it's I'm so thankful he let us see some fruit while we were there because it was really very encouraging so we appreciate your prayers we thank God for all of you we're very glad to be home but I can say God was good and I know now why the devil attacked my tooth because there was something that God was going to do in that place and I was thankful to be part of it I mean let's all stand and read the scriptures I got a short thought that I'd like to share with you before we leave let's turn to Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3 and verse 8. Genesis 3 and 8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden Spar heads and pray just for a moment Lord Jesus we thank you that we had an opportunity to share such a good report with your children the things that you have done Lord You've Been So merciful and gracious now as we look into your word Lord we ask that you would open the word for us that you would feed us by your hand and give us Lord the food that we have need of for we've come to commune with you Lord and dine at your table and I pray that you would be blessed and all that's said and done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you all can have your seats again brother bear says in the message God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship he said God loves to fellowship with this creature in the Garden of Eden we are told that when a man walked in uprightness of God God come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with his children so we've talked about this many times before but God built Eden for himself God when he rearranged creation when he spoke his word he took chaos and put it into an order and he took chaos and brought it into Eden which means pleasure then he planted a garden Eastern and Eden and he placed a man there and he placed the man and his wife over it and he went to take his rest because he was so satisfied with his work that he had accomplished his desire and brother bam tells us that God was alone Adam was alone because God was alone and he dwelt with the cherubims and he dwelt with the angels but he had no Fellowship because no one there understood him and so he had created man and he would come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with man and God loved to fellowship with his creatures that he had created for his purpose and they were a fellowship of a father with his children and God loved that fellowship and it was his desire and his desire it was made manifest and it was was what God wanted and so I'd like to take for a subject if I could not servants but bride not a law but love not servants but bride not a law but love so God this was God's original desire and God didn't Institute a church he instituted Fellowship he didn't start with the law he didn't start with with codes and conducts all he started with was his word leave this alone it's not good for you everything else is fine leave this alone and so he established his word amen to keep the order of everything that had ordered and keep everything according to his desire and everything in Perfection all they had to do was keep the word of the Lord and we know that that there was a fall and we know God knew there was going to be a fall because there was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world there was names placed on a book from before the foundation of the world so God knew they would partake of the wrong tree so God knew that they would he had to make an allowance for that it all fit into his plan and we understand that's God's great plan so that he can reveal himself to his children to his attributes so that the fellowship can grow deeper through Revelation and understanding but but God's desire was to have Fellowship so he didn't start amen with with a book he didn't start with the law he didn't start with the church he didn't start with ceremony what he started with was a father and his children having Fellowship together it shows you what God desires amen God's not Desiring order and structure and form and all these things what God wants is fellowship with his attributes he wants to Fellowship what he could not find with the angels what he could not have when he dwelt alone with the cherubims and the angels he created man for fellowship and he wanted man he wanted to reveal himself to man so that man would understand God in an understanding and comprehending God he would now know God as a savior now no God as a Healer no God as a father the Angels knew him as the almighty God the creator of heavens and earth but they didn't understand him as Savior and healer and deliver provide her and all of these things but God was so much more than what the Angels could understand so he revealed himself amen even through the fall he revealed himself to his children so that that we would know God so that we could have fellowship with God because God loves fellowship and wanted Fellowship amen God has divided himself in the attributes so that he could Fellowship because the one that he was going to have Fellowship was within him because Adam was alone Adam wanted Fellowship but everything that was created and brought out of the Dust of the ground and presented to Adam to see whether there'd be a suitable help me not one was found there was nothing that he could fellowship with because none of the animals were like him or could understand him so there was no True Fellowship he could not find a suitable help me because his True Fellowship his help meet was within him was part of him and it would have to come out of him be expressed in a form and be United back to him and that would be Fellowship perfect Fellowship beautiful Fellowship amen and it would be amen it would be a display of the seventh seal God's great plan and God's Great desire was expressed in creation and now God was alone but he was alone with his thoughts with his attributes with his children amen and he was going to portion himself out because the fellowship he sought was within him he was going to bring him out into another expression and then unite it to himself again to have the fellowship that God desired so we see now that the fall broke that fellowship and God began to restore it through the shed blood of an innocent lamb now God came down and and shed the blood of a lamb to cover as a covering as a substitute for his Fallen children so that he can begin restoring fellowship and we know he went back to remaking the Masterpiece that had fallen and we go to Genesis chapter five let's look at Genesis chapter 5. in verse 21 Genesis 5 and 21 and Enoch lived 60 and five years and begotten Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begotten Methuselah 300 years and he got sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him and the Garden of Eden God would come down in the cool of the evening and walk with his children but that Fellowship was broken here we find Enoch VII from Adam and in the seventh dispensation of the Seventh Generation from Adam which is a type of the seventh Church age something is restored that was lost in Eden and now God once again is walking with one of his children he's walking with Enoch showing that in the seventh Church age there's going to be a restoration of Fellowship between God and man and man could walk with God again and now God is walking with Enoch and and Enoch was not for God took him it has turned to Hebrews chapter 11 and read about this in Hebrews 11. Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5. by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death it was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God look at the next verse but without faith is impossible to please him so how was it that Enoch had this testimony that he pleased God how could he walk with God how could God take him because he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please God and We Know by the message that faith is a revelation so Enoch had a revelation and that Revelation was how he pleased God and what was Enoch's Revelation Enoch had the revelation of the whole Bible because Enoch built the Pyramid and the pyramid is the second Bible so the first Bible is written in the stars the second's written in the pyramid and and he knew the revelation of the word and he knew that the Capstone must be a hidden Mystery and he didn't put it on Amen because Enoch knew the plan of God Enoch had Revelation on the word and by faith he pleased God because God had given him a revelation and he was walking in his Revelation and he had this testimony that before God took him that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please God you can't please God by works you can't please God by deed it's without faith it's impossible to please God how do you please God by faith and faith is a revelation what's a revelation based off it's based off the word of God Amen and Enoch had that Revelation and that Revelation to me is what put him in close contact with God God had revealed himself to Enon and Enoch was walking with God Enoch had the mystery had the revelation of the word what do we have in this day we have the revelation of the word amen and the hidden Mystery has been revealed in this day and what does that do amen it puts us in a place where by faith we can please God and we can walk like Enoch walk we can walk again with God because we walk by Revelation because God desired to reveal himself to his children so that he could have fellowship with his children now God is known by his creation known by his children brother bam said in the God of this evil age he said the word was from the beginning God's plan but God revealed by Revelation the very thing that he Vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of God so what was God's plan from the beginning revelation of the word that's what that's what Abel did to please God Abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice what was his faith he caught the revelation of what happened in the garden and why God had slain a lamb in the garden and he knew it was blood was the problem and now he offered blood as the substitute he what was it it was an expression of his faith which was based on a revelation because faith is a revelation of the word of God and now Abel's sacrifice was accepted and he could commune with God Keynes was rejected because Cain had no Revelation no understanding of God he had his own understanding and that brought a separation but Revelation brought a Unity and Able by faith offered a more excellent sacrificed and came let's look at James chapter 2. as we go down through time God then would call Abraham and I want to look at the designation of Abraham Enoch we were never told of what Enoch did to please God Abel it looks like Abel please go on by making a sacrifice but according to the word he pleased God by having faith because his faith is what produced his sacrifice it wasn't the sacrifice it was the faith behind the sacrifice that pleased God it was the revelation of the word that pleased God in Revelation I'm sorry James chapter 2. James chapter 2 verse 22. it says seeth Thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed to have imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God Abraham believed God what did he believe it didn't say Abraham believed in God most of the world believed in God but Abraham believed God Amen what was it he pleased God by faith he believed God he believed what God told him he believed what God Said the Revelation for his day he received it from the Lord and he believed it and he acted upon it and he pleased the Lord and the Lord said it was imputed unto him for righteousness what the fact that he believed the word of God not his deeds his deeds were an outcropping of his faith Deeds without faith are not salvation but Faith produces the Deeds God's not looking for Works God's looking for Faith but your faith is Manifest in your Works your Works manifest your faith so there's been a confusion in religion and Christianity all down through even Judaism all the way down through there's been a confusion that I can please God by Deeds Deeds don't please God faith pleases God without faith it's impossible to please God the Deeds we do brother Benham said are our love back to him amen his Revelation to us is his love to us his expression to us our works are our love back to him but that's not how we gain acceptance any more than how Abel gained acceptance Cain worked harder than Abel and what did Abel do Abel believed God Amen he caught the revelation of the hour and he acted upon the Revelation and he was accepted his sacrifice was accepted he was brought into communion with God Amen and he pleased God Kane worked harder did more Deeds but his deeds were not accepted not because they weren't good deeds not because he didn't work hard not because he wasn't sincere but he had no revelation so by faith and without faith it's impossible to please God it wasn't what Abraham did it's what Abraham believed he believed God and it was imputed or placed upon him for righteousness he was declared righteous because he believed God and then was called the friend of God God we never think about God wanting a friend God is the one who called Abraham his friend Abraham didn't call God his friend Abraham didn't say God's my friend no it was God who called Abraham his friend showing that God wanted Abraham for a friend because God is interested in the relationship not just the D's not the acts not the ceremony not the ritual but God is looking for Fellowship amen somebody that loves them somebody that he can express himself to that will receive that expression that's what God wanted from the beginning if we could turn to Isaiah I'd like to read this in Isaiah what God says about Abraham the word of God is so rich and so perfect I you would never think about God wanting a friend we think God wants servants but he had servants and angels and then God want to worship but he had worship and angels He had servants he had worship he had he was glorified he had all of that with the Angelic host and that realm and of angels he wanted something more than just to be worshiped he wanted something more than to be served he wanted a relationship and the first relationship he expressed with his creation was that of a father and his children and brother Branham would dramatize it he said come down in the cool of the evening and he says children have you enjoyed the creation that I made for you today he was enjoying the fellowship he was sharing with his attributes and they were sharing back with him as they would Express back to him all that they saw and all they experienced and God loved it strong I'm so glad the prophet of God Amen could catch these glimpses and dramatize these things to break us away from traditional thinking and break us away from ritualistic thinking and religious Notions and bring us back to what God wanted from the beginning amen because what he wanted at the beginning is what he will have at the end and what he wants out of his bride amen is not strict conformance to an ordinance he wants somebody that loves him for who he is that can catch who he is by Revelation and they can come into communion Isaiah 41 and 8. I say 41-8 but thou Israel are my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend I would love to see a scripture written like that with my name attached to it with God speaking through Isaiah saying Jacob's my servant the Seed of Abraham my friend what did Abraham do to deserve this friendship that Abraham find God or did God find Abraham did Abraham uh revealed the word to himself or did God reveal the word to Abraham it was God revealing to Abraham Abraham believed God it was imputed unto them righteousness for righteousness and he was called the friend of God who called him the friend of God God called him his friend he said Abraham's my friend you know so many people I remember in school everybody wanted to have friends you know everybody wants to have the most friends and be the most popular and you call all kinds of people your friend but they're not your friend unless they call your friend back you can claim a thousand friends Abraham could say God's my friend but What mattered the most was God said Abraham's my friend praise be to God let's go to Exodus 19. Exodus 19. we know that God kept his promise to Abraham and delivered his children out of Egypt and God was bringing the children of Israel to himself because he wanted to unite with them he was going to marry them he was giving them in Exodus 19 he's given them the proposal of a covenant that if they will join into this Covenant he will become one with them and in Exodus 19 Verse 3 it says and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself so it wasn't the nation of Israel seeking after God God went and got them and bore them On Eagle's Wings the wings of a prophet a prophetic Ministry and he said I brought you to myself this was all God's doing I went to fetch you and redeem you and I sent Moses and I brought you to myself and he says I brought you into myself verse five now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation these are the words which thou shall speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and called for the Elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded them and all the people answered together and said all that the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord God had fetched them to himself he had gathered the children the seed of his friend Abraham the natural seed of his friend Abraham and he went and redeemed them and he brought them to himself and he brought them to Sinai and there on Sinai he's making a proposal to them he said if you will if you will heed to my voice and keep my Commandments you will be a peculiar treasure to me above all the peoples of the earth and you will be a a kingdom a nation of priests and they said we'll do it so Moses brings the proposal from the groom down to the to the bride to the people they agree and he takes their answer back to the Lord and the Lord says now now set up and prepare prepare yourselves for after three days I'm coming down to speak to the people and and they make preparation and he said after three days I'll speak to the people and when they hear the trumpet sound long amen have them come up to me into the mountain and we know that that God did exactly what he said he would do but the sight was so fearful so terrifying the mountain quaked and it was on fire and it was so terrifying that Moses said he exceedingly trembled and quaked and when God sounded out the trumpet blast and the trumpet blast was when he gave the Ten Commandments that was his Covenant with Israel and you pick it up in Deuteronomy chapter 5 and it said he spoke this and added none there unto there was going to be no other law there was going to be no book of ordinance this was the Covenant you keep this Covenant with me you'll be my people I'll be your God we'll be connected together and you'll be a nation of priests and when he told them is when they heard his voice when he sounded out the Ten Commandments and blasted it forth in the long blast they were to come up to him unto the mountain and when the trumpet sounded long and it blasted and the voice of God spoke Moses LED them out of the camp to go to the mountain and they all ran the other way they ran far away they ran away from the voice of God they ran away from the presence of the God because it was too terrifying amen and this is when they broke the Covenant and they said to Moses you go up we have heard the voice of God we cannot bear it anymore unless we die you go up and whatever he tells you will do originally God only had this Covenant these Ten Commandments to give to Israel and and the Bible says and he added none there too that was it that was the original but they couldn't bear the voice of the Lord in the presence of God it was so mighty and so powerful and we know this was all according to God's plan everything worked out so he could display himself that's why he came down in such a fashion amen but they ran away breaking the Covenant asking a man to go stand between them and God when God said come to me and now they asked a man to go stand in between and asked the man to get Commandments and you get Commandments and then we'll keep the Commandments and God says they spoke well that's what we'll do and then God gave a law a book of law a book of ordinances that he wasn't originally going to add to the Covenant and now Israel when they were going to be a peculiar people they were going to be a nation of priests they now had to establish the priesthood and Temple Worship in the Tabernacle and ordinances and laws and God put gave them exactly what they asked for they said you give you go get the Commandments we'll keep the Commandments and God was going to prove to them that you can't keep the Commandments you can't be holy you can't do it yourself you can't do without me at the end of this you'll know that you need me and that was the whole purpose of the law and and God gave him exactly what they asked for so that they could find out that there was no righteousness no ability to be righteous in themselves they did not have the ability to keep all the law because they were corrupt amen and God wants his people to come to his voice to obey his voice and come to him and not send somebody in between and not ask for a book of ordinances or laws but just to come to his voice that's what God wants and so for hundreds and hundreds of years a thousands of years they they worship God by the book of ordinances by the law and Moses gave them the law they said they would keep it and no one was able to keep it all and now they became servants they were going to be as peculiar people but now because they said we'll obey the Commandments he gave the book of ordinances and now they became a nation of servants where Abraham was their friend was God's friend now they become God's servants and let's look at Romans chapter 3 together I want to look at a couple scriptures here in the New Testament Romans chapter 3 verse 19. Romans 19 or sorry Romans 3 19 chapter 3 verse 19. now we know that what thinks over the law saith that saith in them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God so why did God give a law he gave a law to make every mouth be silent be stopped and every person become guilty he wasn't going to require this in the beginning if they would have just come to his voice but they asked for it and he gave it to him and it was a lesson that had to be learned this was something that God had to do to display himself verse 20 therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his side for by the law is the knowledge of sin let's go to Galatians chapter 3. Galatians chapter 3. verse 21. okay Galatians 3 21 is the law then against the promise of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the Promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe but before Faith came we were kept under law shot up into the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a Schoolmaster fear all the children of God by faith in Jesus in Christ Jesus for as many of you have been baptized unto Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you're all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so how are you Christ by faith how are you righteous by faith not by the Deeds of the law but by faith righteousness is imputed unto you the same way it was Abraham and so God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he paid the penalty of sin he fulfilled the law he kept he kept every jot and Tittle fulfilling the whole law of God and now God was opening the way of Grace once again and what was it going to require it was going to require believing God Amen if you believe God Amen that's faith and without faith is impossible to please God keeping the law alone was not pleasing to God Amen but keeping it according to faith in God was pleasing to God so the law was a school Master to teach us that we had to have Christ that we could not do it there was no righteousness obtained by the law by keeping the law itself life could not come by just the law it came by faith all the way through it's been by faith let's look at what Jesus says in Mark chapter 12. mark 12. in verse 29. Mark chapter 12 29 and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these so he was asked by one of the scribes what was the uh the the first commandment of all and he says the first commandment of all is the Lord our God is one Lord and you shall love him this is the Commandment of God to know that the Lord is one and you shall love him with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength that's the greatest commandment is to know God and to love him the second is likened to the verse or similar to the verse to love your neighbor as yourself and Jesus says there is none other commandment greater than these let's look at Romans 13. it's going to tell us the same thing the Apostle Paul will write here in Romans chapter 13. Romans 13 and verse 8. it says oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law they couldn't keep the law but he says now if you love one another you fulfill the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not coven if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no will to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law no law but love brother bear says we have no law but love no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible over and over he says we have no law but love because the law is fulfilled in this that you love your neighbor as yourself the first commandment is know the Lord God as one Lord and that you should love him with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with all your strength and the second one likened to the first one is love your neighbor as yourself by this all the law is fulfilled in this God didn't need to give them all the ordinances of Commandments he only proved in them they couldn't keep it what they needed was the love of God Amen and then you could fulfill all the Commandments foreign look at Romans chapter 5. Romans chapter 5 verse 1. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith and to his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation work is patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God the love of God which is the Fulfillment of all the law the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us by being born again and United with Christ by being baptized by spiritual baptism the Holy Ghost into Christ the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts and that's the love of God that is the Fulfillment of all the law because God's not interested in ordinances God's not interested in rituals not gone interested in getting everybody to line up to the queue what he wants is he wants a people who are like him and God is love amen and the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so that now we don't need all the ordinances what we need is the love of God should have brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so that we can act like God and so fulfill the law it's it's it's not it's not religion but it says it's not an altar it's not religion it's not a sacrifice it's not being sincere but it's the revelation of the word and he is the word amen it's the revelation of God which brings us back into Union with almighty God and God is love and his love has done all of his works and his love has declared the law and the Fulfillment of the law is found in the love of God so there's not ordinances that he wants it's not a Commandment that keeps us rigidly in line but is the love of God should have brought in our hearts that keeps us in line not a rigid adherence to a commandment but a desire of the heart to please God and the Very nature of Jesus Christ Living in us bringing us lining up to the word amen not even maybe knowing what the Commandment is but having the nature of the Commandment Giver on the inside when the love of God shall have brought in our hearts brings our attitude brings our conduct brings our nature in line with God's love and we are fulfilling all the law without having to understand a strict ordinance of the law people love religion people love ordinances people love real books it's not sometimes people get so fixated on something and you realize why is somebody so fixated on this it's because when you really dig down deep you'll find out that's what's happening is they're basing they're basing an acceptance by God on an ability to do everything right so the it's human nature everybody wants to know just tell me what to do it's like give me all the rules and if I keep all the rules I'm fine that's what I want to know and it's not about keeping all the rules it's about believing God it's about accepting him in this day and letting his nature become part of your nature and fulfilling the law not by a book of ordinances but by the law of love amen by the very nature of Christ on the inside bringing us back into fellowship with God who is love you can't get back to fellowship with God Amen by by keeping ordinances because you can keep ordinances without faith and without faith it's impossible to please God you can say no the women do not cut their hair you wear this kind of clothing you come to church every time the doors are open you you read so much a day you pray so much a day you do all of these things and you'll be accepted by God none of those things equal acceptance by God what equals acceptance by God is faith in God who is the word who is the person of love so you can see the tendency is always to the law that's human nature but God didn't want God didn't initially establish a church he didn't initially establish rules he had one rule don't touch that tree and fellowship with me and God has brought us back into fellowship with him by what by the revelation of the word by the revelation of Jesus Christ God has revealed the mystery that was in the back part of his mind and that mystery was that the heart purpose of God the Eternal purpose of God was to have a bride of his own choosing because he wanted more than servants he wanted Fellowship I did not marry my wife so she could wash my clothes I could pay somebody to wash my clothes I didn't marry my wife to keep a house or to help me raise children I married my wife for Fellowship for companionship for love God is Not Looking for servants he's looking for a bride he's not looking for uh minions to do all of his bidding he's looking for a bride who will love him for who he is who will understand him will catch the revelation of the mystery and come into Union with him and give him the fellowship that he loves that's what he's doing that's what this day is all about that's what the message is about that's what the mystery being revealed is about to bring us back into this Union with God Amen to bring us out of religion bring us out of denominationalism bring us beyond the ordinances in the Creeds and bring us beyond all of that and bring us back to a revelation of God as the Creator who loves me and I love him back not now I never married my wife to do the dishes to clean the house to help me but because she loves me she does all of those things anyways and she serves me but she is not my servant she serves me Faithfully and listen she serves me Faithfully with no pay there's no paycheck there's no salary there's no benefits the only bond is love we didn't sign a contract you do so much you get so much it's all based on love and you can never find a more faithful servant than my life but it is not on a contract basis it's not on a rule basis it's not on instruction the whole the whole basis of the relationship is love and she serves me but she is not my servant and the Bride of Jesus Christ serves Christ with her whole heart and is obedient to everything that God wants not as servants not under a contract basis not to get acceptance but by the law of love amen it the the Daniel says the Ancient of Days did ministered unto him and brother Birmingham said who ministers unto the unto the uh King but the queen who ministers unto the bridegroom but the bride he said this is the bride and she ministers to the king she serves the king but she is not his servant Israel was their servant because they took a law in a rule book an ordinances to please God they became servants the bride's not his servant but the bride serves him it's our pleasure to serve him but it's the law of love we don't serve him for acceptance we don't serve him because of fear of refusal em we love him because he first loved us and when he revealed the great mystery in his mind he revealed how much he loved us and in turn it it brought a response a reciprocating love for him and this love brings us Beyond so many orders let's look at John 15. John chapter 15. in verse 13. greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you Jesus speaking to his disciples and say I henceforth call you no more servants what changed them from servants to friends revelation read it again henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth the servant just obeys but he doesn't know the mind of the master he doesn't know all things that his master does the servant just keeps the ordinance the servant just keeps the rule and the servant finds acceptance by obedience the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you what changed the relationship from servant to friends because the friend is revealing himself to a friend and he says because I have revealed to you everything that I've heard of my father I won't call you servants anymore but I'll call you friends because now we're in Intimate relationship by revelation and if he could look at his disciples and say I call you no more servants but now I call you friends amen what would he say to his bride at the end time when he is given he's opened the book and loosed to seals and revealed the secret that was in the back part of his mind amen She's Come Beyond friendship into marriage praise God let's look at second second Corinthians 11. second Corinthians 11. and verse 2. second Corinthians 11 and 2 for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I Fearless by any means as the servant be God Eve through septility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ God had taken him from servants to to friends and Paul is wanting to espouse them into Christ Paul is trying to bring them into a marriage because the relationship is growing closer and closer and brother Branham says in the message titled love from 1956 that I think love is the greatest Force there is in the world there's nothing more powerful than love if I had the choice tonight and was a sinner and was standing here before God and he said now boy I'm going to give you all nine spiritual gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give you the spirit of Prophecy I'm going to make you a mighty preacher give you the word of wisdom and understanding I'm going to give you the gift to speak in tongues and to interpret I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have a great faith for the sick and I'm going to do all these things for you I'll give you all that or I won't let you have any of those things but I'll let you have real love in your heart I say God give me love that's right for where there is tongues they shall cease where there's prophecies that will fail where there's knowledge it will vanish but where there is love it will endure forever that's what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the Earth it was what was his love we had an option for any gift in the world and we could become so popular or so powerful by all these gifts brother Branham said he would refuse them all and take love because God is love in Christ is the mystery of God revealed Prophet says but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now on the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her how is Christ making love to his bride how's he expressing his love to her by Whispering secrets to her what Secrets the secret that was hidden under the seals The Secret of his great plan the secret of his threefold purpose his secret was that he would get back to Union with man again and go back to the fellowship they had in the Garden of Eden that's his great secret and how is he expressing Love To Us by Whispering that secret to us the Revelation that he gave to disciples moved him from servants to friends now the Revelation that was in the back part of his mind is the love secrets that he's making love to his bride with and drawing her to his side in the Feast of trumpets he says how can two walk together lest they be agreed Jesus was walking with his children in the Garden of Eden but then they broke the word but then Enoch come to a revelation of the word and once again he was walking with God how can two walk together unless they be agreed if Enoch's Revelation didn't agree with God God couldn't walk with Enoch but Enoch could walk with God because unless to be agreed how can they walk together so Enoch's Revelation was in agreement with God and they walked together how can two walk together lest they be agreed they can't Jesus said they can't and how can a church the Methodist and Baptists walk together how can the Church of Christ walk with the Presbyterians how can the Catholic walk with the Protestant how can the Protestant walk with Protestant but the bride can walk with the word which is Christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word and who is the person of the word Jesus Christ and who are we walking with in this day we're walking with the person of the word and how can two walk together unless they be agreed it's the revelation of the word that we received that bring us back in contact with Christ and once again man can walk with God by walking with the word there has to be an agreement between you and the word the word in you and the word the person of the word and the word dwelling in you has got to come in harmony by the Revelation and once again man is walking with in his people amen coming back to Union back to fellowship look at Zechariah 14 I want to read just two scriptures and we'll close Zechariah 14. and verse 6. and now shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it should be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but I shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light we all know the scripture because brother Brandon preached it so well that there shall be light in the evening time this is the evening time and this is the light that has come behold the light has come and the light is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's bringing us back into that Fellowship let's go to first John first John 1 and 7. but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin where is he in the light we have to walk in the light as he is in the light but in the evening time it shall be light again it's light again friends he's here and we can walk in the light as he is in the light if he's in the light and we walk in the light we're once again walking with him come back into Union come back into fellowship and now I mean the prophet of God didn't come to bring us a church order he didn't come to bring us a rule book he came to bring a revelation that you would Knight the two back together and now we are not his servants but we serve him Faithfully now everything I know he wants it's my pleasure to give I my desire is to be pleasing to him but I can't be pleasing without a revelation without faith I can't just be copying my neighbor's works it can't just be I don't cut my hair I don't smoke or drink I I go to church I I confess I believe the message it's got to be more than that it's got to be a genuine Revelation that has brought you into Union with the person of the word and then the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and now it's not I'm it's not compulsory for me to keep the message it's not a mandate for me to keep the message I can go to the bank of the river and fish every day of my life and be just as safe but there's nothing in me that wants to do that what I want to do is serve him who loved me so much I want to love him back and if he says this is the way that's pleasing to me everything in me by revelation of who I am and who he is and what he's done for me has brought a desire into me to serve him and to minister unto him with everything that's in me and it's not compulsory it's not because I have to to make it to Heaven it's not I I I by Revelation I've received a revelation that I am a sieging of God my name was on the book before the foundation of the world it was laying on the marriage certificate under those seals since before the foundation of the world that I can no more be lost and God can be lost I'm not worried about losing my salvation I'm not worried about being a Castaway I'm not worried about not making the Rapture what I'm worried about is giving to him my full service and my full heart and serving him because I love him because of what he's done for me not jumping through a hoop to make it somewhere I made it before the foundation of the world not trying to attain to something it was attained for me not trying to be good enough look good enough act good enough none of that is any motivation amen all of that I would say is the wrong motivation and if that is any motivation left in us at all to look good at good attain to something be something to climb some ladder to get into good graces with God we need to go back to God and say God I need a revelation from you I need that understanding that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was part of you before the foundation of the world I'm one of those C Gene attributes it's impossible for me to be cast away because I don't want to serve you out of fear I don't want to serve you compulsory because I have to I want to serve you out of love I want to be a faithful bride I want to be one of those thousands times thousands that come to minister unto you I I want to give you my whole life because I want to give you my whole life I want to give you my thoughts my desires my time my attention I want to give you that not to earn something but I want to give it to you because I want to give it to you not because somebody makes me feel guilty or ashamed not because somebody preaches fear into me and makes me feel like if I'm not good enough I better get good enough and if I'm not doing right I better do right amen not not any of that I want to be a motivation for me but I want to see how beautiful he is and how much he loved me and I want the love of God not a human love I want the love of God to be shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Ghost so that I can love him with all my heart with all my soul with all my might with all my strength and I can love my neighbor as myself and I in doing so can keep the whole law not by reading a checklist and checking but by his life shed abroad in my heart and that I become a love slave to him uh Paul was a prisoner of Jesus Christ and he was bound by chains of love God didn't change him Paul chained himself to Christ what was the bonds that held him so tight it wasn't because it was compulsory amen it was because Paul loved Christ and it was the strongest bond there was the bond the bond that's the strongest is the bond of love not because we have to but because we want to and it's not like somebody can make me afraid you know you're not doing this you're not lining up here you need to line up here here and here listen everything in me wants to line to the word and if I find that there's some place in me not I want to repent and I want to lie to that word because I love him because I want to serve him and I want to please him and I by faith know who he is and I by faith know who I am and it motivates me to be pleasing to him but I don't want to be pushed coerced threatened I want somebody to preach the great Revelation and love of God I want somebody to preach the great threefold purpose of God because that's what unlocks the mystery somebody to preach the real message at the end time what is the message the message is that God's heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to have a bride of his own choosing and he has worked all of this time to bring back his plan and unfold it until he can get to a place where he has a bride Amen in that bride under the revelation of the word can be broken out of denominationalism can be broken out of religion and broken free from all of those holes that hold her back and the Holy Ghost can be freed from all the chains of denominationalism and the two can come back together as one that's what this message came to do and you'll never get there by rule keeping you'll only get there by the revelation of who he is and who you are in him and if you ever come to that place then nobody has to force you into anything if you ever come to that place nobody has to threaten you nobody has to make you feel ashamed or guilty all they have to do is show you the word and if you've come to that place you'll come to the word because the word is your mate the word is your bridegroom the word is the love of your life and we will always line to the word it's not that we get everything right it's not that we know everything yet there's many times as we mature and we grow and we understand more and we begin to understand that what I was doing wasn't pleasing the Lord this is what the prophet thought this is his desire and everything in us gravitates and moves to the word of God Amen we haven't arrived we haven't attained we're constantly moving to be more pleasing to him by love it's not like nobody ever has to tell us anything again it's not like we'll never be corrected for the pulpit again but not threatened amen not not not made ashamed in the Conformity but somebody will just show you this is what God likes and all of those have been United to Christ will say if that's what he likes that's what I like to do if that's what he wants that's what I want to because I have a great desire I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and I want to be Shackled by chains of love not by force not by peer pressure not by group conformity but by love it's the only thing that'll hold everything else will fade away everything else will fall subservient to the power of love and that's what I want to be my motivation that's what is my motivation and that's the way I want to preach the message that's my greatest desire it's not that we won't ever hold the word up again and say this is the word this is the standard this is God's desire it's not there'll never be another correction there'll be loads of Correction because we've not yet attained to everything we're looking for but oh God help us to move by revelation oh God help us to love you because you first loved us and help us God to Shackle ourselves to you by chains of love that's what he had in Eden that's what he once again not looking for servants but looking for a bride looking for a wife those that will minister to him and loving I say that'd be the greatest privilege of my life to be that to my Lord to serve him with everything that's in me not as a servant but as a wife but more faithful than any servant would ever be because of love man let's all stand God is wonderful and I love him with all of my heart he's done so much for me musicians if you'll come if we think about the great Revelation that's gone forth in this day it's overwhelming friends it's overwhelming the thoughts that he had of you before the foundation of the world the desire that he had to you to be United with you in the desire that motivated and moved him to topple governments to change the course of history to move things on a global scale why it was his desire to you that has moved him all down through time it is desire for you that has hunted you out wherever you were in the world and brought the Revelation to you it was God hunting you out like he hunted out Abraham like he hunted out everyone else and God brought the Revelation to you and placed a seed within you to be able to receive that revelation oh what gratitude are in our hearts for a God that loves us that much let the love of God be shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and let that love for him and love for our neighbor be the Fulfillment of all the law and let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus I love you so much I thank you Father for your goodness Lord God you have been so good to us you have loved us with an everlasting love you've looked down through time and watched over us bringing us through Lord the generations watched over grandparents and parents and all of these things that bring us to the place we are God you're so good your mercy is Grace is so overwhelming to us God it makes us love you more I pray God that you would forgive us Lord for every wrong notion and wrong idea help us God to break away from the traditional thinking of humanity help us to move away from religious ideas and Concepts and help us God to come back to what you desire to be pleasing to you by Revelation in your word God help us Lord to surrender more than we've ever surrendered before and give you first place like never before for that's our desire gone we know that your desire to restore that Fellowship that was lost God you've done everything on your part you've made every way possible you've opened every channel and you've invited us to walk into this tremendous revelation and God we do so with joy knowing that you've accepted Us in the Beloved that you paid the price of redemption that you paid it in your mind before the foundation of the world and you brought us to this realization because you want us because you want our fellowship you want our companionship you want us God that makes me more than anything Want To Worship You from the depths of my soul makes me want to cry out to you in love and rejoice in your goodness and thank you God For Eternity for your great grace love you gone I ask
