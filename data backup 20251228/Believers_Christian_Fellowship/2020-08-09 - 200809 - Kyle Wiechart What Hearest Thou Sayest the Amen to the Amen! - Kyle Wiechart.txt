[Music] and i want you more than [Applause] me [Music] desire [Music] amen god bless you all i enjoyed singing without a mask on i just wanted to take the opportunity to do that since you all can't so i really happy to be here and he may be seated for just a second just talk to you for a second here and um had a really nice time up at the ministers meeting over the weekend and uh just wanted to express my my thankfulness to brother dan who would arrange it and the brothers that came and attended it was it was really good so you'll have to nod for me because everybody behind that just kind of throwing me for a loop i guess the good thing is i can't see you frown if i say something wrong um but yeah so it just had a really nice time and i really appreciated the brothers that came it was just such a nice atmosphere of the brothers that came and it was a really a great opportunity i i thought to just be able to get together and just talk about the things of god and it was quite an interesting situation with brother chad being asked to speak no doubt and i can see the hand of god in it for as well you know but you know like he said he would have been quite burdened and nervous coming but now i'm bearing the burden of my brother but that's scriptural we're supposed to bear one another's burdens and i want to be found faithful to bear the burden of my brother and so here we are today i'm bearing the burden but i just was up praying and you all know me enough by now i have nothing to put on for anybody so i just tell you how i come to these things i don't like to preach like i really don't like to stand here it's a scary thing always scares me always bothers me i literally was up till past midnight last night couldn't sleep all night up at three praying this morning not because there isn't a lot of word like we have a lot of word and anybody with an education could take some scriptures and take some quotes and put it together and put together a pretty great subject matter that we all would would love right but it's that burden you have to catch the mind of god and the spirit of god and just say what he wants you to say and then to say no more and that's i'm learning that i think we all have to learn that by obedience to just say what he said and then be quiet when he doesn't want you to say anything more so i was up praying you know and seeking the lord and i'm like well you know i'm kind of i go by inspiration a lot of times and i wait and i wait and i wait and nothing's coming to me like i'm like lord this is torture this is absolutely tor it's midnight and i'm like i have no idea what i'm ministering on no idea i know some people think wow you're crazy you're talking crazy certainly you have something like no i have nothing i have no thoughts you have thoughts but you don't know what is his his will in the whole thing right and then i got to looking at my subject matter and i told brother chad i said maybe it's because the subject matter i'm going into i'm waiting for god to move upon me i'm waiting for something i'm waiting for a mighty rushing wind i'm waiting for a fire i'm waiting for a thunder to say this is my will walk you in it go tell them this you know and it's not happening that way it's just real calm you know i just had a little thought and that little thought i just said well i'll just bring that and if that's the still small voice speaking then that's just what i want to say is just what he wants us to say because we don't want to be found doing anything other than what his will is and his will is his word as well as his word so i trust that this little thought for you will be okay you all love me right okay so you have no choice then no matter what and how bad i i blow it you're going to love me either way and you're going to put your arm around me and say i love you and that's what we do as christians right look beyond the faults and mistakes of a man and his insecurities and his failures and say i love that that that little attribute of god that manifests in you so why don't you stand and if you will turn in your bibles to first corinthians chapters 2. so having been one with a mask in church i do know that you yawn a lot for lack of oxygen i am sympathetic to that and i can't see it so it's okay but if you pitch over i will call you out it's just the reality of it i know i sit back and i'm like i'm glad brother chad can't see how many times i'm yawning right now it's not because i'm i'm just lack of oxygen you're about to pass out sometimes you feel so don't pass out stay awake stay alert okay and i can't hear you so you'll have to say amen a little louder right say if you agree with it take a hold of it right we don't just let it pass by we say hey that's mine i'm taking a hold of it we don't want to just be a hero not a doer of the word we want to take it make it ours right so we want to participate in these things first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god and if you also turn to first kings 19 9. first kings 19 9. just stay amen when you're there okay i can't hear you that's good and he came this unto a cave and he lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and he went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah if you will just bow your heads for word of prayer most gracious heavenly father lord we just come before you lord lord humbly lord we come before your throne lord of mercy this morning and lord we ask lord that you would do that which we cannot do in another cell father that you would take the word lord and break it and give it to us father lord god we are a needy people and lord we're learning as we're going lord is lord you learned obedience to the things that you suffered father god so are we and i just pray lord you take the little burden and thought that's in my heart lord and that you could bring it to your people that it would bless them and help them lord i know my insufficiency and i know my dependence it's a complete dependence so father god i just pray lord that you would take this vessel lord shut my mouth to any of my own thoughts and let me just speak which you would once said and father god may you help the people that are before me lord your most precious people father lord that they could receive the things that you want to say to them lord that it could set them free that it could call them up higher that it would reveal to them the spiritual realities of their sonship father and lord i just pray lord that you would be glorified in everything that's said and done lord in our midst today we love you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so a little title it's a strange title what here is thou sayest the amen to the amen what herestyle says the amen to the amen and a part of this is coming from a personal experience for me myself i'm i'm a man of no reputation so i never make myself as a reputation of being someone that gets it right all the time i don't i'm a far cry from somebody that gets it right all the time but i do see the hand of god and the grace of god in my life to correct me and that gives me a comfort because this rod and staff are a comfort to us and there's not one of us here that hasn't experienced the difficulties i think of this mask thing right and the difficulties of the whole cove thing and the whole thing that's like hey why are we becoming subjected to things that we don't need to come subjected to other than it's the word of god and when we hear those things it's something that i found that's a war inside of me constantly and i realized that i'm constantly wanting to buck status quo trends for my own self and i'm realizing that my greatest enemy is still me it's still me no matter how much i know and how much god has done for me if i won't submit myself to the littlest of his commands i have usurped my will over his and that's a very dangerous place for any of us all to be is to ever put our will above his will because the amen the bride doesn't do that and we i want to go into looking at that and the character and the aspects of the son and daughters of god and the hour in which we're living is we submit ourselves to every word of god as little as it may be and many times we'll accept the great big things but then we'll stumble at the little things and we wonder why what is wrong it's because you're not hearkening into his voice you're wanting something big you're wanting the fire you're wanting the earthquake you're wanting god to do something great big and he speaks to you as a still small voice of his word and that word never changes it's immovable and if you want god you accept his word so simple so humble it goes over the highest most intellectual minds in this word world if you want him take him at his word but we have this carnal nature about us that's constantly trying to view god as something great big glorious mighty powerful which he is but that great god has so veiled himself in the simplicity of his word that it constantly stumbles the carnal mind and what stumbles me what lord brought my attention to is you know when that came out i said something and i was wrong i told the other deacons i do not want to wear a mask i've been unveiled before my god why should i put a mask back on why i didn't want to do it but there was a little voice in my head that said but his word says and then i went to prayer i never said anything but i went to prayer and right there i was praying prayed for about an hour and i was like lord i don't know how to and and something came to me and said it's the humbling of the bride now you take that for what it is man i'm not going to say it was thus saith the lord i'm not going to say anything like that but for me maybe it was the humbling of kyle maybe it wasn't for everybody for the humbling of kyle because we had to observe him he was meek and lowly coming in on the fold of an ass and if you want to be like him you're going to walk in his footsteps and you're not going to take a different path that he took to get there right and when you know i go back in the bible and i look you know and we see john or revelations 5 you know and i preached on behold the lamb you know and as we look at that behold the lamb as i start to look at him more and more he hears a voice the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed and everyone no doubt john's looking as the type of the bride saying here he comes the mighty god the sword in his hand to correct the the situation and he turns and sees the most powerful thing that could have ever been expressed a bloody lamb that's a shocking situation how could the king of kings and the lord of lords the great and mightiest one amongst us in the whole universe take the form of a little humble man no beauty that we should be holding and let them rip his beard out let them spit him in spit at him in the face rip off his clothes and humiliate him before all flesh and he didn't do anything he said nothing he let them do it that to me is just so shocking and so humbling and i'm so ashamed of my attitude in the presence of of that you know it's something i'm realizing you know it's one thing to know him and it's another thing to know him you know about him but to know him i think is to walk in his footsteps that brings a whole new reality of knowing him right you can before two people are married you can tell them about marriage and all that goes with they say beware you know hey say whatever you want sweetie you know those little things right there right this little thing to kind of but once they become married then they have to go through those difficulties of working things out in situations and humbling themselves and saying they're sorry and realizing they were wrong right they're knowing on a completely different level because now they're experiencing those things that they were told and now they have to put them into action to actually see the fruit of what they've been told right and so as i i just sitting there you know and i knew god did that and i had to i had to go and i had to go pray about it and i and i just when i did and i was looking at the scriptures and i just come back and the simplicity of it is god is such a gentleman he's so gentle and he is so meek that he will not force his will upon you he's so gentle it's shocking remember it even stumbled john the baptist he was so gentle are you the one like the high places made low oh yeah they were but it wasn't in the caramel realm that you could see but it was spiritually taking place strongholds were breaking and so in in looking at that i i just i just came back to the realization no matter how much i don't want to do this his will must take preeminence over my will because his will is his word period like amen amen you want to know the will of god it's his word it will never deviate from that you will never get so high in your revelation that you will ever discount and diminish one of his least commands true revelation will put you in humble obedience to every word that god has asked you to walk in that's a great revelation if you can break for me the whole seven seals and you can't walk in the simplicity of god's word i'm wondering i'm wondering because we have a pattern of this and the scripture is very clear of these things that god never deviates from his word because he is the word period and so many times like you'd say i had an experience you know so i like back there in the back i'm thinking i'm like well lord i really don't want to preach like i really don't want to do this hey like don't you don't understand i don't understand how a person really wants to preach like i still don't understand that like i don't get it like you see men and they just want to get up there and talk and i'm like i don't want to say nothing like i want to go hide and i i still wrestle with that but like in and of myself i'm like but i know you spoke to me and i know i'm supposed to minister to your people i know you called me to minister to be a servant to your bride i know you did and i checked my experience in my revelation with your word and it matched the word because if i had a revelation of something that the word said no i would have to bow down to that and say your word is true and my revelation is a lie my thought my experience even if an angel from heaven come and tell you something other than what i'm telling you right now let him be accursed it does not matter god never moves from his word because he is the word and i think in humbling ourselves jesus learned obedience through the things that he suffered what obedience did he come to the word prophet of god said that church is what obedience did he learn to learn to not pursue his will but the will of the father he had a job to do he had a role to play just as you do and so do i we have a job to do we're here to be the word made manifest we're here to reflect his will which is his word completely and utterly so simple so humble that i wonder if people accept it like i wonder because we always want something great big something great beyond something that's mighty and powerful and we don't want to humble ourselves to the simplicity of him and his word and influence is brother branham and i have a lot i i was like i don't know what to preach i looked down i got 15 pages i'm like what in the world is this like i don't understand this so influence brother branham says here always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness today we as americans we so much want to think of ourselves as a big somebody we belong to something great big or some big organization or something something big that we got oh but great big bit big is all that we ever want to see and that one time in the bible we we have seen an example of that there was a prophet went back into a cave elijah and god was trying to attract his attention to come out and there came a fire a smoke and a blustery winds across the mountains and a thunder and an earthquake and shakings and everything else the prophet never even moved god wasn't even in it but when he heard that still small voice speak he covered his face and he came forward when the still small voice of god's word speaks not in a racket not in some great big denomination or something big something but that still small voice of his word that's looked over and that call that still calls man to repentance god is his word always his word and so we see what attracted this for ordained predestinated prophet of god that could call fire out of the heavens nothing but the word nothing was an attraction to him and that's why i think we're doing this we're maturing in the lord i really do believe that i believe as he walked in those footsteps and learned obedience too much suffering and what do you suffer anytime you try to pursue your will over god's will you're going to pay a price his rod and his staff will come and correct and his rod and staff is a comfort to us as his children we love it we don't despise it we want it it hurts but we want it but he learned that obedience through much suffering and so is the bride learning to just obey his voice which is his word and sometimes i know we want to make it something big but my prayer is that each and every one of us because i'm included in this you go down in your own life today and you find out where's that one little thing he just keeps whispering to me and he won't let me i just i'm trying to cover it over with something else i'm trying to cover it over with praying or coming to church or trying to do things and there's that little little check down in the side of me and he keeps saying why are you bypassing me why are you trying to get to me because i'm right there in that little word that you keep bypassing that little humble request that i have for you because god is in that word you know enoch was a perfect reflection of that word he became the living word to his hour because he perfectly reflected the word that he was that was revealed to him in every step of his journey in every manner of his life as each of us would do in our own way we would have the simplicity of you say well god really doesn't care how i act at work oh yes he does you don't talk to men i don't care how mean they are to you don't talk back to them mean that's his word you love those that despitefully use you and you persecute and persecute you right that's the simplicity of his word but why do we want to bypass that and we say hey yeah but i have a revelation the seventh seal i know the prophet of god to the age and i'm his bride what did he want a bride for he don't want a bride just so you can he can say i have a bride he wants a bride to reproduce himself to bring the word and made flesh amongst us today in the hour in which we're living the bride has a purpose to reproduce christ christ is the word from genesis to revelations he's the amen the soviet let it be done and the bride says the same thing so be it let it be done not my will but thine will be done see we're still learning we're walking in those footsteps and i'm not i'm not pushing anybody out i'm not pushing anybody in that's not what i'm doing we want to find our bad spots right so i expose my bad spots but i don't think i'm the only one i think we're all maturing in these things and realizing you know what hey i am still my greatest enemy and i am hindering the move of god if i won't humble myself to the least of his desires that's just the truth god hiding himself in simplicity when elijah was back there in the cave and the smoke went across the blood the thunders the lightnings you see and all those kinds of sensations we've had blood on the face and hands and sensations and everything they it never even bothered that prophet he just laid there and he heard that still small voice and what is it the word then he covered his face and he walked out to see what it was remember friends don't look for something big you say god he speaks of great big things there'll come a time that this will be this and this will be that and it'll be great big things i hope you're catching what i'm talking about see great big things when this comes to pass it'll be great big like this but it'll be so humble that you'll miss the entire theme it'll go right on it's god hiding himself in simplicity you'll look back there and say well that never did that see it see it passed right over the top of you and you've never even seen it it was so simple you see god lived in that simplicity to manifest himself in his greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself a great a big great man can't simplify himself he's got to be a dignitary see but he ain't big enough yet when he become when he comes big enough then he comes down like you you see he can humble himself wow i got a lot so it's okay right we're just gonna fly through this and we'll see where he wants to go with it he says like that it means whatever oh okay so here it is he is the god of the amen this is a continuation of um that he never changes what he does never changes he said it and he stands fast he does it and it's done forever none can take from what he says or add to it so let it be amen so let it be you aren't you glad that you served that kind of a god you can know exactly what listen this you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time because he is the amen god and he won't change you want to check your experience you want to do a checkup just check your life with the simplicity of his word and you'll find where you're standing in his presence it's that simple you don't need a pastor you don't need a preacher you don't need an angel you don't need a mighty rushing wind you check your experience with his word brother branham said that and you'll find where you're standing in his presence so simple so simple now i know why i had no inspiration like i couldn't feel anything other than so simple just a whisper of his word i myself was still looking for something big but he gave me his word he whispered it to me he just whispered it i like that brother man says i like that it means that whatever he said it's final it means that whatever he said in the first age and to the second and to all the other age about his own church and about the false vine is exactly right and it won't change it means that what he started out with in genesis he will finish in revelations he has to be for he is the amen let it be now we can see again why the devil hates the book of revelations and genesis he hates the truth he knows that the truth will prevail he knows what his end will be and how he fights that but we are on the winning side i'm going to keep going because it'll get good a quick look at those scriptures which involves the lord jesus overcoming to bring the truth of this proposition matthew 4. he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word personal temptations and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptations of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word and he fell to the personal temptation of satan by falling to you to failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this the only way to be an overcomer is to it also is the only way that you can know that you're actually overcoming because the word can't fail see you want something outside of the word and it's proving ah that's what a false vine is looking for false vine is constantly looking for something out of his word for vindication of what he is and that he's in the will of god i can show that to you and i will here in a minute now notice how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of his day he constantly applied the word he spoke only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was was not utterly confused by his wisdom for his wisdom was of god but in his own personal life when he was contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god hebrews 5 7 who in the days of his flesh when he was offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared though he were a son not taking away your sonship though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of god now then there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word there's the qualification unless you've been living that word i don't care if you can quote it to me unless you've been the expression of that living word you will not sit on that throne with him because you will constantly be found as one pursuing your own will your own desires above the will and purpose of god very simple you will by your own default eliminate yourself from that position you will do it yourself you'll count yourself unworthy because you'll pursue your own desire see you see how god's just so so quiet he's just whispering his desires to you and then he's checking to see what she'll do he's not going to have a wife that he has to force into loving him it just won't do that jesus said if you say that you love me and you don't keep my commandments you're a liar like i don't have to say it he said it his word is his will and if you don't love him you don't love his word you'll pursue your own will so simple no person will sit a person who will sit upon the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he's been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting on that throne it will only be granted to a word right just a word bride see why you have to humble yourself become like a little child just real simple lord i don't know nothing you show me where i'm not obeying i'm not expressing that word i want to walk in it as a wife i want to be found as the wife that god would want me to be found right as a husband i want to be that kind of an expression that you were to me to to to really be that living word for you right that's just that desire don't be getting tired on me i see a couple of you see a couple of you you're all right you can take a breath believe me i it's okay just breathe a little bit see a couple i'm going like this it's okay it does mess me up but it's okay right just relax so i'm gonna have to get a little oxygen tubes you know underneath the seats you know and pump them in there bright-eyed bushy tail he says as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is united with him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne his word only are on the amen side see why i'm saying it's the amen to the amen we have nothing we're not saying hey but i know this this this this this this no don't care are you obedient to what he's asked you to do i really don't care about anything else anymore i really don't like i'm not looking for anything great and big i know it's hidden in the simplicity of humble moms dads kids older grandmas and grandpas just faithfully doing what he's called us to do in the hour in which we're living the word expression it says here that we are earth that he hid this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power of god that the power may be of god and not of us for we are troubled on every side we are distressed we're perplexed but we are not in despair we are persecuted but we're not forsaken or cast down and but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus may be made manifested in our body for we which are alive always delivered unto death for jesus's sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifested in our mortal flesh we're always dying out to your will you're always dying out and you know what next week you'll be dying out again to something else and then the month after that you're going to find out there's something else i'm dying because you're always dying that's you're walking in his footsteps yeah there's a lot wow a lot of scriptures here in my mind so romans i will just keep flying because i'm not even close romans 8 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation distress persecutions famines or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter every day every hour of every day i'm dying you want to walk in his footsteps remember it's a bloody lamb you want to take the book remember it's a bloody lamb takes the book only the bloody lamb takes the book to make it live you could quote it but you can't make it live you understand yeah now i'm kind of wondering and knowing why i by by inspiration i preached that behold the lamb i see i see for one for me i i i took on the wrong nature for a second and i tried to pursue my will and i didn't realize that's antichrist antichrist is anything other than his word that's the spirit of antichrist don't think it can't work on you anything that causes you to deviate from the least of his commands is an antichrist spirit working upon you remember till that devil is cast in the lake of fire he's doing everything he can to keep you from walking in that word everything he can okay my computer went dark it had to look at me so now here's the here's we're getting to the the meat of what i this inspiration lee not your own understanding now i think our education is good today if we said to our sons and to our and to the sons of god that it's all right to have an education there's nothing against that but when your education is contrary to the word of god then you lean to the word and you let your education go see because the word the education will stand and and will give you a good job and probably a good standing amongst very intellectual people but that's and that's all right which will probably be a great help to you help you in your financials and help you in your livelihood make living a little bit easier for you but remember one thing my son you've got to die no matter how much education you got how much culture and how much you are able to accumulate you've got to face death because it is written men must die and after this the judgment and god and death is so bad but coming to that judgment that's the bad part but now you die but after that the judgment now it's going to be required of you what you did with your understanding of god's word that's where the requirement comes because that your education is fine but the word of god is the life my word is life and and to know it is the life and he said to know him well he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only way you'll ever know him is by his word so simple it's got to stay simple because only someone big can make themselves simple so brother bam says here this headstone was crying grace grace it's passed from death and from creed into the living word of a living god god's only provided plan for this age was his sons in the word word age will be quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something that's been alive and it's seated now in heavenly places already alive and subject to every promise in the word and what does that do you being a part of god's gene a part of the word other men a part of god's word are seated together and they're manifesting the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you you see there's no leaven among you it's just the word only seated in those heavenly places in the door where he has put his name where two ways meet the cross yours and his yeah still an open door now here it is this is the one i wanted to get to resume of the ages balaam we learn in those uncertain terms that this false vine is a vine of satan their gathering is of him satan they meet in the name of the of god and they lie that they are christ's they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rites that are given in the church by christ yet they are not of god but since they say that they are god will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks to them they remind us exactly of balaam he had a prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto god as demonstrated in the sacrifices of clean beasts yet he was not a word prophet for when god told him not to go to honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by lust of gold and prestige so god let him go the perfect will of god gave way to the permissive will of god because of the heart's desire of balaam god actually said go ahead did god change his mind no sir god had his way regardless of what balaam was going balaam did not annul the will of god god had his way regardless it was balaam who was the loser for he bypassed the word his own human desire his heart desire bypassing the word he made himself a loser and today we have the very same thing women preachers organizations false doctrines and etc and people worshiping god manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balaam claiming that god had spoken to them them even when the commission received was opposite to the revealed word and will not defy that god spoke to them or and i will not deny that god spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to balaam the second time and he knew that balaam wanted his own heart's desire above the word and he gave it to him and yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today god tells folks just go ahead in your own hearts desires because they've already rejected the word but the will of god will be done regardless amen i hope you see this it will it will not only clear up much of what we've seen in the ages but especially in this last age with so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is against the word revealed will of god so you see god will let you go right on and he'll keep blessing you he'll keep blessing you those children of israel that came out he still fed him manna from heaven he still let their shoelaces not break he gave him water when they were thirsty he took care of them he calls it the rain to fall on the just in the un just right he pours out he does blessings for all but you know what it does it just reveals the one that loves him and the one that don't the one that don't it's just a revealer these little things all along the way that god keeps letting come our way is going to be the revealer of the heart's desire of each of us i don't think we're done i don't think we're close i think we are all having to learn obedience through suffering and i'm not saying it ain't suffering i know you're all suffering behind that right now i know you are and i know that there's many many things that we have to suffer but for his sake we'll do it because if god is going to do anything he's going to check your heart's desire he'll do it with everything you can imagine i this is one little thing you know that right there's so many things he's checking your heart's desire you think he's not mindful of you every day watching where is his heart's desire you know brother branham says when god chooses a bride he's speaking of what kind of home he wants right when he picks a woman right so do you think god's going to pick a bride that constantly just wants to do her own thing like always wants to just do her thing and god i want you to bless me in it and you know what he'll do he'll bless you he will bless you and you'll think you're fine and all you did was expose you don't have the heart and desire of god you did it he blessed you that's scary that scares me that scares me that scares me for the people it really does to know that the almighty god will still bless you and give you the desires of your heart but it won't be his desire and you will completely reject him along the path and you thought you were fine the people the world the denominational systems they're blessed they're healed they get all kinds of it and they think god's with them in that just like balaam they rejected the word god still blesses them but they rejected him the word god's checking to find his bride that wants his will and his will only which is his word nothing more than that so simple you see real real real simple hebrews 3 7 if you want to turn there just realized we are where that thought i just said was so hebrews 3 7 wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation of the day of temptation in the wilderness so this day of temptation in the wilderness what do you think god was doing in this period of time it was a great temptation he was checking their desires they were in a wilderness why didn't they just come out and go in he gave space to check their desires he had few very few very tiny few that actually had a heart's desire for the will of god to be fulfilled the rest he's still blessed gave him their hearts desires why do you think we didn't take a body change 50 years ago he's checking hart's desires he's learning obedience we're all learning obedience much suffering when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation i said they do always err in their heart and they have not for they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom he was grieved for forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it simply they heard the word they recognized their prophet but they didn't humble themselves to just take him at his word and obey it along the way brother bannon said you can agree with the word you can say it's the truth but until you unite with it it doesn't do any good whatsoever see there's a difference between sympathizing there's a difference between flirters and a wife there's a big difference you'll find it in their heart's desire always hidden in simple things first peter 2 7. please turn first peter 2 7. unto you therefore which believed he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation a peculiar people that we should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of this darkness unto his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against your soul we're all warring against them we all have these human desires and reasonings that we would like to bypass the simplicity of his will and try to pursue our own and it's it's just hidden in so many things now let's look at the amen bride revelations uh of jesus christ the church age now remember this christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows that how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it is exposing satan revealing his words and his attempted destruction of god's people how by discrediting god's word right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's grace our spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit so does the bride have to withstand the antichrist spirit so what is the antichrist spirit anything contrary to the word anything you pick anything so simple but anything that's an antichrist spirit and you're gonna fight it until he's thrown into the lake of fire your will over his justify it give it a good reasoning we all do it i'm guilty right i'm not i'm not i'm the one guilty i'm pointing to me right so just so you know i'm not picking on anybody i'm pointing at me i was the one guilty i'm the one who he told point blank something and i'm the one who justified by my own human reasoning something that was contrary to the simplicity of his word i didn't even realize it but i was up against the antichrist spirit that was coming after me i didn't even realize it until god brought my attention to i said oh my goodness and i had to repent i did repent i really was down because i realized how subtle the enemy was he's so subtle it shocked me like i had no idea he would use such a simple like why does that care why so simple but i had a word on it and that was god and i was going to bypass god and take an evil spirit that's how you get evil spirits you bypass the word so simple it's it's you see this is we have to discern these things we have to be able to withstand this two spirits that'll work within the framework of the christian church an antichrist spirit which is anything anti-god anti-word right it can sound beautiful but who's hidden in beauty and then who's hidden and no beauty that we should be holding no nothing that we're like wow that's great no that's just what he said i like it i don't you always don't have to get excited that makes me excited i don't know i just like it when god talks to me personally and he shows me something and he shows me even in my mistake how this thing is working so slyly so sly and then god won't come down and thunder out judgment because you go that way he doesn't if you're his he'll correct you he'll give you a spanking but you know what you can still bypass that and still go to your own will and you know what he'll do he'll bless you he'll just keep blessing you bless you bless your bless you he told you it wasn't right but wow yeah so she can do the greater work she's an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he'll be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with real true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail against them satan's eden then satan got to eve to listen to his gospel of theology the gospel of knowledge in higher schooling and of higher ethics and of a better civilization and of higher education and so forth so you see what he was doing man he was selling it he was good at selling it like it sounded good it was great educated but god's simple humble word was still there never went anywhere it was just simple see this is what i think god's doing right we've had a lot of things in 50 years a lot of things that comes up comes down and you start to realize well i wonder what this is really all about i think god's really just checking the desires of people's heart if you want something great big he'll give it to you but if you want him it'll be hidden in the simplicity of a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and your identity with the lamb which is the word and you'll be killed all the day long for walking with it um oh computers there we go see higher education and so forth then when he got to her to stop and to listen to him for just one minute to his reasonings which he had commanded us to cast down that's when he got her to listen now you looky here church the church is so and so it's to be established for so long we're one of the oldest churches here we have the mayor coming to our church i don't care what it is you see if it's against god's word you be against it that is your enemy anything that's against the word is your enemy everything that's for the word is your brother he's a part of you so you see when the enemy comes in like a flood i'm not trying to shoot at you i'm just trying to shoot at the spirit of antichrist that would be working to try to paralyze and make us formal and powerless so right that's what we do we identify something by the word you say ah that's not the word brother not sister that's not the word i know god's blessing you in that career that you're pursuing but that's not the word like you can pursue that career if you want to but it's not the word let the older woman instruct the younger woman on how to be what you answer it yourself keepers at home and how to balance a career not what he said that's not his word but you know what he'll bless you in it you go right ahead god will bless you but don't you want to do his will don't you want to be found faithful and say don't you want to hear those words well done good and faithful servant you didn't pursue your own will you pursued mine because thou hast walked and i known choosing he told brother brown and it was the harder way you have picked the precise and correct way and it is my way right but brother banham had to learn things you know that he fell lots of times he came under wrong influences he came on the wrong influences of preachers sometimes remember that that was his big mistake he came under wrong influences and god would correct him just as he'll correct his bride he corrects me and i believe he'll correct you because we just want to do his will there's nothing good great about us there's no big ones among us right if the king of kings and lord of lords made himself of no reputation what do i have i got nothing i got no reputation i think when the bride loses her reputation she'll see god manifested in ways she never thought possible she stops trying to do things in her own strengths she'll see the power of god manifest like never before so humble so brother branham tells us the story here the way of the true prophet you know a lot of times angel come angels come down boy and how the pentecostals will sure eat that up how about when saint martin was standing there and here stood a great bright being stood before him and a man was bapti and the man who baptized in jesus name who believed in the holy ghost and kept the word and the romans kicking him out and doing everything to him trying to give him their dogmas and their man-made doctrines and the man stood on the word one day in his power the devils would come up to him and try to talk to him he wouldn't even pay them any attention one day satan came like that like christ crowned golden slippers on stood there and said don't you see blazes of fire all around him said don't you recognize me martin i am your lord worship me martin looked at him and said there's something wrong here he said martin can't you recognize me said i am your lord and savior said worship me he said it three times martin looked around he seen christ will be crowned by his people at his coming he wouldn't be wearing no golden slippers he said you get away from me satan oh how the pentecostals would sure be eating that up you see how did he discern this false image that was placed before him of christ it didn't match the original word it didn't match it didn't fit it really doesn't matter how big and beautiful something is presented to you as a false christ a false word if it doesn't match the original simplicity of god's word it's wrong just wrong i know sometimes we all want something like i wouldn't mind an angel coming and telling me but that doesn't fit the pattern that just doesn't fit the pattern i'll be obedient to his word he knows his bride will hearken into his voice she won't be moved by mountains she won't be moved by earthquakes and fires and winds she'll just be moved by the still small voice speaking through his word and shall walk right on into a rapture it's so simple christ in the mystery of god revealed the pregnant person with the seed of god the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of god that the word and the word alone manifest itself in the person you see is a prisoner to an individual it's individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth that god would reveal himself to you as an individual so quietly simply masterpiece and when he had made his first passing masterpiece he put him behind the word when he made his second masterpiece he was the word amen he was the word not behind the word but he was he was the word god never changes in his plan that's exactly what he started off to do in his first church was with the word now god the word in the beginning he was independent from all other everything else all other people now i don't mean to say this to be different god is a segregationist you know that you talk about integration but god's a segregationist he certainly does he'll separate his own his people from the world he separated israel his nation he is trying to separate his church from the world but the work but the church wants to go on with the world but his people is still segregated segregated to him who is he the word you see god's just going to bless both sides it's not going to he's not going to just right now curse the other side that rejects his word and he's going to bless that one too but he knows there's another little people little humble people that'll be looking at their lives through the mirror into the mirror reflecting their lives in the mirror of god's word and seeing something's not right remember christ in you is the hope of glory this is the seventh seal on on display just so you know it really is it's the it's the simplicity of a life of christ manifesting in you really is where did he go where was he at where is that big fellow brother ben said manifesting expressing learning obedience too much suffering in the form of a bride identified masterpiece he's making a bride yes sir and he's hewing and chipping her down chopping off the world oh church goings and creeds and denominations and their doctrines and their dogmas all has to be cut away from the church their ideas and their indifferences and their doctrines and everything they've got to come back and let the master pick up the bow let the master pick pick you up with his hands and strike the word say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he'll strum your life and you'll strike your life and you know what your life's going to speak jesus christ the word is the absolute the word is the same yesterday today and forever and my life is speaking what that word says there's the masterpiece in his hands he's cutting you now he's cutting you down to where it's the word only he's cutting all the creeds and your dogmas and everything away from you and he's trying to get a bride for his son another masterpiece part of his word now the great sculptors see he's counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirements that the word requires is counting on you to stand there and let him cut you in these last days i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy christ is that identified masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself with him by the same word to be the masterpiece of the bride matthew 5 44. sorry i'm gonna keep laying it in now so we know we are walking in his footsteps right our lives have to walk in those footsteps into that perfection in matthew 5 44 jesus says but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you but what if they really said something nasty like come i mean i they're not even bride that doesn't mean anything like i've heard that and it makes my stomach turn they're not bride they're not elect i don't care what spirit's in you this isn't the spirit of christ christ is the word and he said you have to love your enemies i listened to a brother earl martin i think it was his testimony and i think they were trying to he was a preacher he's trying to throw him out of the church there was a man in the church i'm going to get you thrown out of this church you ain't ever preaching here again and he said well he said he worked up the whole church and the whole church had a big meeting come to find out nobody wanted him out of the church just this one man and the man said if you ever get that pulpit and preach i'm going to shoot you and brother earl martin says you know what happened he left and had a heart attack and he said serves him right that's what he said serves him right brother branham got word of brother branham approached him i don't know when it was came to him said don't you ever get in the pulpit and preach again until that spirit's changed he said don't you ever get in a pulpit and preach until you can pray and love that man like your best friend that's what he said it's earl martin brother earl martin if you want to i listened to testimony a while ago yeah ain't that something so if you can't love your enemies as your friend see there's a wrong spirit living in you see very simple so where are we at matthew 5 44 yeah but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them they hate you and pray for you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son listen son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth his reign on the just and the unjust for if we love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans sow be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so do we have any criticism for anybody really no you really don't you have no ability to actually condemn the other person you make you can you not have to agree with them in what they do but you're not to hate them you're not to you know just absolutely say well they're not my brother and they don't believe things the way i do i'm telling you there's something not right with that spirit because it just doesn't match the spirit of his word because you have to love those that hate you and would want to do evil to you and he said in the spirit of christ and you will will do that see it's a good checkup they're real good checkups first corinthians 3 1 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet are you now able so what disqualifies them for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not yet carnal and walk as men so if there's envine and strife and division among us guess what you're not even ready for the real meat of god's word you're still yet carnal in your understanding you're still not even got the spiritual mind of christ to be able to look beyond those things and recognize your position and what you're supposed to do in those situations matthew 19 8 if you don't mind and i love this years ago when i was studying marriage and divorce i came across this and it just it just really thrilled me when i saw this matthew 19 8 he saith unto them moses because the hardness of your heart suffered you to be put to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and as i say unto you whosoever shall put away of his wife except for the cause of fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put awake doth commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry but he said unto them all men can't receive the same save them to whom it is given for there are some eunuchs which are born from their mother's womb and there are some eunuchs which are made eunuchs of men and there are some eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of god's sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it because what he was saying was a very hard thing and he knows it but he's got a bride he's got a people he's got an elect that will choose to fulfill his word and even stay single the rest of their lives because his word said so they love him more than that even to and i know that's a tough one like that's tough i i'm not in that position so i can't say i personally can feel it but having one that has a wife if i was in that situation and i find that it was not pleasing to my lord and i did that i say god bless you whoever has been able to take that stand for the sake of the word you chose him over your own desire you chose a harder way you're walking with him see he's always walking that harder way but it's always his way and i just i always love that scripture because it just shows right here with god it looks tough i'm not even denying it in the world in the natural it looks tough but with god all things are possible all things are possible and there is a group that will receive his word now is everybody comfortable now i did put this in here and i was like i don't know if i should put all this in here but i i want yeah take a deep breath okay we go for another hour here we go so i want to read this and i know you've heard it but i just i feel to read it pick up your pen and i want to take my time in it and i just want to bring out some certain aspects of it because i think it so summarizes the entire thought that i just there's there's no reason to preach on it when the spirit of the lord says pick up your pen i want to tell the church something i think we should listen right so listen to this if you don't mind and i'll pause here for in the middle of it here's what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is each specie brings forth of its own kind genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his own kind his seed is in itself upon the earth and it is so whatever life was in the seed came forth into the plant and fence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church christ's seed will come to the headstone she will be a super church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will just be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with them with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations can't produce this wrong seed they'll produce their creeds their dogmas mixed with the word and will mongrel this mongrelizing brings forth hybrid product the first son adam was a spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself there's the purpose of the bride that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization and she caused him to die the second son jesus was also a spoken or was also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like like as was adam but before he could marry her she had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of a true seed of the word god will present christ a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be manifested in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to be manifested that's the one i want to hit he himself the reality of the hour in which we're living is shocking to me and it's so humble it's so simple i mean i was listening to brother chad and brother aaron and realizing that we're living in the very hour and it's so simple we're god there's an open door and there's a voice and a prophet to the age and he's calling us to come up higher and it's a rapture age that i'm getting called up into and the molecules in my body are changing i've been called out of dead denominationalism and it's happening and it's all happening right now so simple and so humble that it shocks me and i sit there with tears in my eyes i'm like lord how in the world billions of people and you're letting me hear these secrets you're letting me see you i i i don't deserve this i don't i don't even there's nothing in me good to deserve this and i'm sitting there in just utter shock and amazement that god's allowed me to hear these things and then have a heart's desire to walk in those things even the greatest desire of all and that is to me what's god's doing at this point he's really truly just hunting out a bride that just loves him really really loves him loves his word because he wants to bring himself into view again and how will he do that when you take the word and it becomes a living word in you as a obedient wife as a correct husband as a you know whatever you're doing at work whatever it is that's the word made manifest and it's going to be so humble that most people won't even notice it so very humble you see the whole idea of going back to something that's pentecostal with we're hooping and hollering and shouting and tongues and earthquakes and fires and all these things no no it's the word in the word only it's time for the word and the word only to be manifested in the bride not that i would take away from any gifts amongst us i believe they're there but we're not looking for that as a vindication of his presence we're looking for the word made manifested as the vindication of his presence amongst his people but that word but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifested god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of his virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads now notice the harmony of the father and of the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him of the father john 5 19 the harmony is to now exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his word of life and she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death revelation's a rapture right rapture is a revelation it's the word she won't doubt the word not one of it and death won't be able to harm her because he'll just believe the simplicity of god's word for if the seed be planted the water will raise it back up again here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with his word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it will come to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride will do only his will no one will make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works and fulfilling his word he did not complete his work all his work while he was in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do for he will now fulfill through the bride the that work which he has left for this specific time now let us stand like joshua and caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now joshua means jehovah's savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as paul came as as the original leader caleb represents those that stayed true with joshua remember god had started israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church notice how god did not move israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his appointed time now the people might have put pressure on joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go up and take it joshua you're all through you've lost your commission you don't have power like you used to have used to hear from god and then know the will of god and then act quickly something is wrong with you but joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew what the promises of god he knew the promises of god so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from god and when it came time to move god placed sorry god placed the full leadership in joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word god could trust joshua but the other ones but not the others so it will repeat in the last day the same problems and the same pressures same problems and same pressures how can i tell the two spirits apart the pergament church age just give them the word test and if they don't speak that word you know they're of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two brides he will try to deceive the bride in this last day trying to get her to hybridize herself with creeds or just plainly turning from the word to a sign that would suit her but god never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came came to the word first and then watch for the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit i like that do i like that if you need to see the power of god manifested in your life just do what the word says take him at his word the word comes first you need healing in your body take the word repent of everything you got to do then you can say hey devil you got no right to be standing here anymore i've done all that the word told me to do now i'm waiting for him to come and energize this word that i have taken a hold of and what's going to stop that god will confirm his word so simple you see we wait for something to move upon us just take him at his word and then watch god do the action from that point on because that's technically what you're doing you're taking a hold of god when you take the word just so simple but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside this laodicean church age and god says i'm going against you i will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i have seen nothing but men esteeming their own words above mine so at the end of this age i will spew you out of my mouth it's all over just makes you go low real low john 12 20. please turn and there were certain greeks that came to worship him at the feast and the same came therefore to philip which was at which was of bethesda of galilee and they desired him saying sir sir we would see jesus this really spoke to me philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew to philip tell jesus and jesus answered them saying the hours come the son of man should be glorified okay verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abide alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it until life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there oh there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour for this cause came i into this hour father glorify thy name then there came a voice from heaven saying i have glorified it and i'll glorify it again that's a bride i believe that's a bride he glorified it as a corn of wheat that fell in the ground and died and hated his own life didn't get didn't get a chance to even pursue those things he had a right to and he has a bride that'll walk in those same footsteps not pushed not forced by choosing shall choose him real real quietly she'll just choose him matthew 11 says come unto unto me all thee that labor and are heavy laban laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls my yoke is easy and my burden is light philippians 2 says let nothing be done through strife and vainglory but in loneliness of mine let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others so let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men he just became a servant to the word just do the will of god just the word and nothing more musicians if you'll come you'll be able to breathe revelations 22 16. [Music] i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely for i testify unto you unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are in this written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifies these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen he closes the whole revelation of jesus christ warning the people don't you ever take away one word and don't you ever add to it one word otherwise you have counted yourself unworthy to ever sit upon that throne with him never will happen we all stand if i'm going to say anything and echo it loud his word is his will that's what the amen said to thee amen amen let's just power heads for word of prayer most gracious heavenly father lord we come before you lord thankful for this time that we've been able to gather together lord i know i really messed up and jumbled it up the thoughts but lord i pray that the spirit of what was being said got clearly communicated lord to your people lord in so many ways i find myself so ashamed by the attitudes and and things that i've done not even in years gone by but in weeks gone by and months gone by lord i'm ashamed lord i just pray lord that you'd no doubt i appreciate your grace to show me where i'm wrong and lord we all appreciate it lord when your grace humbly corrects us lord in your mercy lord you say my son i'm not gonna let you go that way you gotta cur you gotta learn this obedience you've got to come according to to me learn of me i'm meek and lowly i'm not aggressive that's not my nature i'm not forceful it's not me lord i so appreciate that and i admire that so very very much and it's my great desire and i believe all of our greats desires to be yoked with you in that lord it's you're the most beautiful thing i've ever seen lord i just pray that you would humbly forgive us for attitudes and lord forgive us for words spoken against other brothers even others that aren't even brothers forgive us for attitudes and thoughts and mean-spiritedness that we might have as treating human beings is less than human beings lord that ain't right and should never be spoken amongst your people lord we we should be way higher than that lord we we should have an attitude in the spirit of love that so pulsates through us lord that even our greatest enemy wouldn't be able to say that man says and does evil things to me he should be able to say i'm mean to him all the time but he just always sweet to me and lord i just pray that you'll find that in us lord that we would we'd find you'd find a dwelling place lord for that dove to lead every day according to your will and your purpose lord lord with all that's in me i love you and i love these people lord i pray lord if anything was said wrong forgive me i didn't mean it in that way to be mean or hurtful it's not my desire i just want to see you high and lifted up and lord and know the tactics of the enemy now a little better than i once did before and i just pray lord that through my mistakes lord they'll find footprints to be able to follow a path where you lead them lord lord we just love you we commit ourselves to you and ask lord that you would search our hearts lord that's that's a scary thing lord to see that you would even bless those that that don't have a heart's desire for you lord that's that's scary lord and um the lord we we want to be found with your heart's desire we want to be found as a bride that loves you more than anything in this world lord and lord we want to be found faithful to that that calling that you've elected us to lord we don't want anything to distract us and pull us away from it lord i just pray lord that your hand of mercy and grace would lead us and guide us lord so that we can take that final step with you one of these days just love you in jesus name i got a song you just want to please [Music] [Applause] found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday i just want to please [Applause] in his presence found in his likeness to hear him say well done someday one more time [Music] please [Music] is [Music] amen anything that will root out the antichrist spirit in my life is a good message you know moses [Music] he had a revelation of who he was he had a revelation of his proper birth given to him by his mother it was handed down and he knew what he was called to in life he was to deliver the children of israel but his initial ever effort in deliverance failed he killed an egyptian ran into the wilderness was rejected by his brothers because moses initial effort to bring forth the word of god in his life was completely according to his own desire and his own thoughts and he failed and god let him fail and he runs through the wilderness and in the wilderness through trials and through tribulations and through separations amen living with a hot tempered wife which is exactly what moses need begin to chip away at moses's self-will and resolve and he beat all of moses out of moses and he got all of the egyptian training out of him until finally moses couldn't do nothing right couldn't speak right couldn't deliver anybody couldn't do anything to help them down there in israel he he got to the place where he was convinced he wasn't the deliverer he couldn't do anything to help those people and that's where god wanted him because god wanted god it never changed moses purpose never changed his calling an election never changed his sonship it was still moses but moses had to get to the place where moses would have no confidence in moses so when god would tell him to do something it wouldn't get twisted it wouldn't get tainted and then if he said call for flies he called for flies he says go unto pharaoh and cast down your rod and go and cast it around nothing extra nothing less just exactly what he was told [Music] i wonder what it's going to take to get us in the same place he's given us his word he's called us he's told us who we are and what our purpose is what we're supposed to do in this life amen none of that's going to change but i wonder if he doesn't let us make make these mistakes and fail so that we we quit having confidence in us that we stop trusting our reasoning stop trusting our ideas our intelligence and stop trusting our even our years of experience until we get to the place and said lord without your word i'm not going to move because i don't know what to do i'll mess it up i'll make another mistake i'll fail you again god just show me out of your word and if i can see your word and take your word on it i'll do it and that way god can do whatever whatsoever god wants to do he's going to have a bride and i believe that he wants to do a work through his bride i believe that and it may be more powerful than we could imagine it may be simpler than what we think i don't know but but he's got to get that bride to where she gladly submits to the simplest of the simple commandments before we ever call for her to call for flies why would why would he put that kind of power and authority into a bride who will not obey the simplest and littlest of things seems like lately god is drilling down into our lives and dealing with the nitty-gritty and the tiny and and dealing with these things but but don't resent that just say god deal with all of me deal with all of me lord everything just deal with it lord because we have no idea what's coming next and whatever is coming next god needs to root some things out of our life to self-will and self-desire and own understanding and own intelligence we've got to die out more to those things for whatever coming next friends god doesn't waste the preaching of the word he doesn't waste the anointing that's going forth it's all for a purpose what he's looking for is humble submission simplicity and he can do a lot with that i wrote down a phrase that i wanted to capture and not forget while kai was preaching he said this god can be expressed in the simplicity of his smallest commandment i want to express god i want to bring forth christ in this day christ can be expressed in the simplicity of his smallest commandment what is that manifesting the word do it in the little things we're doing the big things we do in all things and that's bringing forth christ the manifest word in this age the amen is so be it if god says it he's the amen if he's the amen what will his wife be [Music] amen and if he said it in his word and he stamped it with an amen then i want to have the heart inside of me to stamp it back with an amen god said this is it i want to say this is it god help us i think all we can say after this is god help us without your spirit there's no way without election it's impossible without your choosing it's impossible you've chose before the foundation of the world or there's not a human being that could come to this level that god's calling for but because he chose now he'll send his spirit the matching piece of that chosen part amen so that he can bring to life what's laying there amen so he can accomplish his purpose on this earth say god help us help us to yield to that spirit help to help us to catch revelation upon revelation that will quicken your word so that we can have amen so that we have a desire for your word so that we can just walk in that word god help us humble us lord let us walk in simplicity an order you know what i'll say this last thing you know what i believe personally the greatest most dynamic if we can think of the most dynamic most powerful demonstration to the world of jesus christ in flesh if you can think of raising a dead person or whatever it will only be the simplicity of somebody obeying him the same simplicity that obeyed him and not speaking evil of a neighbor is the same simplicity that'll bring forth the greatest manifestation you can think of it's the same thing it's obedience to his word and following his leadership if we can do it in all the little things then we can do it in the big things too and if he can trust us with his re with his word he can trust us to keep it all and to subject ourselves to it he can trust us with everything so praise god that's what i want search me o god search me out uncover those things in me that where willfulness is laying uncovered lord i don't want it anymore where selfishness is laying uncover it lord i don't want it anymore i just want your word on display i don't know about you but for me it's becoming so serious and so subtle it has me on pins and needles i realize that in myself i will fail him every moment of every day and it's got me on pins and needles because i realize there's no capability in me all capability is him [Music] now i gotta be careful that i take enough time to listen to his voice but i read his word that i yield myself to it are all wind up off of his program he loves me he'll chase me and get me back but i i don't want to depend on that i want to i want my will is just to obey the first time that's my desire god help us god help us we're going to dismiss you in the name of the lord we love you god be with you god bless you god use you god changes from glory unto glory let us manifest his word above all things that manifest his word [Music] sin i just want to please the lord be in his will in every way to be lost found in his likeness i just want to please [Music] found in his likeness oh precious lord strip me on vainglory take away all that's left oh precious lord every year make me humble [Music] i pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] please make me humble [Applause] [Music] glory and cry make me [Music] i've had it all but what i eat just more of you [Applause] and yet [Music] lord hear my prayer for more of you you [Music] i need more [Music] i've had it all but what i eat is [Music] [Laughter] empty and bear lord hear my prayers flow through me spirit flow through me [Music] flow through me spirit flows through me [Music] as i live my hands to worship and magnify
