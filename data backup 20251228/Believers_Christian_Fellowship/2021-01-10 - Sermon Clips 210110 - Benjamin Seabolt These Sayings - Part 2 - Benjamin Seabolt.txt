========================================

here is a man that has laid in a bed for 38 years and there's now a man who has came along with the power to say take up thy bed and walk and instead of asking who is the man that made you whole they said who is the man that told you to carry your bad on bed on the sabbath day i mean i've been accused of being legalistic but i mean this is a whole other level of all things this i mean do we understand the fact pattern here this man's laid here for 38 years he's been made whole and the only thing that they can think to ask him is who's told you to come and bust up our denominational thinking who has told you to come and throw a wrench into our tradition our traditional sunday service who has who has asked who has told you to do these things not wilt thou who has told you and made you whole they won't ask you that they want to know who's disturbing things who is threatening our position who is going to put us out of a job if this be so i'm not concerned that you've been made whole what i'm concerned about is my self-security and how many how many in here can relate to that when the message of the hour came your way [Music] the people that you thought well everybody will see this everybody will love this will will thou be made whole you're just chucking that out to everybody you come to will thou be made whole like i've been made whole well that'll be made whole like like i've been made whole and they've known you they've known me and they've known that you've laid their important for 38 years maybe not 38 years you put your own number in there but of all things they just can't seem to ask how is it that you have been made whole they want to know why are you trying to cause this confliction in my life by presenting this cult to me by presenting this false doctrine to me what what is your problem where are these radical who has told you this who has told you to come and disturb my traditional sunday plans they don't say yes please make me whole they want to know who is causing this disturbance why are you doing this to me see if we can't discern the spirits within the framework of the christian church we will so easily be caught into that because the question they asked they had scripture for the question they asked was not a what we would say a wrong question it was a very scriptural question the problem was they missed the point
