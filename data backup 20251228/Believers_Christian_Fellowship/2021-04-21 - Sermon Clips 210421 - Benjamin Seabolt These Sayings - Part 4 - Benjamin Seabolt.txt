========================================

when that politically backed religious persecution comes i am not going to be the one when they close the church doors to say well i can take i can take that i can handle that what else you got i'll stick around for more no saints when i see a politically backed persecution in the smallest form i'm looking for my atoms to change i'm not here to be a tough guy i'm not here to get stuck in the combine and get ground away to dust i'm not here to bounce around in a combine have you ever seen a corn of wheat go or a air corn go through a combine it is not a fun process it's bouncing around it's going up and down and sideways in every other way it's getting belts run all over top of it they're probably the most amazing machine ever invented just by the way but i'm not here to say that feels good or i can take some more or what else you got when i see a politically backed religious persecution against the true bride of christ i don't even say it this much i don't even have to have it come my way if i see it come your way that's good enough for me that's a that fulfills the scripture i'm good to go i'm good to go take me out of here so it's not about you know preaching this way so we get tough and we resist it and no saints i'm looking for the garner but i'm not going to defy prophecy and scripture to get there i want to have a proper understanding and i want to die daily and get my shock away from me i want to have a proper revelation and say these other things now to get my shock away from me not worried about the other shock i want to get my shock away from me by saying these things and repeating these things so that i can say my doctrine is not my own it is he that sent me i am who i am by the grace of god and i'm willing to do what the scriptures say i must do for my hybridization to pass off the scene
