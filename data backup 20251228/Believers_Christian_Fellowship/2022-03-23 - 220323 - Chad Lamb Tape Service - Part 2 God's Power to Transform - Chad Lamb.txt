in prayer dear lord jesus we thank you for the privilege to be here this evening to gather together lord in peace like this to be able to put our licks of fire together and worship you lord and be warmed together in your presence god as we turn our attention to your word god we listen to this tape lord we hear the voice that you chose to speak this message through in this generation oh how we are privileged people lord may you take the words that will be spoken drive them into our heart lord and bring changes in our life and bring fruit lord from that seed that will be planted in our heart and may it bear fruit for your glory i pray that you'd bless your people tonight that you would take preeminence in all that we say and do and may we bless you lord in our praises and bless you and our approach to your word we ask lord that you would watch over all of this in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and go to the opening scripture that brother branham turned to in the beginning in romans chapter 12. also i'd like to inform everybody that we have a special treat this evening we've got a baptism tonight our young brother levi brooks has desired to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so we're very excited to see him baptized and very excited for the brooks family so let's read now in romans chapter 12. this is the scripture brother branham began with verse 1 or 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god also if you could turn with me to isaiah 14 there's two other scriptures that he's going to get into in this section that we're going to listen to tonight and the first one is isaiah 14 and verse 12 isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north so this is a scripture reference brother venom will refer to in the tape tonight and also one more and second thessalonians chapter two ii thessalonians chapter two 2 thessalonians 2 and verse 3 and verse 4. let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god amen god bless the reading of his word you can have your seats uh last time we started at the beginning and we went to uh page 14 but we're going to back up just a little bit just to catch a little bit of the context we were in and we're going to begin on page 12 and we're going to start at the beginning of paragraph 80. so we're going to start at page 12 the beginning of paragraph 80 and we will go to the bottom of page 26 to 9. so i'm going to go through a quick review last time with the question since it's been two weeks since we were here for this tape the first question we asked was what is the bible and we got the answer from the prophet of god it is god in letter form it is the word of god and it is god but it's god in letter form and we ask what does the word transform mean it means to be changed then the next question was what is the channel that every seed must stay in and that is his line of the word we the the every seed must stay in the channel of god's word and if it stays in the channel of god's word every seed will bring forth what god designed for it to bring forth because he put the power of transformation in the seed it's already in the seed if the seed stays in the line of the word then it'll produce everything that god put in it but from before that's powerful friends for us that is powerful because god placed a seed within us from before the foundation of the world and what must we do to transform ourselves what must we do amen for all the potentials in the seed to come out all we have to do is stay in the line of his word and if we stay in the line of the word everything will come out amen amen the next question what what power does the enemy have we know that god placed within the seed the power of transformation by his word but what power did the enemy have was the power to deform the power of deformation not transformation and what does he do with that power he makes his own eden so that's the review from last time that's what we picked up on last time and now let's go to our questions if we can bring up the powerpoint brother franco and we'll go to our questions now all right question number one what was satan's purpose from eden sometimes these questions would be worded a little funny but you'll find out in the tape why it's worded that way i worded it as close to the way brother branham says it as possible like i said last time there's no trick questions there's nothing odd this is just the way it was worded there what was satan's purpose from eden question 1 what was satan's purpose from eden so that means satan has had a purpose for 6 000 years and uh what can quicken the word what can quicken the word question number two what can quicken the word and then question number three how did satan deform the original seed how did satan deform the original seed tell you what as we go through this you could preach a sermon on each question brother branham if you caught it last time in that first 45 minutes or so we listened to brother branham dropped so many gold nuggets he taught so much doctrine and packed it in that it's hard to hold yourself back but question three how did satan deform the original seed and question four what is the true thinking man's filter so he preaches this message just a short time after he preached thinking man's filter and so he discusses that a bit in this section we're getting into what is the true thinking man's filter what is the true thinking man's filter and then question number five what what is satan's business like i said before you can answer that all kinds of ways but if you'll wait and just see how brother branham handles that and the way he words it what is satan's business amen question number five what is satan's business now as we begin here in paragraph 80 you're going to find that brother branham as we talked about before he's preaching this uh september 11 1965 towards the end of his ministry he's preaching it for the full gospel businessman fellowship for the breakfast at the ramada inn in phoenix arizona and you can tell as he gets into this part that brother branham is really laboring in a real evangelistic style to try to get the people to see the condition of the church to open their eyes to what's all around them and you can see that he the prophet of god is laboring to get the the people that are there to see what the systems has produced and where pentecost the pentecostal revival has gone and he's really laboring to do that and so you can catch his burden as you as you listen to this tape so we're going to begin now on on page 12 paragraph 80. brother frank if you can go ahead and start the tape for us now satan is the author of civilization he is the author of science he is the author of education he says that true all right let us read in god's word now genesis 4 and let's go back and just see for a minute i know i may if i get too long brother carl will probably tell me but uh genesis the fourth chapter in the 16th verse gold's head telling here in the beginning what god did in order to place the curse upon the man and the woman and all that they was to do not the curse on them but tell them what would happen to curse the ground for adam's sake and we find out here now that eve had a pair of twins and one of them was of satan and one of them was of god now you say oh no now brother brent just a minute you find me one scripture anywhere that says that cain was adam's son i'll show you in the scripture where it says cain was of that evil one not adam now notice when she conceived here we begin at the fourth chapter first and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten she said now i have gotten a son from the lord of course the head of me no matter if it was prostitute or anything had come from god see because that's his seed it's a law of a seed it has to bring forth where this corrupted seed perverted seed or whatever it is it's got to bring forth anyhow it's his command and she again bear his brother abel no more knewing adam knew his wife and she bear came and also bear able twins satan was with her that morning adam that after you and you see the big fuss in the paper here i believe the tucson now that woman bringing forth a colored child and a white child at the same time she lived with her husband that morning and the man that afternoon and the man would take care of the white man said take care of his own child but the colored man would have to take care of his own see i know that in breeding of dogs and so forth it certainly will if it's in a few hours afterwards this proves now the show where civilization come from now let us read genesis over here uh uh in the fourth chapter of genesis again and see where the 16th verse and cain went out from the presence of god and dwelt in the land of nod on the east side of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enough and he built a city and called the name of the city after his son enoch civilization dr scofield here in my scofield bible says the first civilization notice then he begot sons and they made organs and music the next one begot sons and he began to do other things wonders build cities and and make uh instruments of brass and all kinds of things see that's what he did become the first civilization which was canaanite peace done the same thing down through the ages now let's get there with the 25th verse and watch what the next was and adam knew his wife again now and she bear a son and call his name seth for god said she has appointed me another seed instead of abel who came through and saith and to say up to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos and then began man to call upon the name of the lord out of the south side not the canaanite side see that great intellectual that we all so hold to what's communism today what's their god it's the intellectual science what are we doing anyhow where are we living consider these words today now he has his kind of an eden satan does now in these 6 000 years he has formed not created but deformed god's whole earth is creatures the animals integrating high breeding trees plants human even to religion the bible church until he's got himself a complete garden of eden of science everything moving by science automobiles everything that we have was given to us by science what man has done and he's got his great eden here to prove the message is timely to prove that it's not some other age but revelations 10. look at the high breeding today to make a better or prettier not a better look at little children today i had my daughter to a dentist yesterday and he said her teeth was twisting brother down in tucson brother norm and had his little daughter and her teeth was bucking out and the dentist says that soon he believes that maybe in times to come that people be born he's growing anyway it's the food that we're eating hybrid food did you read reader's digest last month about billy graham the noble advances have you been listening to him i pray for him now more than ever when he's talked to those turned around callers and so forth the other night laying it on that clergy something's happened to him one of these days i hope he sees his position where he's at notice now calling from sodom that perverted city and now notice this in readers digest billy had gotten so weak that he couldn't even hold his meetings and they told him he had to run take exercise and so forth she runs a mile each day i believe it is there's something to get extra sign man is rotten the whole human race is corrupted everything is like it wasn't antelopian time it's completely upset turned around different from the straight rule that god planted them in sin through science and deception has twisted the whole human race did you read also just below that article word said in in these days that little girls and boys are in their middle age according to physical structure between 20 and 25 years old think of it it's determined the other night i picked up a girl 22 years old in menopause called rotten that's what a doctor told her see it's a pollen degenerate hellbound race of corruption i know that sounds not ethical but it's biblical that it is true this race that we're living in this generation of people now notice today high breeding cattle high breeding plants and science comes right back around the same science that does it says that it's what's destroying the whole human race you read it the same as i do oh why don't this stop it is because that they can't stop it god's word is said it would be that way but if they think for a minute there are the instruments as judah says carrot placing exactly the thing that god said would happen it's doing it just exactly on their own basis of sign by his scientific research in the same pattern he deceived eve he also has to see the church which eve was a type now now adam a type there again or any brother of the church notice what it did through the wandering for knowledge she slips across the line between right and wrong by listening to satan's perversion or deformity of the original word of god and now the churches today has become deformed i'm not talking about the peoples the individuals i'm talking about the church world once twisted one way and one twisted another and by signs same pattern that it is he has carried out his threats satan has of isaiah 14 12 let's just read that for a minute in the book of isaiah let's begin the 14th chapter 12 first how art by falling from heaven o lucifer sun of the morning power thought cast down to the ground which dideth weaken the nations this is isaiah seeing him in a vision see in the age to come for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will set also upon the mount of the congregation the side and the gnar satan's purpose from eden was to make his own self of eden and exalt himself above so the stars of god would worship him son but worship him and he's absolutely carried out now and when he's done this and brought it into the church which i won't go in details any of it listen to them tapes know about him that that's exactly the hour we're living in and it's satan that's done it through educational programs better fit better this better that and not knowing all the time they're walking right straight into death blinded leading the blind blinded leaders of the nations blinded leaders of science blind leaders of the church blind leading the blinded jesus said let them alone they'll both fall in the ditch here notice the type of the two eden so closely typed together to almost deceive the very elected matthew 24 24 said that it would be that way but i want us to stop for a few moments and consider these two eden and one thing especially how the bible tells us that god's word did produce that eden and how god's word warns us that the other eden would come now we also know that there has got to be another eden if we would also listen to the prophet paul in 2nd thessalonians the second chapter i could read it if you want to he who exalts himself that day will not come of the lord until that man of sin be revealed he who sets in the temple of god exalting himself above all that's called god so that he as god is worshipped as god think of that now isaiah 14 the prophet said that he saw lucifer in his heart to a vision under inspiration of god saying he would do that in isaiah 800 years before paul or approximately that now here 800 years later paul's season comes to his position notice it heads up is eden his scientific eden with his scientific world with a scientific bride church all under the the word of knowledge great seminary great degree educational program listen brother sister each one of us is going to walk that road to florence what i asked you in jesus name to consider this not consider it me i'm your brother that that isn't it consider the word that i'm speaking of god's bible and look through perfectly vindicated in god's own word in the age we're living in where we're at these programs are absolutely antichrist in themselves now he's got to have an eden he said he would do it here's a simple word of god saying he would do it and here we look right out and seen him do it he's done it with his intellectual scientific denominational bride he's going to take head one of these days in the world council of churches that'll be set up all will be with him kind the people not because they're bad people they were planted in that straight row like corn but satan sowed the creepers called science research education doctor's degree sometimes they won't even let you in a pulpit unless you can produce a doctor's degree from some seminary somewhere it's all wrong not the people it's the program it's wrong and now what's it done it's all headed up again and brought the whole entire world through a bunch of hybriding perversion of the original seed of god to another darkened chaos but i'm so glad that god is mindful of us again that he could still move upon the face of the condition he promised he'd do it and call a little flop which would be his bride notice here again now how perfect these churches type are these eden god through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the life giver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is now notice what's happened in the garden of eden was god's economy of innocence and that was one of the um the dispensations the first dispensation was innocent the people knowed no sin they didn't know anything about sin both adam and eve were naked but they were hid from their nakedness by a spirit veil over their face they never knew that they were naked at all because they were here for god's veil in their own mind they didn't know what right and wrong was and then both standing there naked showed that the knowledge had not yet come to them that they were naked the pair was naked and knew it not now if you'll turn if you wish you'll write it down to revelations the third chapter the holy spirit predicted in this last age to the lady of sia pentecostal church age and the last days it said thou art naked and blind and knoweth not there is god's seed under innocence not knowing at all they were naked under a veil of the holy spirit bailing them from sin and now in the last church age we find here that they're naked again and don't know it but it's not the holy spirit veil it's the veil that satan slipped over eve back there a veil of lust the lust veil they are so filthy so they don't know that they are naked are women on the street with sharks on sexy dress someone sent me a piece in the paper the other day of this new dress that they're going to wear i think the 14 inches from the hips are something and um i wonder if our of our women folks does realize that that is a lust fail now you you say i can prove before god that i'm innocent of any adultery to my husband or i i all this but still at the judgment you're going to be called an adulteress the bible said so jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart blind naked and don't know it not them poor little women out there it's nothing i got against them it's that evil and the system of the church seems to fail to recognize it or stand against it let them bubble up their hairs wear makeup and shorts and things under the name of christianity what a horrible thing it is see they're naked again and satan's eden and those if not they don't know it i believe i've seen perhaps looking across sure the swimming pool at women out there now if that woman only realized that what she's doing but she doesn't know it she's naked her body is sacred she strips off the clothes that god clothed her with with skin for this generation she constantly cuts it off she's naked under the word of civilization higher education better civilization higher ethics let me be sure that this soaks in is all of the devil and will be destroyed at the coming of the lord jesus amen it'll be destroyed every bit of it there won't be one thing left oh friend across the nation as you're listening to me here in phoenix think of those things you are here subject to them now jesus said that they would deceive the elected if possible the first spirit was a first veil was a holy veil holy spirit and she wasn't supposed to look out of that but when satan began to talk to her about knowledge she just had to take a little peep at the world that's exactly what her daughter the church has done you have to see you have to dress like uh some movie star our young man has to act like uh elvis presley or or pat boone or or some of those people under the name of religion pat boone's the church of christ elvis presley's a pentecostal two demonized characters that stole the world in a worse chaos than judas is carrick did at the betraying of jesus christ they don't know him them boys don't know that nothing that i have against those those boys man it's the spirit that's motivating him just step over on that side one bit let that creeper just get one little hole around the shuck of that corn one time watch what takes place the corn is gone oh yeah done got it and that's the way it'll do it he'll do it every time eve had to take just one peep at the world and let me say something to you brother and sister in first john the second chapter in the 15th verse we can read if you wish to the bible says if we love the world are the things of the world it's because the love of god is not even in us now the word there is not earth if the greek word is cosmos which means the world's order if we love fashions of the earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time or we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it is perverted by the devil or if you love the world's order and the things of this present world is because the love of god is not even in you remember that oh god look what we're looking into here i want to stop just a minute and tell you a little story i heard a chaplain from the first world war they throw um like satan at the beginning when he come into the garden of eden he could not dig up those seeds he could not destroy him but he sprayed them with poison and it deformed the seed it didn't bring forth its right kind it deformed the original seed and that's what all these programs of religion they are still sons and daughters of god but being deformed they go to church wanting to do right a nun never enters a nunnry to be a mean woman a minister never goes through school just to be a a bad man you never join church and shake hands put your name on the book or whatever you do in your church to be a bad person you do that to be a good person but it's the deception it's the deformity that does it satan sprayed it god never had an organization there's no such a thing anywhere found in the words of god god is our organization we're organizing him a body and god in heaven that's right our names are on the lamb's book of life notice but you see i know it's very hard but i want you to suffer just a little longer if you will in the time of the world's war excuse me for getting away from my subject but to make this point i i wanted to give you my analysis of what satan done in eden spring horrible poison spree would you like to know what this spray was i can tell you i got the farmer of it two words unbelief which is contrary to faith spread unbelief doubt and science filled its place where the cavities that went into the sea satan filled that cavity with knowledge and science and civilization and it's deformed the whole entire creation of god i know you think i'm getting you on a limb but i'm on the lamb with you and we're all here to try to find what we can do we don't say those things to be different we must be honest we each one come down to the end of the road where we're going to give account for every word right now we know that our voices when we are born a reversal of crime goes on a tape it's going to be played back against the day of judgment even the clothes you wear will be shown your face at the day of judgment even science has found that by television see television doesn't manufacture a picture it only channels it the color closed every time you move every thoughts in your mind is absolutely kept on god's record that big thing will be laid right before you every one of them filthy dresses you wore every time you went to the barber shop cut that hair that god gave you it's going to be your answer for you can't make a move right there it is even the thoughts of your heart while you're going to be played right before you how you go to escape how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation we're not going to escape every move and the thoughts of the heart is recorded right in another dimension even the color clothes you wear television color television proves that rhino pulls it out and shows it that's just one dimension from the three that we live in now [Music] how the poison has struck the church struck the earth satan's uh poison upon the seeds that put cavities in it and cause it to be deformed more and more he shanks deeper into the hearts of the churches in the hearts of the people and everything science science until it's become a place for the human race by being interbred i believe every seed should bring forth of its kind and the human race and the plant and all being in a bread has brought us to a place in eating our food from the earth which our bodies have made hybrid it's put our whole minds now if our bodies are falling it from 20 to 25 years old because of degenerated cells the hybrid foods don't our brain cells degenerate isn't that cells also that's why ricky runs through the street near this hot rod while ricketta elvis and them as we call name out here half naked before the people mentally gone no more conceptions of decency immoral my little story this chaplain said you've been down in the hospital and said so many boys laying the temp some just come from the outside said he went out there and some officer told him the chaplain we want to ride out to take a look at the fields out there that throw this mustard and chlorine gas as they did in them days said i got out there brother brown said there wasn't a bark on a tree during the spring of grass it was only easter morning he said there's some old wrecked tanks down there the officer had to get record of them and see if there's anything to be done for them near the great argonne forest said when i was standing there by myself they looked up said oh god this is the way it's all coming to that's right it's all coming this all burn up no life no word on grass burn off the tree with that gases trees killed everything was killed twisted hanging down where bullets and things riddle it if that isn't a picture of the world today where satan spraying his unbelief his high breeding his science his knowledge until what it was at the beginning when god put adam and eve in the garden that beautiful paradise without death without sickness without sorrow and everything perfect in order look what satan's ddt has done she's a chaos earth nothing left in it he said i started crying i walked back i was attracted to a rock but i just went over there and looked at the rock pushed it over down beneath the rock was a little white flower growing the only living thing left because it'd been shellered by a rock god rama shelter us today oh god when these poisons are flying everywhere in the name of science and education shelter us keep me until that day oh god now i hope that we're each one or under that rock christ i just preached the other day many of you heard it was going down through the woods hunting and i was attracted to turn around and i looked nearly to empty cigarette carton or package or what you call it and it's the company i don't feel i should call their name but the tobacco company had they have a slogan a thinking men's filter a smoking man's taste i started walking on down a little further in woods and something attract me go back to that cigarette pack well heavenly father i'm going down here to that tree where those squirrels was spoke into existence by you one morning why would you call me back because something said you got a sermon coming for sunday your text is wrong on a cigarette pack i went back and i began to think a thinking man's filter what a deception that is if a man was a thinking man he wouldn't smoke at all but you see people swallow that i believe it's two years ago when i was in one of the conventions i went up to the world's fair when it's on the west coast and they had yule brenner's picture and many of them there and the scientists many of us in the same hall about the danger of smoking how they pull that smoke across a marble and tuck a little q-tip and tuck up the nicotine off there and put it on a rat's back put him in a cage in seven days he's full of cancer he couldn't even walk he said pulled it through water and said filter said filter there is no such a thing said now this is science himself they said you cannot have smoke unless you got tired power makes a smoke and the only thing it is is a gimmick to sell more cigarettes from that if i don't hope you think i'm sacrilegious or a fanatic that devil in a man that makes him smoke to kill himself when he he wants the nicotine of one cigarette that will supply his desire now the company comes out of this deceiving gamete and says a thinking mass filler you'll have to smoke four or five cigarettes to make a much tar in you to satisfy them as you did with the one american selling death to their brethren sisters i don't get it but yet in there i thought there is a thinking man's filter that's right now if a man was smoking remember it produces a smoking man's taste then if you cannot have us to feel the desire of a smoke until you get the smoke there it has to produce a taste so you smoke four cigarettes or five and pay more for it than you would just smoke one regular cigarette see it's a gimmick a sales gimmick deceiving the people americans when i think of valley forge george washington with two-thirds of his soldiers no shoes on their feet on that cold day to make us the economy we are in an american cell on merica and his brother and sister of death under a false gimmick for filthy lucra the root of all evil the crave of money love the whole thing's gone mad no not that this whole thing will perish but if you don't get no smoke you can't have the taste then i thought there is a thinking man's filter a thinking man's filter and i took my text from a thinking man's filter produces a holy man's faith so i thought that our denomination has done a whole lot like that take people in call themselves christians and just anyway why they get more in their denomination our organizations we get more in there because we let them come in under this that and the other anything i don't make any difference just so they put their name on the book and say they're christian that's all by faith you're saved you have to believe the devil does the same thing you've got to be born again and that comes through god's help now there is a thinking man's filter i'm holding it in my hand it won't produce a denominational taste but it'll certainly satisfy a holy man how could a bob-haired woman ever come through this filter how could a woman with shorts don't ever come through it are slacks and the bible says it's an abomination to god for a woman to put on a garment that even pertains to a man and how can a man that thinks anything of himself get out here and dress like a woman let his hair grow out like a woman down his eyes with bangs and twirled up like that he's wearing his wife's underneath clothes she's wearing his outer clothes a thinking man's filter a thinking man won't do that or a thinking woman won't do it right god's word won't let it pass through there isn't one thing can pass through that word that's the holy spirit and it brings the word into you and it produces a holy man's taste look at the day ricketta on the street lovely beautiful anatomy god gave to her and satan using it and she'll dress so immorally not knowing that a week from today she may be rotten in the grave coming down the street you're not long ago with preaching a convention in the assemblies of god over on the west coast in a meeting out to the southwestern bible school a little lady walking down the road with a little little clothes on bikinis there what you call it and branch hanging around the cowboy hat and boots i was going up the road i thought poor little feller some mother and dad's child was put here to be a daughter of god has become a bait trap of the devil i thought i believe i'll just turn around and go back and tell that kid she looked to be about age of my sarah there 17 years 16 years old or something i thought no i better not i'll just go up here on the road and pray for somebody seen you stop and talk to her i better not do it now and listen sons of god you get that same place these jezebels of the day play up to you but a faking man will think first she may be so pretty that maybe i can make a hit with her but it'll cost you your soul boy some of you girls to these ricky's thinking man's filter produces a holy man's face you married man when you see them women on the street like that you sons of god don't you realize what's taking place in the first beginning when science had made women so pretty in the andalusian world until the sons of god took daughters of man not daughters of god and god never did forgive it they destroyed the whole faith science really used to be you notice the beauty of women lifting in the last days is a sign of the end god's prudence so use a thinking man's filter you'll have a holy man's faith it'll cost you your home it'll cost you your position it'll cost you everything you've got besides that your soul it'll break up your home you may have another man raise your children another woman raise your children take a thinking man's filter it'll produce a holy woman's taste when she starts the barber shop or something you tell you go to have a headache take a thinking woman's filter but the bible's that thing and turn away from it don't you do it i'm your brother and i love you nothing i have against you god knows that's what makes me say the things i do is because of a love of god for you if a man go out there and they won't tell you another pastor let you sit around and act like that he don't love he you love you i wouldn't want that kind of love for the women i want to have a holy taste for my sister or really be my sister not somebody said somebody talked about being so pretty and how she is and a little sex queen she goes to my hunt or a lady oh lord keep me under the rock yes in ephesians 5 26 the only one way you can get through that rock that's washed by the waters of separation by the word that's right now don't let this devil spray you with his education no no it'll kill the influence of you don't let the devil take that well i belong to the church that my mother belonged to it my father my grandmother don't let the devil spray you with that the bible is already said on the seven church ages and things there it's all gone to seed right the whole thing is corrupt the whole thing is a putrified sower don't let him spray you say well it's higher ethics we're more educated we used to be in old days you let the devil put that over on you i've showed you his whole program is civilization education science he's got it right into the church and don't you listen to that keep your head on old dirty televisions and things our text says be not conformed but be transformed not go and say i was confirmed sunday no going to be transformed right now transform from what you are to what god wants you to be now it depends on what kind of seed that's in you if an intellectual educational seed has been placed in you there's only one thing it can do deform you that's all to a son or daughter of god the only thing you can do people of the day as i look out they act like they don't even believe there is a god pardon this expression if anybody feelings is hurt for this i don't mean it a couple sundays ago i was invited by my own daughter to come in to a television set and to watch a religious singing that sunday morning i want to hear oral roberts on his program i told him let me know i said you hear this this is a great hymn saying my son standing there told me about it two i'll turn that set we rent from a woman that has the television in her house i never intend to have one in my house no sir i want that thing in my house i'd blow it out with my shotgun nothing to do with that evil thing but let me tell you about your arizonans you've seen that analysis the other day of schools that yeah eighty percent of the children in arizona schools are suffering with mental deficiency 67 percent of them was by looking at television how about that you better use your shotgun [Music] now don't let the devil spray you then no sir now people as i said uh people act like they don't have to come to judgment these boys and girls that had some indian family and a whole lot of stuff i think a fellow named mr pool it was the head of it and if i ever seen a modern mockery of hymns it was way they handled it a bunch of ricky stand there shaking their hands up and down i certainly appreciate that young man here this morning and saying look decent like a real man i i like that when you your business man sometime here get a bunch of these ricky's that stand here hoop and holler and carry on and hold their breath to their blue in the face and that's not singing that's just making a lot of scientific noise singing his melody from the heart [Music] i thought what a pity what a shame it is so how under the name of religion they act like there is no god someone said the other day to avoid goals of my daughter christian boys that give a smart remark about adam and eve said eve going through the garden said children you see a tree there so that's where your mother eat us out of house and home could you imagine supposed to be a staunch christian that would take a promise in a word of god and throw it they act like they don't have to come to judgment but god will bring every secret into judgment they act like there's no god i don't want to call him a fool because the bible said that fool uh not right jesus said this don't call old man a fool but in psalm 14 1 the fool said in his heart there is no god they're not i don't want to call them fools but they act like they are they act like it so you see where we're at today like there is no god i belong to church now all the whole thing the bible's a big joke our church knows where they're going yeah right straight to hell exactly right on the road right down to science and education theological seminaries and things just raise them right down the road the holy spirit doesn't have a chance to give a revelation or nothing the seminaries don't got to cut out the holy spirit to lead us not a seminary not bishops and overseers and so forth the holy ghost is our leader cain was such a person is that he was a very religious indeed now if religion is all that you have to have then god was unjust by condemning king because he was religious he's just as religious and sincere as abel was now remember he thought of god he worshipped god he had a church he built an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he rejected no matter how esau was also in religion see that's satan's business not to kill the whole thing but just contaminate it that's all he ain't going to kill the whole thing oh not communist no no the antichrist is not communism the bible said it would deceive the elected if it was possible don't notice the iron curtain but the purple one amen you can see how brother branham is trying to get the people to see the condition of the day and boy is he brave he's standing in the face of opposition with every kind of denomination facing him and he's calling it out amen because he had a commission to do he had something that he had to do and i respect the man for that he was rejected for it even there in the phoenix convention we know in brother perry green's testimony that the wives of some of the leadership there in the full gospel businessmen fellowship wanted them to stop inviting brother branham because the way he preached against women and preached against fashion and brother williams is the one who stood up for him and brother williams is the reason that he was there preaching that that day and brother williams got up if you remember last time in the beginning and he made the statement he says we'll always brother branham is always welcome here as long as i'm here because if it wasn't for him they would have kicked him out they didn't want to have that anymore and he knew that and still preached that that day i thank god for a man with a spine a man who will stand on his convictions and say what needs to be said and you can say he wasn't saying it hateful and he wasn't offended to the people he had nothing against them but he wanted them to see the condition he's so bad one of them have eyes to see and i thank god that we had a prophet who would tell the truth amen because who else is telling the truth amen let's go to our questions now uh question number one what was satan's purpose from eden if we go to look at paragraph 102 we'll begin here to look at this paragraph 10 let's start at 101. let's just read that for a minute in the book of isaiah let's begin the 14th chapter the 12th verse how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer's son of the morning how art thou cast down to the ground which did weaken the nations this is isaiah seeing him in a vision seeing in the age to come for thou has said in thy heart i will send into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation the sides in the north satan's purpose from eden was to make his own self an eden and exalt himself above so the stars of god would worship him sons would worship him and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this and brought it into the church so it we look we know from last time that satan's purpose his plan over the last six thousand years was to bring his own eden but what was the purpose of that eden what was satan's eating to do he says brother bam tells us here so that the stars of god would worship him sons would worship him he what he was trying to do was exalt himself over the sons of god so that the sons of god would worship him that's why he brought this this eden this scientific intellectual religion and brought it into the church amen so that the sons of god would worship him it was all his attempt to exalt himself over the word of god so he had to bring a deformity to the way god made his children and when the children were in line with the word they were unstoppable undefeatable and they were over satan but when he deformed them now he wants to rise above them and now they're worshipping him that's why brother bram tells us in another place in the message millions worshiping the devil and don't even know it they're doing it and what he said in churches and so that was the purpose for making this eden he's trying to divert worship away from god and exalt himself over the sons of god and receive the worship that's due to god and he's been extremely successful in doing that but god has sent a message to break his yoke to expose all of his trappings so now we don't have to worry about our worship being devoted to a false god or being directed misdirected if we come back to the word that's been given to us and stay in line with that word our worship is going back to god and satan by god's grace will be put under our feet no longer will be exalted over the sons of god but the sons of god by the word of god will go right back into their rightful position amen and immediately will put satan into his position amen so i thank god that god has sent a message to break that power of satan's eden the next question we had was what can quicken the word let's go to paragraph 112. paragraph 112. what can quicken the word god through a seed of his word there's only one thing that can quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the life giver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is amen what will make the seed of god's word that's plant in our hearts grow when the spirit moves over it it'll quicken it amen what about the seed that god planted into your soul when the spirit moves in it'll quicken it to life when the life and the spirit in the life in the word and the seed they come together it produces exactly what's in the seed whether it's the seed in you or the seed of the word the spirit will quicken it to life why it's the same life it's the same life in the spirit same life in the word and when those two come together it'll quicken amen whatever god purposed in that seed question number three how did satan deform the original seed let's look at paragraph 130. we're going to spend a little bit of time on this one how did satan deform the original seed paragraph 130 on page 19 like satan at the beginning when he come into the garden of eden he could not dig up those seeds he cannot destroy amen what god had created so because he cannot destroy it and he cannot create the only option he has is to prefer pervert and deform amen so so i mean if you think about that satan cannot stop the word of god so what does he try to do he tries to deform or pervert your understanding of the word of god so that you don't take all the word of god or you misunderstand it or misrepresent it or misquote it because he knows he can never overcome the pure word of god so he brings through through religion through uh churches through a theological understanding a misunderstanding or a misplacing or a misquoting of scripture amen and he strips us of the power that god has given us but when we come back to the pure word with the true interpretation of the word he cannot stand against that he cannot destroy it that's why he's always trying to pervert it it's important to understand it's important for us to understand he could not dig up those seeds he could not destroy them but he sprayed them with poison and it deformed the seed it didn't bring forth its right kind it deformed the original seed and that's what all these programs of religion they are still sons and daughters of god but it's being deformed they go to church wanting to do right a nun never enters a nunnery to be a mean woman a minister never goes through school just to be a bad man you never join church and shake hands to put your name on the book or whatever you do in your church to be a bad person you do that to be a good person but it's the deception it's the deformity that does it satan sprayed it and god never had an organization there is no such thing anywhere found in the words of god skip down to paragraph 134 but to make this point i want to give you my analysis of what satan done in eden sprayed horrible poison spray would you like to know what that spray was i can tell you i got the formula in two words unbelief which is contrary to faith sprayed unbelief doubt and science filled its place where the cavity is that went into the seed satan filled that cavity with knowledge science civilization and has deformed the whole entire creation of god so what did he do what what was the poison he sprayed it with unbelief he got them to doubt the word and got them to move away from the word amen he sprayed it with unbelief and into the cavity that was formed when that that poison was sprayed in he filled it with knowledge science civilization and deformed the entire creation of god why because god's entire civilization was based upon faith in the garden of eden everything was based upon faith and now he brings in reasoning and when he began the reasoning and he got eve to reason about the word amen and through unbelief he sprayed the seed and brought a deformity through science intellect reasoning wisdom and all of these things amen when god's original intention was for his children just to believe a whole eden was based on faith god had to believe his own word in order he had to speak it and believe his own word for it to come to pass so the entire thing was based on faith and he wanted his children to operate by faith and as long as they operated by faith in the word everything was in harmony but as soon as satan moved them off of faith in the original word now deformity said in perversion by the poison spray of unbelief that's why in order for god to restore the woman back and to put him back in the garden of eden first he must bring the word back into the right line so that she can have faith again because the civilization we're going to he said is not a civilization of science he said you won't have your automobiles and airplanes in this next one that's to come it's a civilization of faith again people who believe the word of god are going to be set up in a civilization of faith once again not science but with faith they'll do more than science could anyhow science and scientific achievement and scientific understanding you know we always wonder what's what's wrong with science brother branham was the one who laid it out and goes all the way back to genesis chapter four to show that all those scientific discoveries city building and arts and crafts and all of this stuff came from from satan's line through cain and he goes to show us that to show us that that that science if we look at even science today and the things that it's done for us the whole field of science is to to remove your requirement or need for faith i mean you don't even have to take your hand and physically open a door anymore you just walk up and they move everything is is being taken care of for us amen so that there's no need there's no need for faith there's no need to believe all you need to do is understand science and the whole world is operating by science but god doesn't want us to operate that way he wants us to operate by faith praise god that's why he restored his word let's look here at paragraph 137 in the same subject now how the poison has struck the church struck the earth satan's poison upon the seeds has put cavities in it and caused it to be deformed more and more he sinks deeper into the hearts of the churches and into the hearts of the people everything science science until it's become a place where the human race by being interbred i believe every seed should be fourth of its kind in the human race and the plan all being interbred has brought us to a place in eating our food from the earth which our bodies has been has made hybrid it's putting our whole minds now if our bodies are falling from 20 to 25 years old because of degenerated cells by hybrid foods don't our brain cells degenerate brother branham is just it's amazing how a simple seventh grade education can pick out the obvious and the simple if all your sales are generating because of hybrid food and scientific achievement your brain operates by cells too doesn't it our brain cells degenerate isn't that cells also that's why ricky runs through the street here with his hot rod while raquetta elvidas and many of them as we would call name out here half naked before people mentally gone no more conceptions of decency or morals what has brought the human race to this science scientific achievement that would get more production out of a field by changing the seed could get more production could get more productivity out of you by giving you things to organize your tasks to the things to simplify your day computerized things gadgets and apps and all of these things what's it about getting more production out of the field getting more production out of human beings amen driving satan's eden further and further and further and what has it done it has degenerated the humans and degenerated brother branham says why does ricky run around in his hot rod because the food's been in her bread who else can make that connection that the mental illness that we're seeing on the level we're seeing it in this generation is tied right back to scientific achievement the deformity and degeneration of god's original plan for a seed to bring forth after its kind man has manipulated it and manipulated that he's beginning to destroy himself so that man is losing his mind and now we have silly debates going on in society on whether or not who a boy who thinks he's a girl can compete with the girls and some of us who had a renewal of our mind by the word of god are looking at that and saying what on earth are people thinking to where now you know there's laws that are being passed in countries and there's laws on the books that people are trying to pass that will forbid you as parents to name your child with a gender-specific name or use gender-specific pronouns until your child is old enough to know themselves whether they're a boy or girl and it can be considered child abuse for use used for you as a parent to use gender gender specific pronouns to label your children until they've had the opportunity themselves to determine whether they're a boy or girl or not my goodness this is what science has achieved this is what a scientific based civilization has come to and if you say anything about it that you're the one with problems you know you have hate speech and no love and you're ignorant and uneducated i'm saying i don't want your education if you can't even determine what's male and female i don't want your education it's not going to do me any good it doesn't work and so now you have you have now the women who wanted equal rights they wanted the the compete in a man's world and be treated equal with a man now they're screaming because men are now competing in their sports and they're losing all their medals i say you got what you wanted you're equal my goodness and only a prophet can tie that back to hybrid food scientific achievement this is what science has proved that's why friends we have to have a renewing of our minds because we're eating the same foods other people are eating that's why more than ever you should bow your head and pray before you stick that in your mouth because the same food that makes them not know whether they're male or female is the same food we have to eat but we're living by faith not off science and faith can overcome science [Music] amen and we wonder so many times why uh a mental illness is on the rise and depression is on the rise and all of these different things are on the rise it's because of what science has done amen the environment the chemicals the the hybridization the foods the the the even this visual stimulation from all the electronics and all the entertainment it is all corrupting humanity from what god intended it to be and that's why we as believers have to have a renewing of our minds we've got to continually be going back to that renewing of our mind by the word of god so that we don't fall trapped to the same thing amen so so god is going we're not going to have a civilization of science thank god praise be to god let's look at paragraph 140 again or next if that isn't a picture of the world today where satan is spraying his unbelief his hybriding his science his knowledge until what it was at the beginning when god put adam and eve in the garden that was beautiful paradise without death without sickness without sorrow and everything in perfect in order look what satan's ddt has done she is a chaos there is nothing left in it amen after reading this i mean i really earnestly pray over my food now more than ever now it's not a ritual for me now i need god to help me because everything there's death in the pot there's death in every pot there's death in every outlet death and every resource death in every product because it all comes by man not by god and now we need to have the renewing of our minds day by day question number four what is the true thinking man's filtering paragraph 153 paragraph 153 at the top of page 23. then i thought there is a thinking man's filter a thinking man's filter and i took my text from a thinking man's filter produced a holy man's taste go down to paragraph 155 you got to be born again and that comes through god's filter now there is a thinking man's filter i'm holding it in my hand it won't produce a denominational taste but it'll certainly satisfy a holy man's taste you know so what is a the true thinking man's filter it's the word of god it's the bible that he's holding in his hands how could a bob tear woman ever come through this filter how could a woman with shorts would ever come through it are slacks when the bible says it's an abomination to god for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man how and how can a man that thinks anything of himself get out there and dress like a woman let his hair grow out like a woman down in his eyes with bangs and throw it up like that he's wearing his wife's underneath clothes she is wearing his outer clothes a thinking man's filter a thinking man won't do that or a thinking woman won't do that god's word won't let it pass through there isn't one thing could pass through that word that's the holy spirit and it brings the word into you and it produces a holy man's taste praise be to god question number five what is satan's business let's go to page 26 to paragraph 178 towards the bottom paragraph 178 cain was such a person as that he was very religious indeed now if religion is all that you have to have then god was unjust by condemning cain because he was religious he was just as religious and sincere as abel was now remember he thought of god he worshiped god he had a church he built an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he was rejected no matter how esau was also see religion see that is satan's business oh that's good religion see that is satan's business not to kill the whole thing but just contaminate it that's all he ain't going to kill the whole thing oh not communist no no the antichrist is not communism the bible said it would deceive the elect if it was possible don't notice the iron curtain but the purple one the catholic one the false religion the church he says religion is satan's business he not to kill the whole thing now listen that we understand that and the great the great uh concept that's been brought to us of the fallacy of denominations and false religion under the purple curtain and the mother having daughters and all of that but listen the the the devil he'll get into and if he can make the message religious and not personal then hasn't he done the same thing if he can if he can make the message just a form of religion and we can have a religion for religious form of worship in the message but take away the individual connection between you and christ amen you individually connected to a living god having met jesus christ personally and haven't even personally revealed to you but can move into the realm whereby a religious order of believing the message and being in a message church now i'm okay hasn't he accomplished the same thing so we can always say we see it here and we see it there but the devil hasn't quit working just because we come into a message church and say i believe the prophet he's still trying the same old tactics he's always trying so we've got to be careful that the message never becomes religion for us or we never let it become religion for our children amen but it has the message is personal amen it's not group it's never group it never it never will be group the message is to the individual this revelation is to one person and you decide who that person is but i've already decided who it is for me so satan that's his business is religion he's not going to try to kill the whole thing but contaminate it that's why we have to stay with the prophet we have to stay with the tapes and stay with what the prophet said because maybe his his method now is not to destroy the whole thing but to contaminate it but if we stay with what the prophet said we stay true to the message as it was given to us and not take our own ideas and not run two three four steps beyond the prophet but stay with what god brought us the way god brought it to us amen it'll keep us from allowing this message to be contaminated because god brought it to us in purity amen he brought it to us it was a humble vessel sure but it was pure the word was pure that came and let's stay with that never stop reading the books never stop listening to the tapes it'll keep you from taking a contaminated message we each one have to we each one have to receive the pure word from god's method god's form and it'll keep us inoculate us from taking a contaminated form amen just that was it for the questions but just a couple points i would like to bring out before we close let's go to paragraph 109 and we'll just do this quickly paragraph 109 and i'm going to start in the middle of the paragraph up here at the top of page 17. it says it's all wrong not the people it's the program that's wrong and now what what's it done it's all headed up again and brought the whole entire world through a bunch of hybriding perversion of the original seed of god to another darkened chaos what's he taking us back to he's taking us back to genesis 1 2. now he says it now it'll be darkness upon the earth gross darkness upon the people now in the laodicean church age we've come back to genesis 1 2. religiously through the religious world amen through the minds of men have come back to genesis 1 2 darkness covered the face of the deep but verse look at paragraph 110 but i am so glad that god is mindfulness of again that he can still move upon the face of the condition he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride amen there's darkness of poop there's darkness on the earth gross darkness upon the people we've come back to a religious chaos but in that the spirit of god once again moved over the waters and what did he do for you and i he parted the waters and so we could see the light and the light come down and set everything in order to bring us back into an eaten condition thank god for the word amen let's look at paragraph 127 i want to highlight something that he said here paragraph 127 on page 19 and let me say something to you brother and sister in first john the second chapter and the 15th verse we can read it if you wish to the bible says if we love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of god is not even in us i want to i want to highlight what he said but i also want to do that so we have a greater understanding so now the word there is not earth it's it's a greek word is cosmos which means the world's order if we love if we love fashions of the earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's perverted by the devil for if you love the world's order and the things of this present world it's because the love of god is not even in you because the love of god in you will have you long for a civilization based on faith now when i read this for two reasons one just to highlight what he said but also so that we understand that there is nothing wrong with loving god's creation so many of us you know you'll get out in nature you'll get out uh you'll see a mountain range you'll see a river you'll see a stream you'll see something god made and something in you comes alive when you say that that's not what he's talking about if you love the world it's not saying well i hate this old world i can't wait to leave this and then you know this creation still has god's fingerprint on it especially if you get out of civilization and get away from society and get separated from all those demon spirits and that scientific civilization and get back to more it's more in line with what he made amen you'll see it still has these markings of a great creator and you can love that all you want but it's this world order this world system if you love that the love of god is not even in you amen so many people love culture i don't love culture i love i want it the way god made it that's what i'm longing for to go back before it was cultured before it was civilized when it was ordered by faith in god's word that's what i longed to see let's finish with this paragraph 166. paragraph 166 and our text says be not conformed but be transformed not go in and say i was confirmed sunday no go in and be transformed right now transform from what you are to what god wants you to be how many wants to be transformed to what god wants you to be oh god i don't want to be what i am i want to be what you want me to be i want to be transformed by the renewing of my mind by by the by having the mind of christ has been given to us in this day amen god bless you let's stand brother levi if you and your folks want to go ahead and make it around back and brother bob brother bob's going to have the grand privilege of baptizing another grandchild what a special time for brother bob you guys can go ahead and move around back musicians if you want to come on up let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of all the people that are on this planet how many get to hear this word of all the human beings that are trapped in civilization knowledge hybridization corruption perversion they don't even know it lord it's all they have to live for is what science can bring and another achievement and another creature comfort but god i'm so thankful that you opened my eyes to see that you've given us lord your word and you've given us the renewal of our mind to be transformed not into this deformity of this civilization but transformed by the renewing of our mind to take the mind of christ to bring us back into the knowledge of what you wanted from the very beginning and god we ask that by the power of your spirit by the word that's been sent to us would you transform us lord changes from what we are to what you want us to be god for you put a life in the seed that's within each of us and god your word will bring it to pass lord your light of your word the washing of the water the word will bring this bring the life lord the fullness to what you wanted it to be and god we surrender to that let us live by faith lord so that we'd be candidates to live in a faith civilization help us to break our minds free from science and education and let us come back to simple faith in your word to believe your word to take you at your word to see your word as you showed it to us in this day god what a privileged people we are god what a privilege to sit together in a place like this and listen to your prophet's voice with like-minded believers lord that want to fellowship around this truth god i don't ever let me take this for granted oh god how special these times are how privileged we are may we all walk out of here so satisfied with your goodness so full of your love to recognize what it is you've done for
