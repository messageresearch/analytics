Glory and Honor in it all thank you Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you thank you amen God bless you praise God we can all stand amen she was sweet she just stared at me the whole time I don't know if she was frightened or mesmerized or what she did good it's uh while we're standing let's look into our Bibles in The Book of Leviticus and we'll begin there I want to let you know that brother Emmanuel sebasa was preaching for brother Burley Williams this morning so we want to pray for him and that wasn't really intended to be that way he was just going down to visit a friend that attends there and brother Burley got asked to take services and he heard through the grapevine that brother Emmanuel was coming so he tapped him last minute so brother Manuel thought he was going to visit friends and now he's preaching amen so we want to remember him this morning and also that they have traveling mercies coming home I just want to say I enjoyed the trip report Wednesday it was really nice to see what the Lord is doing and it was great to be on that trip amen and I preached eight services in just eight days and that's more than a month's worth of services and so I was really thankful Caleb or Kyle agreed to take the service because it gave me a little break and so I know he was tired too he was as tired as I was but I appreciate him stepping and doing that it was really nice it was wonderful and he was telling you at that service kind of how that came about some of the thoughts that he shared there was the capping off of a sermon that we had preached together I preached and he was supposed to preach the beginning but he ended up coming at the end and so I just felt in my heart to preach that sermon this morning so which is the sermon I preached last Sunday brother Danny Del Mundo's anniversary meetings so Brother Kyle you did get to set it off this time amen we went in the right order he went first and now I'll come so now we got it we got it arranged correctly amen so this morning I'd like to preach on the wave Chief is our example and let's begin in Leviticus 23 verse 9. Leviticus 23 and verse 9 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and saying to them when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf of the firstfruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the Sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it may God bless you as you take your seats amen I want to say welcome to Sister Paula Taylor God bless you it's good to have you in service with us it's been a while since we've seen you so it's good to have you here any other visitors you're more than welcome and say God bless you as well amen when we look at this subject we have talked about the wave Chief before but this is a thought that dropped into my heart several weeks before I left for the Philippines and I started meditating on it and working on it but so for the title is the wave Chief is our example and I want to read a couple quotes out of it is the rising of the sun to set the basis for the service this morning brother Manningham is referring to the wave Chief offering here that we just read out of Leviticus it was an order that was given to Moses to give to the children of Israel that when they come into their land amen and they begin to before they harvest their fruits they're supposed to take the first part of the Harvest the first part that comes the maturity and they're supposed to cut a Sheaf off of that and take it to the priests and the priest is to wave it before the Lord and this is very symbolic because it's symbolizing a thankfulness to the Lord amen for bringing another Harvest but they're also taking the first part of the field that came to harvest maturity amen and they're waving it it's also symbolizing that they're trusting God the same God who brought this to maturity will bring the whole field to maturity so it's it's a Thanksgiving but it's also a testimony amen it's a sign that God is going to continue the work and that they're going to have another Harvest and so this was instituted by God given to Moses Moses give it to the Levites and it was an order that was kept and brother Branham picks up on this and the message it is the rising of the sun he says notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat now he's speaking of Jesus Christ so brother Brahm is taking it to spiritual times now the first Corner Wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was the Sheaf that's why they had to wave the Sheaf or it was the first one that come to maturity it was waived as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign so now the wave Chief becomes a sign amen it's a sign that the rest of the field is going to finish the maturing process and come to full maturity in the Harvest and he goes on and says and today because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity to be in God he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people oh what a glorious Lesson by the quickening power the first one although he had been typed and many times as we see later that he was typed but this was really the first fruits of them that slept he was waived over the promised seed that had promise of life he was waived at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a a mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realize in the last day so brother bam showing us there was a spiritual waving of the sheath the first the first one to come to full Harvest maturity was Jesus Christ and he resurrected out of the dead and was waved back over the congregation on the day of Pentecost amen and and but he says it didn't stop there there's to be another waving of the Sheep in the last day amen he goes now I want to read that again to be waived again we realize in the last day according to Luke 17 30 in the Sunday again and the day that the son of man will be revealed or waived again over the people so the son of man is to be waived over the people again amen not just there on the day of Pentecost but in the last day he's to be waived over the congregation once more how many beliefs were in the last day how many believe he's been waived over the congregation amen so so oh let's just read this next quote and then we'll get into some things further down in the same message he says as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ so now we're looking at our day amen in the last day and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheep what was the Sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age so now he keeps pointing he keeps placing us the last day the day the son of man will be revealed and the bride age and the bride coming of Christ he's tying all of this together and showing us when this Chief will be waived amen now for the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism so what is the bride age it's a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power amen so we're living in the resurrection we're living in the resurrection out of dark denominationalism amen what resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is the first resurrection was the resurrection of Jesus Christ and now he came back Amen to be waived over the people in the day of Pentecost amen but what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is praise be to God amen all right the last sentence in this quote he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it's to be waived again in the last day so it's important to know what is being waived because what is being waived is the word made manifest so what I'd like to just make a a make a few statements to put all of our lining in the right spot amen what was waived was was not a person what was waived was the word and in our day what was waived was not a person what was waived was the word okay so it was the word the word made manifest that was waived and that was an indication amen of the Harvest time because the beginning of the Harvest time would be the cutting of the sheath and the waving before the Lord it notes that we're now in the harvest season amen we're now in Harvest time so we know that we're now in the harvest season we're now in Harvard the Harvest Time which is the last day which is the bright age which is the bride coming of Christ which will require another waving of the Sheaf to kick off the harvest season glory amen so I want to I want to look at this uh waving of the Sheaf and the word amen now when the chief was waived they would go to the field usually on the edge of the field where it got the most sunlight would would ripen the first amen not in the Middle where it's more shaded but over in the edge somewhere they would go and cut the sheath and they would cut a handful of stalks down had the wheat in and they would take all of that back and give it to the priest and the priest would take it before the Lord and wave it before the Lord now you realize that the purpose of waving the Sheaf was showing that the seed is mature it's a sign of maturity in the Harvest all right but more than just the seed was weighed because you have stock and you have shock and you have seed all being waved together you got that they didn't just thresh out the seeds first and just have a handful of no they had the whole shock that they were waving and in that shock the reason they were waving it was because the seed was mature there the machines he was already Harvest mature so they they plucked it up and they waved it all before the Lord and before the congregation and it was a sign that everything else would come to maturity but what was waived was more than just the seed it also had stalk and it also had shock but it also had the seed but the purpose of the waving was the seed so we're all together we're all on the same page I hope brother bam says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed it says now did he what happened in the pre-figure now he opened Adam's side and took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the bride has to be the word now remember what was waived the word what does the bride need to be he must be the word for she must she has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on Creeds she cannot stand on denominationalism she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from Christ see Christ is the word made manifest she was taken from Christ she must also be the word so she is the word at the end time there's a bride coming of Christ there's a bride age amen so that's the day and age of the Harvest Time amen and there has to be a Sheaf taken from that Harvest amen and waved so there has to be part of the Bride word that's come to maturity amen so we know that there's prophecy laying in the Bible amen of a restoration of of a bride a restoration of what's fallen and brother bam tells us in the Masterpiece we know in the Masterpiece what fell the Masterpiece family fell because God first created a son but the son when the sun was created which was Adam and Adam was put on Earth to have dominion over the Earth God said it is not good that man should dwell alone he was alone amen but within him was his wife we all know this we've rehearsed this so many times amen so God had to extract his wife from him split the feminist Spirit pull a rib out and make the woman and join the two back together that was his Masterpiece that was the Masterpiece family but Satan came in through deception and ruined the Masterpiece so God went back to work to restore the Masterpiece the first part of the restoration was when he restored the last Adam we don't need another atom we've had the last Adam or the second Adam which is Jesus Christ the son has been restored but in that sun was a bride amen was a wife amen so he struck a little blow off to his left side at Calvary and Out Come the ingredients or the material for a wife come the spirit and the word amen and he began to form now amen you begin to form now starting at Pentecost begin to form the wife amen what's he doing he's rebuilding what's Fallen this is all a prophecy showing what God is doing restoring back what had fallen at the beginning that's why when we get to the Book of Revelation we start to see prophecy about the bride show you the bride the Lamb's wife and we have all of these things in the Book of Revelation at the end because it's the restoration of the bride at the end of the book bringing her back in Union with Christ and restoring back and eating condition upon the Earth for a thousand year honeymoon so the book is a book of redemption the whole Bible this whole Bible is about a book of redemption what's being redeemed what was lost in the beginning what was in the beginning God created Eden in his in his pleasure in his Eden he had a garden in the garden he had a son and his son's wife and he gave him rulership over all of creation and then that fell and the rest of the book is redemption bringing it back to that place so this is a book of redemption amen that makes it also The Book of Life which also makes it a marriage certificate because it's all about marriage amen so now the we know at the end what must be waived is the word but what portion of the word amen and the message things that are to be the problem says now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by the denominationalism we must live by the word because the brightest part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour so what is the word bride she is part of the word and she is the word manifested for this hour not a previous hour for Harvest Time so what's Harvest time it's bride time it's the bride age bride time she is what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Crete or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're not living all right we have no argument with that right so now we know what the Harvest Time denotes and and what's coming to maturity what part of the word is coming to maturity amen because it has to be the bride part coming to maturity because for the church ages you know the the church was birthed at Pentecost amen when that first wave Chief was waived over and it was birthed at Pentecost and it was supposed to grow all the way into Perfection and be United with Christ but the Roman the Roman caterpillar come in the bug the insect and it started to eat it down and the church ages shows a church that's now falling from its position amen and being restored back amen there's over 2 000 years amen God is fashioning his bride and restoring a bride amen but there has to come a time where it's no longer church and no longer Church age but the whole intent and purpose now has to come into manifestation not to have another church or another church age but to have a bride Amen to restore back what the original intent was so now he's growing it back through the reformers through the reform raids and the mayonnaise he's bringing it back through Luther Wesley Pentecost through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and he's bringing a bride back and he says in 1962 now she's standing on her feet amen so that is the word that is being restored that is the word that is coming into manifestation in the Harvest Time every other word's already manifest the manifestation of Jesus Christ of the restored Adam the last Adam is already been manifest the church ages have already been manifest but what's to be manifest now for the Gentiles is not a church but a bride so in the Harvest Time now we know the season now we know the word that's to be restored to the Gentiles so in the in the Harvest time now God will have another wave chief at the end time and in that wave sheath once again he'll pluck up a part of the of the field that has come to harvest maturity and to begin to wave it and when he begins to wave this wave Chief over the people again what's being waived is the word all right what's being waived is the word because the word has come back amen that it's gone through the process of growth it's women to the ground and died and it come forth has sprung forth It's went through uh blade went through tassel went through shock went through seeing now it's come back to seed and now that it comes back to seed now there's a waving of Thanksgiving but also a sign now there has to be a sign saying we're in the harvest season there is one part that has come to maturity proving that the rest is going to come to maturity that's why sometimes we say we've seen the wave Chief and and William Branham and that is absolutely the truth but it wasn't the man it was the word because he was the Forerunner of the second coming but he was also part of the Bride he was also a member of the Bride he himself had also come out of dark denominationalism he has also experienced a resurrection out of manage coming into the eagle age coming into the Harvest Time amen and we see a Son of God come into an adoption position like brother Branham did and he's showing full maturity in the bride in that vessel and it was plucked up and waved over the people not the man he was the stalk and he was the shock but inside of him was the word yeah and that was Christ working through that man amen demonstrating what amen an adopted son of God looks like at the end time what a member of the Bride looks like when it comes to maturity but when it was waived remember it was stuck and shock and Seed praise God so many things that I want to say so many things so I don't want to get confused because you can say brother Ben was the wave sheet and that in one part is correct and one part it's not correct because it has to be the word that was waived so it was the word in him that was weighed before the Lord for our acceptance amen and it was waived as a sign of Thanksgiving end a sign it was the word that had come to maturity amen but that word was still housed in a part of the Dead grain the part of the the thing that was holding it up makes sense okay that's so important that's the part that I really want to focus on amen because we know that now in the wave Chief which we've we believe we've seen the wave Chief in our day amen the same son of man was waved again it wasn't brother random wasn't the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man so where was the son of man he was being revealed in a son of man amen and that a son of man was being waved over because the son of man had come to maturity in a son of man amen and so now we saw it I mean we saw it clearly on display without mistake amen so Vindicated and so proven by God so now we've seen that so what does that mean what is that what does that actually mean it means thank God it's Harvest Time thank God whatever happened to that first part is happening to the rest of us the every other part of the Bride field that's laying there this wheat plant this field that's got to come to harvest maturity at the end time whatever happened to that first part is the same thing that's happening to us that was a sign that the whole field is coming to harvest maturity not maybe not hope so but it's a sign that whatever brought this to maturity is going to bring the rest of it to maturity it's it's a Thanksgiving amen and so now when we see that Ministry when we see that life when we see that level of consecration that level of obedience that that manifestation uh of the word and the gifts of the Spirit and the the life of the spirit amen operating in that man it's not so that we can stand there and say oh what a man that was I mean that's our that's our reaction we appreciate and value what that was but if we just fixate on what was being waived we missed the whole point of it being waived because the whole point of the waving was that I can have absolute confidence in God that if God could take that part to maturity he can take me to maturity amen and he's already working the process because this is Harvest Time [Music] this is the the whole point of the sign that's been waived at the end time and the Messianic sign that's been shown in the Life of Christ on display through human flesh the whole point of that was not so that we can memorialize that and remember what was done so but that would give us Faith to recognize that all I need to do is lay in the presence of this Jesus Christ that has returned to his church and it'll bring me to the same Harvest maturity I'm on that same road I'm to that same destination that is my goal not not something I idolize but something I'm pointed to something that I'm that's showing me the way to walk in the direction I'm walking and the goal the place that I am coming to is that maturity how do you know there's already been a Thanksgiving wave and it's already been a sign believing that the rest of them is going to come and I believe I'm one of the rest of them do you you can say oh brother Chad I'm still in the milk phase you know my seed's still juicy and tender and needs baked out hey well praise God it'll get baked out we don't have to hope we don't have to wonder what they were in God has so shown the sign that there's no question in what day we're in we're no question in what hour and we're no questioning what was weighed before us amen it should not allow another question in our heart amen if we by faith recognize who we are then we recognize what road we're on and what's happening in our lives God is bringing us to that same level of maturity when I say that I don't I don't mean to say that we are all going to operate in the office of a prophet I don't mean we'll hold the same office I don't even mean that we're going to manifest all the same manifestations but we're coming to that same maturity and you know more than a gift I want that maturity I want that character I want that life more than a gift more than a sign and a Wonder more than anything else I want that character because a sign of Wonder a gift a manifestation amen can lead you and others astray but that character will never get off that life will never leave Christ amen but a gift can brother bam says in the message spiritual food and due season says now do you see where I'm trying to get to I spoke with you pretty plain this morning don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride where do you see it it was in his ministry he's saying don't you see it but he's trying to show you what you're looking at do you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church the bride the sicker healed the dead are raised the cripples walk the blind seed the gospel Goes Forth in its power for the message and the messenger are the same what was his message his message is that Christ is returning to the church he's forerunning the second coming of Christ and Christ is coming to unite with the bride amen so now his message is declaring amen that Christ is here and so the message and the messenger are the same so he becomes the example of his message and his message in the end time is showing the bride coming of Christ the bride Christ returning and uniting the headship coming together with the body to become one unit and now he the message and the messenger are the same he becomes a display of his very message he goes on to say the word is in the church in the person praise God now we've laid the foundation now I want to get to where I want to get to says now in the anointing ones at the end time he says now I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice in my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and I determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happened so perfect that the perfect they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it I wasn't what I it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me I want to lay that down as a foundation because then when we look at where the wave Chief took place and what all was plucked up and waved and where the seed come to harvest maturity I mean when we look all at all of that amen it's very easy to start putting Merit on a person and and I don't think there's anything wrong with showing appreciation for a person even the person that's carrying a gift I and I don't think it's wrong to appreciate brother Branham I don't think that's wrong at all I don't think it's wrong to love him to appreciate him to Value the sacrifices he made but brother Brandon is very clear in letting you know that it wasn't him it wasn't him it wasn't his power it wasn't his intellect it was in his mind it was in his spiritual uh understanding it wasn't his scriptural knowledge it wasn't him it was God working through him then he goes on to say it's not because it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to now remember I titled this the wave Chief is our example so now the wave Chief becomes our example now now if I'm coming to that Harvest maturity I want to see what brought him to harvest maturity and what it looked like when he came to that maturity and when he come to that maturity I mean he wasn't one bit puffed up proud arrogant he wasn't any of that he had he had no no confidence in his flesh no confidence in himself all of his confidence was in God he knew who was doing the work and he knew he was just there when he was doing those things I was just standing there when he did it I Didn't Do It Christ did it I'm just a voice that he used amen he said even against my better judgment he said it wasn't what I determined to do not even what he wanted to do he had a different desire for his life amen but God had a desire and a purpose for his life and when he surrendered to that God did the work through a surrendered vessel and we saw it as the very life of Jesus Christ on display we saw it as some of the most Supernatural happenings that have that have ever been recorded in humanity we saw it as some of the most amazing things we've ever heard and seen the most amazing testimonies the most amazing the discernment the most amazing things that we have ever seen or been recorded amen we see that amen but brother Brahms really wants us to know that when you see that although although the seed is still in this old dry Sheaf it's not the stalk anymore that's worth anything it's not the shuck anymore that's worth anything it's the seed that's on the inside that's what we're focusing on that's what this is all about so now if we could think this is this is just brother Chad now if you'll just allow me just to think of this in a little different way for a minute if we think of that sheep if we think of that wave sheep at the end time we think there's an old dry stalk there and the leaves have already fallen off or collapsed they're all dry there's a shuck there that's still somewhat holding the seed when they wave it it's all right there and if we could just take that as an example of the human being that the stalk is my flesh and the shock is my spirit but the seed is the gene of God in my soul all right before that before that this grain could come to maturity everything around the grain has to die the process of maturity to bring the grain to full Harvest maturity is death to everything that's holding it stalk has to Die the leaves have to drop off the shuck has to get dry and brittle everything has to die and the debtor it is the more Harvest ready the seed is until it gets to the point it's dead it's brittle it's fragile there's no more life in it all the life now has gone to the seed and all the life now is in the seed that's what this wave Chief is all about what's waived it may be more than the seeds being waved absolutely but you know everything else is pretty much worthless the only thing of value is the seed the only thing the only reason there's a waving is not because they're so you can see stock absolutely you can see the stuff you can see the shut there but the waving is not for the shock and the waving is not for the stalk the waving is for the seed that's what's important signifying that whatever brought this to harvest is going to bring the rest to harvest so then you look out the field and you see stalks and maybe different stages of drying out amen the leaves may be wilting and falling and shut maybe still holding tires starting to separate there may be some greenness still around it amen but you look out there and say when it's harvest ready all of this will look like this that's why I say the wave Chief is our example because when I get Harvest ready amen this is going to be dead amen my inner man and my my spirit man is going to be dead amen but the inside of the inside needs to come to life and become the dominant life in my life amen to come to harvest maturity and then we can all say it's not me it's not what I've done it's not anything I knew it's not anything I'd done but there's something inside of me that's beyond me that's been quickened to Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the very Life of Christ Living now through me it's not me it's the seed that somebody else planted in me amen this is how Brother Bear could say such things as it's not just it's not me I'm just a voice he used I was just standing near when he did all of these things because he had the proper understanding of what was happening in his life and I I think we need to have the proper understanding of what's happening in our life in John chapter 5 let's turn together and read this scripture in John chapter 5. in verse 19. foreign John chapter 5 verse 19. all right says then answer Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also do what the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that he himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that you may Marvel so here Jesus is he's the this is the first corn of wheat coming into full maturity and he's saying I don't do my own will I only do what the father shows me he even told him he says it's not me but it's the father in me he doeth the works so now Jesus is speaking just like brother Branham speaking and anointed ones at the end time Jesus is saying it's not me it's the father in me the father in me he's the one doing the works and and I only do that which the father shows me so Jesus is standing here amen God made flesh but he's playing the role of a submissive son a perfect son and he's saying I don't take my own mind I don't take my own will I don't do it on my own accord I only do what the father shows me and the works that I do I don't do of my own but it's the father in me he doeth the works that's the that's the first corn of wheat that come to maturity now in the bride maturing the whole Harvest material there's been a sheep up and waved amen and when we've seen that God used that vessel God used that man and in him the word come to come to life before us you can see that he speaks the exact same way it's not me it's not what I thought not what I could do it wasn't me it was him amen I was just standing near when he did it it's not me I'm just the voice he used that he spoke through and then I mean all of these things he's saying now it's not what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself to he's speaking just like the first Corner weeds why because if the bride ever comes back it's got to be just like Jesus Christ it's got to have the same character the same traits the same surrender the same obedience the same life has to be a display here male version and female version but with the same character and I believe we got to see that in the message hear ye him speaking about adoption he starts to teach on adoption and we know that adoption is the placing of a son adoptions like the not our modern adoption where somebody doesn't have a child and they want to to raise another child and make a home form so they adopt somebody into their family that's not adoption not biblical adoption biblical adoption is where they have a son their own son their own child of their own loins amen but they want to bring them up right so that they can take the inheritance and become heir of the family business or the Family Farm amen so brother Ben says they put him under the instruction of tutors amen and the tutor will begin to raise the Sun and when the sun comes to maturity and he's able to conduct business like the father is then the father adopts his son and he positionally places him in a position of authority and Power so it's adoption is positional placing that's adoption so brother bam is talking here about adoption and I'm going to look at this in the message here ye him now notice how this tutor would come before the father and if the son had did wrong the child was disobedient how he must have turned his head and said father I just hate to bring you this message but oh this disobedient child what would the father do Bow his head in shame he's talking about one son that's not listening but then he's going to turn it to the son that is listening and brother bear said who did God get to be the the Tudor he said it's the Holy Ghost is our tutor he said now now let's change the thought what if this tutor come before the father and said oh sir your boy is just like you why you know he just acts just like you do this is going to be so important hold on to that statement he loves the things that you teach he likes to run the farm the way you run it oh in a street expression he's just a chip off the block he's just like you you're a holy God he believes in being holy you're a great all-powerful God he says Amen to it you're a great God to work miracles he believes every word of it and practices the same oh how it must please the father yes that's my son sure you know what happened then when the child come to a certain age the boy if he had been a a bad boy and was not exactly what the father could trust him he never had any inheritance at all you rather know that from the scripture but if he was an obedient son and when he become to a certain age then the same son was taken out into a public place before the public and he was put up on a high place and there the father put a robe on him and he adopted his own son into his family and on this placing of the son that son's name was just as good on a check as his father's was because he'd been proven he was obedient and his name was good just the same as the father and brothers showing this adoption now and and how the tutor would come to the father and he would give the good report and so in order for the son to come to adoption he must meet a certain criteria and here's the criteria your boy is just like you he acts just like you do he loves the things that you teach he likes to run the farm the way you run it you're a holy God he believes in being holy see the tutor is saying he's ready for adoption because he's exactly like you not he has his own idea he's got new technology he wants to implement in the farm he's waiting for Dad to get out of the way so he can bring some better ideas adoption when he comes to adoption is not when the son thinks he's ready and he knows something and he's able to do the work that's not adoption he's ready for an adoption when he has no mind of his own no thought of his own no desire of his own he's ready for adoption when he only wants to do an act just like the father then the tutor says he's ready for adoption and the father says he's ready for adoption let's put him in adoption so you see it's not it's not this modernistic idea of we know what to do we've got it all figured out amen just turn us loose that's not that is not the right attitude for adoption but if we're going to come into adoption and this is adoption age the bride age is adoption AJ man because through the church it was a maturing it was a bringing back but the adoption comes in the bride age amen it's a placing now you're to be wife amen you're not to just be church anymore you're to be bride so now the whole age is an adoption age where the church is being positionally placed as a wife as a bride not church anymore that's why when brother Branham comes through the first seal he says I'm not going to call you church I'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand we're moving into an adoption age now you're being placed what you always were meant to be you've grown up through Luther Wesley Pinnacle there's been a restoration of the bright tree but now the bright tree has to be placed and as it's placed it's placed under the headship of her husband United in an invisible Union this is placing time so now the bride is coming to adoption this is the adoption age but what makes her ripe for adoption is not because she thinks she knows something because the tutor says she is just like you she only wants to do what you say she only wants to obey your scripture she she doesn't argue over every Point she doesn't look for a loophole she doesn't try to justify her actions you see what I'm saying what's happening when it comes time for adoption amen when it comes time from adoption is also a sign of maturity when it comes time for the grain to mature everything around that seed is dead this boy who's going through the tudorship he's got lessons to learn he's got things that he's got to learn and if he doesn't get it right he must repeat the lesson how many has been have lessons have you ever repeated any I think I'm still working on some and he's not going to move on until he gets an a you know this isn't like you know just pass them on so we don't have to deal with them let the next great teacher deal no this tutor is going to make sure we're going to learn all our lessons amen and so now he's going through the lessons until he stops doing it his way and starts following the instruction of the tutor and the tutor is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost always operates according to the word so now we're in the tudorship until we finally surrender until we lose all of our childish Notions until we lose all of our pride and all of our ambition because that's not going to work for the inheritance we can't go this young man I mean he can't go he can't just listen he can't just understand calculus and accounting and finance and Seed sowing and planting because he's also got to have the character to take the inheritance not just the skills because if he takes the skills without the character he'll still ruin the farm and lose the inheritance because he's got the skills to plant and the skills to take the money to the bank and to count it but he doesn't have the character to manage the blessings that come with it and so he will bankrupt he will destroy the family farm so he's got to have more than just skills he's got to be just like the father because the father has been able to manage all of this let me ask ourselves why is life so hard because we have a wonderful inheritance that's promised to us why does it have to be this hard why do things keep happening why why is it one step forward one step back two step forward another step back why is life so hard I'll tell you why life is so hard because you're going to inherit the world the whole Creation with Christ Jesus you are in joint Heir and will sit on the throne with him that's why life is so hard now do you hate life no we love life now we say thank you God there's some things that I need to know and so now we look at oh my goodness again and hear ye him it says now then you have the word of God the authority of God and then as God shows you what to do you're led by the spirit and you do the things that's pleasing to God now Jesus was being adopted on the day of Mount Transfiguration God was adopting his own son and to his family now he took Peter James and John and he took Moses Elijah and Jesus and he brought them up to the top of the mountain and there you notice he was transfigured before them what was it put into a public place up high on a mountain can you see the similarity and then when he did what did he do he was transfigured and the Bible said that his raiment Shine Like the Sun and its strength that robe that the father in the Old Testament put on his son for the day of adoption God put his robe of immortality upon his son in the day of adoption so Brother Bear shows us that mount Transfiguration was an adoption because he was going to entrust all of Creation in the hands of Jesus Christ because he was going to place upon him the sin of the entire world and he was going to Bear the sin of the whole world to Calvary Amen to be the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and redeems back purchases back everything that's lost and God was going to hand this to Jesus Christ but he first had to be tested and he had to come to adoption so that he could go to Calvary carrying the whole inheritance let's look at this in uh Matthew 17. let's look at Matthew 17 real quick we'll read this and then move on Matthew 17. in verse 1. Matthew chapter 17 verse 1. this is Mount Transfiguration and after six days Jesus taketh Peter and James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them in his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make your three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed him and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him this is a significant statement because it's almost a repeat of the statement that was made at the Jordan River because when Jesus came to Jordan and was baptized by John the Baptist God from Heaven repeats almost the same statement said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased but we know it's there he declared him to be a son but from that point he went straight to testing Jesus come up out of the Waters of baptism filled with the Holy Ghost and he went straight to the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil for 40 days what was he doing he was being tested he was being tried amen and he was tested by the three great Temptations the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life and he passed that test and then he was tested in the pharise by the Pharisees he was tested by Israeli Israelites he was tested when they wanted to make him a king he was tested in so many ways he was tested but when he come to mount Transfiguration this is his adoption and in the adoption he repeats the same phrase but he adds to it this is my son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him now he has it all now he inherited all now he's the boss of it all who was with him Moses and Elijah representing the law and the prophets what is that that's the word of God that's the whole Old Testament and and Peter wants to build three Tabernacles one for the prophets one for the law Moses and an eyes and one for Jesus but God Cuts him off short and says no you hear him he's the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets he is everything and now he's brought him into a position of authority and power here ye him I'm putting all the word on him I'm putting all the responsibility on him and I'm putting the entire inheritance on him he had been tested his whole life was attesting tested in the wilderness tested for three and a half years in Ministry he was tested but he passed every test and God brought him into adoption and now you know that he has to go to Calvary to pay the price for the inheritance and on the way to Calvary is Gethsemane and in Gethsemane the word Gethsemane means an oil press and Gethsemane is a olive Orchard with olive trees so it's very fitting the name is very fitting that in the Grove of olive trees Jesus bows down and begins to pray and says father let this cup pass for me father let this cup pass from me but thy will not mine here you have a son is he in agony as a human being he's in agony so much so that is the the drops of sweat were dropping as great drops of blood upon the ground he was in utter Agony but he had already been proved and already been tested he could go through the oil press and he could stay true to the Commandment of the father three times he asked did this cup pass from me but in the last time he said if if this cup cannot pass from me then thy will be done this is a man who was surrendered he could be trusted not taking his own will or his own desire Brothers says he loved his disciples and didn't want to leave his disciples he knew the pain that lay ahead and he would feel all of it but yet in the olive press he would be pressed out you know when you take olives and you you press them out you have to destroy the olive to get the oil because what was important is the oil the oil is valuable the oil is important so you must destroy everything around that oil to get the oil and when you want to make wine you have to destroy the grape to get the juice to make the wine and everything that's around the wine has to be destroyed in order to produce wine because the wine is so valuable and in the in the fragrance of the Rose of Sharon to make the perfume brother bear says You must crush the rose of Sharon Amen to get the perfume and you must destroy everything that's around the perfume it must be destroyed to get the perfume out are we seeing a pattern if Christ is in me if I'm part of the word by predestination by having an eternal see Gene of God if part of God Amen is dwelling in my soul that must be expressed by the power of the Holy Ghost what has to happen to everything around it everything around it needs to be crushed everything around it needs to be dead everything around it needs to be dried up so that what's valuable can come out so the fragrance can come out the oil can come out the wine can come out and the Harvest you see so much material there but what's important is to see in the wave sheath there's so much there the stalk and the and the shock and all but what's important is the seed and in this day this bride is an eternal seed Gene of God she is part of the word for she comes from Christ she's part of she's part of the word like her bridegroom is part of the word and the word is in her Amen in the spirit to make the word live has returned to her amen but but in order to get that life out everything around it has to die we see in my opinion we see brother Branham come to adoption we even see him lifted up into that constellation of angels taken to a high mountain and lifted up before all transfigured in a way and you remember remember the dream and standing in the Gap when when uh I believe as Roy Roberson had the dream and he he saw brother Branham leave and he went out west and when he come back he had been changed he was shining and his face was shining amen I believe brother Branham came to a place of adoption where God could trust him where God could place responsibility in his hands but how did the prophet get there what was his life like up to that point brother Ben says in the Feast of trumpets it says then one day in Sabino Canyon while God called me early in the morning up there I was up with my hands in the air praying and a sword came in my hand you know that I stood there and looked at it just as natural as my hand is now not knowing what it meant and it was left me with the voice that said this is the sword of the king and then later when the angel of the Lord revealed it it was the word in the hand the word of God was being placed in the prophet's hand because he was going to come Amen to the seals and he was going to preach the unwritten part of the Book of Revelation what John was told not to write which was what the seventh under sounded the word that had been sealed up inside the pyramid amen the pyramid had writing all around it and the prophet went all around it interpreting all the writing tying together all the Loose Ends from Seven Church ages but when he got done with that he peeled the top off and showed there's something there's a White Rock a revelation inside that light has never shined on before and nothing was written on it because there was a word a mystery a truth laying in the Bible that the light had of Revelation had never shined on in this word and it was a mystery of God that would be revealed and that word that John was told to seal up that part that had been probed at for thousands of years amen that word was being placed in his hands and day by day amen the angel of the Lord would come to him day by day when he preached the seals and give him the revelation and he would come out and bring it just as he saw it he says I saw it in a vision and I take a pen and write down what I was looking at and then I would spend the rest of the day going back over the scriptures and tying it together God by Vision amen revealed the seven Thunders to the prophet the unwritten word the word of the Lord the king's sword was being placed in his hand and every day he was the man with the correct interpretation of that word and he was the one bringing the king's sword out day by day I believe God had to trust that man before he could give him that responsibility he had to be tested he had to be proved that he would be faithful before he could do that so at the end of the seals brother Brown says now don't thank no man don't say thank you to no man he said because I didn't know those seals they were given to me day by day I was just as confused as anybody else so brother I'm saying don't thank me it wasn't me amen God gave it to me and I brought it to you so God had to trust that between the vision and the preaching that that man wouldn't twist anything changing because how would you and I know between the vision of the Seven Seals as they broke day by day and he saw it saw it break before him take a pen and write it then go to the scriptures and tie it together then come and preach it how do you and I know that between the vision and the preaching nothing changed because we believe God put the sword in his hand we have confidence in God who brought him to adoption who tested him through the tutors and proved him to be faithful with the word God had to trust that man with a greater level of responsibility praise be to God so I I believe that was brother branham's adoption I may be wrong this is my personal opinion I believe that he was lifted up he was adopted and the sword was placed in his hand and he was given the authority to bring the word the the correct interpretation of the unwritten word which had to match all the written words and it did so you think about how brother M got to the place where God would put a sword in his hand and he said it fit my hand just exactly and that was the king sword it was the word in the hand in his hand how did he get there well it started way back when he learned a whole lot of lessons remember when brother Branham early on when he come in contact in Mishawaka Indiana with the Pentecostals and and he preached there he got all the invitations to go out and remember when he got home his mother-in-law said you're not going to do that you're not going to go and you're not going to drag my daughter from Pillar To Post and in order to spare the feelings of the family and not to upset his mother-in-law he digressed he didn't take the invitations president said that's when the plagues broke out in my home if you listen to life story said my father died my brother died and then eventually his wife died his baby died he said because I didn't go when he first called amen and he said go this work could have got a lot further along amen if I'd went when he called look at the price that that man paid for his disobedience and what was he doing he was capitulating to family not to upset family God was teaching him family doesn't come first I come first and and remember now he now you know we just I'm just taking Snippets from his life you could follow his life story but remember when he's preaching and there's a young couple he says Making Love on the front row kissing and hugging on each other and making a disgrace amen and and and and what they were doing was absolutely wrong and distracting people and all that and brother Brandon was upset about what they were doing and God come to him and said they're in your hands whatever you say and now he's in a place where he can pass judgment and whatever he says to them that'll be the Judgment that'll happen amen and brother Brandon even said you know if you strike them dead they'll be dead and they were deserving of judgment because they were doing this mocking right in the face of God they deserve judgment and now he's being tested because when that he had the spirit of Elijah in him but when that Spirit of Elijah was in Elisha that that uh that Elisha got angry when he was made fun of by my kids and he called two she Bears out of the woods and killed 50 kids and brother Brown said that wasn't the spirit of Christ that was Elisha's own Spirit when he got angered remember because he was in that office God honored his word and those children died but now that Spirit of Elijah now post Christ is now in another vessel and now he's put in the same place judgment's in your hand amen they're making a mockery whatever you say and brother Branham says I forgive you what did he do he took the nature of Christ not his own nature what is this testing's tutorship bringing a son to adoption remember when he went to South Africa and he got tangled up with the preachers and God told him to stay in this city and keep preaching but because they had an itinerary and he didn't have any money he didn't have a vehicle he got all tangled up and had to go with the preachers and and God finally gave him permission to go but he said you'll suffer for it he went home with an amoeba that nearly killed him he thought he was going to die nobody could cure him he couldn't get any relief till God supernaturally delivered him because God had to teach him family doesn't come first I come first preachers don't come first I come first you always obey and submit to the word of the Lord look at the training this Prophet went through all the testings the rejections the mockery the the this is this is a a man as a young boy was rejected by his community was an outcast in society amen because his father was a bootlegger and all he wanted was friends he wanted people to talk to him but they would pass him on the other side of the road when he come down the road and now in the early years of his campaign he becomes the most popular preacher in America I wonder what that did for him I wonder that helped him and now all the rejection starts to pile on do you think that wasn't hard for him what was God doing he was testing him will you stay with the word will you stay with the word will you stay with the word remember when he got his wife to tell the little white lie to the lawyer about him not being in there God corrected him God come down on him what was it testing after testing improving after proving even when he failed amen God could bring him into a quick repentance and he would make it right and the man was so honest he would stand before everybody and tell him what he did what was God God was proving there is a son here that I can trust nothing improving testing and proving then even after the seals he comes to standing in the Gap we've preached about it a bunch we won't go into detail but he wanted to run away because of the rejection because of the pressure he wanted to run off and have a little bit of relief and what he wanted wasn't sinful he didn't want to do anything sinful he wanted to get away from the people and get away from the pressure and God corrected him and when God corrected him he repented and moved right back down into the ministry that caused his rejection and pain because that's what God had for him we think we've suffered we just need to watch The Life of that Prophet that man who was trained by God in the end time and brought into a position I believe of adoption and through him the word was waived over us so we could see what an adopted son of God what a bride in the end time looks like you know what God didn't wave that on 1200 tapes in a couple videos God didn't wave that so you can say wow I wish I could be like that he waved that so you would know that's the journey you're on that's your destination not to stand before crowds and discern thoughts that's not what I'm talking about but to have that surrender to Christ to be entrusted with the word like he was entrusted with the word until God could trust him with his own word and he wouldn't handle it wrong he would handle it exactly correct and I say thank God for that brother Ben says in the message just once more Lord I love this statement said if God come to me and said I want you to go to Earth and I was up there and said go to Earth I'm I'm going to give you a hundred year space of knowledge but I want you to lot your years what years you want to take the first 25 the second 25 the third 25 are the last 25. what would I say well if I'm going to put my time here to be a football player an athlete or something I better take the first 25. if I'm going to here to be a carpenter or some person like that well I better take the second 25. but if I want to take to serve the Lord I'll take the last 25 from 75 to 100 because I've had the accumulation of that much knowledge I know more about it now think about this uh this this statement we know it we've heard it before but it amazes me mother bam said if I'm allotted a period of time to serve the Lord if I'm going to serve the Lord I'll take the last 75 to 100. and he picks the weakest time in human life the physically weakest and many times the mentally weakest time in human life to serve the Lord because by then he'll finally have learned something and I wonder what it is he'll learn it's an accumulation of knowledge but what kind of knowledge the knowledge of how to serve God and stay with his word forget your thinking that's why you can pick the weakest time in life because it's not dependent on your strength your mind your understanding he's finally come to an understanding it's not my mind it's not my mental prowess it's my my great speech it's not my physical strength it's all him it's not me I was just standing by when he did it so what time would he pick the weakest when everybody else would say you're nearly finished or already finished he would say no that's when you can just get started with the kingdom of God and really do something for the Lord before that you could share in the glory before that you could take pride in what you're doing but when you get to the weakest stage of your life then all you can say is it wasn't me it was him I couldn't do anything you all know I couldn't stand here you all know I had we wheeled up here in a wheelchair I've lost some teeth I I forget even what my phone number is but that's when he felt like he could serve the Lord the best oh let us take that attitude not my strength but my weakness not my ability amen but just my surrender remember don't forget in the wave chief everything around the seed is dead everything is dead seed is alive I want to read Galatians 2 20 together Galatians 2 and 20. it says in Galatians 2 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I'm crucified it's not me it's him Living Through Me if we're going to have a manifestation of the Bride in the end time which I believe we are having it's not going to be her it's going to be him in her she's going to have to learn how to surrender to yield how to die brother Brown says in perfect strength my perfect weakness said I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William Branham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we get ourselves in the way then we cannot I think this is why Paul says I Die daily Paul knew how to keep under his body and keep it subject lest at the end he'd be a Castaway he and I knew how to Die daily he knew how to crucify himself so that Christ can live brother Ben says in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says but you remember when it went down and the grain begin to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same thing same word what is it same Jesus in Bride form but when that seed ripens everything in the stalk has to be dead everything from a previous age all of our own thinking all of our own understanding all of our own ability has to be dead for that to fully mature and ripen until we can recognize like brother Benham that it's not me I was only standing near when he did it this is not wishful thinking this is the promise that was promised to us when God waved that Sheaf when the ministry of the son of man was waived over the world it was a sign that this crop is coming to maturity that's why he sent the word and that's why he returned because his presence the presence of the son is bringing ripening maturity to the grain all we've got to do is stay in his presence and let the word work in us and stay surrendered to it it will accomplish exactly what he sent it to accomplish this is not wishful thinking this is not someday over in the wild blue yonder this is now this is Harvest Time this is the eighth and we I believe are the people and that sign that we saw was a sign for us to have confidence in God God if you can do it there you can do it here amen whatever you did for him you're doing for me I believe by faith I'm part of the same Harvest I'm part of the same bride I'm part of the end time bride so now I can't in myself produce anything I can't manufacture I can't manifest anything that would prove anything to anybody but what I can do is die to my thought die to my own thinking under the tutor of the Holy Ghost Say Okay teach me the lesson I want to get at this time because I want to do it exactly the way he would do it I've tried my my own way I've tried my ideas a few times I've tried to improve the process I don't know if maybe none of you have but I've tried an improved method and it fails the only one that works is the tried and true process of the father and that is surrender to the word because the word always works hey we've we have human beings have tried to alter it change it we've tried to bypass it Overlook it we tried to make excuses around it we've tried to we've tried the Greek study around it but there's only one thing that's going to work I got to do it exactly the way he does it and he always works according to his word he never works outside of his word he always works in line with his word I've got to do it exactly like the father does it so now my head is Christ now to be his bride I have to do it exactly the way my head does it I have to be in perfect submission to my headship which is Jesus Christ the word and it's been restored in this day the reason the word has come back is so that we can be a proper bride because without the word you don't know how to be a bride because a proper bride is subject to her head and when the headship was obscure she was in confusion but now the word has come back so that she can be a proper bride and the proper bride is in complete submission to her headship and as much as Christ the bridegroom was perfectly submitted to the Father the bride is perfectly submitted to the bridegroom to be the proper bride and the word has come so that we can be a manifested bride well what great thing will you do what tremendous Mighty thing will you do to prove a manifested bride I think the greatest work of all that the manifested bride will produce is she will be completely surrendered and subject to the headship of the word because that's where every other bride failed and still produced works and still produce churches and still produce groups of people but I believe the greatest sign this world will see of a bride amen will be a people who are absolutely 100 percent surrendered to the revealed word of this hour and subject to her headship which is Christ Jesus the word then what God does through that is whatever he wants to do if he wants to do Mighty works and mighty manifestations and I believe we'll see some of that my personal belief is we'll see some of that but whatever he does he'll do it because he's got a vessel in subjection so the first thing to get right is surrender to the headship of the word and then all things are possible to them that are in Christ Jesus praise God Matthew 16. 24. I want to read two more scriptures and close with a quote Matthew 16 24. Jesus then then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it like Kyle Brother Kyle said on Wednesday the Way Up Is Down the way to have life is to lose your life the way to have Victory is the first surrender amen be overcome by the word to be an overcomer you remember the quote I believe God Brother Kyle read this quote on Wednesday I believe you read the quote where he says can you nail yourself to the cross remember what Jesus says take up your cross and follow me what is a cross used for execution what do they do with the cross they nail people to it to kill them so if you're going to take up your cross and follow Jesus what are you supposed to do with that cross is it you know is it a piece of furniture is it decoration no I think it's a useful Implement in a Christian Life I think a cross is necessary to serving God properly I think we must keep ourselves on the cross crucifying ourselves to our own wants our own desires our own life our own thinking our own history our own whatever I think we have to stay crucified to that to let Christ live in US that's why Jesus said take up your cross not somebody else's this is a personal cross that you're supposed to carry take up your cross and follow me let's turn to Revelation chapter 12. this is the final scripture I want to read Revelation chapter 12. and verse 10. Revelations 12 and 10. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death how are we going to overcome by the blood of the Lamb by the word of Our Testimony and we will not love our own lives unto the death but we will be willing to die you say brother Chad I'm willing to die I'm not talking about dying once talking about dying daily a lot of people will die for their faith if you if we come down to a showdown and it's going to be one bullet five seconds you're done no suffering I'll die for my faith but will you die daily and when you die not by an Executioner's hand but will you die by your own hand nailing yourself to your own cross and surrendering your life and becoming dead to personal desire dead to personal one dead to personal preservation we spend so much of our lives trying to protect ourselves we try to protect our emotional realm from other people we try to protect our physical being from from hurt and harm we spend so much of our life trying to protect ourselves and Christ is asking us to surrender ourselves that doesn't mean we act foolishly you know and jump in front of trucks but I'm talking about we don't need to protect ourselves he's our protection what we need to do is surrender our life to him and let him take the responsibility he's promised to take remember the government shall be upon his shoulders he's promised to marry you and take responsibility for you we don't have to take all the responsibility for ourselves we have to surrender to him and let him carry that responsibility for us trust in him lean not to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your steps this is the age of adoption what's adoption big powerful no leading up to adoption is when the sun will do it only the way the father does it I want to come to that place where I only do what the word says to what we've been given in this hour what we've been taught through this prophetic Ministry the word that has been restored I want to only do it that way God help me to surrender my life to that way and be purged be cleaned and be prepped by that word and be used for his glory and one last quote Christ is revealed in his own word the thing that matters the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their heart must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness what's greenness immaturity let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured Christians what is this word what has this message been given to us as restored word what's it supposed to do what's the presence of Christ supposed to do bake all the immaturity out of us till we come into His image amen I say God bake all the greenness me he realized president wasn't telling us what works to do and what Hoops to jump through and what no he was just telling us to surrender he was just telling us to give up to give up our lives to give up our thinking to stop our struggling with the word and just surrender to it stop the debate in our mind and stop struggling with the word but just give over to the word and then let the presence of the sun bake all the greenness out you don't try to become mature you don't try to do better and try to become mature amen all that effort is human effort and it will fail but what we do is we finally surrender to this Hot August Sun that's here to bake the immaturity out and then lay in the presence and quit running around and getting in the presence of other influences and get influenced by this message not by modern Trends on unpopular whatever websites and whatever uh social medias but don't lay in that presence belay in this presence and let us stay in the presence and stay surrendered to the word until it bakes all the greenness out of us we've been given a good example in this day I want to follow that example man let's all stand musicians if you'll come brother Ben if you'll come what day is it it's Harvest Time it's the last day it's harvest time it's bride time it's bright age it's time for the manifestation of Jesus Christ in the formation of the Bride that's him through us what's it going to take it's going to take me surrendering my life and dying so that everything around that seed is dead praise God oh God help me die but I'm so glad we've been given the bright light of this word the sunlight that'll do the work I don't think brother Branham reformed himself and I don't think he got himself good enough to do all the things he was doing I think he truly just surrendered to the leadership of the Lord and God took him step by step I don't think we have to reform ourselves I think we just need to surrender to the word of the Lord and let the Lord lead us step by step hey we're going to make it how do you know I've seen the promise I've the wave chief is a promise that the whole Harvest is coming to maturity I believe I'm going to make it I'm on the road now I'm not what I ought to be not even what I want to be but praise God I'm not what I used to be can you testify the same thing and what has changed you it's this word so let's stay in the presence of the Sun and let it bake all the greenness out of us man let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus I thank you God for this word that you've given to us this promised sign that you showed in the Harvest time when you displayed yourself Lord by working through a man and God you left a sign to us that we could have confidence that whatever you did to produce that there you're going to do the same thing for the rest of us Lord I pray that you'd forgive me for my selfishness forgive me for my own wants and my own desires to interrupt so much help me God to surrender in a greater way and God As We Lay in your presence when you allow the power of your word to bake all the immaturity out of us Lord with your presence Lord just change us and mature us and grow us Lord into your own image that we could be in your own likeness Lord I Thank you for the trials of life oh God they've been hard feel beat down sometimes and I feel shame sometimes in my mistakes but oh God when I look at what you did in the prophet's life I recognized them now as part of my training they're necessary Lord and I thank you for loving me enough to giving me a good tutor help me God to learn the lessons and the surrender may I stay under your headship lord may you have your way with me Lord I love you I ask that you bless each one of us may we leave your encouraged Lord that what you've already displayed is a promise what you already showed is a final result and you've given us all the ingredients and everything that's needed to come to that same place here it's in our hands help us to Avail ourselves of it Lord we love you we ask that you would take us Lord into your hands mold us into your very likeness and use us For Your Glory may you get all the glory and all the credit for it Lord may you have preeminence in this hour in each one of our vessels for we're surrendering ourselves afresh to you and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen how many believes it's time for a manifestation of the Bride that's wonderful I believe that too but we can no longer believe it collectively we must now accept it individually we I agree we've believed it collectively how many believe it's bright time it's bright time you can get the whole church to shout how many believes is the adoption age when it's going to be Christ on display in the form of a bride absolutely but when we talk about that we're thinking collectively collectively collectively but you know what this is the age of individual individual individual all those statements now must be true about me it's time for me to surrender so that he can display himself through me it's so easy to think collectively and be confident collectively but we have to be just as confident individually that he will have his way with me by the Revelation he's placed in my heart that God is going to get me to that place if I can just stay connected to him what do I have to do just lay in the presence of the Sun and let him bake all the greenness amen God bless you better man that's man [Music] [Music] for I'm ready for the Harvest I'm
