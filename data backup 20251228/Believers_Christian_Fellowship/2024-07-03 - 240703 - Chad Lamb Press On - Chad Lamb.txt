God bless you all this evening and while we're standing let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we're so thankful Lord for the privilege of being here again tonight oh we just want to take an opportunity every opportunity to say that we love you we're thankful for what you've done Lord and we appreciate the opportunity to gather together with our brothers and sisters to sing your praises and to declare of your goodness and God as we come now to the opening of the word I pray God that you would come yourself and open the word for us break the bread of life with your own hand may we get ourselves out of the way and allow you to come and move on the scene for God we're utterly and completely dependent upon you and we're Desiring Lord for you to come and speak to us God

also want to let you know that the church age book Bible study that was scheduled for tomorrow is cancelled I was supposed to tell you that on Sunday and I forgot and I'm sorry for that I had it written on my notes really big and right in front of me I don't know how I missed it but I did and so that's canceled we'll just pick it up next Thursday July 11th so we'll we'll go with that schedule also we want to welcome our visitors here I saw brother Terry Horn and his wife Alice God bless you this is Sister Julie numer Mom and Dad it's always good to have you with us and I saw brother Bob black and his wife Monica God bless you Sister Monica Sister Irene and Bal Garner sister so we're glad that you guys are here and I think there's some family here with sister Chrissy God bless you Sister Chrissy amen you all showed up at once praise the Lord we're happy to have you amen you all came for my birthday I'm so appreciative so thankful amen God is good amen we appreciate that also want to thank you all for the greetings we've got a lot of text messages and cards and we really love you all and appreciate you as Earl so good to us and always so kind we love you all so much amen so for my birthday message I just want to preach the word of God Amen what a privilege to be able to serve God every day of our lives and on this day especially so let's turn to the book of Philippians chapter 3 and uh we'll begin with verse 12 Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 says not as though I have already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth in those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen may God bless us as we look at his word and you can be seated amen I I look at this word press this word press towards the mark of the high calling in and it means metaphorically to pursue to seek after eagerly earnestly Endeavor to acquire so I like that Paul saying here that I'm I'm pressing for something I'm pushing towards something I'm earnestly contending to acquire something so Paul wasn't passive in his desire to serve God or to get all that God had for him or to grow in the all that God wanted him to be it wasn't a passive thing but it was it was a great desire that he had to run the race to press forward to press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen so he was he was admitting I'm not saying I've arrived yet I'm not saying that I'm everything I ought to be or I've come to Perfection amen but this one thing I do laying laying aside everything amen and all the things that are behind me forgetting all of them but reaching forward to that which is forward I press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen so this is such a wonderful attitude and we find this attitude is an important one for us to have too we don't want to be passive or lazy or lethargic in our in our exercise of our faith amen but there's something worth pressing for there's something worth striving for there's something worth giving our lives for there's something worth going the extra effort for amen and and I believe this message is worth it amen so today I've been I've been meditating and studying for a couple days now and I got to the place where I mean so much comes and so many different things and thoughts and they flood through I have no idea what the title is so at the end of it you write whatever you want on the top of your paper but I'm just going to I'm just going to uh uh deliver my heart I have no idea how God will take uh what seems to be jumbled and put it together but I'm not worried about that all I'm worried about is standing here and asking God to come on the scene by the anointing of the Holy Ghost and bring the word the way he wants it brought amen that's my desire above everything else is not to mess up what he wants to do amen and so let's turn to Luke now and look at Luke 16 when it's all over maybe you could text me ideas for a title Luke 16 Luke 1616 Jesus is saying here in Luke 16:16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it this word presses is interesting to me because it's a very very aggressive word I mean it's not presses just like we would call it but it means to use force or to apply force or even to inflict violence on this kind kind of press I mean it's a serious pressing Amen to use force or to apply Force so we'll read it again with that in mind the law and the prophets were until John he's just saying the Old Testament was until John amen since that time the kingdom of God is preach and every man presseth into it so once again this is not passive terminology this is not stumbling into or just waiting to see what's going to happen with my life and I hope it all works out and I hope at the end of it all that I find find myself a Christian and that was not the attitude here the attitude is the kingdom is preached and I'm going in me I'm pressing in I'm not going to be left out I'm not going to be left behind if there's a kingdom to have I'm going to have it amen and we realize the truth we understand you know because uh because of the prophetic message we've had in this day God's lifted us up into such a realm of revelation we understand that God forsaw the end from the beginning he knew the end from in the beginning he for ordained what would happen he knew who would receive it and who would not receive it he knew who the elect were and wrote them in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he knows where he's going to drop a seed of faith and he knows where that seed of faith will come to life amen and we know all things work together for the good and we know God's in control of all things that right amen but I don't believe that Revelation at all should take away a fervent desire in our heart to have everything God has for us I don't believe that Revelation that Revelation come to take away fear fear that I won't make it fear amen fear that I'm not part of it fear that I'll be left out fear that I'll be uh reprobate and left to the side at the end of The Journey amen all that fear can go away by the predestinated plan of God that God foresaw and fornew but I don't think at all in a genuine life of a Christian amen that that seed that's inside of us I don't believe is passive and leth argic and lazy and and not contending but I believe that portion of God that's within us has is reaching up and saying I want that I'm going to have it I'm part of it it's for me amen it's a magnetism amen between the word that is in us and the word that's being preached amen and it's a and it's an attraction one to another and it's it's not this uh this this revelation we have this overarching Revelation well whatever it will be will be I'm not going to worry about it I'm just going to sit here in my seat and if God wants me to do something or if God wants me to be something he'll make me that you know that's true that's true but it's not going to happen exactly like that eventually we're going to get into the situation when we're pressing when we come into desperation when the wheels come off the bus when everything in life falls apart amen we're going to press our way in amen so so this this terminology is aggressive and praise God it's aggressive let's go to Genesis 32 Genesis CH 32 and I'd like to read from verse 24 we know this well I'm just going to read this quickly to refresh us on the word the wording but this is where Jacob wrestles with the angel and it's when he's coming back into the lamb and in Genesis 32:24 he says and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the break of day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakthe will not let thee go except thou bless me praise be to God I love this I love this this is also aggressive amen he he he later says he calls the place Pineo because he met God face to face so he knows who he's wrestling with he's wrestling with an angel of the Lord which he says he met God face to face and this Angel of the Lord is saying let me go and Jacob has the tenacity to said I will not let you go and unless you bless me amen and what made what made Jacob so desperate it might have been the situation he found himself in amen he was moving back into the land he had he had cheated his brother out out of so many things and his brother was angry and now he's fearful for his life he had Laban before this chasing him because of the way he snuck out from laan and and now his brother's coming against him and his life is in turmoil and now he doesn't know what's going to happen tomorrow when he meets his brother he he he's now separating and dividing his flocks and his herds and his wife and his children and now he himself is all alone amen and the angel of the Lord comes to wrestle with him and I love this because the angel of the Lord doesn't come down and and come to Jacob and say Jacob now I know you're having a hard time and you're so weary and I felt so sorry for you I thought I would come down and encourage you amen I don't know what the conversation was like if there was any conversation but it started into a wrestling match [Applause] I don't know if any words were exchanged we have nothing recorded I don't even know how they got into this wrestling match you can only use your imagination but but at some point this Angel of the Lord tells Jacob let me go you let me go and and and he says God met him face to face so God tells Jacob let me go I preached this before and you might remember but my personal feeling is God was saying out of his mouth let me go but in his heart he was saying don't let me go [Applause] he was testing Jacob this is Jacob's test amen he's proving him amen and listen Jacob was predestinated before the foundation of the world he was in the right lineage the promise was his the birthright was his the blessing was his God had met him on his way out of town when he was in bethl and in a dream he saw God and God promised I will be with you I'm not going to leave you until I bring you back to this place and fulfill everything he had a promise of God but that promise of God didn't allow him to Coast through life but it was full of Trials and pressings and T and temptations and all kinds of difficult circumstances till he gets pressed into this difficult circumstance and God comes and God doesn't make it easy on him God wrestles with him and says let me go oh my it's amazing how uh how this idea this this concept this idea that I'm dwelling on is all through the scripture remember Jesus tells the parable the story of the unjust judge and the widow woman now now listen the just in our Pious Christian whatever religious piety you would think that that you know Jesus wouldn't use this kind of story where there's an unjust judge and a widow and she's desperate and she needs to be Avenged and the only one that can avenge her is this judge and she comes to the judge and the judge won't avenge her he won't give her what she's asking for but she won't quit she keeps knocking she keeps harassing she keeps she won't take no for an answer and Jesus is the one who tells this this story and he tells it to his disciples and then he uses as an example of how we amen should approach unto God yes and and now all of the sudden what you mean you mean I'm not supposed to take no for an answer amen listen I don't I don't know how to qualify this in my religious mind amen I don't know how to do this but all I know there was a desperation in that woman and God's pointing to a desperation in his child he doesn't always make it easy sometimes he says no amen just to see what you're going to do about it to see what the faith is down inside of you is there any tenacity is there any fight amen is there any strive is there any grit is there anything that matches his nature that's not going to give up on the word of God that's not going to roll over and die that's not going to capitulate to the to the winning of Satan but it's going to say this is the word you've promised it to me and I've got a right for it amen I listen it's Jesus who told the story it's Jesus who used the example I can't even tell you all the appropriate applications because there's times where Jesus will tell you no and you must accept as no but there also may be times where Jesus tells you no and and you're not supposed to accept as no I I cannot qualify that in my brain neither can I give you enough examples for you to sort it out but there's got to be something down inside of you that sometimes won't take no for an answer and God will be pleased with it yeah he was so pleased with Jacob that he changed his name from Jacob to Israel amen because Israel means strength because he's because the Bible says that he prevailed over the angelise the Lord and he had power with man and with God I think God was proud of his son amen so please don't ask me brother Tad when should I take no for and when should I not take no I don't know I don't even know how to sort this out of myself all I know is there's times desperation strikes to say I've have no choice godone there's nothing else will work I've got to have you come on the scene for this I've got to have an answer I've got to have Deliverance I can't live like this anymore I can't take it anymore and I can't give up on my children I can't give up on my wife I can't give up on my brother I can't give up on myself being delivered amen amen Amen brother Brenham says in the unchangeable God so the main thing was that Jacob he had a dream he had dreams and visions and so forth but this was one time he could lay his hand on something and say it's God and he was able to hold on to it until the blessing come oh if we could do that if we could find a spot to where we could see God whether it's in his word whether it's wherever it is and recognize it's God God and hold on to it until the blessing comes wrestle it out with God God promised to do it God said if we'd seek we would find ask it' be given knock it'll be open every word is true when Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at and hold on to with his hands and seeing that it was God he would not turn it loose Hey listen this message is God don't turn it loose the word of God is true don't turn it loose for anything no matter what and I wonder sometimes if God won't just every once in a while take this message take his word take take our life and just shake it real good one time just to see how strong a hold we have on it amen you ever had your world rocked amen you ever had I mean I'm talking about in the truth of the hour you ever had somebody you love walk away from the truth amen somebody denounce it somebody amen not believe anymore amen maybe God will just take the this word that you're holding on to and shake it real hard one time to see if he can get it away from you you say God wouldn't do that maybe he would maybe that's exactly what he would do amen why because he's looking for sons and daughter somebody that has his nature amen that's not the shaking off kind amen he's looking for those that are magnetized through the word and can't be shaken off not because of themselves or because of their own strength they can't be shaken off because there's something something inside of them that won't let go of this word it's God holding on to God Amen it's not it's not you holding onto God it's what God placed inside of you what he put in your soul before the foundation of the world that's come to life under this word it won't let go because it's God holding God Amen who was it that was facing off with God and standing in the gap for the children of Israel when they moved to idolatry when Abra when Moses was up on the up on the mountain amen and all of a sudden they moved to idolatry and now amen God was going to wipe them off and he said Moses amen you move to the side I'm going to WIP and Moses stood in the Gap and said don't do it Lord don't do it block my name not theirs and brother benam said and in the and the Bible said and God repented of the evil he thought towards Israel and brother R was troubled with that how could a man have a better idea than God had and said then I realized it was Christ in Moses that wasn't the man that was the God and the man it was God talking to God Amen maybe what God's looking for is the other part of himself amen the other half of the Chinese ticket maybe he's looking for somebody that has his character his nature his desire his love for the word hallelujah man yeah sometimes we get so confused in our Lives why is it so hard why such shaking why one thing after another that's where that's where Jacob was trouble after trouble after trouble and I can just imagine God saying I'm going to go see what's inside that [Laughter] boy amen maybe it wasn't that Jacob needed this maybe it wasn't that God needed to see what was in Jacob maybe Jacob needed to see what was in Jacob you know a faith that can't be tested can't be trusted sometimes we think we believe something and we do to the best of our ability but how are you going to rest on it till it's been tested till you almost lost it till there was nothing else that would hold on but faith and then that Faith was tested and went through the refiner fire and you found out that was a gift of God that wasn't human faith it wasn't intellectual faith that was faith that came from God because it held through it all maybe God doesn't do that for his benefit but maybe he does it for ours amen let's go to 1 Timothy chapter 6 1 Timothy chapter 6 in verse 12 Paul tells Timothy fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life one to thou where unto Thou Art also called and Hast professed a good profession before many witnesses I mean this this idea this concept this thought is all through the scriptures fight the good fight of Faith you mean faith is a fight faith is a fight maybe you have to fight for it maybe it's worth fighting for fight the good fight of faith and lay hold on eternal life that means acquire it grip it grab a hold of it again not passive terminology Paul is not in any way inferring here and the Bible's not any way inferring that all you have to do is come to church to the right kind of church that preaches the right kind of word and you sit there until you get the cold like everybody else got the cold it doesn't come that way the kingdom of God is preached and they presseth into it amen amen that's not what God's looking for God's looking for somebody will'll say that's nothing but the truth amen and I've got to have it in my life brother M says in the message the marriage of the Lamb so the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way God has got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way that's an amazing statement uh God has amazing grace to save you he's talking about your salvation and he will but you'll fight every inch of your way amen he said now he said I've been behind the pull pit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must Reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us we must lay them aside ourself we can't say godone you come lay them aside for us we got to do that ourselves so there's a good fight of Faith there's something to apprehend but there's there's also something to fight against and that's ourselves and God wants us to do that amen he wants us to to bring this body subject let's look at this in 1 Corinthians 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9 where Paul goes into this in verse 24 it says know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain already we're back in nonp passive terminology amen he's talking about striving running and not running just to keep Pace running to win right so this is not passive this is not a passive approach to the gospel or living the life amen but there's a there's a contending an effort a striving a a reaching forth and so let's read this again he says no you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertain so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away so now we want to look at the good fight of faith and this way when Paul was fighting the good fight of faith and in that good fight of Faith he has to bring his body subject so that it doesn't hinder him in his running the race he has to be temperate and moderate and have self-control over himself and bring this body subject to the word of God why so that he where's his fight right here and it this terminology doesn't sound compassive because he says when I keep under my body that word keep under means to beat black and blue also not a passive statement he's not passively allowing the dictates of the flesh to take him wherever he wants but he's actively taking dominion over the flesh aggressively that's the terminology we got he's serious about this and he's aggressive about it he's not passive about it but he's not going to let himself trip himself up and he's not going to let himself hinder himself from getting the prize amen and he and he types it with an athlete which has to do the same thing if the athlete wants to win the prize he's got to bring this body subject to the desire he has inside to win the prize and we've got to do the same thing we've got to bring this flesh amen subject to the desire on the inside to win the race praise God brother brandham says it this way and 1963 in the message accepting God's provided way at the end time says cry for your needs that's God's provided way didn't Jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that cried day and night how much more will the heavenly father give them the spirit who cry out for it day and night seek keep seeking knock keep knocking when the scripture says seek and you shall find knock and the door will be open when when it says seek amen that is that that is a word amen seek or knock that has no definitive Tim stamp to it seek and you shall find so how long should I seek till you find amen amen knock knock is not but knock is active knock brother say keep knocking says knock and the door will be open so so how long do I keep knocking till the door is open seek and you shall find knock and the door will be open this is not a this not a one-time temporary kind of thing this is a an until amen amen seek keep seeking knock keep knocking just keep on till he opens stay out with it cry until the promised word is Vindicated then you got it you don't have to worry no more you see the Bible promised it then stay right there and cry until you get it if if a little baby sees a cooking now listen to what brother b i I thought uh I thought the the analogy the story Jesus used of the unjust judge and the Widow I thought that was a little bit extreme but but now brother brandom's going to bring a parable in the little baby sees a cookie and he wants it he just cry and cry and cry and stick and kick and scream and holler and turn red in the face my religious piety doesn't allow me to talk this way he turned red in the face his mommy getting a him a cookie and it's all over and he got what he saw what he wanted if he wants to lick off your ice cream cone he'll just keep raising a fuss till he gets it well that's the way we're supposed to do this is a prophet of God speaking to us here I mean he he has some understanding on what he's talking about and and and I'm thinking I mean you're using the analogy of a baby throwing an absolute Hissy Fit until he gets what he wants and he's pacified and and and and he wants your ice cream and he will kick up a fuss to you give it to him he said that's what we're supposed to do oh my goodness I'm glad I can read quotes cuz if I tried preaching like that you'd be like brother Chad now should we really talk to God like that should we really shouldn't we just accept whatever he allows and that's not what the prophet taught us that's not what Paul taught us that's not what the scriptures are showing us praise the Lord amen he said now that's the way we're supposed to do if we see a promise in the Bible that's God's word then I just stay stay there and cry out till God gives it to me and he do that now listen he do that to get you off his hands you see that would be in the natural but he's wanting you to do it he likes for you to ask ask abundantly that your Joys might be full he said cry until his word is Vindicated now friend let's watch just a minute now cry until the word is Vindicated the trouble of it is we get a cookie and think that's all there is there's a whole table full we get so we can speak in tongues we say oh brother that's it oh no that ain't that's just some of it that's right oh I I got happy enough to shout that's some more of it but there's a whole lot more of it just keep on crying until that's God's provided way for his people God's provided way always is to take his word and hold onto it until it's Vindicated to you so what is God's way God's Prov by way is always is to take his word and hold on to it until it's Vindicated to you now do you follow me God a provided way hold on to the promise Until It's Made manifest to you so that's our instructions how long until amen seek and you shall find knock and the door will be open amen and remember I'm on record for this that any promise of God in the Bible it's on conditions now just because you believe it's there that don't make it so it'll happen them Pharisees and Sadducees was just as religious with those sacraments as they could be but God said they'd stink in his nose there was no sincerity there was nothing to it that should be you've got to come upon basic promise and then upon your mental attitude towards it amen this is what I believe that the prophet teaching Us in the Bible showing us this is what this is what I'm Desiring to share amen when we take a passive approach when we are just super contented with whatever and we're living below our Privileges and and things that that are promised to us we're not attaining for and we're not looking to grow amen spiritually we're not looking to overcome to be delivered to have to have our family delivered these things that we just settle down and accept and be too contented it shows the wrong attitude towards the word of God that's the real problem that we get to it shows there's not a fervent desire to have all there's not a fervent desire to be delivered we get to some state of just being being able to maintain we got to a certain position where now everything's controllable and okay and we quit striving we quit pressing but that's not all friends there's more there's a Deliverance amen there's Freedom there's Victory there's souls to be saved there's our body IES to be changed for our atoms to change in a moment and twinkling of an eye there's no place to stop and settle down but keep on pressing and keep on pressing to Higher Ground amen and and so to me sometimes the problem is our lethargy and our our complacency is showing a wrong mental attitude because it comes from a lack of desperation yes because we're okay amen am and the reality is God's been good to us friends he's been you look all around God's been so good to us we've been so blessed in our families and in our church and in our health and we've been so blessed in so many ways but God helped me not to be complacent with part of the word when the full measure of Christ has been made available in today and everything he promised is available and I can live the life of Jesus Christ if I'll keep pressing and he'll keep working inside of me and I can have all the promises fulfilled in my life God forbid that I would become complacent in the day when everything's available help me God it's all I can say is help me God Amen now when we talk about the right mental attitude brother B says there's a there's a mental attitude towards the things of gone and it he says it's it's actually required for the Fulfillment of the word you have to have the right attitude towards it in the message the greatest battle ever fought he said when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind and head now they never started in from some organ organization they never started in from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you now we're going to look at the good fight of faith amen contending for the faith pressing into the kingdom fighting laying hold of all of these things we we've turned and and then Paul starts talking about uh uh being tempered in all things and having control over his own body and and we realize now that my enemy is me what I'm fighting is me but the battle now is in my mind and it's going to require ire to F see the Fulfillment of the promises of God is going to require my faith in the promise and my right mental attitude towards it amen but where am I going to have to win the battle I'm going to have to win it in the mind because what's affecting my mental attitude towards the word something in my mind amen amen when we don't know where the Warfare is amen we then we want to fight everything around us listen if you can if you and I can win the battle in our mind we win amen we win because the battle has moved to the battleground of our mind and if we can take the word of God by faith and win the battle in our mind amen we win the fight amen it's not what's going on out here that keeps us defeated it's what's going on in here that keeps us defeated amen so the Battleground is in us and we have to understand that that God is looking amen for the right mental attitude to be expressed and for the right mental attitude to be expressed amen I've got to win the battle in my mind amen praise God this is why this is Brother B said this is a neurotic age amen this is the age where the battle is taking place between our ears this isn't the age where they're hauling us to prison and we're being stoned for our faith amen and we're persecuted and run from City to City it's amazing how we can be fighting a spiritual battle amen that's absolutely crippling us when we have the we have freedom to come to church whenever we want and worship the way we want and sing what we want and do whatever we want we have absolute Liberty to live this message to its fullness so our battle is not external now our battle is internal because the external battle and that doesn't mean we're not going to have a squeeze or a press at the very end the prophet talked about that but that's not what's going on right now right now there's still a battle and the battle is not being imprisoned by the Roman government the battle is being imprisoned in my mind with wrong thinking with complexes and self-doubt and all kinds of fear and anxiety and all the things that the devil's trying to put into our mind to what to inhibit us from having the right attitude towards the word because the right attitude will bring the promise to pass so the fight is in the mind Amen to inhibit me in the expression of my attitude towards the word amen amen praise God you know there's been no age free from a battle when we have so much Liberty and freedom and and and wealth and all the things that we need to serve God according to his word there's no age free from a battle so God gives us freedom and liberty and finances and but then puts us in a neurotic age where everything around us is a lie selling us a lie and tormenting our minds polluting and corrupting our minds amen so we have to win the battle in the the Mind Amen brother B says uh now the right mental attitude all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude your right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass yes amen this is why we cannot be complacent this is why the terminology that we've been reading in the Bible is aggressive because that's the right attitude the right attitude is that land is mine and I'm driving the Philistines off of it that's the right mental attitude that's what the attitude God wanted his children to had when they crossed Jordan he wanted them to have the attitude God gave this land to me it's my land and you've got to go and I'm going to fight you till you're gone and what did he rebuke them for at the end of Judges is because they started to make treaties with all the Canaanites and didn't fully possess the land and he brought a prophet and he used and he used Joshua to bring a rebuke against them and why did you stop why did you quit why didn't you keep pressing what were they showing they were showing the wrong mental attitude towards the promise of God cuz the promise of God was the full inheritance and when they got a degree of peace and comfort and and and a little bit of easy goinging amen they stopped getting the promise and they settled down to eat corn and corn was their blessing it was the corn of the land the fat of the land that was their blessing they started enjoying the blessing but but and and taking the blessing and putting the Canaanites under tribute is showed the wrong mental attitude towards the word of God and God rebuked him for it remember when the king comes to Elisha when Elisha's dying and he says my father my father the the the horsemen of Israel and the Chariots thereof and and and he said pray that we'll be delivered and I I I don't remember the full context but uh Elisha said take your arrows take your arrow and your bow in your hand and shoot it out the window so shall you be delivered of the syrians now take your arrows and smite them on the ground and he smoted them Thrice and Elisha rebuked him and say why did you only Smite Thrice you should have done at least five or six times then you would have been fully delivered of the cians but now now you're only going to have a partial Victory why because you weren't aggressive enough when your opportunity came to have a promise of God you weren't aggressive enough you didn't want enough you didn't ask enough you didn't push enough listen I don't want I I like I said I don't understand all these things cuz I'm not pushy by Nature amen I'm telling you when somebody cuts in front of me in line somewhere I just say God bless you I mean just I'm not put pushy I'm not aggressive and I don't want to be pushy or aggressive but I'm not about to to miss my privileges anymore I'm not about to stand by amen and miss my opportunity to have the word fulfilled in my life amen remember remember when they had the Fallout with the Tribe of Benjamin because they took the Levites concubine amen and he ended up it was a horrific story end up cutting her into pieces sending it out to the 12 tribes and they went up to destroy Benjamin and they asked God God should we go up against Benjamin or not and God said yes amen they inquired of the uran the thumb and he said yes go they have a direct word of the Lord God said go and defeat Benjamin they went to fight Benjamin defeated them they turned their back and they ran away they lost the battle they lost but God spoke prophetically and told him to go but they lost you talk about a mind battle that would start a bind battle what happened the high priest and the man and thumb and this is what God Said and he told us to go what did we get wrong what did we miss how how did we misinterpret what God what what's what's wrong with us what's wrong well nothing was wrong they went back and inquired again and said oh God we don't know what happened we don't know what's wrong should we go up against Benjamin or we should we stop and he said go up yeah they got the word of the Lord and say okay what whatever we messed up before let's not mess it up this time they go up and they lose the battle a second time listen the Bible says Elisha was a man of like passions as we are brother renam come along and he took those Old Testament types and told the story in a way that made it real to where we can enter into the story so let's let enter into this story this is you now the word of the Lord through God's prophetic means has told you to go up and you lost you did it again you lost now when that happened before there was an achin in the camp so where's the aen in the camp we're all accusing each other of but that wasn't the problem this time when you read the story apparently there's no problem they come back now to God a third time and say God should should we go up we don't know what to do should we go up or not he said go up they went up to Benjamin that time and they wiped him out they defeated Benjamin they won and you look at this whole story and say this whole story is a mess from beginning to end it is but one thing that we can learn from that is whatever God says do it regardless of the outcome amen do it don't worry about the outcome keep the word the outcome is up to God Amen if it doesn't work the first time do it again if it doesn't work the second time do it again do it until God tells you stop or you got something wrong or you need to change direction but if you're convinced it's the word of the Lord if you've got confirmation it's the word of the Lord then stick with it what a lesson God wants a little bit of grit some tenacity amen some of his nature coming through his children amen there's so many things in the Bible amen that are far beyond my intellectual understanding I would have never written the Bible this way and I would have never done it that way but we come here to the end of time and I say I'm so glad God wrote his Bible that way I'm so glad he did it that way cuz that's my life amen I go to do something and apply the word that I am convinced is the word it's Vindicated through a Vindicated Propet I know it's right and I do it and my effort fails amen I don't get the results I think I it it turn turns in a direction I didn't expect what am I supposed to do I don't believe I'm supposed to take a passive approach if it's the word and I'm convinced it's the word it's Vindicated the word and I believe it's for me then maybe I should just try again maybe I shouldn't Smite my arrows just three times but maybe five or six or seven times until I'm fully delivered and possess This Promise in my hand amen am maybe we're not supposed to be so passive when it it comes to the promises of God Amen the nature of God listen friends is so Dynamic it's not simplistic it's Dynamic you think about Jesus he was the Lamb of God we talked about this before but the Lamb of God when he saw the money changers in the temple became overwhelmed with Zeal for the temple of God became angry platted together a whipped the money changers out of the temple and threw over their tables this is the Lamb of God God Is So Dynamic the Lord he's full of Mercy but he's a judge amen uh he's so gentle and so aggressive if if I'm going to take the nature of Christ it may be more Dynamic than we thought maybe there's times to be aggressive and there's times to be gentle maybe there's times to be a lamb and times to be a lion depending on the situation and maybe we just need more discernment to know when this is time this is the word of God friends this is the word of God this is a promise and this is my need and I can't see any other way God I've got to have it I don't know that that's displeasing to him from what I've been reading amen now I didn't finish this quote but brother B says your right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil and when you accept him as your healer don't ever act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God then and not on you amen is that right brother Jim Swanson amen amen amen I was trying to get him act like he was crippled but he was refusing amen he stood up and walked when I was telling him not to but he believed the promise of God Amen so sometimes don't listen to me brother he says believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God then not on you as long as you take God at his word then the word will produce what it promised to do is that right now have faith believe him with all of your heart now uh we've been talking about uh me the right mental attitude the the the Battleground in the mind because that's the that's the age we find ourselves in friends that's where we're at it's not so much the physical things and we deal with some physical things we have some pain and sickness and some of these afflictions but really I I to me I believe our greatest battle is the mind the age that we live in and and so we've got to win the battle in the mind and brother brm says and in the message Hebrews from 1957 in the Hebrew series is now only way that a church can be built the only way that a command can have faith is not by his denominational not by his affiliation but his faith rests not upon Theology of some man's ideas because it's no more less altogether man but the only way faith can find its solemn resting place is upon the immovable and unchangeable word of God so that's where we have to have something to base our faith on and we fa base our faith on the word of God we can't base it on our emotions our feelings our thoughts our our we can't base it off any of that because those things change all the time so we have to have a basis for our faith to start first and and our basis is on the unmovable and unchangeable word of God then he says this your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he he he could sure stop them from roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess that he confess that he has done it for you he's the high priest of your confession then again in 59 he says you that accepted healing and you don't feel any different he went through the prayer line or they prayed in a meeting they accepted healing but they didn't feel any different you say my faith is not enough to move it right now brother brandom then he says take the adopted child way don't take that way but come to the ad opted child way just keep saying Lord I am healed I believe it it'll come you get your right mood your mood you get your right mood that's your mental attitude you get your right mood you see and then your faith will be right it'll take it you just believe it with all your heart amen you realize what comes out of our mouths is really important cuz what what our ears hear our mouth say affect us affect our mind affect our temperament affect us we have to be very careful that we confess the word of God not the lies that the devil is trying to feed us lies like you'll never get over this lies like it'll never be any different lies like you can't change all those lies you cannot repeat those lies because as you repeat those lies there's a power with spoken word and we don't want to be found speaking those words but we want to be found speaking the true words that can't fail so if God's given us a measure of free moral agency and we get to choose then let's choose to speak the word and choose not to speak anything contrary to the word amen said you get your right mood and then your faith will be right I love this and in the message a man running from the presence of the Lord Brother tells this story said something like I was told one time that a lady said back in the horse in buggy days that said the horse run away with her going from church and said what' you do said I trusted the Lord until the lines broke said well that's the time to trust the Lord after the lines is broke you're trusting in the lines until they're broke now this is really important that little statement that that woman made I trusted I trusted in the Lord till the lines broke and then I panicked and brother brandom is so Keen to to point out that then her faith was not in the Lord regardless of what her confession is her faith was in the lines because when the lines broke she lost faith oh this is this is this gets down to nitty-gritty many times we can believe the message we can believe certain things as long as the lines don't break now you can interpret those lines any way you want like like I go to the doctor the doctor has a treatment that treatment seems to be working and I'm trusting God as the treatments working and God heals through doctors he heals through medicine so I'm not discounting that but when the medicine starts to [Applause] fail and what worked before isn't working anymore then we'll find out where our faith is is it in the medicine or is it in the Lord cuz when we start to panic because it's no working it shows that we were putting faith in the medicine not in God God can use medicine but I'm trusting God to use the medicine for my healing not the medicine so if the medicine fails it doesn't change anything God's still my healer it's it was God all along it was never the medicine he may choose to use the medicine and if he does and leads me that way I got faith that God's going to use the medicine if he chooses to use a doctor or a chiropractor or surgeon then I've got faith that I'm going to be healed because this is God's method for me but if the method fails I don't lose faith in God because the method failed because God's word is a promise to me that by his stripes I am healed that he's The God Who heals all of our diseases if I go into panic and listen sometimes listen we believe the message until a relationship around us has failed a friend a church relationship something goes wrong in the church something wrong with the pastor the turmoil in the church and all of a sudden I'm starting to doubt the message or not that that means your faith was in the lines not in God faith was in a human relationship and when the human relationship failed I started having doubts and questions and insecurity and all of the things then our our faith was in a human relationship not in the Divine word of God Amen and these are good that God will allow these things to be pointed out in our life so that we realize I was putting confidence in man I was putting confidence in a Minister I was putting confidence in my brothers and sisters but I was supposed to have confidence in God alone God works through a minister God works through my brothers and sisters like he works through a doctor or medicine but you know what there're still human beings and those lines can break the human element is weak riddled with failure Pro prone to collapse but when the human element collapses and then our faith collapses then our faith was in the human element not in God that's the reality I say God help us to put our confidence in you and you alone amen see there's just a couple examples I want to give as we as we wind down I just want to share a couple examples from the scriptures back in Genesis 37 Joseph was had a dream he had two dreams a series of two dreams and in those dreams he realized that he was going to be in a position of PR prom prominence and that his brothers were going to bow to him because he saw all these sheeps in the field and the 11 shoes of his brothers bowed to him then he saw in the next dream the Sun and the Moon which is mother and father and uh 12 stars and the 11 Stars his brothers and his mother and father they all bowed and did Obe Essence unto him and and this is what angered his his Brethren and and so now Joseph has a dream and that dream to him is a prophecy so he knows the will of God in his life and the will of God in his life is that he's going to rise to a position where his family is going to bow to him the problem is Joseph doesn't know how he's going to get from point point A to point B he knows what point B is but he doesn't know what the Journey's like from point A to point B you know when he had that dream I doubt that he very much could have anticipated being hated by his brother sold into slavery gone to Egypt hey there's no way that he could have anticipated that this was God's way of fulfilling the prophecy so when we talk about the right mental attitude and we talk about the battle in our mind consider Joseph now for a minute who's got a promise of God through a prophetic dream that he knows what's going to happen in his life and the position that God has for him and then all of a sudden the very next thing that happens in his life is the opposite of the dream like it's not working like your brothers don't bow to you they hate you and they sell you uh to to the moabites to the ishmaelites amen to become a slave and then you're in bondage in a in a in a train in a camel train being taken down to Egypt when you get down there you're sold into the slaver or you become a slave in Piper's house my goodness you talk about having the opposite effect this is the word of the Lord this is what happened put them together like when somebody come in the prayer line Amen brother B had to teach people about Divine Healing they come in a prayer line they got prayed for by a prophet who has a gift of Divine Healing given to him and they were prayed for and the next day they got sicker opposite opposite they thought they were going to get better they got sicker and brother bandam says that's the very indication that you're getting well don't lose your faith amen don't give up on the promise don't don't take what you accepted yesterday and throw it in the trash today because of the circumstances the circumstances are the lying vanities the word of God is thus sayeth the Lord amen praise God so now Joseph has this deal in Piper's house then that goes sour he winds up in prison he gets some position of prominence in prison like it goes from slavery to prison like it's worse and and I want you to consider with me this is what I'm considering is the Mind battle Joseph was in if Elisha was a man of like passions as you and I what do you think Joseph was do you think Joseph ever said what in the world is going on Lord do do do you think he could have ever possibly said Lord I don't understand what's happening I don't understand why I believe the dream I believe you showed me but I don't understand what's happening am and maybe he didn't say that maybe he had perfect Faith all the way through but I know myself and I would have probably asked myself something like that I would have probably cried and cried and cried and say God I don't understand what did I miss what's wrong with me God where where have I failed where am I broken what's the problem with me yes that's probably what I would have been doing I'd have been probably saying God then then you know the devil puts thoughts remember what he said the the the birds can fly over your head so the thoughts can come in your mind but don't let them Roost chase them away the thoughts come brother said the devil can put thoughts in your mind but he can't read your mind he can whisper thoughts into your ear but he cannot read your mind and then the thoughts come well maybe I Mis understood the dream now I'm not trying to tell you what happened to Joseph I'm just trying to tell you if I was switched in that place being the kind of human I've been those are the questions I would ask what's wrong with me what what did I do wrong why am I here maybe I misunderstood maybe maybe I can't really interpret dreams maybe I was just kidding myself maybe I'm I'm not really one of them amen the devil the devil Whispers in everybody's ear amen he he cannot I couldn't say he can't possibly God could have sh him anything but a human being can't draw the equation from all the prophecy okay bondage oh slavery I get it slavery okay now to Egypt then slavery to prison okay I'm in Pharaoh's prison oh I see the whole plan God's got this mapped out perfect I don't think it was like that you know what happens when we come through situations and our life they become testimonies amen we look back over and we say absolutely every step was perfect that decision I was Cur I didn't know it was right or not it was perfect that timing that the decision that position I but while it was going on you were like I have no idea I don't know if this is right or wrong I'm just doing what I feel to do and I and it looks like I made a mistake oh God I'm sorry if that was a mistake I don't know this is how we pray this is how we talk this is how we live amen and then we get on the other side of a situation you look back everything is lined up perfect according to the results God wanted amen but when you were in the middle of it you were fighting mind battles like crazy trying to know if you were right or wrong or you misunderstood or you got something off or there's a hidden sin in your life or somehow God hates you I mean I don't believe I'm the only one in this position but the reality is amen we have to believe be we have to believe the word of God and say you know what I'm not here because of myself that God has drawn me God has called me and he didn't call me unless he knew me before the foundation of the world Amen and he revealed himself to me and revealed this message to me and I'm here by the drawing and calling of the Lord not by myself and now I believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and He delighted in his will and brother bam said he even he even makes our mistakes work together for his perfect will and I believe by the grace of God I'm one of them and even my mistakes will work together for his perfect will in my life the problem we run into is when we allow amen these things in life to beat us down we start to question and we start to second guess and what it does to us is it changes our mental attitude towards the promise of God and it start to seow doubt and apprehension and we lose that aggressive nature we need to keep pressing on we get into a middle of a set of circumstances and now all of a sudden instead of marching forward like a mighty marching Army we're putting sandbags up to defend territory we better hunker down right here I don't know if I'm going the right direction or not we were certain of it a day ago but today I'm I'm digging a foxhole right here because I'm taking enemy fire and I don't know that I'm right amen you know the best thing that we can do is if we were convinced it was the will of God and God hasn't told us differently the best thing we can do is put our head down and keep walking and saying God I cannot find my own way I cannot do what's right I cannot make a sound decision to save my life but God I'm going to close my eyes and put my hand in yours and if I'm making a wrong step just turn me somehow step me somewhere else move me in some way I don't know what to do but I believe that you want me to go from here to there and I'm going from here to there unless you tell me something different what else can we do every time we start moving in second guess start moving in second guess the the Bible says a a a a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways every once in a while we have to set our face like flint and move and I believe if we're wrong God will wake us up we're his children amen we're not his enemies we're his children we're not his puppets we're not his toys we're not his ponds we're his children if I was an honest heart of moving forward doing the best I know how to do be believing with all my heart this is what God wants and I get a little bit off the path I believe that I have a father who's a Shepherd who will bring me back on because he loves me amen but I don't want life circumstances in the mind battle to cause me to stop pressing to stop striving to lose my my aggressive approach to the things of God and you find sometimes in life that happens to us happens to all of us has anybody ever had a slump before spiritually amen I've had several of them you just get into a place where feel like you don't know any more anything don't know what right you don't know what to do you don't know where to go and but what it causes is the wrong mental attitude towards the word of God that's what that causes you know it's a good thing to doubt yourself but it's a bad thing to doubt the word so we get into these fixes sometimes he says here's what brother Brenham says in the everpresent water from The Rock Says you see many times people thinks that a prophetic gift that God just says I'll pick you up right here and set you down here now you just go right over here and he doesn't tell you all those things if he did then what overcoming Faith did you have see he lets you stand alone more than anybody else brother R's talking about himself now with a prophetic gift he lets you stand alone more than anybody else you all can come to me and ask for certain things and he's never failed yet but what he gives you the answer that's right but I can ask him for things for myself and many times he just lets me alone and just let me go ahead and walk into it yes you talk about a mind battle a mind battle this man has a gift that he can tell you where your car keys are who stole your car how far they drove it where they brought it and where they parked it yeah but when he ask something for himself nothing talking about mind battles I mean I can imagine the Mind battles I can imagine the discouragement I can imagine the difficulty I can imagine the question why God why it works so good but nothing now I'm praying to you and I'm getting nothing oh my goodness he says Now list is what brother Rim said I have things now that I have to solve out myself and decisions I have to make and this is such a vital one till I cannot exactly make it until I'm sure that it's him speaking to me he won't give me a vision he just lets me alone so I'm just sitting as an orphan like this morning I don't know which way to turn so I've committed it to the Lord I love I'm so thankful the prophet said this he said I'm sitting here like an orphan this morning what did he feel like he felt abandoned with no and and you know what he would think I I've been this way before where I've needed God to speak to me so bad I had to have an answer I needed it with all that's in me amen at least I thought that I did and and and I said God it's so simple for you one word I don't know if you ever prayed like that but I mean I've been de God one word it takes nothing if you would just nod your head this would go away why won't you speak why won't you answer I've cried out to God before said God you can speak many have heard your voice you have a voice and you can speak why aren't you speaking to me amen I I've been I've been in this spot where I felt like there's there I have no idea what to do I can't go forward I can't do anything unless God speaks to me he's got to show me I need a sign I need something and you know what I got I got absolutely nothing because nothing was better than a sign nothing was better than an audible voice because there's some things that I had to work out on my own some decision I had to make on my own to prove what was inside of me God God doesn't always make it easy friends we get into situation listen when when they came out of Egypt they come out of Egypt singing and dancing and shouting and having a glorious time amen God had delivered them he had spoke through the prophet everything he said come to pass and come right down to the Red Sea to an insurmountable obstacle and they were all going to die that's right they had no clue what to do or how to get out of it go back can't go back can't go forward can't do anything Moses starts crying out to God they cry to Moses Moses cries to God and God said why cry speak and go forward why did he say that why did he say speak and go forward because God had already told Moses you're going to go fetch my children and you're going to bring them back to this mountain so he already had the word of God he didn't need a new word of God he already had the word of God and the word of God is you will go get my children and you will bring them and they will worship me on this mountain so when he hid an insurmountable obstacle amen he CED the most logical thing to do is cry out to God and God says why cry out to me speak and go forward I've already told you you're coming back to the mountain so just come back to the mountain I'll move the obstacles away God already promised we're healed I don't know what he's going to do or how many obstacles I get but for me it's not to figure out I just move forward towards my healing and trust God God will work it out he's got a plan and he'll work his plan he'll fulfill his own word amen but I've got to keep moving forward towards the promise amen amen whatever that promise may be oh it doesn't always come easy I don't think he wants it to be easy I think he's proving his children I think he wants to display what's on the inside of you and I you know we don't really know we don't really comprehend the full potential that's in a child of God amen we don't really comprehend it we can talk about it we can even quote the things brother Brenham says about it like he says if you've got a shadow of the life of God in you you've got enough power into you to create another world and go live a private life on it but we can quote that but I don't think we comprehend that but you know what God will do sometimes he'll let us get into circumstances because he wants us to know that greater is he that is in ye in thee than he that's in the world amen and faith comes out and and and and a determination comes out and grit comes out and and a laying hold of the promises comes out why because that's part of God's character that's in there and sometimes to get the fragrance out of a rose you've got to squeeze it amen so many times the battle is in the mind and that's where we've got to have Victory is in the mind so many circumstances in life so many difficulties but what we're really struggling with is our own thoughts right what we're really trying to overcome is our own thinking so that we can keep moving forward into the promise of God and sometimes God will let us sit like an orphan and not say anything to us I mean there so many times listen God is so good to us there's so many times we'll come to the service with a question in our heart and God will answer it over the preaching of the word so specific you cannot miss that it was God answering your question do you know there's other times you come with just as much a desperate need and say God I need to hear an answer and I'm coming I'm coming this is your way and you're going to answer today and you walk out with the same question you walked in with he's just as able to answer the one is the other amen sometimes he just wants to see what you and I will do about it because the battle we've got to win is the Mind battle and I don't think it's going to get easier but I think God's training us teaching us not to rely on circumstances but to trust in his word his word says Go destroy the benjamites they they whipped us what do we do go destroy the benjamites but God they whipped us what do we do go destroy the benjamites amen maybe there's a lesson in all of it maybe this whole life there's a lesson in all of it for all of us to stick with his word and keep sticking with his word and keep sticking with his word until am amen I want to read one more scripture together before we go let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10:32 before we read it I just want to say sometimes the test is time and silence that was a test for Abraham right God come to Abraham and told him you're going to go to this land and I'm going to give it to you and your seed then a long time went by before God spoke to him again sometimes when we read the Bible and you let's say we read the story of Abraham it's like God's always coming to him talking to him like he God's talking to him all the time but you know there was years when God never spoke to him years of what years of keeping sheep years of managing the servants years of moving about years of life with obstacles and struggles and trials and in those years no doubt Abraham would have questions sometimes because God would come back to him and speak to him again and Abraham would say God you've given me no seed and one that's born in my own house is my Heir but God had already told them your seed's going to possess the land he already had a promise that your seed is going to have this land I'm giving it to you and your seed after you but now time goes on and silence goes on and the next time God talks to him he says you haven't given me a seed and this one that's in my house is my Heir and God says Oh no you're mistaken that's not your air but the one that comes out of your bow should be your air what was the challenge for Abraham the challenge was time and silence listen most all of us have Supernatural events in our lives times that God did something Supernatural and special without question that was God he spoke to me he gave me a sign he answered a prayer he did something that's unquestionable but guess what that's not every day of our lives and sometimes we like to act like we're super spiritual and we have this thing that happens every day of Our Lives but the reality is God will do something Supernatural and special and then you'll go through years sometimes of Silence with no other Supernatural event why because you've got to press into the kingdom we've got to overcome by faith our faith has to be groomed and encouraged do you realize your faith can grow that's what Paul says you grow within Faith Paul even said when I come I want to come and and add what's lacking in your faith our faith can grow and God was growing Abraham's Faith all through time until when he gives the report through Paul at the end he said he staggered not at the promise of God when you go through and read it's all kinds of little questions and this and trying that and doing that and it looks like he's staggering but God's not worried about the process God's looking at the result the Finish line and at the Finish Line he staggered not at the promise of God but he believed God was faithful sometimes we look at our life and we're looking at the process and it looks like a big old mess I because the process isn't always clean and neat and nice and tidy you know but God is bringing us to a desired end he's working on us he's growing our faith he's teaching us to win the battle in the mind he's showing us how to lay hold of the promise and hold on and not let go how does he do it maybe we got shook off a couple times maybe we got shook off along the way once or twice but then we realize next time I'm not going to get shook off and the next time we get a hold of a promise of God and all of a sudden it starts shaking he say I'm not going to let you go till you bless me amen oh praise God maybe we just need the training to win the Mind battle to stay with the word of God regard us of what we see feel think hear amen stay with the word of God prise God Hebrews chap 10:32 he says but call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became Companions of them that were so used for you had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring sustance cast pass not away therefore your confidence which had great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tar now the just shall live by faith but if any draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul amen God bless you as we stand we want to finish with this scripture amen how many of you believe that God's called you not to be of the drawing back kind amen listen not because you're a super strong person but because he's planted his seed inside of you and he knows the potential in that seed and he's using the circumstances in life to draw the potential out of the seed to have a son or daughter of God like him on the earth amen I failed I'm probably going to fail again you may not have but praise God I failed but my failures have done something to me they've put inside of me a greater desire to never fail his word again they've taught me a lesson that I don't want to forget they've showed me my Frailty they showed me my Human Condition they've showed me my inability it may be completely relying on him and on his word to exposed the trappings of the devil to exposed the lies of the devil maybe that was the purpose all along to mold and make character inside of us amen but we're not of them that draw back why are we not of them that draw back because he's predestinated this bride not to fail that's why we're not of them who draw back because he predestinated said this bride won't fail she's predestinated not to fail and he says we've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son so we've been predestinated unto adoption so for us there's no option but forward amen forward forward yeah I got knocked down that's okay there's no option but forward I got derailed that's fine too come back to where you got off but the only option is forward cuz you've been predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ you've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ this bride won't fail she's predestinated not to fail there's no option but forward God is going to have a people that'll keep reaching forth in the spirit keep striving for the word of God keep pressing into the kingdom until the full promise of the kingdom is fulfilled and I don't want to be of those that draw back God forgive forgive me for my failings God forgive me for my drawing back but oh God give me the strength to keep moving forward by Your Grace by your spirit by Your Word keep me moving forward to the full realization of the promise of this day amen amen let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you oh God we thank you Lord your Prophet told us man is a failure to begin with God we realize it's true man is a failure we've come hybridized our minds are weak our bodies are weak our Cravings are wrong but oh your word is right your promises are true and God you've planted something inside of us that's beyond us Lord what you called the true self what really was meant to be us from the beginning God help us not to look to the flesh anymore but look to that seat of Promise God help us Lord to no longer allow the devil to whip us around in our mind and move us into a place of fear and second guessing and compromise where we too mentally strained to reach out and to move forward and be bold we've lost our boldness we've become timid in our own minds and fearful apprehensive forgive us Lord forgive us for that God if you'll come and strengthen Us by your word and by your spirit give us the strength to move forward with boldness Lord to rise and to press on to move out in the word again Lord to keep struggling to keep striving to keep fighting to keep PR pressing to keep denouncing the devil to keep calling lying vanities L lying vanities help us Lord to keep moving forward by your grace strengthen us Lord in times of Silence help us to believe your word let Faith rise to the occasion Lord when you seem to be absent help us to have faith and eyes of Faith to see that you're always present and the footsteps of the righteous are order to the Lord God let your word become our vision let your word become our reality let your word become the only truth that we accept help us God this is the hour that we live in this is what we have to come to help us almighty God strengthen us fill us with your spirit give us your anointing Propel us forward as your Mighty marching Army in this last day we love you we confess to you Lord that we need you strengthen us feed us move us by your grace we love you father help us God to want nothing more than the pro promise of your word I love you father I thank you for this day bless your word in our Lives May the word that's preached Lord become a manifestation inside of us become a may it become a living reality in our next trial when doubts and fears begin to press in our mind God may this word take control and bring us Liberty and deliverance and strength we love you God we thank you we ask that you would move in US and move us forward in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all brother [Music] John I'm pressing on this upward way and New Height I'm G in every [Music] day still praying as I'm
