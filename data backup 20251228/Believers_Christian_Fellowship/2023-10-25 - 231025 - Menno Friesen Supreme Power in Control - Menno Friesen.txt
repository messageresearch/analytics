here earlier in the year twice in one year this is wonderful amen It's a Wonderful privilege as we mentioned before you know brother minow pastored here in Lima years ago and he pastored several of you and you know he's been faithful when I see these men have G before who's been faithful for decades it does something to me it's not an easy way it's not easy to minister it's not easy to pastor but when God will hold a man faithful you can see the power of the spirit in a man's life and his willingness to surrender where would we be if these vet veterans hadn't paved the way hadn't held on when others were letting go and and hadn't battled it out when when things were rough and I just I say I just respect you brother Mano I appreciate you appreciate What the Lord Has Done through you and for you and it's our privilege to have him come and Minister and share what the Lord's laid on his heart and I just want to do my part in pull and make it easy for the brother just to freely share what the lord has laid on his heart and I want to receive from God tonight amen let's just welcome our brother with the song It's a sweet sweet anointing flowing down to make me clean like a might rushing [Music] stream swe [Music] pour and wine sing that one more time when you getting used to the words here sing it one more time oh sweet S I know Glory down to make me clean like a rushing byy stream oh sweet oh sweet pour out the all let's just bow one more time in prayer as we invite the Lord tonight Lord that's the whole reality of it all that sweet anointing that comes from you that washes us whiter than the driven snow sets us in a place where we can walk on the King's Highway all of our cares are cast on you tonight amen and as we look at the promises of your word everyone is already a finished work amen only ask one thing only believe all things are possible to a Believer so we thank you again today Lord and we singing that song talking about walking and talking and going along the way that's the one one thing we're all longing to hear when this race is finished well down thy good and faithful servant enter thou into the presence of the Lord when the race is run we want to hear those sweet words lord well done faithful servant who can be faithful Lord but them which you've ordained to do that all of our faithfulness and our goodness Lord it just ranks to nothing but you are the faithful God that never never never changes time has no effect on you but we're creatures of time and we realize our days pass quickly but oh there's a land beyond the river Hallelujah that's sweet forever thank you for your goodness again tonight for this little house of worship and as the Saints have come tonight may they go away just a little higher a little stronger May the weak say I am strong and if it's nothing more than than just a confession Lord knowing that the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass and just stay with it God said it I believe it that settles it thank you for your grace now bless us now as we Fellowship around your word in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen God bless you you can be seated and I like to welcome and thank you all tonight this uh Tabernacle I feel I need some binoculars to get to see you all I said it last time too I said brother Chad must be all used to that and and um but uh I'm used to seeing the faces of the people we got our people way up closer I just this is far enough so they don't spit into their face but I mean but it is good to be here find good people and I'm sure you're all nice people I can't see you too well but I'm you're you're wonderful people I'm thankful that you're part what I believe is the most glorious part of God's choosing uh if he'd had done any better if he could do any better he would have done better because he's God he wouldn't choose just anybody he knows them that are his and uh he's not ringing his hands trying to figure out who they are he knows them before the foundation of the world and U I got to make a little confession I'm actually here on on a on a uh trip brother Wayne where you at oh yeah way there and um he said come come for a while and and just stay a while and I said all right so we kind of planned October and said let's uh let's put October aside and and so then it went on for a while didn't come to the middle of October and I said well all right then we'll be the two weeks and I'll uh I'll preach once for you on the 15th and then I'll then we'll just uh meet in the restaurant We'll pour from vessel to vessel uh you know what is when preachers get together it's a good time when you can sit down over coffee and just pour from what vessel you learn a lot of things along the way and uh it's good sometimes and then sometimes when I get a little bit out of hand he straightens me out so that's he's a young fell he can do that and U but I let him do that too cuz I kind of I'm I'm very happy for the young ministers that's that I look behind I think my they they just picked up the message and just running with it with all the grace and reality and uh there's so much reality in this message that I I don't think we'll ever be able to digest at all it just just the time you get a good drink and just think oh now that's it from now on that is so then comes another wave and and it just swallows you up to the place to where you finally say Lord there's just nothing left just keep pouring it in pouring it in and giving it out we want to pour in we want to give out what what what's in in us well whether we like to do that or not that's what happens whatever is in you it comes out and I'm glad to say say this I believe it's the grace of Jesus Christ in our heart in my heart here today and I stand before you I'd like to say things that would help you along the way make it easier and I've always believed that uh a real Christian one that's filled with the Holy Ghost has a desire to make life a little easier for somebody and uh though we're not always there like we'd like to be and uh but I do believe it makes a difference if your heart's in the right place he gives opportunity to serve him to serve his people and uh I I believe that the uh the uh the little bride that's on this Earth is the cream of his crop she's he's she's the wonderful people I I don't mean it because that she had anything to offer that's right that's right he offered it all and something inside of your heart said amen and so I'm I'm kind of that kind of person I believe in the god of the amen some people believe in shouting a lot and clapping a lot that's good running around that's that's good that's all has its place uh we don't all always act the same when we're alone or when we're nobody's looking why we might get a little excited but uh but there's one thing you can always do say Amen to the word of God just make sure it's the it is the word of God not the word of the pastor and the minister alone that it's the word of God in season in the time that we're now living and the message of God's word is in season all always in season now God's word is never out of season it's recognizing the day and the hour that we're in and I'm want to just bring greetings brother Dwayne Fair who is the pastor there now in our assembly he said make sure wherever you go greet the Saints and I do that in the LI area and I believe uh you know running down through the road number 75 I was thinking the other day Irene and I were driving and going on to the church there in bluon I said you know there's one thing about this this area they're going to have to quite an account for their lives they drive by they' got the opportunity not for what they've heard but what they could have heard there's a church three major churches here and maybe all different ones that's ones I know and I remember when there was wasn't even one when I first came here in 77 and we laid the we we dug over the uh the the ground where we're laying the foundation for the Tabernacle there and there was they were just coming in from everywhere there was a few Believers here of course you know the Browns and so with the major ones at the time and different ones they I say the major ones the ones that I was associating with the closest and but there I found out later on there were just everywhere laced around the area and now you think of all the saints the lights are shining everywhere but it is of course a lot darker too than it was then we're we're much further down the road now and uh we're we're we're we're beginning to see a lot of the greenness B out of the the uh the church you know that that adoption of the spirit of the Lord where it's moving and getting all the greenness out for the combine to come and take it out and we know that's we are dealing with immortality there and uh but remember before immortality comes upon this elect lady she'll be fully rip there won't be any greenness is my I believe it this way I believe it that way no I we believe it the way God said it that's good enough with me and I appreciate some of the things and brother CH brother Chad said just preach uh he didn't tell me what to preach so I just I want to just take my time I not take my time this is Wednesday night I'll quickly hurry up now because Wednesday night most of you been working today and and uh you you except for sister Nancy is that you sitting there no she she didn't work today she was taking it easy we've already had coffee with her and a few other people and uh we love you thank you for your prayer prayers from time to time you know how it is I can't say I pray for you all the time because there's so many to pray for nowaday is come from the East that's just our nation but around the world there's an elect lady that I believe is ripening in the presence of almighty God I believe this message in itself is the power of God working in Souls of men and women that will literally bring them to the condition is bringing them to the condition of immortality I I'm not I'm not young anymore but I could I could go yeah we're talking about somebody 93 years old stand there and we were discussing it the other day what would feel like to be old and then suddenly see your body begin to change amen well I I know what it feels like when the soul changes when it picks up the light it begins to shine and the glory of God begins to uh shine in your heart you just can't see anything once you see the light walk in the light that's all you can see from that time on I'm glad to be here tonight let me read Colossians and for a little I'm going to take Colossians maybe you could stand with me as I read it I'm not going to take a lot of time but but just drop in a little bit in a certain little area I uh I wanted to T entitle my message tonight that we're singing that sweet sweet anointing and I'm going to read a quote after I read the scripture and draw my text from that little quote just to to reflect for a little while but let's read Colossians the 1 chapter and verse 12 beginning giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son that's a good place to be your spiritual position in Christ am in whom we have the Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible invisible whether they are Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church and we call her the bride but the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the cross or through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether things in the Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alate and enemies in your minds by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight amen if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which is which ye have heard which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a minister amen Lord we ask your blessing on your word it's already blessed but bless it to our hearts and to our souls father thank you now for your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated and I didn't ask them to put this up but let me just read a little a quote here and uh this is an old quote but uh I I kind of uh would like to make it make draw my thought from there and said uh because we're thinking about the sweet anointing that's upon a people brother Bram makes a little comment here said some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that he said when was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone and what did it do when they had that anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ he was the spirit we have the spirit by measure but he had it without measure and one day when he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and to bind up the Brokenhearted to heal the sick and give sight to the blind now he laid down the scr scroll you know the scripture well and look there and he laid it down and he stood back and uh he laid the scroll down and he said this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now we would think in such an anointing as was on him he had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here it was in type and in full anointing the full blessing and the anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building screaming holler and that's all right I don't think didn't say it was wrong but that kind of anointing that was built up 800 years and that had been prophesied here is the fullness of the word embodied and he standing there takes the scroll and begins to declare himself who he is right that he is the one that created all things yet he took upon the form of humanity to redeem he didn't have to do anything but did all things for his own glory for his own self and here he's standing now and he said it would make us what to shout and scream and holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll he sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what's that's what he done under that anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is the supreme power in control I want you to just you feed on that during the week let it roll through your heart the anointing the true anointing is supreme power in control now this is if somebody show somebody's going to preach this much better than I ever would or every can make reference to it because I'm not a teacher but uh I can just hear some of the things right think of all the powers they're trying to take control of this day of our human race of the world over what's the biggest what's the struggles it's all going about right now to cease power and be supremely in control it's the nature of man it's the nature of people that want to do that but you know they never will we know who supremely in control but listen I said the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how that's what's here now you might not be able to understand it as you walk he's talking about the prayer line he's standing in the prayer line you might not be able to get it but I challenge your faith to this you come and believe what I have told you remember what the angel told him if you can get the people to believe you what you have said that this is the anointed word as was told by the scripture what Malachi prophesied this is that this is our day of visitation if you believe that it's not me a man speaking but it's God speaking through the veil that you can see the man but recognize God one saw a man one saw God the same word now you say oh deifying I'm think I'm preaching a deity here today absolutely I believe I'm preaching to deity being a part of deity and we're all a part of deity to begin with or we'll never be for there's only one form of eternal life right it didn't start it didn't end your body had a beginning and it'll have an end this flesh but not the real Soul that's right amen I love that he said I challenge your faith to this you come and believe what I have told you and watch what'll happen see just just believe what's been told you and see what happens the anointing of the Lord is in the temple in the Tabernacle this morning he said amen and he says Amen to that I say Amen to that I do believe that the greatest that the only way way to see God is to recognize him in the day that you live in oh it's good to preach to God most everybody looks back and they preaching about the God of history and and uh the great things that he did but I do not believe that that and any church AG look at the here's the prophet when he became and he came on the scene and and uh he begins to pull out these doctrines that we so love I remember when we first got the church aid book oh my it was nightly we were just sitting together and comparing notes how did the Lord reveal those seven angels and The Seven Ages and pull them out and bring them and showed forth those Mysteries well we didn't understand it until the Seven Seals was revealed then we understood then when the light began to shine on the word it became a living word in the age that we live in we're not feeding on a man this is not some man's anointing we're feeding on the the body word of the son of man the word word sell body to body it's building a body ready that's fit that's not fit for this Earth the way it's conditioned right now you're not really that's why you everything you see you can look through and you see by Vision Divine Vision what's the nature behind it cuz everything produces of its kind let me read you another another little part and you know just U Fellowship a little bit around uh the things that I that we all do believe amen I believe it's a pure word of God a little message called recognizing your day and its message Jesus was the promise of the scripture Vindicated to the woman he's talking about the woman at the well Jesus was the interpretation of the scripture he was the interpretation of his own life interpreted the scripture yes now you see what's been interpreted this day is the scripture his own life no other it wasn't William bram's life that did it it was Christ veiled interpreting his own word and he's still doing don't you see the message of the Hour his own life interpreted the scripture he said don't you see the message of the hour can you recognize where we're at the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour that we're living in praise God oh you say we say that oh well I see that you know in Israel is going on this now I do believe I do believe the prophet said very plainly he said if you want to know what time you're in in the time Piece of Time watch Israel didn't give that Gentiles that he said watch Israel that's natural kingdom and there's going to be people born in one one hour a nation will be born but to the Gentile bride that's not of course that's not the bride sign that say well we see the look at all the world and the sodomite condition they are signs but that's not what we're feeding on we're feeding on the word of God that line upon line pries upon pries is building a body that's maturing as it's laying in the presence of the word look when the prophet went off the scene what did he say what she needs to do the bride right now is not a new message not somebody starting up and saying oh I got you know how it is every time there little the holy spirit moves a little bit watch how wants to go left or right that's right always go over word like there's going to be another oneman Ministry now you know it's not going to be it's not prophesied we've got thus sayith the Lord and the brides got thus say to the Lord or Jesus shuts up she don't say it if if he didn't say it there's no sense saying it because it's not said but if he said it stay with it if he said it just stay right with it see Jesus his own life interpreted the scripture don't you see the message of there can you re as we're at the message itself from the scripture Jesus said to Israel if you had only known your day one time sitting there in Mount of Olives he looked over and said Jerusalem Jerusalem he wept he looked down and he seen it he said oh if you'd only recognize your day not in any comparison maybe that way but the other night he said the other morning about 10:00 I I saw a preview of The Prostitute Church down in my heart he said I felt the Holy Spirit dropping tears he said Jerusalem I said I felt like saying Jerusalem Jerusalem how of I would have hovered you but you didn't want to you killed the prophets that I sent you you murdered them and the message has been sent to the church today and has been murdered by their denominational dogmas and the scriptures been murdered by their dogmas and Jesus said if you'd only known your day but it's too far now it's too late now so is it with the churches I do believe with all my heart that she has passed Redemption then he goes on and begins to indict not spoke the Mage indictment which I'm not going to speak on right now but if they would have only known their day each day God pulled out an elect lady in each day that recognized her day and her hour that's the age I believe we're living in right now this is not a new message we're not preaching anything new you know exactly you go find them every one of I'm not going to read them all but but I do believe it don't you see what I mean he said the message called believing God do you get what I mean then in there is a spirit he's talking about immortality then a man that's born of the spirit of God does not commit sin amen oh I I this makes us feel good because I I believe that there's a spot sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ on the Earth right now Hallelujah not that makes us sin sinless imperfect but let listen to how he reads it I know you've read this so often you probably shouted around your table when you read you know when you have Fellowship sometimes you read certain things said oh said you know like that little boy said Mama that's me that's how I feel so many times when I'm reading said oh that's me he's talking about yes sir I identify myself right there in the word this message is me that's right we've had all kinds of confusions and all kinds of people rising up and and challenging the message I tell you what I've challenged myself to I believe the message I'm challenging myself every day Lord not just believe in it but it manifesting itself in my life the walking word The Living Word the reality of God in every manner the worshiper once Pur has no more desire of sin that's where I look at myself now I look one things I might get a lot of mistakes but I have no desire for unbelief and sin in my life no turn no more conscious in the Old Testament of course the worshiper offered and he goes back a little bit let me take a little time with that and he went back and but what the Old Testament we know what happened under the blood of bulls and Golds they were sorry for their sins they knew they're Sinners went and made the thing right offered came back with the same desire but it's not so with the blood of Jesus Christ once baptized into that Kingdom once filled with the Holy Ghost you walk away your desire for sin is gone you don't want to disbelieve the word of God the only sin that really is unbelief in the word drinking smoking gambling the prophet said adultery so that's not sin that's attributes of unbelief so if you if you're born of the spirit of God I don't mean to hurt anybody but if you're born of the spirit of God those things are dead in your life so well I'm still tempted yes as long as you're in this body you will be that doesn't mean you're not a Christian being tempted right that just means you're a part of the Overcomer we're talking about Overcomers here people that's overcome all the Creeds and the dogmas that tries to attach itself to the word that's right there's a lot of denominational Spirits trying to attach themselves to this word and use the power of God to verify their Vindication listen we're not interested in that we're interested in one thing Lord you said it and I believe it whether even I understand it or not how many could have how which one of us could say I understand God it's impossible as long as we're in this finite body how can the finite identify it with the infinite you know he's it's so beyond us but something drops way down said but by faith Noah by faith Abraham by Faith by Revelation every one the Church of Jesus Christ is built all the way through she is the revelation ofes Jesus Christ everyone played the part each one looking for the next one to play but now the last one the last trumpet it sounded to the Gentile church here now you know the Israel are not going to we're not going to tie them in here right now but you know what they're longing for where they're at right now all these years sometimes I you know I'm you're sure like me we stop and we think over 70 years already they've waited whole Generations have died waiting for the confirmation of the word still trying to start the Old Testament worship the red hepher trying to build not realizing that this is going to be a nation born in a day but what what what the the glory when we when we think of her Deliverance but the little elect lady think oh if you could just go tell them about it but no matter how many you remember how brother B says no matter how Bibles you send there how much you preach Jesus Christ oh there's some Jews saved but not Israel there's Jews that saved I'm thankful for that he said but um a little further in this message of believing God he said but but here it is in the Hebrews when when the worshipper in this case when he puts his hand on the son of God's head and the sins are purged by the sanctifying power of God there is no more desire of sin left there there is where your life lays that's what makes you an offspring of Jehovah amen and Satan can't hurt you without hurting the father father because you're an expression of the Father which one of us and we he said you can't hurt that little girl without hurting me and his little daughter sitting there said you can't hurt her without hurting me I tell you that you can't hurt your children without hurting you and then it he is not willing that any of them should be should perish but now before the flesh here before the flesh is perfected now here's where we're sitting right now before our flesh is even perfected we have to die like our soul dies as long as we're in this flesh there is no perfection in this flesh this Veil is the only thing that's bothering you yet but it too and when we are dead and God has recognized our repentance and recognized our baptism he recognizes the blood of his own son which by faith has been applied and recognized by for ordination and knowed what it would do and has recognized me to be Christ and I'm dead then Christ died in my place when he was slain before the foundation of the world and my name was put in the book as a Christian I like that God oh doesn't that make you feel good baby look way back there when he put up the book and he placed names in there my name is put in the book as a Christian Hallelujah Christ died my Death Christ Christ is my sacrifice and God could not impute to me sin anymore he give me the Seal of the Holy Ghost as a witness that I passed from Death unto life Oh my he said doesn't that make us feel good when they're born been born of the spirit of God they do not commit sin for he that he cannot sin for the Old Testament said so it takes people he goes on to say the Hebrews he said now perfect it forever worship the worshiper one Purge Hebrews 10 has no more conscience of sin so you take the people that runs to church and jump up and down and shout and speak in tongues and then act that anyway like that Christian and run out and the next day they're back next week they're back in they're coming whenever they come see they're only impersonating for the Bible said the holy spirit is a seal to us and Christ and seals us unto the day of our Redemption not till the next Revival amen that's what makes me rest assured cuz God promised it I believe that's this message what what it does it gives such a rest that that there's nothing in the world can separate you from the love of God it's peace it's Joy you can't get so low to where sometimes you feel like is it worth it but check it out where it comes from the voices that speak to try to always trying to contradict the word of God but a real Christian takes it back to the word always no matter what happens I want to just take one little part here a little message called called uh the inner Veil and you know how brother Bram talks about so many things I like to read this when we have communion foot washing you know just to see how far his grace has taken us from sin there's not even the smell of sin around a Christian that doesn't mean your flesh is perfect never look at your flesh to be perfect it never will be I'm not encouraging young people or old people or said then I can do what I want you know what I always do I like what brother baham says well I could do what I want oh said if I knew that if I could live and that would be sin free and that oh I would I ever live it up that's what Christians do they really live it up they live so close to the master they look like the master they walk with him they talk with them they sing with them they're born of another world you can't help it you can never feel at home no matter where you go build the nicest home you got get the nicest vehicle you got get the nicest clothes you got get the nicest Church you got you're not at home that's right that's right just a passing through our Treasures are lit UPL somewhere beyond the blue I don't know where they're at but they're laying they're waiting for us you know I'm that telling most of you know but I just turned the the magical number you know 80 to I know a year and a half ago and I never thought I'd I'd get past 50 and then one got past 50 got 60 and thought oh maybe run 70 oh my now I'm 80 and I'm thinking oh my I want to live a little longer fact I want to live as long as he lets me I'd like to walk right into the Rapture I like to feel that feel that feeling lift one foot and it wouldn't come down I kind of like to feel the aches go out of it and begin to realize wait a minute what's happening sir I used to have black hair and even more hair now I have to comb them all very carefully so they stay in place but there's a full head somewhere everyone you know don't you love those those uh albums you know the old books you they put them all together you all said wow I take pictures we're not going to be here that long looks pretty good said oh look at me oh look at me why look at that black hair straight shoulders straight ties they hang straight these ones have bubbles in them these on but we had them in those days they were there a but there's a land calling where mortal will be swallowed up to immortality don't ever worry about sowing The Good Seed just walk with God sew it wherever you go tell them about the goodness of God tell them that you're from another kingdom yeah they might call US aliens it's all right we were Alias rather but I like this part he said you know he talking about red through red is white and you know in the little paragraph there in the inner Veil and uh but he gets to that one little part and he said now God looked through the blood he doesn't see you anymore as a sinner amen he sees you redeemed amen you're redeemed because he's always seen you through Christ did you did did do we realize he has always seen you through through Christ that's the reason when the word of God went and struck when the light of the word of God struck your soul something inside says that sounds like home to me I don't even understand it I don't even know what just happened but something begin to move and it begin to draw you like a magnet we sing about that when the Great magnet brother Hank used to sing that when the Great magnet from above and we we took it from the song where brother Bram preached about the great magnet in the Africa said what happens to all the other stuff how come it's not going up said oh that's it's aluminum it's not for everybody you know L message is far from everybody there's a lot of people even around the message is not for them they're just acting like it is but give them the word and start talking about the real Born Again reality they look at you kind of strange said huh what's that but oh if you're ever a born of God you have a new nature a new spirit and then you got his spirit thank you you can get along with one another amen look it doesn't matter to me what church you go to in this area right there's no brand but the brand of the Holy Spirit yes I I tell you what I'm I'm I'm just one of those I tell you don't matter where I go I'm not interested in the brand we're wearing what church we have and we've got nice buildings now day but you know none of those buildings are going in the rapture you're not even going as a church you're going as individuals you're sitting there with an individual birth said yeah he stopped by my place the almighty God saved me and because I preach I'm not saved but Wars me for a greater judgment will be to us preachers than it will be to the rest of you for we have taught the way of life that we might also walk in the way of life not just teach it but here this is a beautiful I I close with this if the musicians want to come up I I'd appreciate that I would like to sing a song at the end of this part but it goes to say this oh he said you're not perfect he said that's the reason uh we can be perfect said you're redeemed because he's always seen you through Christ that's the reason we can be perfect not because we are in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ that's the reason he said be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now that's not just put in the Bible just to be the good writing that's there because that's exactly what he's looking for that's who he's coming for the ones that are offsprings of God well God's perfect amise God but he put you in a body so he could become a savior A Healer but most of all he put you there because he's your lord there's a lot of people claim him to be their savior their healer and even Jesus Jus the name but which Jesus the one of the word the one that Vindicated itself in this last day according to Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 that God that Jesus or the one that the church says is our Jesus right as many many are claiming the name of Jesus but there's one Lord Jesus Christ yes sir there's one Lord Jesus Christ that's the reason be you there for Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews was trying to explain the shadow of the law of Good and Evil of the law of the Old Testament and blood of so on but could never make the come or there under perfect because they were looking through animal blood but now looks through the blood of his son Perfection came by Jesus Christ am now I'm not perfect in your sight and you're not perfect in my sight right if we if you came tonight to find fault you've already found quite a bit that's all right because there is no perfection in the humanity our actions are different differ our ways are different some are quiet and some are loud and some don't say anything and some are very energetic but you're a human being just the same never judge a person by their outward actions even watch what their love and desires when it comes around the word of God that's what I that's what's important that's where it lays he said right there he said now said I'm not perfect you're not perfect but what about what God sees what about in God's sight that's where it lays and if you're born again in the body of Christ then God looks upon you as perfect as Christ was himself amen nothing you can do it's not any works that you can do at all it's by grace that God has give you this offer amen amen I like that give you this offer and if you've accepted it in the sight of God you are perfect redeemed washed in the blood of the Lamb without fault without blemish without spot and he stops and said isn't that marvelous isn't that marvelous when he saw the preview of the Bride you know he said earlier here he very discouraged and he was he was crying he said Lord is that the best that all of the Vindication all the signs and the Miracles that have taken around the world and stood there and challenge the entire world if you think this is wrong come here and stand and take my place challenge the leaders the religious people of the world yes come here do the same thing that the holy spirit's doing in the in my life confessing to the world that it's not him doing it it's Christ doing it and all of that and he stood there and he wept and that sweet voice said the bride will come into preview one more time Hallelujah he said I turned to look I heard that beautiful music said here come that bride just like the first one just like that Pentecostal bride that's inaugurated there on the day of Pentecost that same Holy Spirit brought forth another bride through the perp through the purpose and the purpose of almighty God through the shedding of his own life he brought forth that same life in the resurrection look at the message that came up after all of the word died in the first church second third church but in the third or fourth fifth sixth 3 4 5 and come come rather up to the seventh here come back to Perfection again just exactly with the seed that went on the ground you know we're driving here and ch is a beautiful time of year and the the all the trees and the beauty but but I'm a Farmer Boy way back I mean yeah 70 years ago 60 years ago at least but but I it's in my blood every time I see a combine going down I said oh my said imagine that farmer goes into that corn and he's so disappointed it's not not uh uh soy beans so I was expecting soybeans when I went into the corn field are you kidding when he goes into the corn field he knows exactly what he's getting right cuz he planted that our father knows what he planted he didn't plant Baptist Methodist or menite or anything like that he planted Sons and Daughters of God that are attributes of his divine nature and they'll say Amen to the word of God no matter what's preached how it's preached whether it's even just in red that's right because they believe him that way amen I stand amazed in the presence give me key of D or something that or give me a SE all right no go back to them no try me try me that's I stand that's a little bit do a little higher just one a little higher than that I stand ohaz in the presence of Jesus the nazarine and I wonder how he could love me a sinner condemn

come to this earth before I would make my first mistake before I would fail and embarrass myself and be ashamed before all of that he already had a plan he already had a Redemption plan he already knew that he would cover for all of that because he already knew me amen I was already a part of him I was never I was never meant to be separated and divided from him forever but I was always going

he sees us perfect brother bandham said you preached a Thanksgiving message you remember he said I'm more thankful for this than anything else and he begins to say you're the Spotless sinless virtuous Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ oh he was looking at something else other than the outward appearance of Flesh he was looking at the promise and he was looking at what God had done yeah you know we so many times we we always believe we believe what God's done we believe the word we believe the testimonies we believe the the ministry and life of brother Brandon we believe what God has done sometimes the greatest thing we need to believe is what he said about us may God grant us Faith to believe what he said about me I believe what he said through it all but I want to believe what he said about me amen it's not based on my ability or my power but on his ability and his power what he done what he's done and I just receive it by the grace he's put in my heart to believe it I'm not worthy of it
