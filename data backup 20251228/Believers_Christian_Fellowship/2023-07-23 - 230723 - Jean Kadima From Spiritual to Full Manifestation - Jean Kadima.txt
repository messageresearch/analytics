you have the word of life you the comforter and you can Comfort them God feed your children from your own hands this morning we commit everything to you in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you musicians I will ask the church to sit a little bit so I can speak to you all of them right [Laughter] contacted me uh this morning and uh is greeting you he told me to take my Liberty I don't know that means three hours or uh so it's good to be back in the house of the Lord you see missionaries need also a local church all right even if you go somewhere you spend five years one year whatever you still need the local church a home church so praise God that He gave me one amen has been really long time but God knows so um I'm gonna give you a little bit of uh talk to you a little bit of what we have been doing in Pittsburgh uh so before that I want to just say thank you to thank to the church for your continuing support to us in Pittsburgh uh without that I don't know you know remember the last time I was telling you that the church is really empty it's pretty empty nothing no chair nothing so maybe a guitar so uh but uh Chad decided to help us and he gave us like six months of friend yeah six months of rent so all the money we collected just you know accumulate a little bit so we can buy other things so it was so helpful uh the church was empty no chairs no Pulpit no platform uh we got some um what is sound system from BCF uh we we also got the organ that was at brother Steve Steve golden yeah yeah yeah that organ it was not easy to transport it I I I rented a small truck and it was my brother Steve and his family were just you know it was not easy but they helped me to get it there and and uh but a Franco has been working with people over there remotely did a great job um so people have been contributing and one-way all the other even just to help me find where to rent where to find the church a place for the church to rent so your prayers you know your support God richly bless you yeah I even remember brother Daniel errant doing you know building our little website Daniel are you here oh okay so since I finished his big project he has to come back to us so uh well we have now the chairs let's see that and in front there you can see it is the organ uh so we add more sound system video system and uh it's getting there brother William Brothers said brother William works with brother Franco to set up all these things remotely right I don't know how they do it but they do it yeah [Music] so all we have this young people William said and James they take care of those equipment they work with brother Franco one day we had an issue we did not know how to solve I say to him or feel free to contact Brother Franco I already did uh yeah the organ is being used actually the very first day we use the organ it was a visitor from Erie who played it sister liner came to visit us the very first day we moved to the cranberry Town location ah you must know this man here I think he's leading a song of something and he's been helping the young people and actually today as I'm here is is taking the service over there yeah it's been a great help you probably know this one too as Priscilla she's being helping with the music and the Sunday School all right there she is all right the church is pretty small but we always have often have visitors always the visitors coming out of state in area churches so we always have people people are hungry and thirsty they're looking for the word amen and God just used the tools that he has at his disposition and that's what it is it's not a human being it's just God doing that we had people coming from of course Pittsburgh because we are in a cranberry town we have people coming from Erie visiting us people come from uh oh this one didn't come out right coming from Butler people coming from Whole Supple something like that one hour 30 minutes Eerie one hour 30 minutes out of town they just they come and they enjoy they enjoy the world what what we take as granted they enjoy it amen so um yeah we have been blessed by these people they come they really encourage us to continue amen amen same thing here this is the special very good in Swahili uh yeah this is a church song can you see it clear it was not done professionally uh you may recall this man but Emmanuel came and took a service for us um a couple weeks ago it was wow I I listened to it after I came back say wow I never seen things that way I got good feedback um so as I say we had people coming they don't know if there is a church this couple is from Nepal so they originally from Nepal they live in Pittsburgh the brother had another brother maybe listening or watching sermons at BCF and realize maybe that I'm going to Pittsburgh call his brother his brother has been looking for a church foreign [Music] they come to church one day some people from maybe Wisconsin from Nepal to um they came to visit him and they're sitting in a church I'm preaching but you see when you have new people coming you want to be a little evangelist but I'm just going with the Revelation and who are they they don't know the word after the service they were like oh we were blessed oh it was refreshing to be in a church again something like that so there were Believers that all over the place some don't have a church to go to and you know you know continue praying because maybe we are in our last minutes and this Earth so whatever God wants to do let him do it yes absolutely hunger and thirst everywhere ended and it is a battle it's uh it's not like it's not a picnic but I'm saying it's a real battle so but the load is taking care of his word and that's what matters amen so we had this brother from uh battler brother Nathan uh he joined the church actually and yeah recently I told him brother um uh you can you take some services to be lead the song service they say uh I'm not a good singer but I think I sing for my children wow that's qualified him already there yeah yeah we uh well we we don't we don't have to count on our abilities if God give us gifts and things like that yeah we can use them but it's not about that it is God is looking for an empty vessel that he can use a person with good disposition and I say brother yeah he's qualified to do it so here he is and uh yeah That's how little uh story there but um just to remember to pray for us uh keep us in a prayer thank you once again for your support and yeah that's it so we ask for your prayers this work is challenging and rewarding in the same time because we working for the master for the king himself um it's good that God is watching over his own word and he encourage us as the ministers by your prayers you know by you telling us that you who you like to hear us when you tell your pastor that you send him a little card it encourage him because he can take that card and show the devil you were saying I'm this look look what people feel so uh and uh and God is giving us the stimulation of the revelation without that we cannot keep going because sometimes you don't know maybe I cannot keep going but it is just show you I'm in control you see you see you see and that help us so pray for us and it's good to be back in the house of the Lord it's good to be back among you and I always watch all your services don't think Wednesday I am with you every time so God bless you let's stand up and go straight to the word of God um after a while in the mission field I can only preach like I preach in the missions all right so you kind of have to bear with me right okay so Matthew chapter 22. Matthew chapter 22 this is an intriguing parable simple or complicated if you are very little like I used to be Matthew 22 1. and Jesus answered and spoke unto them again by Parables and says and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were beaten to the wedding and they they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bad Biden Biden behold I have prepare my dinner my accent and my fatalings are killed in all things are ready come unto the marriage but they made a light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servant and and tricked and then spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof it was rough and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up uh their City then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but the day which were Biden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as he shall find bit to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guests is so there was there there a man which had not not a on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how cometh thou in not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then say said the king to the servants find him a hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there shall be whipping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen let's pray one more time Heavenly Father we can read because we went to school we can even understand intellectually the word we will invite your presence your inspiration to speak to your children in Jesus Christ's name we prayed amen you may take your seat so if if a few times was asked this question a question regarding this Parable and I don't know how old I was every time he answered that question I was left like why did not answer I want him to answer it and I was very little I wanted him to tell me that a man can go in heaven have a body change go to the wedding supper and they're not found with a clothes and thrown out of heaven so how can that happen did he really go to heaven did he really was thrown out of Heaven do I want him to answer clearly and he was answering I was not listening hmm and sometime it happened to us God can speak to us but we don't listen right and one day I kept asking God for one thing for years and the ears keep asking the same thing the same thing then I say wait a minute let me stop here let me ask him maybe Lord you have already answered me but I'm not able to hear you now help me maybe lower yourself to my level please amen speak to me like a baby or you know help me to understand what you are saying so Brothers has been all the time answering that question but he did not ring I he did not match my understanding so here is like in this message cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to read uh Sin from our lives he said then when he came in and he found one man now and now there is only one door to come through because there is where there is where the Garment was given out and he found a man at the supper table without the Garment on he said friend what's do uh what are you doing here uh why aren't you got a garment on and the man was speechless he came in by a window some other way he didn't come by the door amen and every man that comes by Christ into the body of Christ who received the Holy Spirit The Robe he is sending right there to put it on you just as you come in see that's what he has promised and that's what he does so brother Venom is answering that question he say is happening now it's not like it's going to happen over there it's just the person is thinking thinking that they can get to heaven uh through other means of true man-made systems through the uh denomination of things but they don't realize Heaven is a kingdom of God is made of the word and the kingdom is already within you it's not something that you have to go and then be being thrown out it's happening now when people try to go into heaven through Adam means than what God has is required that's what it is a very simple thing and that the there is a prerequisite to get to heaven and you have to go through the door and the door is uh Jesus and he stand at the door and he gives you a garment it's all happening right now it's a spiritual occurrence that is very critical because when we talk about spiritual things it looks like no that that's just like a an abstract notion or something like that it's really really happening and that will be my emphasize that the spiritual things are real more real sometimes than the physical ones amen therefore how can you find yourself there without the robe and all that is given here now and by looking at this I found there is a parent actually and then where that's where I got my tattoo I say is a from spiritual to full manifestation it's all started by a spiritual phase to the full manifestation phase the body change is the full manifestation amen but there is a spiritual phase that you have to go through everyone must go there if you want to see the full manifestation amen and what the devil has tried to say is like okay the word when we say the word has come right what is perfect has come right we say that but what is perfect is what no what is perfect is who is God and God is the word and I'm I'm quoting brother Branham without reading it here now so when we when we say that what is perfect has come we're talking about a person that has come is that right you have to go to that person otherwise you won't be there that's what it is that spiritual occurrence people find it like oh it's nothing it's just an idea the world has come is no it's not an idea it's a it's a little yes he has come and you gotta accept that invitation to whom shall I shall we go now when there is a wedding supper to to be given in honor of someone the bridegroom furnished robes that is in uh Middle East uh what they used to do for all the people that come in because it's friends consists of poor Rich and different but everyone that invite is given an invitation and in this invitation and this invitation the bride's groom name on it oh this invitation the name of the bridegroom Jesus Christ is on this invitation this invitation is the word and the name of the Lord Jesus is a sign below that word it's so real it's so critical it's not something we can play with is our lives amen it's really our life we cannot play with it so he brings this invitation to the door and there is a porter that stands at the door and he has the garments let me just tell to you that the door is the word who is in the door is the word let me just say it the government is the the word oh my Revelation chapter four now what do you think when the bridegroom come back and found a man sitting there without a wedding garment on say friend how do you get in here in here and it's too speechless it showed that it came some other way beside the door he came I he came in a window he came in the back door do you remember a computer users we had a virus called back door that's a wrong way to come and and he called him a friend showed that he was a church member you know he tried to get there by a membership in the church though you need more than it yes you have to have your local church that you support by Your Presence by your ties by offering yeah you must be part of the body you have a personal uh relationship with Christ but when a Rapture eruptured us as a body amen you still have to but not just a member in the local but the member in his body friend how did you get in here here without the coming on now Jesus say this himself and he called uh he called to the Porter and say binding him foot and hand and he was cast out into outer Darkness where he will be whipping wearing and gnashing of teeth that's Christ's own words right he was cast out because he proved without the wedding garment it comes some other way beside the door if he would have come by the door he would have received a wedding coming amen now he's burned because the tears have to be bound and burned and the wheat although the wheat goes into the storehouse and the comment is the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost proof the Holy Ghost evidence is the word of God amen is the same person the Holy Ghost and the word the same person another Branham question and answer uh 1963 now this man had come by some organization back at the window over here some slipping in the hole and he got in at the table and sat down all these things there was hard for me is sit down at the table in heaven no no no no no it's just all this is happening is the way is approaching the word it thinks that way he think he can get their die it he will not happen there must be some prerequisite to get in there and that's what he missed and he got in the table and sat down and went the bridegroom comes up he looks around it was this have been all dachshund before now is the old duck say what uh what's you doing here like that without the baptism or the Holy Ghost and all the things how did you ever get in here the footwash flanky is at the door and Jesus gave to himself that job they are the physical presence in heaven could not take place without the spiritual it never happened well it come in somewhere beside the door he come without the proper invitation it come by some educational system something like that he got in and he said to them bind him and then hand and feet cast him out here in outer Darkness where there will be whipping and willing and gnashing of teeth see he went into the tribulation period it did not come in by the door so all right yeah there is no other way of coming there is only one word one way is the word of the end time the message of the hour that's the only way you can get in it's the prerequisite it's why you have to go other ways is just an attempt that will never take place yes now this is what Buddha bam say in the present stage of my men my Ministry they say well all men have forsaken me but there's one thing he stood by me I'm not I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision that happened down there on the river have stayed true to it it has been true to me I'm trusting in Him someday I don't know when for crowning my Ministry I've stayed just as true as I could be I don't know what it will be I don't know when it will be I just went it's ready I am I don't care and he said I hope it will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress is the bride in the cloth of the word and for is for his righteousness I hope you will Crown me let me stand that day and say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so you see they uh the last messenger the prophet of the hour Ministry is to take that cloth so you see it's not over there is here is today is now is taking that close and the clothes of the word he put it on you amen he put on you therefore then you can go there and find yourself wearing the clothes of as everyone that's sitting there there'll be no you know throwing you out over there but everything is taking place here so you see for you that thinks that you know in the mission Fields people don't see this so what I'm doing this morning I'm encouraging you to uh to see that what you hold in your heart is precious what you holding is real what are you holding here is the prerequisite to go there therefore you already have it so the Rapture is a Rapture in the word the word is rapturing the word God is raptoring himself his own body and for that he has prepared everything he has an invitation what is the invitation the word who signed the invitation the word you have to ask repeat the word is that right that's what you do you RSVP head all right you respond to it amen and the word comes to marry you therefore don't tell me that the word is just a thought Christ has not come it's just a thought it's a bridegroom it has to come and give that dress the robe or the Garment for the wedding therefore why the devil attacked this Revelation so much we need to go back and talk about it and encourage each other amen the prophet said I hope he will yes he did I hope he's going to let me dress the bride I hope he will let me say Behold the Lamb no no no no no no no no Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the bridegroom the king the judge the cloud amen and you respond to it you get into the process of the rapture by responding to it you will not just happen to be raptured no you gotta get into a a process when she was promised she was given the promised son she who got into the process dramatize it how she sees she saw her look have changed on the on the mirror how a body start changing the process started and then nine months later she had the promised child so you don't happen to jump in or let me you know let me wait for the Los Angeles to go down an hour yeah I will call Brother Chad oh my you gotta be there you gotta be part you've got to be in that process you gotta be men of the body of Christ invisible body the invisible is the real one the spiritual is the real one amen I look at it I saw the pattern all over the Bible that it's always the spiritual phase happened then the physical or the full manifestation in everything in everything you go to your knees in your closet you pray that is spiritual occurrence who are you talking to spiritual communication right and when you come out God reward you openly is that right it was a spiritual occurrence in your closet and when you come out God heals you give your answer is that right it's uh is this now it is a full manifestation of that spiritual occurrence which one is the most important which one is it when you see the full manifestation of your prayer or for God is when you were at your on your knees crying to him communicating with him for God that was the most important when these people were getting in that room that was boxy room in the tent vision this was something amazing but everyone saw something amazing the pillar of fire left but the angel for the very first time and get into the room and the people that were getting in the room they had an experience a spiritual experience a real experience it's the true experience when they came out they were healed it was a full manifestation of what happened in the room is that right which one is the most important when you saw them healed or when they were in that room are you with my church I would say what happened in the room was more important than the full manifestation we start we need to start looking at things like God sees them all right yeah what was important when you were crying Lord this sickness this issue oh Lord what was it when he healed you it's important to be healed right yeah absolutely what was important in God's eyes the knee Lodge how they say that vocabulary talking about Daniel Denise okay uh that time when you were talking to him was the most important time it was more real amen amen when you came and were healed he was good but that was not the most important yes it was not we will see it God's grace so we we find out that you gotta have that uh you have to be in the process the Rapture is the process there is a shout there is a voice there is the uh the trumpet it's a process you will not just happen to get there and be in that uh Kingdom where you going to Reign How can you reign with Christ when you here are not even under Authority amen how can you be an authority without being an authority under Authority right you must be already under in Authority amen for that you can become an authority because Christ God did it with Lucifer he gave him Authority without him Beyond The Authority it didn't work right and this is where you get in here now now you're getting that you're getting to learn to be under authorities submission under the word uh and then at that point God will say that he has formed a character then I can use him all right Jesus is doing three things as he descended he has the shout he has the Trump The Voice he has a trumpet and the brother said what is a shout it's the message going forth the shout the invitation it's the shout is gathering you together it's real it means that Christ is descending it's real and people make us to get scared of what we believe because so real when you want to battle is just start talking about these things yeah when you want to fight talking about you may think oh other things happen that's why I'm I'm getting all this troubles start talking about this then the trouble come amen the invitation is the word the shout is the word the door is the word but the door the word is a person so it's not an abstract an idea somewhere it's a person and when you become the word because you have received the word it's an amazing experience that you are going through but you don't know you don't know because the word is everything that's why people don't understand they think oh the word is like an idea thoughts you know ideology but they ain't the word is what created heaven and earth if you are it you are a creator you call into existence and you also can call out of existence so think about the devil Lucifer looking at you before he saw one one man Christ who could call him out of existence is that right now this is multiple people that can call him out of existence [Music] you get it it's scary therefore don't let them get that revelation yeah that's where the battle is thank God he cares about his word and you watch over it you watch over us I remember when I started ministering in Massachusetts I was I was doing it in my own in apartment I was not even owner of a house I live in my apartment and somebody came and thrown a little firing at the uh in the window and and the place burned and burned down and and uh that the fire was aware of what was in the house the fire saw the tapes the books the message books the tapes and the fire came where the wall where there was a wall where I put everything like the Shelf the pictures and the message the taped and the fire came and said I don't want to be in trouble went up through the roof and went and burned the other they had a wall over there and left in this wall what was God showing I am so God protected us it protect his word and we were barrier of the word that's why you protect us is not actually us that it protect God protect himself because God provides only for himself therefore When you pray don't tell him God do this for me do that for me tell him God do that for me so I can worship you better I can serve you better tell him the reason why you want and make sure that the reason is not just to you but it's him you see this is a message you can read you can you can read I I caught you already you can read I don't know about you but uh sometimes you take a message like a title of a message you already you you know what is going to be what the prophet will be talking when you see just day the title have you ever been disappointed I I saw a title I was I saw a title invasion of the United States wow let me read the invasion of the United States what is that well it was not quite what I it was pretty bad but it was not what I expected I won't spoil it for you go and read it what about this one is your life worthy of the Gospel oh brother Branham will tell me how to live a Christian Life it will give me my checklist when you do this but a child loves that yeah you love a checklist so I'm I'm seeing the title and I'm just oh okay he's going to tell me that uh your life have to be this way that way this is how you have to act this is a good behavior that's what he's going to tell me nothing of it nothing he was it was just you you found you how can I say you found yourself unworthy of the Kingdom that's why you refuse [Music] the invitation that's what it is nothing about my checklist what is the good behavior of a Christian no no the good behavior is to respond to the word and let the world do the rest the problem is when people reject the word that's the problem because they have rejected prerequisite I spoke to a Believer who was telling me that I will never reconcile with this brother or that sister even if the Holy Ghost comes down and with outpouring of the Holy Ghost I will never forget forgive now this is not Behavior I mean I'm not the psychologist but what I try to say is she or he was not asked to do anything it was she was rejecting the word just like these people when Jesus said eat my flesh drink my blood they did not have to do anything there was no doing it was believing all right Peter did not understand either body he used to it and when a person refused to yield that's already a problem because it's a prerequisite to manifestation you understand my English it's a prerequisite from spiritual to full manifestation when the word of God comes you yield to it and let me redefine yielding yielding doesn't mean doing anything when you yield for a car that is coming you don't do anything you yield you lit you give way so therefore the first thing when you hear the word is to say Amen to that word is not to do anything it's not to perform it's not nothing it's just a say Amen to it I don't know how I will do it I am weak I am this but I say Amen to that and let now the word do what it's supposed to do am I making sense yeah let me switch a little bit let me let me go and maybe we will come back let me go to Matthew 26. 36. here's the Jesus in Gethsemane then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called a bitter man and say unto the disciples City here while I go and pray under and it took with him Peter and the two sons of exibity and began to be so full and very heavy what is Soulful and very heavy depressed you know really heavy sadness depressed Christ knows how when we are depressed he does he understand that you know and then say he unto them my soul is exceeding Soulful and even unto death Terry ye hear and watch with me again he understand how to be lonely such a high priest an amazing High Praise he felt it in his own body oh praise God verse 39 and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wealth and he came up unto the disciples and findeth them a slip and say unto Peter what could he not watch with me one hour watch and pray that he entered not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and pray and pray saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and founded them asleep again for their eyes were heavy Jesus was God In the Flesh he was a king the prophet say he was the king of prophets you see I put cup in the blue so you can see it he is in Gethsemane and he sees a vision somewhere brother Burnham say he was in a conference a spiritual conference with the father and they're talking and he sees the cup and he knows as a Prophet this is a symbol what it means is if I accept then it will be I will take the cup of the sins of humanity that means all right all right is screaming Hebrews tells us he's screaming father if it was possible Let It Go the vision of the cup is spiritual occurrence it was a spiritual faith before the physical happened at Calvary is that right get some money has to happen before Calvary if if gesman did not happen don't ask for Calvary so what do I which one is the most important in a Gethsemane a cry he begged is screamed did he cry and beg and scream Calvary the Bible said he was silent there the most important things were happening in Gethsemane this is where he had to die so if I talk this way to my fellow denominational you're saying Calvary was not important that Calvary was absolutely important but he had a prerequisite it could not happen without to get the money is that right yeah the pro the prophet say that uh that this eternal destination of every soul was there at Gethsemane the decision he had to make will impact all of us and he say and when our blessed Lord indeed to get the money when going there when he was be rejected at Jerusalem and the council was going to take his life when Eternal destination of every soul that ever was would be on the earth rested upon his decision he has to say yes you see it has just to say Amen and once you say amen he had taken the cup all this is spiritual but so real and today they want to tell us that the word has come the Capstone has come it's just something it's so real they the devil wants to steal us from us let's be encouraged this message is precious don't play with it why let me just continue but in that great crucial hour until he suffer knowing all things he saw it he was a god of prophets until the water and the blood separate in his body and the great drop of sweat like blood dropped from his brow he died more death and gets the money then he died on the cross the physical or the spiritual he bled before bleeding he died before dying oh brother that's not English I'm not talking English now he bled before bleeding in where I didn't get the money or you never seen it real the Bible the sweat it was like brah before Calvary he died to himself he died to what he wanted before die without to get the money there will be no calipery the spiritual is a prerequisite to the physical or the full manifestation is okay it's actually more real more real death I have it in the blue more real so therefore let's stop thinking that everything has to be physical physical physical because the reality is spiritual it's the reality but Abraham say all the kingdoms of God is made of the invisible is that right and it's more real love is more real than the material peace is more real give me five pounds of Peace this morning go to Walmart get me that can't find it is that right but it's more real than your grocery and whatever but I'm explained all this were happening was and get the money Jesus was in a conference with a father he say to his disciple wearing they had had a lot of big meetings I was tired perhaps like you are this morning but he said will you just watch with me an hour and for I got to go younger and have conference I have to go alone and when the the conference was set in the lamp Young and Beautiful Life Never a life like that never was never will be a life like that the lamb had but now the father said are you willing are you willing to die are you willing and when God asks you can you do this can you do that why don't you just say Amen once you say Amen is like you accept the word let the word provide for itself is that right it's not me is the word in me yeah Is Your Love force that sinful thinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to protect their place to Bear their sin to the hardest crucial death the father is asking do you love them there could be nothing die that kind of death but him he died he he died to himself he was the greatest death Calvary he never opened his mouth it was a a happening yeah something it was happening that was nothing and get some money everything and now in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow he was under strained the sins of the world was upon him and then he looked into the face of the dove and say not my will but that will be done the thing that you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we are the thing that you have to overcome is yourself this man had to overcome himself if he had to go to the marriage supper he had to surrender he has to receive the invitation respond to it one was a prerequisite of the other without their spiritual one the physical one the full manifestation will not have taken place without the spiritual rapture the physical body change will not take place amen you gotta be in the spiritual Rapture now and it's real amen amen how do you get it by marrying the word the word and you becoming one accept the word that you hear it we have become used to the word I know we cannot maybe help it but stop a little bit stop and look around this is no time to play you know God help us Lord I want to heal I yield to you is you I is not asking you to perform something do something slip on uh you know on the floor uh tonight he's not asking you that do something no he's asking you to yield and what is yielded to say Amen to the word dip in your heart is going to reproduce oh my it's going to reproduce according to its kind what kind the kind of God amen let's go back to the government proving his word not no more as a church see no no more the bride is called you see you know this this quote see in that day the son of man will be revealed why to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom a call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in a human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man amen not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean yeah the ministry of the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in a human flesh Among Us and will make his words so real that it will unite the church in him as one the bride and then she will go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage feel your friend because the marriage of the Lamb has come now today but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper you know that so everything is happening in the spiritual realm right now Christ the bridegroom United with individuals the word and then dead so the wedding is happening now invitation will send the shout you respond to it and your your life is worthy of the Gospel amen you respond to it it becomes you become him and is going to Rapture himself everything is happening now and it is real hmm when the word here Unite with the person they to become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he hear the word the church does the same thing amen so it's happening now before the body change it's happening and all that the devil can put in front of us to stop this he will throw it at us but we are hidden behind him the husband we don't have our own strength he is there to protect us to take care of this business what should I do I just have to yield to it amen that's the apparent that I saw in the word is just always that part and happen before the spiritual the before the physical the full manifestation the spiritual takes place and people say ah the spiritual is just an idea and then they miss the whole thing then they will come but when I'm saying some will come and say oh we heard that the Rapture takes place then there is a tribulation then this then that and it will say it already happened where were you you were not in the process you're going to be in the process you've got to be part of it it does not just happen it is a process God help us amen let me read one more thing event made clear by prophecy now I will have a prayer line and I want to pray for the sick as much as I can now we can either have a line to call the people to bring them up here a prayer line and pray for everybody here that is sick and I suppose I have my ministers Brothers to come here with us and lay hands upon you we can sure do that and either or either we can ask a father who is the only one that could do anything for you because my hand is just a man like you you men but the thing it is it's not the human hand that does it the will of God faith in that word is what does it not scientific think about it not physical it's all together unscientific there is not one thing the Christian has in its earner that's a scientific uh did you know that love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience Faith Holy Ghost everything is unseen by science and that's the only thing that is real and last thing well uh the fullness of the world has come yeah yeah yeah but what is the fullness of the word Christ oh well but uh we're still waiting uh well we're waiting is the body change and going home but the fullness of the word is Christ is the bridegroom is the king is the judge in the mighty angel yeah what is more real the spiritual things are more real everything you look at come from the earth and goes back to the Earth but the things that you can't see with your eye but see it declare itself that the world of eternal let me read an exposition to the church ages and the true and the True Vine or what about her is she growing where are those vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer out to cause and not most of them merely emotional in their approach in this the series of something physical rather than Desiring which is truly spiritual right people want the emotional the thing that they can touch well is not actually the the spiritual that is more real the prophet is asking is this age not like the day in which Noah entered the Ark and the door was shut but yet God carried in a judgment seven days none was literally turned to God in those silent States let me let us look at this Noah was a prophet he was Vindicated by God and he had a message that was unscientific but it was so real it's going to rain for seven days he got in in the ark with his children his wife he's all right but the door the door of the Ark was still open for seven days is that right but no one got in the ark technically the door was open but in reality it was closed they could get there but they could not because the spiritual proceeds the full manifestation the spiritual precede the physical since they did not receive the message of Noah they could not get in the ark Ark but the ark was open brother John yes it was open but they could not get there because they prerequisite was to believe in Noah you can see the door open but you know as a spiritual people you understand they could not get there seven days the door opened they could not get there it was open right but they could not how could they get in the ark if they did not believe Noah that's how it is I saw this pattern I preached in the mission field in Pennsylvania they couldn't it was open calls it the silence day oh my that is it the rising of the Sun Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people the first time they were they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denomination on his will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonder as they did back there Christ himself yes except he is not in the body that went in the grave but is in a different body but himself is again waved here right but what I want to emphasize here emphasize here is the bright age continues here they say because I live he live also speaking to his wife because I live he live also what a resurrection that was and what Resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power what Resurrection this was ah let's go back and see that that Resurrection is happening in a bright age she's being resurrected out of the dark denominationalism you cannot resurrect before you resurrect from the nomination you have to come out of the grave the tombs of the nomination men's idea this is a spiritual occurrence first you resurrect from the nominations then you can see the physical Resurrection praise God amen it's a prerequisite it's all over the place it's with Rebecca and Eliza it's all over the place it's the prerequisite what is it the word be encouraged is the word is the word that brings us home is the word that is real yes the spiritual application is real the physical is just a consequence it's just the right the normal course of action amen it's more real the spiritual one amen can I be good to you what time is it musician if you can come let's just stand up [Music] and uh Eliza did not know what to do how can I get that wife for Isaac how can I do it he went to the place where Rebecca lived in Abraham on family that City but notice Eliza does not get into the denomination that City is not getting in that City he stay out of the city out of denomination organizations is Eliza is the messenger of the end time where does it go he stay at the well he stay at the well is not creating a a new well it used the same well that everybody uses all the women the girls are using you're spiritual now it doesn't create a new Bible when the message of Malachi forcame he did not create a new Bible he used the same Bible at the well he spoke to the girls the churches at the well but he was looking for the spiritual occurrence to happen saw the full manifestation can happen the one that will respond to his message and the one that will see the the spiritual element will be the one that is going to take for Isaac the one who respond to spiritual yeah we'll see the full manifestation amen and Rebecca happened to know the spiritual element this secret word praise God that Eliza had in his mind she got God God's mind therefore she could go you caught that mind therefore you will go no matter the no wonder the battle is so hard but it's good it's good the two kingdoms are fighting and it's good because our captain is strong amen when she did that she recognized the word therefore [Music] she could go we have recognized the word of our time God we want just to encourage each and other to continue going to keep going to keep going as the day go by it becomes more real and more real even the way we see the our eyes has been transformed to God's eyes so we won't be looking at the word this world as the world look at it slowly we're still human we're still making mistakes and things like that but little by little our eyes becomes a good eye the way we think we process think becomes like hell yeah slowly we get it there my brothers and sister amen be on College keep going amen stay at your post of Duty support your pastor we're getting there Hallelujah God bless you Amen Brother John I love us [Music] ing and there are streams of Grace that's flowing down from Calvary calm down received I will take you from the Nations angry and I'll be Sanctified in you before the eyes of man [Music] will I depend on please my experience with me spring clean water on you and I'll save it from yourself and there's a fountain open in love [Applause] from Calvary [Applause] night are for the house of My Chosen One the spirit of Grace and supplications [Music] and you and you have the old [Music] there is a Fountain open up [Music] [Music] and there are strings of Grace [Music] oh they the fountain open in the house [Music] that's flowing down from Calvary home now and receive foreign [Music] precious Heavenly Father ah take this word your word Place upon our heart this morning father we try to encourage each other as we see the day approaching [Music] oh God this message is real the word is Christ and the Christ is the person of the word is the person is not an idea it is not an abstract but it's the reality the devil has tried to attack this portion of the word and this morning we we just we have poor our heart and to tell your children that this is real father you make it real to them too like like we just think there is a fountain there is a water is pouring let's go let's just go and take and drink from it it will do us good it will change us it will transform us it will mold us into your own character and when we do it will not be it will not be us doing it will be you in us it will be it won't be a human effort father all we need is just to yield to it today I have redefined our word healing I just say it's actually you don't do anything you just say Amen to the word truly in your heart truly in your heart maybe we don't know what to do how to do what you ask us to do but if we yield won't you come down won't you help us to do what you want us to do and that's the point father that's the point is spiritual precedes the physical before the full manifestation there is a spiritual occurrence the spiritual is so real is the real thing get some money what's the real thing Calvary was real too was actually real it's what we know without it happening no one will be safe without Calvary but there was a prerequisite to Calvary it gets the money we sometimes lose sight of get the money we lose sight of what the spiritual experience that we have we lose sight of our personal relationship with you but that's the real thing that's what that's what you are looking for that communion that personal relationship it's more than anything that we can get it's more than having a good job it's more than having a good health it's more than anything relationship with you it's spiritual but it's a real father I am a human being I may not expressing exactly as you wanted but God take those words and place it place them in your children hearts take what belongs to your place in the heart and let them be encouraged that when they stick to this word they are doing the best things that they could do for the life granted father bless our
