========================================

Think about those three Hebrew men that were going into the fiery furnace. They already made the declaration, "Our God is more than able, but even if he doesn't, he's able to deliver us, but even if he doesn't," they had no guarantee. They believed he would, but no guarantee that he would. They got one step closer, he says God wasn't there. Two steps, God wasn't there. three steps. What if they weren't determined to go all the way? What if they assumed, "Oh, I got an assumption here. God will deliver us when we get near the fire. God will not he'll certainly not let us go in that fire." And what if they had pulled the eject button somewhere along the way? When they felt the flames, Amen. when the guards started to suffer, they they aborted. Never mind. And I thought he would save me, but he didn't. They would have never known what a miraculous deliverance lay just ahead. Just that last the worst step, the worst condition, the impossible. When nothing can save us, when there's no turning back, when there's no hope, when all hope is gone, that's where he was. What if they didn't take the last step? They would have never come in contact with a living, breathing son of God in their midst to fan away the flames. They would have missed a miracle. They would have missed the sign. They would have missed the deliverance. They would have missed the turning of Nebuchadnezzar's heart. They would have missed the declaration that went all over the world that this is the true God. What happened when they were willing to go all the way? There's story after story after story in the Bible. Listen, you can't determine after you get started to go all the way. You've got to determine before you begin to go all the way. Amen. If it gets bad, if it goes from bad to worse, if it gets impossible. If it gets where there's no more hope, this is a hopeless situation. All hope is gone. Hey, you already determined I'm going all the way. And many times God lets it get the darkest and the worst and impossible to show his glory. Many times deliverance comes past where we thought deliverance would come. What if that widow decided not to knock the next day? I've knocked enough. I've tried for 20 days, for 15 days. How many days I went knocking on the door asking for deliverance. She didn't know it was that time. Amen. That he was going to answer. How many times have we stopped just before? I don't know. But I'm determined not to stop again. Whatever it takes. Amen. Wherever he takes me, whatever he wants to do, wherever he wants to manifest, I want to be determined that he's going to have his way and I'm going to follow him. Hey, Peter was determined. I'm going all the way. But he didn't. He bailed out. He hit the eject button when it got too scary. I'll go to prison. I'll go to death. But when prison came, he bailed. He had to go die out to himself and be born again by the spirit of God. But with the spirit of God, he was able to go all the way. Amen. All the way to crucifixion, all the way to being hung upside down on a cross and giving his life. So, I want that same spirit to be in me to help me go all the way. And I want to yield to that spirit. I don't want to pull the eject button anymore. I know I'm not the only one who's pulled the eject button and tried to save myself. No more eject buttons. No more abort. Let's just go all the way and let God have his way and never stop and never quit. What we might just find is we might find the son of God, one like unto the son of God right in our midst, right in our camp, fanning the flaves away. Praise God.
