greater life than we've ever known before we love you and we ask God for these things that you would take control and speak to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you we're going to ask you to take your Bibles while we're standing we just want to say Happy Father's Day to all the fathers amen God has certainly been good to us as we look around and see the families and and what God has done and what the word has done amen amen I I I realized several years ago when we came to the message that the message that was delivered to us changed my whole life it taught me to be a father it taught me to be a man it taught my wife to be a mother to be a real woman and and It produced the family that we have now it wasn't our efforts cuz we would have ruined everything it was the grace of God because he gave us of himself amen and I remember how uh when we came to the message all of our family was so worried about us because they we had gone off the deep and we had left what was traditionally true for our family for generations and and they were worried and we had got to a call and we were off and but I remember that it didn't take long after years they would always compliment the family and compliment our marriage and complement the relationship and compliment the kids and talk about how wonderful it was they love the Holiness they love the the family unit they love the relationship of mom and dad with kids and they didn't realize it was the thing they feared had produced what they loved amen and so when we look around and see families that are intact because of the grace of God we just say thank you Lord for your word may it keep keep changing us and keep uniting us and breaking every barrier that's still hindering these things in our life and may the word produce itself amen so we going to say God bless you fathers we thank God for you amen uh as we take our Bibles let's turn to Genesis chapter 1 and I heard sister Nancy marrow is here God bless you where you at sister Nancy God bless you Sister Nancy it's so good to see you so happy you're here and feeling good amen it's good to have her back she's been been absent for a little while and so God has certainly been good to her amen we know that many are traveling everybody most everybody with the yingst family has gone to Canada for the wedding of uh brother Jared a blast and so they're gone and it's also vacation season has started so many are gone so we wish them well may the Lord bless them as well but thank God that we're still here and he's and we're here to hear his word amen Genesis 1 and 26 Genesis chapter 1: 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen may God bless you as you take your seats and may God bless us as we look into his word amen I just want to welcome brother Emanuel God bless you brother Emanuel it's good to have you back in the service and good to have you there with your family amen I've asked brother Emanuel if he'll take the Wednesday night service so he's agreed he'll be preaching Lord willing this Wednesday and hopefully he can give us an update of some things that were accomplished and then Minister the word so if you can be praying for him I know he'll greatly appreciate that amen uh when we look here this is a very familiar passage of scripture but I want to I want to preach I want to capitalize on Father's Day because there's been something that's been stirring in my heart and uh I want to talk about bringing forth the Royal seed and um and if we can look here that God had had commanded them to multiply and replenish uh the Earth and subdue it and have dominion and Adam was given this commandment but then we go to chapter 2 if you go with me to chapter 2: 18 it said uh Genesis 2:18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man shall be alone I will make him a help meat for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cat and the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father his mother and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh so by the grace of God we've seen this so thoroughly explained by the prophet we've gone into this so many times but he begins to show us that God's foreshadow of his plan lays right here in the creation of Adam because Adam was a created Son of God Amen and and as a spoken word created Son of God he was given dominion over the whole earth and and God wanted him to multiply and replenish God's original intention would to have an earth inhabited with sons and daughters amen we know that sin entered in and brought a corruption and a perversion and it started the cycle of redemption which also plays into God's Great desire because one of God's greatest desires was to express himself and so to be known and expressed as Redeemer and healer and father and all of these attributes that were in him had to be expressed so the fall came in to set the backdrop to where he can begin the cycle of redemption and he can be known as the great healer and Redeemer and savior and all of these great attributes that were in him but we see originally when God Amen had put man on the earth his son the Son of God Adam the Son of God on the earth to rule and Reign Over the Earth amen he saw that it wasn't good that he should be alone so he made a help meat for him amen and and it's impossible to preach on Father's day without preaching about mothers because there's no you not a father unless there's a woman that you can make mother so the two go hand in hand they go together but but uh we just wanted to read this account to have this in us our minds because this is going to be God's original intention and uh and we find uh brother B says uh what is fatherhood he said it is an attribute of God so fatherhood is an attribute of God that's why we thank God for the fathers that are among us because they're expressing an attribute of God they're portraying to the world part of what is inside of God is now being reflected Amen in Christian fathers the same thing with christian mothers but he goes in in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man and that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it see he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ and so because he loved fatherhood because he was a father he wanted to be known as a father amen and so in order to be perfectly known as a father amen he had to become a son of man because now the son of man Jesus Christ was reflecting the fatherhood and referring back to the father and was the son and the son was the reflection of the father he was the visible of the invisible he was The Offspring or attribute and we know that he was the attribute that contained all the attributes of God was fully expressed he was the expressed image or the stamped likeness the exact uh uh uh reproduction in flesh of what the invisible God was now was molded into a flesh being and he was that exact image amen amen and so because he was a father-in Lov fatherhood he became a son so that he could express fatherhood amen but because he's also a husband he's going to need a wife amen amen and and then God is continually expressing himself then that was the first phase of his three-fold purpose then it says secondly to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people so the first part was to be expressed as a father so he came as a son of man to get preeminence in flesh in a human being in Jesus Christ to express himself Amen to express fatherhood through the sunship amen and then next to get preeminence in a body of Believers a bride a people Amen to express himself as husband amen and wife amen so so when we go to the church age book we look at the pergam and church age we just covered this in the last uh Church age book bible study this past Thursday but I'm just going to read a section uh out of the pergan church age and it starts off with brother brandom explaining the background behind what we're going to read says one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasped the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride so then here's the message this is the holy spirit giving a message through the prophet to the church so this is a message to us from the Holy Spirit here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it's the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ's seed so what is the true bride church it's Christ seed he's the Original Seed amen so it must come forth in the lik likeness of the Original Seed because every species must bring forth after its own crying so the cry seed must reproduce Christ again amen so the bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image praise God this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas mixed with the the word this mongrelize brings forth a hybrid product the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him so now why did Adam why did he receive a bride it's not good that he should dwell alone I will make a help meet for him that that brother brenham's now not brother Brenham the Holy Spirit now is telling us in the message to the church amen that he was Adam was given a bride uh so that he could reproduce himself amen amen so let's read that again he said the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die so the very purpose when God looked down and said it's not good that man shall dwell alone I will make a help meat for him she was given to him so that he could reproduce himself upon the Earth again because he was a Son of God and God wanted an earth full of Sons and Daughters of God Amen and so that's that's what God wanted to do and that was her original purpose amen but when she received seed from another source and hybrid herself amen now she corrupted that original purpose and brought death instead of life and now instead of God's original intent and purpose the have the Earth inhabited with sons and daughters of God now it would be inhabited by more than that because now there would be another seed line introduced into the Earth and a mongrelize and a mixing and a hybridizing of the seed and so now the original plan amen now moves into the the that moves into the uh mystery plan where God can express himself amen then he goes on in this message from the Holy Spirit to the church he says the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like was was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died so now we're speaking of the first church now as Christ came and laid down his life for the church a as he was pierced in his outflowed blood and water amen the ingredients to make the church and now the church sprung forth on the day of Pentecost amen but already in the first age she was a fallen woman because she had taken the pure word that was given amen through the apostles and she began to adapt it amen to her own thinking and receive seed from man so she did the same thing that Eve did she left the word she died but God's purpose is not defeated he goes on to say from a little group group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is Virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas buying through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary now he's saying what what now all will be fulfilled in what the end time bride amen from a little seed of the true word of God the bride God will raise up a bride for Christ and all will be fulfilled in her that was promised to the Virgin amen and so here's what he's going to type it with the Virgin Mary The Word of Promise come to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself so what was the promise that came to Mary The Word of Promise the prophecy that came to Mary was he himself came into Mary amen so that Mary could reproduce What men God in flesh amen Jesus Christ amen oh praise God but the Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her oh my goodness that what was the Word of Promise that came to Mary that was he himself the word came to Mary and the Word was he himself now that came to manifest himself through who through the Virgin now this little group of the true seed of the word will be presented to Christ a virgin bride so that all that was promised of the Virgin shall be fulfilled in her amen amen praise be to God so although it was the Angel's message it was the word of God you see the same thing repeated in our day it says the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads so this is becomes really an important and he goes on but I just want to take this little section and begin to talk about he goes on just before this when he talks about the word coming to the Virgin Mary which was he himself he said he acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin he acted it didn't say she acted he acted himself and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message with the word of God Isaiah 9:6 he fulfilled at that time all that was was written of him because she accepted his word to her he listen he acted at that time and fulfilled his own word he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him he did it she didn't do it the only thing that she did amen was accept his word to her all that she did was say be unto me according to the word all she did was lay down her life and surrender and say that ain't nothing but the truth let that be according to your word Let It Be according to me she didn't have the power to produce or do or manufacture or make anything happened she couldn't the only thing she could do is wait for the angel Messenger to come to her to tell her the mystery of her life amen in the secret of the timing of God's promise and then all she had to do was accept it and believe it and he fulfilled at that time his Word of Promise because she accepted his word God's going to be Christ is going to be presented with a virgin Bride of the world word and what is she going to need to do she's only going to need to do what the Virgin did to say be that unto me according to your word I can't produce it I can't be that she will be a super race a super seed we can't how are you going to become a super race how are you going to be the super seed how are you going to do the mighty works you can't do any of that in your own power and strength neither can you work it up or pump it up or use religious means the only thing that we can do is say that's nothing but the truth brother brandom I believe what you said to come from God I believe that this is the time and I believe I'm the one amen it's not a doing it's a surrendering sometimes in religion we get so things so backwards we think that God needs us to do some things amen God doesn't need us to do he supplies the power to do he needs us to yield to his headship he is the head we are the body praise be to God Amen amen and amen and amen So Adam was given a bride to reproduce himself on the earth Christ was given a bride for the same purpose but she fell but that bride will be restored because in the restoration of the Bride tree Amen brother bandam keeps going through this line over and over he says over and over the phrase I will restore I will restore I will restore who will restore the church isn't restoring herself he said I will restore all that the cankerworm all that the Locust all that the caterpillar all that they I will restore why because it's his word it's his prophecy it's his desire from before the foundation of the world to present Christ with a virgin brde so he's going to restore the bride tree amen so that she can produce the fruit amen amen so he needs her because he's willed it that way but she can do nothing in herself she must receive the head headship amen it doesn't matter listen how much a a woman wants to be a mother she can desire it she can crave it she can want it but she can never produce that on her own she needs the headship of the male she needs the seed that comes from the male amen she can beg for it desire it want it crave it dream about it talk about it but she has no power in herself to produce it amen she's going to have to lay down her life and surrender herself to the will of her husband and when she does she can receive the seed amen that will bring forth life and she can become a mother amen not by her works but by her husband's Works amen praise God the spiritual and the natural type one another so perfectly God's given brother B said my first Bible was nature amen so so there's no way to talk about fatherhood without talking about motherhood you can't talk about motherhood without talking about fatherhood and God Amen is a great father and all of this is reflecting him Amen in the in the message presuming the prophet of God says but the female is dainty pretty that's where Satan lays right there that's where he chose an Eden that's where he's got to in Eden that's what he's used ever since you tell me one nation in history some of you school kids uh a fall of a Nation as soon as motherhood was broke and Womanhood that nation's backbone was was broke brother man makes this statement so many times it's shocking uh it's multiple times in the message he said that motherhood is the backbone of a nation and and it's I mean it's it's it's actually a shocking statement and motherhood is the backbone because if you talk about the human body and the significance of your backbone your backbone is what holds everything together you stand because of your backbone amen your head is where it is because of your backbone all the nerves and neurological Pathways run through your spinal cord amen your backbone is so essential to everything it's what holds the skeletal structure together it's all built off the backbone amen and now he's saying motherhood is the backbone of the nation amen she's the one holding everything together say when you broke motherhood you broke the nation amen it's like how could brother B say such things and he can show all kinds of types and all kinds of ways in which during World War II when the mothers went to work and started leaving the home and the Great Migration out of the how everything morally began to deteriorate and he he has all kinds of examples for this but the reality is it goes right back to Eden when you broke motherhood you broke the whole civilization of humanity so motherhood becomes this instrument this essential instrument to bring forth the plan of God Amen when it was broken in the woman when it was broken in Eve I mean we we all now come broken because that back backbone was broken and so we're all handicapped because of that so motherhood becomes essential a man can never express what is in him and express his seed without a woman that's why God chose to use the same method the same example brother B in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says this he says that's Comm that's committed to Her Sacred virtue sacred Womanhood and sacred motherhood honor her husband three things that a woman is entrusted with sacred virtue sacred Womanhood and then sacred motherhood sacred virtue is keeping herself virgin sacred Womanhood is keeping her body amen veiled keeping her femininity intact amen and not becoming love for allowing others to lust after her and then sacred motherhood is keeping her womb pure Amen to bring forth life amen amen this is why there's so many themes in the Bible that match this there's the there's there there's the theme of progyny Amen a father bringing forth children and everybody going back to their fathers for their identification amen they always go back my fathers I mean even even uh uh even Jacob is saying I worship the god of My Father Abraham and of my father Isaac they're always referring back to their father's Faith their father's lineage who their father was the tribes were broke out the 12 tribes all took the name of the original patriarchal fathers that's why the bi whole Bible set up on a patriarchal system amen that's why we still today when a woman marries she takes her husband's name she comes under his headship comes under his identification so the whole thing is is set up this way under this fatherhood amen it's such a theme in the Bible amen but another them that runs through to the Bible is the the the need for virginity amen it's not just listen it's not just for Morality although it is for Morality but it's not just for Morality because what was the first thing that was broken in Eden is Eve lost her virginity and now corrupted the very womb That was supposed to bring forth life to manifest sons of God and now it falls into corruption because she lost virginity virginity is not just it's not just a way to control actions of people or to have a better morality or to have a better life amen it goes all the way back to the fundamental cause of the of the reason that we're in the condition we're in now and so this virginity runs as a theme because virginity is a way amen for the the way to preserve the heritage of the father that's what it is all through the Bible amen it's a preser it's a preservation of the the heritage of the father he wants to marry a virgin because he doesn't want any other seed to corrupt his seed but he wants to reproduce himself upon the Earth or bring forth his offspring his children and it was so fundamental to the ancient Nations amen this whole thing because it's a concept that comes from God so so now I mean it's been absolutely polluted and corrupted in the world that we live in today and been treated with such disdain amen that it it's acted as if it doesn't mean anything whether or not you keep yourself from marriage or not but they've lost the whole intent and purpose in it all I thank God that he's opened our eyes and given us understanding amen so that we know what God wants of us because the natural types the spiritual what does God want amen he wants a virgin bride he wants an uncorrupted unpolluted womb where he can sew his seed to do what to reproduce his own life comes all the way back so these themes run through the entire Bible amen and so when we started looking at bringing forth this Royal seed my wife and I were sitting at the breakfast table with brother Alistair one morning we were just talking we're just having a conversation and brother Alistair started talking about uh lions and we just were just chatting and he started talking about and he and he mentioned this scripture here see if this works praise God Revelations 55 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and he starts talking about the nature of Christ as a lion and he started because he lives in South Africa he loves nature he loves lion so he was just relating some things and he started talking to us about the objective of the whole Pride amen is to is to move forward the progeny of the male the whole purpose amen the lionesses they they hunt to feed they they they they breed they reproduce the the the lineage of the male amen then they protect them they raise them up they feed them they give their whole lives Amen to to raise up the seed of this male lion amen and they keep out all unwanted uh um other male lions and all their Lions amen because a male lion will come and he will first thing he'll do is he'll kill all the Cubs so that he can put a female back in Ester so that he can sew his own seed because even the animal kingdom is all set up on this sewing seed and progyny and protecting progyny it's all set up on the same thing bringing forth life protecting that life bringing that life to maturity amen the Bible is the same thing bringing forth the life of God in human beings protecting that life and bringing it to adoption maturity praise God so we see it all through nature is what one of the reasons brother B said uh God is in nature and his first Bible was in nature so we see then I started thinking about this as far as uh Father's Day and the purpose of the bride and all of these things and I had this picture here I was thinking of pictures that I could use as a nice big black main African lion but this is actually a picture that my wife and I took when we were in Krueger National Park and so um I was thinking of doing this PowerPoint my wife said we've got those pictures from Krueger I said well praise the Lord that was a mission trip then it was a Ministry trip that wasn't just vacation so I should get a tax write off for that or something but but no it's not the case but so anyways you see this big male lion and the pride is structured Amen to bring forth his seed line and to protect his seed line and feed his seed line and and keep all other Predators away and anybody that would inhibit their lives until they can come into their own maturity amen and and the the church is very much the same way he's the lion of the tribe of Judah amen but we are we are the church we are here to reproduce his life his seed not any other thing and we're here to to protect those progyny from false doctrines and from the Predators that are out there from demon lying spirits and all the things that are around there that's the goal of the church is just to bring forth his life and nurture that life and bring it into adoption maturity amen it says in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he became not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side amen when he comes to take the book amen it wasn't time he did the overcoming himself amen he overcame his own self he laid down his life he won back the book he took the book he loosed the seals but when he thundered and when he roared as when a l line Roars and seven Thunders uttered their voices brother B said he was calling for his Queen to come stand by his side now at the opening of the SE seals was time amen for his Queen to come and Unite with him amen and that's the day that we live in yes amen Revelations 10 1:3 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud brother R said none other than Christ it could be and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders had uttered their voice question is have you heard him Roar Amen in this day have you heard the sounding of the seven Thunders he's calling his Queen to come stand by his side praise be to God in the breach message he says now see he's done his Kinsman work you you know what the Kinsman work was to testify before the elders you remember Boaz kicked off his shoes and so forth he's done all this now he comes to take his bride amen he comes now as a king he's looking for his Queen Amen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals old brother Seven Seals waiting for him to come he comes as a king looking for his queen and the whole book has the secret of it wrapped up in those Seven Seals in the breach again he says when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his right it was a judgment seat then he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side so at the time he takes the book and Loos the seals and Roars and the Seven Thunders utter is the time that he's calling for his Queen to come stand by aside that's when we move into the bride age because now it's the calling from the bride out of the denominational age out of Lea to come and Unite with him the Capstone that's come down amen and so she must be a queen Queen amen and because he's calling for a queen what he's wanting to do is reproduce himself he wants to bring forth his seed upon the Earth and he needs a queen and he needs a Virgin Queen that's why he had to restore the word through a prophetic Ministry so that we can be washed by all the filth of these denominational prostitutes and washed away all that was unlike him to bring us back to a virgin condition Washed by the bleeding bloody word so that we can be presented back to Christ as a virgin of the word and a Virgin by the word so that we could receive that word so that we could reproduce the word amen praise God Amen and some some things that that oh the the the Bible is so terrific amen the message is so wonderful but you find out if if you just let your mind go I mean the problem is sometimes we try to intellectualize things and sometimes that's my problem I'm trying to understand too much and it's not about comprehension intellectually it's about comprehension spiritually it's about a spiritual truth that's Awakening inside of us that's why amen we could describe Christ as the lamb and his wife is the wife of the Lamb so he's the lamb she's the lamb but he's also the lion and know she has to be the Lioness I mean you you see all these types and shadows coming down through amen they're all trying to dispel truth to us it's not so that we get hung up and say well is he a lion now or is he a lamb now he's no longer the lamb now he's the lion so am I supposed to be a lamb listen forget about all of that God is trying to take some symbol that you understand and teach you a truth he's not trying to divide himself up and say now I have this nature and now I have this nature it's not like that friends we get all boggled down by details and now is he this or now is he that he's a lamb is he a lamb he's always a lamb he'll always be the lamb when he takes the Throne of David he'll be the Lamb of God but he's also the lion of the tribe of Judah and he's always been the lion and will always be the lion so people get confused with details brother brandham doesn't get confused with details that's why he's a perfect Prophet because he can take the same scripture and use it two different ways because it's all about the revelation of the truth it's not about the details of keeping the words lined out correctly so people get confused and think brother B's contradicting himself one time he makes Noah those Noah and those in the ark are the 144,000 Jews that are saved through the time of tribulation one time he makes them the elect seed that's saved from destruction another time he makes them part of the foolish virgin that are saved from destruction amen when was he right and when was he wrong he's always right because it's the truth that's being inseminated by the word and so now we try to say I mean you take any type if you take a type of The Lion and the pride of lions you take that type and you run it too tight you're going to find a place where it falls apart and no longer expresses the nature of Christ because these are still beasts and Fallen World and a fallen condition and sometimes they eat their own young that's not the point don't get hung up on the details catch the Revelation that he's bringing to us this day he wants us he's calling for his bride his church his seed the the the the female version of him to unite with him in this day so that he can reproduce himself upon the Earth how's he going to reproduce himself she's not going to birth out another Jesus Christ like Mary did 2,000 years ago she's actually going to receive the word which is he himself the promised word for this hour which is he himself manifesting himself in the form of a bride Jesus Christ in the bride form and she is going to now surrender to the headship of the word and live that word to the letter by the power of the Holy Ghost that's been released by the fullness of the word coming back and that will be him reproduced through the womb of the Bride amen don't let your mind get B well what child what baby and when and all of that it's you it's in you it's in collectively in the bride it's Christ coming forth from the womb of his his his church that has been redeemed amen praise be to God some of the things that causes arguments and confusion needs to just fade out of our minds and we've all been guilty of it I'm as guilty as any human being so I'm not pointing a finger I've been boggled down in this type and and that type and how do they all mingle together amen you know how to get them to mingle together it's fly a little higher and you see how they're all connected amen I like that picture brother Simon Drew looking at the walled City I mean you got to get a little higher to get the perspective and see how it all fits together amen praise be to God now he is calling for his Queen to come stand by his side what does it mean to go stand by his side does it mean that I have to wait for him to physically manifest and appear and then I walk over to a certain location and I stand next to a to Christ who's now been appeared in whatever realm or whatever Dimension that would be I don't believe that's what it means to come stand by his side I think what it means is to come to his side the side of the word come stand with the word the anointed word that's been revealed in this day leave your position leave your denominations leave your ideas leave your Traditions leave it all and come and stand by his side who is he the revealed word amen he is the manifested revealed word Christ the anointed word for this day that's who he is come stand by him this is the spirit position it's not a physical location amen he's calling for his bride to leave the realm of carnal to leave the hybrization of religion and move up spiritually in her Revelation amen and come and align herself with the word and stand shoulder Tosh shoulder to be what to be his helpmate what the woman was originally intended to be praise God in the restoration of the Bride tree says but what he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female tree don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female Tre this bridegroom as it is in the bride The Works that I do shall you also what is it it's his life now in her amen and brother B said the bridegroom tree without the bride tree don't bear fruit so where is the fruit going to come in the end time the fruit which comes from the seed which is a product of the seed life the fruit comes on he says on the top of the tree there's been a topping or a treetop time coming to the bride tree it got ate down by these four insects he said these Roman insects they got in through the corruption amen of denominationalism the corruption of man's ideas and desires and being mixed in with the pure word amen and it ate the tree down through four stages but through four stages he's bringing it back to life and he's showing through through Luther amen through his message it was coming back and he and brother brandom goes on to say and those same Roman insects went to eating on those new shoots that came out he said but God says I will restore his purpose is not going to be defeated in the restoration of the brid tree so what does he do he just trims off the Lutheran branches and lets the life keep coming up they don't eat it back down again friends they only attack the new growth brother B explains all this and the restoration of the brid tree and now they come out to the next level under Wesley it's growing a little higher putting forth shoots amen started bearing a life of sanctification amen and then after Wesley dies those insects those Roman insects start creeping away again but God's purpose is not going to be defeated he already said I will restore all the years that the cankerworm palmerworm caterpillar and Locust have eaten I will restore and so now amen he he starts to bring it up and then when they eat it back all he does is prune off the Wesley and branch and brings the new growth out of the top what's he doing he's bringing it to a treetop he's bringing it to where the full sun can shine Amen to bring forth the predestinated fruit same thing through Pentecost comes up denominationalism Creeps in he prunes it off but the fourth stage Hallelujah said he ate it down through four bug bugs but it came back through the fourth and when brother Ram gets to this he goes oh how I'd like to go into Ezekiel and read about ezekiel's dry bones amen where the Prophet prophesied and they came together through three stages bone to bone and senu and skin and now they were standing there on their feet amen but there was not life yet amen so now he says the fourth stage is speak to the wind amen which is the spirit amen to come back into this Army that's the fourth stage that's the latter Reign that's this message prophesied by William brandham to do what to bring the spirit The Life of Christ back into a body of Believers amen what was lost after Pentecost amen has been lost and ate down through these Roman bugs but he's brought it back through four stages and the fourth stage is the message the opening of the seals the revealing of the mystery of God Amen it's the Life coming back into the church praise God I just how i' like to get them dry bones hallelujah oh my goodness what was it it was a mighty Army but that Mighty Army had went down through four stages they lost the life they lost the skin they lost the Senus and the bones were separated and it was a valley full of dry bones Amen in the Dark Ages but after the Dark Ages he started bringing the bones back together amen then he brought the the the the senu back together in the muscle then he brought the skin back on and Pentecost that's why Pentecost looked like the real thing cuz it had skin and it was standing there but it wasn't finished yet there had to be a fourth stage of life amen to come back and that four stage of Life came when the former rain and latter rain were falling together at the opening of the the seals that's why those messages from the seals on 63 on are so Dynamic he starts preaching about son of man Ministry he starts showing C Gene of God all of these things are coming forth why it's the message of life amen bringing the spirit of Christ right back into your life to have a treetop and what's supposed to happen to the treetop when the full sun of the word is shining supposed to produce the fruit again the original predestinated fruit same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride this is why brother B says so many difficult things if we're trying to go intellectual and we're trying to categorize and uh scholar eyes the message so many difficult things cuz he says this Holy Ghost has been bound by these denomination of waters for nearly 2,000 years and how is the Holy Ghost Bound by these denominational Waters or Rivers he's talking about Euphrates being the barrier to the promised land and coming back into the land and all these things he's typing all of this remember brother M was taking all these Old Testament figures and characters and examples and rivers and Waters and kings and he's all trying to to reveal to us what's happening spiritually not so that we could go back and study the Euphrates and figure out the bins not the physical but the spiritual so now the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Waters these Rivers for nearly 2,000 years said he couldn't get into the church you think the Holy Ghost can go anywhere he wants but no because the because the Holy Ghost the the spirit and the word brother B said are one and the same and when they rejected the word they rejected the spirit they could never get the full Spirit brother B said they had a dip in the spirit because God would always bring a measure of Truth and when they receive that measure of Truth they would receive the life that came with that truth so when they reive justification they received that portion of life with justification sanctification they receive that portion of Life same thing with the restoration of the gifts but brother brandom says that the Holy Ghost in its full measure was bound it wasn't that the Holy Ghost wasn't working through the church ages it wasn't that the spirit wasn't moving it wasn't that they didn't have life and didn't have the Holy Spirit it wasn't any of that but the full measure of the Holy Ghost was bound by these denominational Waters amen for nearly 2,000 years but is loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the messenger comes and brings the message and what does it do it loosed the Holy Ghost what was tying up the Holy Ghost amen he was tied up it wasn't that he was bound and tied up he he could not move in where the word was not accepted and when the word was not revealed amen so now at the revealing of the word the opening of the word amen when that little virgin says be it unto me according to Thy word the life of the word comes right in with the word amen because she's rejected and denounced all her denomination of ideas she's been Washed by the Water of the bleeding word and now she says that ain't nothing but the truth so be it unto me amen and so all of these things uh that they're odd sayings until you get the context of what he's saying and why he's saying these things and what he's trying to get us to see he's trying to break us out of denominationalism he's trying to break us out of traditional thinking he's trying to break us out of sitting here and just going to church on Sunday and going to church on Wednesday and waiting someday for when Jesus comes back and we all see him and we all go to a paradise and everything will be wonderful then he's trying to break that out of our minds so that we recognize he's here he's present tense he is come and he's calling for his Queen to come stand by his side he wants to finish what wasn't finished with the first church that came fresh out of Pentecost because before they before he came to her to reproduce himself fully upon the Earth she was already a fallen woman amen that now he's restored that Fallen woman so he can go so they can go back to Pentecost not to stay at Pentecost remember not Pentecost Revival but when they came through the Feast of Pentecost and they Spilled Out with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and The Life of Christ now living in them that's what he brings us back to but but not to stay there because they were supposed to move from there to the marriage and they never got to the marriage they never never got to the consummation they never got to the conception and they never got to the reproduction God so we don't want to just go back to being the church it was at Pentecost and stop we're just being brought back to a virgin condition so that we can complete what they didn't complete Amen brother B even said in one quot I don't have it with me but you'll just have to go look for it he said in one quote he says not not Pentecost he said the Pentecostals represent that yes going back the restoration of the gifts was going back to the supernatural things but it's not just that we're going back the that was been restored absolutely the gifts of the Spirit have been restored but to bring us into a virgin condition to bring us to the marriage that's what was missed amen this is what brother bram's trying to get us to see the great event that's taking place in our day Christ coming as the fullness of the word the full revelation of what's been hid down Through the Ages what was in the back God of God's mind his great desire was to live in people and he's come to say this is the time for the manifestation of that in the small measure that's on Earth at the time that's why they without us are not yet made perfect they're waiting for this Perfection to come through adoption this Union of Christ and the reproduction of the life of Christ and that will literally bring them out of the graves praise be to God so now he's a king cuz he took the book and he loosed the seals and now he's calling for a queen to come stand by his side amen you know when the lion roars who can but prophesy it's amazing when you uh I can only imagine I've never been a hyena or a jackal or anything like that but I can imagine when the lion roars that if it's nearby and he sounds angry if I'm a hyena or a jackal or any kind of competition I think I'd run away there's some that run away from the Roar of the lion but there's others that run to the Roar of the Lion and it depends on what species you are and what Pride you're part of whether you run to the roar or you run away from the roar when the lion roars amen when did he Roar he Roar when he came down with an open book in his hand and then seven Thunders uttered their voices amen and then there was a people on the Earth that run away from that Roar because they don't understand Mysteries and they don't it's too mystical and I don't know about this Prophet thing and I it's not like what I was taught all my life and they run away but those who are of the same species and of the same Pride they run to that Roar of a line what scares some brings joy to another what is awkward for one ears is a homecoming to another Amen to one it's fearful and mysterious and scary to another it's a welcoming sound it's home it's home it's my father it's my husband it's whatever is in me it's the eagle screaming through the eagle in the chicken yard it's not a foreign sound I've never heard it before but when I hear it I'm attracted to it there's something in me that loves that eagle [Applause] scream praise be to God Amen so now he's calling for his Queen to come stand by his side and she comes to the roar brother M makes this statement he says you understand that did you see the Earth is cursed the whole earth is cursed because of Adam's sin but when this little seed now the woman doesn't have a seed she is a field that the seed lays in not a seed because there's not a germ see seed has to have life in it if it isn't it's just a material the life isn't there so the seed is in the man now I also want to let you know brother br's not talking scientifically here don't try to take this scientifically there's another place where brother R said see the woman has a seed too because those two have to come together 23 chromosomes and 23 chromosomes and they they come together in matching Pairs and we we know we know the science but don't be overly intelligent right now let's just get the point what he's showing is life comes through the father because the mother can never produce life without the father and neither can the father without the mother but he's showing that life that's why the Bible is patriarchal that's why the F the Bible runs from father a son the lineages are patriarchal because he's showing I had a nurse one time who's in the message amen she absolutely believed the message had no doubt she said brother Chad I've looked at the science behind it and the hemoglobin and the life and the and and and she goes I I can't understand it I said the point is not to understand that the point is to understand that life comes from the male that's what we must understand because that's what the whole Bible is showing us you understand I'm not saying ignore science and act like we're that's not the point we're not talking about how the chromosomes match up we're not talking about amen fertilized egg and an egg and a spr we're not talking about any of that what we're talking about is the very thing that the Bible shows us is shows us that life comes from the father from the father to the mother and then they're born and they give attribute all the they give it all back to the father I'm the son of Abraham I worship the god of My Father Abraham and this and this it's always back to to the father why because everything in US goes back to the father because only the male father word has life we're supposed to be the field to receive life amen sometimes you find that the greatest unbelievers of the message are message believers they claim they believe Malachi 4 they claim they believe brother B's a prophet they claim they believe this and then they want to go to Scientific books and proving wrong about life comes from this the greatest unbelievers in the message are message so-called message Believers because God sent us a perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication he gave us the truth of his mind not scientific details the truth the truth that supersedes everything the mystery revealed in the back part from the back part of God's mind that supersedes everything look it's a shame that sometimes the greatest unbelievers of the message are so-called message Believers that don't even believe what the prophet told us sad Ephesians 6:4 it says and your fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and so this is a a commandment given to fathers this is the Apostle Paul says his father's day we might as well talk about it a little bit he says nurture bring them up in nurture and admonition of the Lord but just as Adam in order to reproduce himself needed a help meat every man needs a help meat and if I'm given the task of bringing up my children the nurture and ammonition of the Lord then I need for one to bring forth my seed I need a womb I need a woman and I need a wife in order to reproduce my myself to bring forth my progeny my seed I need a wife and now in a in a holy Union with that wife amen I can bring forth the seed that is in me and that seed comes up and I have a commandment from God to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord but I need the very partner who helped me create this child I need them to help me in my task to nurture uh to bring up the child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so I need a help meat amen we still need help meets Brothers we still need a woman we still need a wife Amen to reproduce ourselves amen we still amen we still need a wife to help us in our task to raise these children to serve God and if that's true then that means it's very important who we select to be our wife amen and I'm choosing of a bride actually I'm not going to read that yet stop I'm going to read this one I've got a longer one that wouldn't fit on the slide I want to read that first brother Venom says now now now remember we're typing natural and spiritual brother B's doing the same thing in choosing of a bride so these what we're talking about now are principles amen that move in every facet of Life everywhere you have a what's symbolically a man and a woman amen Christ and his bride a a husband and a wife amen wherever you have that these principles lay true he says in choosing of a bride now we are here see plainly the spirit spiritual plan of God's planning for his future home with his future bride comes into view now if a man marries a sex Queen you see what he's looking for for the future if a man marries a woman that won't stay home you see what he's looking for in the future this sounds awful says I just feel to say it he's getting ready to say something and he says it's going to sound awful I just feel to say it and usually if I feel to say a thing I ought to say it and it's usually God's way I used to go with a Ranter that I worked with to buy cattle and I noticed the old fell always looked right in the face of a heer before he went to bidding then he turned her head and looked back and forth I followed him along watching him and he looked her up and down if she looked all right the stature then he turned and looked her in the face and sometime he shake his head and walk away I said Jeff I want to ask you something he said say on Bill I said why you always looking that cow in the face I said she looks all right good heavy cow said I want to tell you boy you got a lot to learn and I realized that after he told me he said I don't care how she made up she might be beef Plum to the hoof but if she's got that wild stare in her face don't you never buy her said why so Jeff said well said the first thing is said she'll never stay put he said the next thing is she'll never be a mamy to her calf and said they put her in a pen now the reason she's fat you turn her loose with that wild stair she'd run herself to death I said you know I kind of learned something I believe that applies to women too I'm so glad brother Brown said these things amen cuz I would never use analogies like that in the pull pit amen I believe that applies to women too right the wild stary rietta look better stay away from her boy all that their blue stuff over the top of her eyes I didn't I wouldn't want that I don't think that's becoming to a Christian I don't care how much the television and paper says it's pretty it's the most horrible looking hideous sight that I ever seen in my life he goes down a couple paragraphs further he says but you know you have to plan look Pray when you're choosing amen this is for all the unmarrieds now hey hey you're getting a free lesson from the prophet now just judge her like you would a good beef cow she might be beef don't tell her she looks like beef Plum to the hoof I I would suggest you don't use that quote exactly that way you may lose your chance amen but he says you have to plan look Pray when you're choosing for we see by this the Word of Promise she the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him now could you imagine a man filled with the Holy Ghost take something like that to be a wife I I just don't see it brother now maybe I'm just an old crank but you know I just can't understand that see notice for it's going to reflect what's in him she's going to help him make his future home now when brother brandham now is talking about the choosing of a bride he's he's he's talking now about the lesson he learned in ranching because it doesn't matter the outward appearance it matters the character of the creature and when it comes down to a woman amen she may be ever so beautiful and put together so well and able Amen to to make herself look nice am amen but that's not the part that you're looking for amen you want to find out who's going to help you raise your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord because you need a help me to help you take what's inside of you and bring it to life and nurture that up to the fear and ammonition of the Lord to be amen something that came from you your Offspring that's now serving the lord brother Ben said that's what you ought to be looking for amen so many times we have disasters because uh good because everything was motivated by lust yes then down the road you end up with with a disaster because the whole thing was lust amen but he's saying you should pray because she's going to help make your future home it's not about just fulfilling your desire for today it's for what will happen in the future now then when we change back down for a moment to the spiritual side and when you see a church that's in the world acts like the world anticipating in the world partaking of the world counting God's Commandments as if he never had wrote them then you can just imagine Christ ain't going to take a bride like that could you imagine taking the modern church today for a bride not my Lord I could hardly see that no remember now a man and his wife are one would you join yourself to a person like that if you would it would serve certainly kind of disappoint my faith in you brother man is showing us that now just as a man shouldn't choose a woman with that that that that wild stare in her eye let's just talk about that wild stare in her eye that one that doesn't want to stay put she doesn't want to sacrifice her life she's not wanting to yield she's not wanting to give up her career she's not wanting to give up uh uh her ideas or her advancement or her money or or her idea of what she wants for her family if she's not willing to lay all that down that's the one that you don't [Applause] want amen that's the one you don't want because you want the one that's going to help you reproduce yourself and raise your children in the fear and ammonition of the Lord you want the one that's going to sacrifice herself for your seed you want the one that'll give her life amen give up herself give up her time give up her sleep give up her career give up her advancement give up her titles give up everything even give her body over to another seed that will give herself completely up to do what to unite with you to fulfill your purpose in this life to reproduce yourself and raise your children in the fear and ammonition of the Lord you're looking for that kind of a wife not not just one that that makes your heart Thump Thump and not just one that makes your eyes glisten and glow you want one that's going to help youing bring forth what's inside of you and help you nurture it along to become amen a child of God that's the most important thing to look for why because that's what Christ is looking for brother Brenham is teaching this whole this whole sermon to teach is what Christ is looking for he's looking for a bride to help him reproduce himself upon the Earth she can't have her own ideas her own agenda her own Doctrine her own way of doing things she's got to surrender herself and take his head ship completely amen and lay down her life and give up her body her ideas amen her Traditions her family church give it all up and surrender to him one that's gentle and meek and kind and submissive listen this this so many things that the prophet taught blasting modern the modern feminism and the woman of the day man that doesn't have backbone enough the the the to take leadership in his home he's blasting all of these things and it sounds like well you know people can get the idea well he was just in another generation he was an older man and he had his own ideas it's not that he's actually preaching the very theme of The Bible he's actually showing you that this Modern leodan Way amen is not God's way it's not the way that God Amen attended in the beginning it's not the way God wants it to run now amen he's blasting those things because those are anti- word conduct amen amen and listen brother bham is not a legalist he's not hammering these things out and saying you have to do this and you can never do this that's not the point he's trying to get us the vision of what Christ bride is supposed to be like amen and it's supposed to be reflected in our lives and in our homes cuz we're supposed to be a reflection of the word it's not just a man blasting stuff he doesn't like he's caught the mind of God he has caught the very mind of the word amen he may not know his Bible real well but he knows the author really well he's not just saying things don't take the things the prophet said lightly and just dismissed them as if that's for a previous generation that's for another day no he's he's actually got God's mind amen he knows the author real well and he's looking for a bride that's not going to continually take her own way if a man is looking for a wife he's got to find the one that reflects what's inside of him because what's inside of him is also his progeny his seedline and he's got to find something that matches the inside of him so that he can bring forth listen it's so important to find a match I don't I hope I hope this gets home I don't exactly know how to explain it but it's so important to find the right match because the right match has to be she has to be an extension of what you are inside because it's her very body that's going to bring what's inside of you to manifestation and then you guys are going to partner together as a help meet to bring your desire for your Offspring to fruition to a manifestation now listen this is the principle and you can say brother Chad I did that and there's ones who've left not what we're talking about the world is fallen in a fallen condition and there's sin everywhere you can do everything right and still have a wayward child that's not what we're talking about I'm talking about the principle that matches Christ and his bride catch the principle because the principle Works sin is still sin and free moral agency is still free moral agency things will go wrong amen don't let the principal bring condemnation or feel like your pre against just say amen that's the truth so a man has to find his match amen he's got to find what reflects what's inside of him so that she can help reproduce him on the earth now I know it's in a perverted way and I know it's corrupted I know all of that but the principle's still true there's hybridization and and can still produce a black sheep in a family I mean brother B explains all of these things to us but I'm I want to show the principle is sound and true because Jesus Christ wants to reproduce himself on the earth and he's got to find a bride that matches what's inside of him brother B says choosing of a bride again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married if he married for lust it'll show if he married for character it'll show amen and praise God some of us didn't even know these things when we got married and it was the grace of God that watched over us anyhow amen at the end of the day it's God's grace amen it's not what we can accomplish or what we can learn amen does change the principle being true but I thank God when I knew nothing God was watching over me amen but you all know different now this generation coming up you're without excuse because to much is given much is required don't just say I'm depending on the grace of God God's grace is to give you the word that's his grace so now now a man must find what reflects the inside of him he says what say if I would marry a coarse girl what if I would marry a sex queen or just a pretty modern Retta it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he's took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future and many times it shows he's not thinking of the future he's thinking of the present he wants to fulfill his own lustful desires he wants to have what he's craving and he's not even thinking of the future amen so I want to highlight this bolded here because he took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so many times that's not what's thought of in the beginning but it's what should be thought of it's important it's certainly what Christ is thinking of I want to go down and I want to show some examples through scripture so I'm going to go through several scriptures really fast from Genesis Genesis 20 and aimc said unto Abraham what what sawest thou that thou Hast done this thing and Abraham said because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife so who did Abraham marry his half sister now don't start saying yuck gross it's amazing when we get into the Bible how many times we we judge the Bible based off our emotions about the world we live in today we got to stop that God wrote this Bible intentionally show us spiritual truth stop saying yuck and I couldn't never do listen God God wrote his Bible exactly the way he wanted it wrote don't judge what happened 4,000 years ago based off your emotions about the culture you live in today because what you'll be doing is you'll be saying yuck about the word of God so he married his sister brother teaches us the genetic pool was much stronger back then the law of Moses hadn't come and the law of Moses forbid it to at least the second cousin or Beyond so we know all that God had a way of bringing things down after he spoke what he needed spoke after it was written needed written then he come down and brought protection measures through the law amen so god is perfect in all of his ways so now we said and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou should not take a wife into my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go into my country into my Kindred and take a wife into my son Isaac this has always been through the Bible it mattered who they married this was a natural type but now it's a spiritual type in in Genesis 11 he says in tra that's Abraham's dad lived 70 years and beg got Abram nahor and Heron so remember Abram nahor and Heron those are the three brothers uh three sons of Tara Genesis 24 and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and parted for all the goods of his Masters were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia into the city of nahor where did he go he went right back to the city of Abraham's brother nahor is Abraham's brother and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebecca came out who was born to Bethell son of milka the wife of nahor Abraham's brother with her pitcher over her shoulder so here comes a granddaughter of nahor Abraham's brother his great niece Isaac's first cousin once removed this is what Abraham wanted he did not want a Canaanite he didn't want he wanted to go back to his Kindred because it mattered this was going to be the promised seed line it mattered how the seed came forth God wrote these things intentionally Genesis 24:2 9 and Rebecca had a brother and his name was laan and Laban ran out into the man un the well so Rebecca had a brother named laan laan oh my goodness laan all right let's back up for a minute see this born Bethell son of milka milka was the mother the wife of nahor nahor is Abraham's brother he takes a wife milka milka is the daughter of Haron do you know who Haron is the other brother amen this is a family affair amen I was going to say something mean about West Virginia but I won't because I have brothers I love here you have to forgive me anyways Brothers I love you and Rebecca and his brother and his name was laan and laan ran out into the men unto the well now this is laan Rebecca's brother but now we find as Jacob now Isaac's son is sent back he goes back to laan Rebecca his mother's brother and laan said unto Jacob because Thou Art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for not tell me what shall be thy wages so we know he asked for Rachel and Rachel is laan's daughter so he marries his first cousin don't say yuck this is the word of God why because this was the lineage of Abraham it mattered who they married it mattered that that wound was virgin it mattered that it was of the same family it mattered that they found a match that Rec could reproduce the life of Abraham reproduce the life of Isaac do you understand what I'm saying this is all typology but but we want to type it but when we get to the Song of Solomon he says Thou Hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse what is this this is a Love Song of Solomon it's typing the relationship between Christ and his bride thou has ravaged my heart my sister my spouse thou has ravaged my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck amen who was he ravaged by his sister who was his spouse amen what did Jesus say when he resurrected from the dead he told him he said go tell Peter and my disciples amen that I go into Galilee and I meet them that I go unto my father and to your father you mean you have the same father he's Christ the husband you're the bride who's your father you have the same father just like Abraham and Sarah had because it matters who brings forth this life it matters the womb it matters that there's a match there has to be a match amen so I'm telling you Brothers you need to find for yourself a match one that matches your desire to serve the Lord one that matches your nature one that reflects what's on the inside of you because that's exactly what Jesus Christ was doing that's what God did Through the Bible to protect the seed that's what he's doing right now to bring forth the seed of Christ he has to find his match amen and listen you young Brothers amen find your match don't just find a pretty face you talk to that girl till you found someone that reflects what's inside of you amen who is your reflection on the inside because why she's not only going to bring forth your children she's going to help you nurture them children Amen to be your preny upon the Earth that God has commissioned you to raise in the nurture and ammonition of the Lord and if she disrespects the word if she disrespects her father if she disrespects headship if she has her own ideas and she wants to have the glory and she's the one who's always talking about herself and she's got to have the greatest story and look the prettiest and be the best then you run away from that girl because she's not going to Humble herself down to raise your children your way according to your idea the whole idea of submission is not about men dominating female it's about the the very type and natural of what God is doing the life comes through the mail amen and it has to be according to his desire his mind his wishes his home has to come under his leadership because the life is passing through him she has to surrender her ideas to come in line with his idea for a family amen to match the Bible it's not just saying women be submissive to your husbands my goodness that's a good way to build a whole pile of frustration is try to force that it's better to catch the V vision of what God's doing and what you're doing as a woman you're reproducing your husband on the earth and in doing so you get loads of benefits because those children will rise up and call you blessed they will become your caretakers amen they will be they're part of you also and they will be your strength in your old age don't look for the one that has to have her own way and is always right and has to shop for hours on Amazon to find the newest fashion and the greatest thing and look the best when she comes to church her focus is in the wrong place you want one that reflects unless that's what you really are unless you're not submissive to the word unless you want your own way unless you like your own then maybe that's the right one for you sir remember brother brandham did two weddings that he talked about and in those two weddings one was the rich couple that they married and the other was a poor couple and he talks about they're married by the same ceremony and he goes to visit them and when he goes to the rich couple they're fighting they're jealous of one another she was a beauty queen they were both Rich spoiled children they had everything handed to them meaning they had no character they had no self-discipline they had an overinflated value of themselves they were the ones that got all the participation trophies for no reason no character and brother R comes and sees them fighting because they were at a dance and she's a pretty girl and she danced with another boy or he did or something or another they were arguing with each other amen and and when brother renam came to the door they put on a facade a show that they were fine and happy but he'd already heard him fighting but then he slips up to those in the Box car and he finds them to in a discussion and he's saying oh honey I wanted to buy for you so bad she goes that's all right I've got a dress and he discerns that they they were counting out their money looked through the crack in the door and they were counting so much for insurance so much for gas so much for groceries they didn't have enough money left over but he saw a dress in a department store window and he wanted to buy it for her what is this man self-sacrificing putting her first wanting to please her and do something special for her with this limited amount of money amen and now listen she goes she goes that's all right I've got a dress I don't really need one praise God what was she doing she was reflecting what was inside of him he chose a bride that reflected his character then brother brand looked up on the hill where those two were fussing and fighting he said William brandham who's the rich man anyways where would you rather be which one would you take he said I would take this character down here in the Box car before that beauty queen up there why that man up there married the one that reflected what was in him the one down in the Box Car married the one that reflected what what was in him and Jesus Christ is only going to marry the bride that's reflecting what's inside of him not the beauty queen not the know- it all not the one who's bambas and argumentative and proud he's going to marry the one that reflects what's inside of him praise be to God the natural types the spiritual friends so he's going to marry Jesus is going to marry his match you should marry your match oh my goodness this is so important all of these things brother B said they now they're so significant and they're so important he says now in the Masterpiece notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also know the bride must be why why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten piece off of him there is the Masterpiece praise be to God there is the Masterpiece what is it it's she's part of him part of his life part of his nature what was his nature I only do that which the father shows me he was absolutely submissive to his headship the father what's he looking for he's looking for a bride that is just like him who's absolutely submissive to her headship Christ the word he's not going to take one in Rebellion that's why he cannot take a denominational bride she's in Rebellion to the word she has taken her own idea on how to raise these children amen called The Church the converts she takes her own idea on what's right and not right on what we should and shouldn't do and what's allowed and not allowed this is a this is a woman the denominational woman is a woman whose husband lays down the law says how he wants his home we want to be submissive to the word of God we do this we don't do that and as soon as Dad gone to work mother G gathers the children around and says listen I know that Dad doesn't understand but I understand so I'm going to let you do this let's just not tell Dad it'll be okay I'll talk to Dad it'll be okay that's the denominational spirit and and sisters if you've got that in your home that's a denominational Spirit and the Very seeds of Jezebel Catholicism so wrong that's why I thank God Amen to live in a midst of sisters and brothers who model Christ in his church you see the families coming to church you see the homes in harmony you see the husbands and wives listen it doesn't mean we don't have problems we're in flesh we're in hybridized flesh we have sticky culber nature but we keep surrendering to the word and keep surrendering to the word and keep reflecting the right kind of life and that's why I love to be in fellowship with brothers and sisters to surrender to the word and he'll take this very image of Christ and his bride and flesh it out every day Christ sacrificing for his bride the bride laying down her own will and life for him amen a husband who will sacrifice himself for his family and give of himself give the best that he has give all the time and a and a wife who will surrender herself to the headship of her husband where they're both giving both sacrificing both loving that's a picture of Christ in his bride remember we love him because he first loved us you can't demand love you only give love and love reciprocates Husband must tenderly care for his wife and she'll reciprocate love his children they'll reciprocate you don't get submission by force you don't get it by quoting scriptures you don't get it by brow beating you get it by acting the part of Jesus Christ so that your wife can play the part of the Bride that's how it works we want to demand listen sometimes sometimes those will want to demand everything that a church should be to Christ they want their wives to be to them but they're nothing that Christ is to the church they're none of that to their wife amen how is that right how can you demand that your wife is everything the church is to Christ but you're nothing that Christ is to your wife listen Christ died for his wife when she was guilty when she was in sin before she repented he gave his whole life for her he was spit on for her mocked for her ridiculed falsely accused and he did it all for her then he gives her and showers her with blessings and pours out his life for her and continually keeps her in everything that she needs and she in return lays down her life for him you see and and wives you we can't you can't ask your husbands to be everything that Christ is to the church unless you're also what the bride is to Christ submissive and humble and and taking the headship of the word and yielding your life and your ideas and all your con and surrendering it to him it works both ways because the spiritual and the natural type one another and the principle just works so we see this lioness this queen of the lion and she's interested in something now this is this is real pictures this really happened we were really parked here on the road and we saw her looking back and she was she had an interest we'll find out what her interest is shortly marriage and divorce brother then said now look in the final analysis look there is one Jesus Jesus Christ is that right one man God Emanuel do you believe that but the members of his wife are many see thousand times thousands of thousands is that right his wife the bride the church you understand now that's why he said to Adam before sex was ever induced or introduced multiplied to replenish the earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself there shows then that the bride was has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication multiplications see replenish the earth now now don't let your mind wander and try to piece together things that we're not talking about right now how things happen everything happened exactly the way it was intended to happen then you could say I we I talked to you this before but listen don't dispute over genealogies that bring nothing but Strife there's no point in talking about it everything happened exactly as it was intended to happen in the mind of God so we can speculate all we want on what would have happened but all that's still going to do is gender Strife CU somebody else will have another idea and all that we do know is what happened brother R says a lot of things and I've read them all amen and I believe them all I just don't know how they all fit together but that's okay I know what happened and that's what was important to us to know what happened so that we know where why we're here so now brother bandham is going back to the original command that was given to Adam and that original command man was given while he was in spirit form amen before he was in flesh and that Spirit form said multiply and replenish while he was in spirit form before he came to flesh and that's why brother bam picks that up and he says shows then that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication multiplication see what's he doing he's bringing it now to our age of spiritual birth listen this is not a discussion or an argument on how things were supposed to happen and what happened back there everything happen just fine it was wrong but it was right and and brought about God's permissive will okay are we are we agree that it was wrong but it was right all right but what brother bram's doing is going back to the original command and showing that it was a spiritual command in spiritual form now we're fast forwarding all the way thousands of years and now we've come to the time of not natural birth and natural lineage now we've come to the time of spiritual birth and spiritual lineage and spiritual bloodline and when you come to the spiritual you go back to the original command which is what brother bandham said and said now the bride's not coming forth because two bride members get married and they produce more bride that's not how they're coming forth they're coming forth by spiritual multiplication by the word by receiving the word and conceiving on the word and bringing forth the word now this is spiritual birth this is the new birth amen praise be to God so now what's bringing forth the seedline now what's bringing forth the bride now what's bringing forth the progeny now it's the word amen it's the word that's bringing forth the spiritual multiplication of God's seed upon the Earth right now by what by the bride taking the word carrying the word preaching the word brother brandom said will the bride have a Ministry in the end time he said yes have a great ministry it's going on now it consists of Apostles prophet pastors evangelist teachers what is that preaching the word what is the great ministry in the end time preaching this revealed word because now the children of God are being born by spiritual New Birth by spiritual multiplication by the word that's how Jesus came through Mary that's how the children are coming now prise God praise be to God this message is not to argue over and prove how much you know and fight with quotes catch the principle what is he trying to tell us he's trying to tell us that we've come to spiritual birth why what by the spoken word the word has been restored the word is being preached the word is being spoke and that word is reproducing the seed of Christ on the earth in Bride form the many membered bride so remember this lius was looking at something all we had to wait was a few minutes and see what she was watching she was watching for the seed watching over the seed protecting the seed feeding the seed guarding the seed what is the job of the Bride now to replicate Christ upon the Earth amen by what by spiritual multiplication by how by preaching the revealed word of the hour which is Christ that's sowing the seed of Christ and then what does it do it brings forth another Christ another child of God another word made manifest and now what does the church do the same thing the lionist does she's there to guard protect feed nurture and bring this seed to maturity what are we here for we're here to reproduce Christ on the earth how do I reproduce Christ on the earth amen by sowing the seed of the word first by surrendering myself to his headship and letting him come in and Unite with him and impregnate me and bring his life out of me and then I take that life that comes from his word and I preach the the word and when the word Goes Forth and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Spirit of the word strikes the seed in the soul and New Birth takes place what is that that's another of the Christ seed coming forth then now as his bride what are we here to do we're here to raise those children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord why how the same way a good wife does to her husband by forsaking our ideas our Ambitions our wants our thoughts on the word and what do we do we stay with our husband our bridegroom the revealed word this is how he wants it done this is what daddy said this is how daddy wants us to live this is what he said about this situation that's how we bring them up not by taking our own church idea that's denominationalism but by surrendering all of our ideas and staying true to the word creating a nurturing atmosphere where people can grow into the very stature of a perfect man into the likeness of Jesus Christ that's what we're supposed to be doing in this end time amen this little guy is the seed coming forth choosing from a bride he said the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him in his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a different when we find today that the modern Church a modern World Church Church the modern world church and also the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to sons and one of them a denominational birth is going to be give one day to these days at the World Council of churches which will produce the world to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms the World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son Antichrist so now there's been two impregnations of two different women one the denominational systems and one the bride of Christ the denominational system is going to bring forth what the Antichrist but he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ how will she come forth by spiritual multiplication by nurture in the Lord by bringing him up in the word amen which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one in Christ and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of the body and the two together makes one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so how do we bring bring forth the seed amen by spiritual multiplication by speaking the word and living the word then how do we nurture those children bring them up by the revealed word that's been restored in our hour by keeping the atmosphere in the church true to the word by surrendering all of our own ideas and that little seed one day will grow up to be another male lion this was another young one just coming into adolescence amen fathers this is what you're trying to do you're trying to reproduce yourself if there is another generation you want a son that can lead his family and serve God and raise his children in the fear nurturing ammonition of the Lord this this that young male lion one day is going to have to go make it on his own spoken words the original City he said that's what's the matter today you want you want some kind of a phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting for the real word of God to be made manifest through to the bride them kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen did you get it she can't die that child can't die because he's a word child he's a seed child he's an eternal child Hallelujah that's exactly what Jesus Christ was a spoken Eternal child what was Jesus he was a spoken word spoken where into the womb of the Virgin Mary he was a spoken word seed of God Adam was a spoken word seed of God but now brother bram's bringing it all the way back here and saying through spiritual multiplication they're becoming they're becoming a word child he's a seed child he's an eternal child amen by what by the word praise God who's our husband the revealed word who are we true to the word who do we live for the word who would he surrender to this word this little guy not so little anymore but he's going to have to go start his own family he's going to have to find luses that match what's inside of him so that he can do again what was done oh I say God help us to continue to do what he started in this earth Lord am then the family caught them as they wandered off the road and went walking away to do what what were they going off to do to keep the seed line coming forth to keep the seed of the male coming to keep it strong and healthy and fed and protected and what are we here for the exact same purpose we're here to manifest Christ we're here to preach the true word we're here here to bring forth Children of the word because a child that's brought forth on the word can't die it's a seed child it's an eternal child not hybridization but the true word that's been restored back into our hands in this generation it'll bring forth seed children of Christ I'd like to finish with this scripture Psalms 128 1-4 blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord that walketh in his ways for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house thy children like Olive plants round about the table behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord it's a principle of God it's a principle natural it's a principle spiritual you know what I want to be I want to be the bride that says be it unto me according to your word I really really don't want my own ideas you know what I'm trying to do every day is die out to myself I'm trying to let the word wash out every bit of wrong understanding I've picked up through science and education and church tradition because what I want to be is a bride that reflects the inside of Christ that's the bride that he's choosing I don't want my own ambition ition in this life Lord please help me get rid of ambition please help me get rid of want for anything except Christ amen listen it's a struggle friends because we're born hybrid and have a sticky cocko bur nature but that's my struggle my struggle is I want to get rid of self yes Lord so that I can be the right kind of bride that I can be submissive and yielded and I can be a help meet that Christ can use to manifest himself it's not what we can do we can't do anything any more than Mary could do it but he's promised that he would fulfill in this day all that was spoken in the Virgin Mary he's going to do the same thing today and he will come in the appointed time and he will fulfill his promise why because she believed amen the word Lord Lord I believe your word come and fulfill your word in me in this promised hour and use these lips to keep sewing the seed of the word to bring spiritual multiplication somewhere to your seed line God bless you friends let's stand amen praise be to God oh so many truths are revealed musicians if you'll come brother John if you'll come so many truths have been revealed to us the great mystery that was in God now all the pr preaching and the doctrines and the and the and the scoldings of the Prophet they all make sense they all now we're understand why why submission why humility why was he preaching on a woman's place and I mean he would say such harsh things that when a woman gets out of the kitchen she's out of her place I mean it seems so harsh why was he talking about how degradating it was to have women on the police force in a certain city taking a man's job taking a man's Place why was he screaming against the fashions that that that would bring a woman to look like or dress like a man in any way why was he screaming about the haircuts why what was he screaming about he was trying to show us amen that what's happening naturally is happening spiritually that it's not right according to the word it's not about checking a check boox I'm submissed to my husband it's about living the word it's about fleshing out the role of the Bride it's not about a man just taking leadership so I can say I took leadership in my home and you know I I I worked hard for them and I and I won bread no it's it's about fulfilling the word in your home amen now this whole thing what the prophet taught us was right it wasn't right for 1950 19 it was right for the bride it was right for the word it was right for those who were progeny of the word it was right for those who were going to flesh out and live the word and manifest the word it was right for the word it wasn't right for a generation what he says about marriage and marriage and divorce and interracial marriage and what he says about a role of a wife and a role of a woman and dress and conduct it was right because it was right in line with the theme of the whole word it wasn't right for his day it was right for the bride if I'm part of the Bride it's still right for my day why cuz I don't want to take my own idea and my own thought and I don't want to be the kind of woman that when dad's not looking says it's okay I understand I understand I was born in flesh too I understand I got a C ber I understand but what I understand more is the only right way is the word way and that's our headship and we're staying with the word amen let's bow our heads and pray together there Heavenly Father we thank you Lord cuz you are so amazing you're word runs so deep Lord deeper than we ever imagined what we saw Lord as Commandments or maybe Corrections it was actually your mind it was your desire it was actually you wanting to be fleshed out God and we're so sorry Lord for what we've done with the word we're so sorry Lord for the way we've rejected what you've brought us through a prophet we're so sorry for the excuse es we've made and the compromises I'm sorry Lord sorry for questioning Lord I I truly was ignorant Lord and I didn't understand but oh God as you rub the eyes saav and our eyes were beginning to see like we've never seen before this goes so much deeper than we thought God this wasn't a prophet who was born in a different age crying out against modernism that wasn't it it was your voice calling your bride into action to be your reflection on this Earth it was you Lord sharing what was inside of you to see if there was a woman that would match your inside Parts it was you looking for yourself and a bride God forgive us forgive Lord us as ministers for taking and using Force harshness criticism to try to force conduct for that was never your desire Lord forgive us Lord for those attitudes God just help us to shine the light of the truth on the word and let your bride come to it Lord God we know it's not for everyone it's only for your chosen elected predestinated seed God help us not to try to bring confirmation or Reformation but help us as your ministers just to preach the truth and let the truth have effect in the lives of your people God let your seed come to that word let them be born by let them grow in it let it come to your likeness by it let it wash us Lord by the washing of the bleeding word and bring us into the stature of the image of you God help us to handle your word correctly and no longer handle it like children but help us to handle it Lord like your bride bring life Lord through the word and bring a reflection of yourself in this end time for this is the bride age the time when you're going to be manifest in Bride form God we have no power to bring about that manifestation in our strength but Lord all we can say is I believe your word I surrender to it I give my whole life to it Lord now come and fulfill your promise for this hour where you said I will restore let the four stage of Life come and bring us to be a living marching Mighty Army a bride in full display a fruit tree bearing all your fruit help us father bless every natural father every dad and every mom that's here may they strive to be this word made flesh as a dad and as a mom may every child strive to be under the leadership of their father and mother may we as a church Church strive to be under the headship of your word may we each one strive to fulfill our role in this word as we display to the world this Living Word not words that we just speak not words that we just talk about not words that are on paper on tape but the Living Word that's living in us as moms and dads and teenagers and children and widows and widowers and ministers in a congregation Let It Be Your word made flesh in us all that you desired may it come come to life in our flesh we love you father we ask you would bless us help us encourage us strengthen us may your spirit live through us as we yield to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen man just before we sing I'd like to say you know the message sometimes is rough it's raw it's straight it's honest yes talks about like I said the degradation of society when women entering the workforce wearing pants cutting their hair wearing makeup wearing uh uh scant being scantily clad and the fashions that were taking place in the 60s it was all screamed about and screamed about in a harsh way and it was said straight and it was said bold and it was said without apologies he screaming against denominations and against taking your own idea and against false doctrines and I mean just blasting it and if I had it to say and had use my own nature and I would probably try to soften it and I would probably I would probably try to doctor it up and that's why God didn't use me for that job amen cuz I would have [Music] failed but what was God doing he was looking for a bride that would reflect what was inside of him am what was he what kind of bride did he want he wanted a bride that would hear Brother bham scream out that if you dress yourself that way and cause a man to commit uh uh uh adultery in his mind with you then you're going to stand at the Judgment with you and be guilty of adultery he's looking for somebody to say forgive me God I'm sorry not say how dare he say that it was not my fault it was that man's fault cuz what was he looking for he was looking for somebody that reflected what was inside of him he would scream out about women becoming more masculine and taking on masculine roles in society and he wasn't looking for somebody to said well I have to I have to make ends me and I have to and this is a different age he wasn't looking for that he was looking for somebody to say I'm sorry Lord I didn't understand if that's what you want I'm going back home I'm changing my dress I'm changing my attitude I let my hair grow what's he looking for he screaming it out straight and bold through the mouth of a prophet why he's looking for his counterpart he's looking for the one that will surrender to the word not argue with it debate about it make excuses try to find loopholes or workarounds he's not looking for that kind of bride he's looking for a bride who will see a Vindicated Prophet who is the mouthpiece of God screaming against modernization and he was looking for somebody to say I'll take that as the truth I'll take that as from the Lord and I'll surrender and submit to it how a church should be conducted they'll say that's not the way I was raised but that's the truth and I'll take it that way that's why there's no apologies for the message being straight and bold and honest and true it was the very voice of God in our day what was he doing he was calling for a bride to come forth to come out of the filth to come out of the world Amen the one one who has the capacity to be like him what was it mean to be like him to only do that which my father shows me only what pleases the father is the only thing he'll do and he's looking for a bride who will take the same nature only what pleases my God is what I'll do if it's more pleasing for him that I do this versus that then I'll do what's more pleasing to him no apologies for the harshness of the message I won't apologize for it it was the voice of God no apology for the straightness no apologies it was needed to call out a bride the one who can say it's not the way I learned it and I don't always understand it but I'll surrender to that that's the ones he'll marry that's the ones that he'll impregnate that's the one that he'll entrust with his word to bring spiritual multiplication that's what he's looking for we don't need to make excuses for the message or the messenger what we need to do is say Lord be it unto me according to your word make me the reflection of what's on the inside of you listen young Brothers when you're looking for a wife look for the one that reflects what's inside of you you know I was talking the other day with my wife I think yesterday we're so different in so many ways she has different ways of handling situations different ways of reacting and I do it's like how can she be the reflection of me if we're so different but the reality is she's the feminine of me she is what is in me but that I can't produce on the outside of me but but I love it when it's produced in her amen she's the Fulfillment of me she's the completion of me she's the expression that I can't express in male but she can express in the gentleness and daintiness and femininity of a woman the nurturing and the caring and the tenderness that I as a man cannot seem to express but it's in me I love it I appreciate it I want it amen but God gave me a male expression but he gave me a female expression in my wife cuz the two have become one fles so don't look for your copy look for your reflection look for the girl amen who takes what's in your heart and makes it live the part that you can't she can't because Jesus Christ left a portion of his word that he didn't fulfill in his day he left a portion to be fulfilled in and through the bride the portion he didn't do which is bride form now he's doing in his reflection the bride form God Amen the natural types to spiritual if we just follow the truth of this message it'll guide us in every facet of Our Lives if we can just surrender and let the message be the truth truth yes stop fighting it or making just let it be true it'll change your whole life it'll bring forth the Life of Christ amen God
