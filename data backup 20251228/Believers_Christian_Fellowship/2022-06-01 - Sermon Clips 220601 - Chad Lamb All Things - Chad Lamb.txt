========================================

now there is an angel but this angel to the lord that are encamped about those that fear them that fears him now it isn't promised that sinners has angels so we're talking about a different kind of angel amen they're not that sinners doesn't have angels it's only the redeemed has angels did you know that the angels of the lord and camp about those that fear him now angels are messengers i want you to notice it's so perfect and it'll prove predestination to you the fact that only the redeemed have angels proves predestination to you and these little ones of the kingdom are their angel always beholds the father's face so there's a receiver inside of the believer a sea gene of god amen in the soul to receive revelation amen and when you received the revelation that this was eagle's food and left the others you heard from your theophany so there's a representation of you somewhere that can see the father's face which means with that representation there is nothing hidden amen there's nothing obscure there's nothing hidden that representation can see the father's face and if the father's faith is unveiled to that angel amen praise be to god brother branham said now he says and angels are messengers what message are they carrying and to who amen because the angels are messengers amen are you receiving any messages amen is there any revelation coming on this revealed word in the end time praise be to god amen we have representation in heaven [Music] and i'm so glad there's a mystical channel somewhere that something could come rolling down from the unseen world and landing here just like the woman at the well amen she didn't she didn't have to go to school she didn't have to do any experimentation amen she's standing there talking to the man began to receive something was moving inside of her at this visitation and she began to receive the word and brother branham said because she had representation in heaven [Music] and i just say thanks be to god that there's ears somewhere that can hear amen there's eyes somewhere that can see amen i need more than these ears and i need more than these eyes i need something a little deeper because many people have heard many people have seen and still not believed but oh god thank god for eyes and ears that can hear and see
