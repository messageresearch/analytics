by way of prayer lord once again as we would come to this juncture of the service father to where we would make that step lord from the things that we can do to the things that we cannot do father for we've by your grace and your mercy you've given us strength to get out of bed and get in our vehicles and assemble ourselves here together lord and we've came and we've sang the songs of zion and we have worshiped you by praises father but now we come to the point to where the bread must be broken lord and we know lord that there is not a man capable to do this lord even though we would want to or would try to and do all that we could father only the lamb can take the book and loose the seals so father we would just commit ourselves to you both speaker and here here this morning and we would ask that you would come and take the uppermost seat lord and have preeminence and come and do only that which you can do lord that your divine purpose for this service will be fulfilled here this morning we commit ourselves to you and love you in the name of the lord jesus christ we would pray the bride says amen god bless you this morning it's a very fitting song for the scripture that i want to read here this morning so if you'll take your bibles and turn to john 3 and 16 i would like to start there as you're turning i have a whole list of disclaimers that i have to give you before i preach this service but the first thing i want to tell you is god does love you and i love you and the third disclaimer most importantly is you're not allowed to get up and walk out and you're not allowed to throw things at me when i tell you what my title is so i want to preach this morning on god don't care and i know that may sound a little offensive and uh probably different than you've ever heard john 3 16 preached before but it is what it is and i asked the lord for a couple weeks to give me a different title but he just told me he didn't care so i'm kind of stuck with it but there's a spiritual principle laying underneath of that phrase god don't care and i think if you'll be patient with me and just give me a little bit of grace this morning that once we get to the end of this you're going to see a principle that will help us this morning and this is not targeted against anybody it's i'm not mad about anything this is actually something that god has been dealing with me uh for probably six or seven years now this thought has been stuck in my mind and then for about the last year and a half it uh really has been stirring within me and here we are now that i finally get to preach it so it's uh it's not something that happened last week i'm upset about like i with god as my witness i have no knowledge of any situation that i'm going to preach about this morning so if god hits you it's god hitting you it's not it's not me um and if god is dealing with us then we'll just allow him to deal with us as he sees fit but let's read this scripture and brother franco if you wouldn't care to do the lights like you did the last time that would really help me thank you um john 3 16 very common we all knew this but let's read this it says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and if you'll turn now to revelation 13. revelation 13 and verse 8. revelation 13 and verse 8 says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world god bless you as you would have your seats this morning so as we had approached this topic of god don't care let's go back to the book of genesis and i think we can have a picture start forming to us of what we're trying to expound let's go back to genesis 3. genesis 3 and let's go to verse 1. it says now the serpent the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field god did not have to allow that serpent to be more subtle than any beast of the field god knew that that was the only seed that could cross with the seed of the woman but he allowed the serpent to be more subtle than any beast of the field so you might say that god did not care that the serpent was the smartest one out there even knowing that that was the only beast that could cross with the woman god still didn't care enough to make him a dumb one allowed him to be more subtle than any beast of the field and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto her unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant for the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat i think we would all agree that the omnipotent all-knowing all-powerful self-existing one elohim jehovah god almighty could have stopped this from happening he had created all things all heavens all earth he had created the beast of the field he had created the serpent he had created the woman i don't think we're so naive to think for a second that god couldn't have stopped this but god didn't care to stop it god didn't care to stop it because god had a plan and god had attributes and characteristics and expressions that he had to have this fall for so could he have stopped it sure he could have stopped it this is god almighty the creator of all things and when the woman saw that the tree was good for fruit food and that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be to to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and god did not care to stop her she gave also unto her husband with her i think once again we could agree that god could have stopped him this was a direct son of god god had created adam by his spoken word and he wasn't even deceived but still god did not stop him and did eaton gave also unto her husband with her and he did he brother branham said that even before the bible was formed the word of god was written in the heavens he said adam was not deceived because adam knew that a dishonorable woman should not be lived with even before the scripture was written that a dishonorable woman should not be lived with adam knew that because it was a principle of god and brother branham says the word of god was eternal the word of god was written even before it was formed and put into the pages of the bible so adam not being deceived walks out and does something against the word of god that god could have clearly stopped but god didn't care because god had a plan and god had to express himself let's continue to genesis 4. genesis 4 8 reads and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel and his brother and slew him once again i'm going to ask you the question could god have stopped this abel had just caught a divine revelation from god of how and when to worship god and he had performed this in so much that god was pleased with this and accepted a sacrifice and a few moments later god didn't care enough to keep him alive this is stunning to think about this you say why why abel had forsaken everything he'd forsaken his own mind forsaken his own ways forsaken his own family he had forsaken the story that his mom and dad had told him brother brandon said his mommy and daddy told him it was apples it was fruit forsaken everything caught a divine revelation from god acts upon it and god is so pleased he accepts that sacrifice rejects cain but then a few moments later will allow cain to slay his brother why why didn't god care because god had a plan and god had expressions that had to move forward let's skip to noah i won't make you turn there in your bible i think you're getting the point noah it receives instructions from god and he says that's fine i don't understand but i'll do it at your word and for a hundred and twenty years god did not care that noah got made fun of a hundred and twenty years i would say that's longer than any of us have been alive so longer than any of us have been alive noah would come and preach a message and get made fun of be called insane have brother bran says they threw stuff at him they threw rotten fruit at him for a hundred and twenty years god did not care and we get upset if we have a bad week or a bad day for a hundred and twenty years god did not care to intervene and make them stop making fun of his prophet make them stop throwing stuff at his prophet 120 years is a long time since to be made fun of and have rotten fruit thrown at you like if you're doing something you enjoy maybe that's not a long time you go to abraham let's turn to chapter 12. chapter 12 verse 1. now the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will show you i dares to say that abraham loved his father loved his land loved his kindred and god did not care he said get out leave all that you love i don't care i have a plan i have attributes and characteristics that i'm going to express get out he did not ask abraham how that made him feel he didn't ask him if he liked it he didn't even ask him if he was agreeable to it god did not care he said get out skip over to genesis 13 verse 7. so abraham leaves like god told him we know there's a little hiccup he took a lot with him but we come to 13 7 it says and there was strife between the herdsmen of abram's cattle and the herdsmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land abraham has forsaken his family he's forsaken his country he's forsaken his land he's on his way to where god has told him to go and god don't even care enough to keep a family feud from happening because god had told him to leave everything and abraham dearly loved a lot but god didn't care so he says that's fine you've compromised with my word you've brought your nephew with you i'll allow the church to split god didn't care about the church split god said get out and he didn't care about anything else he didn't care about abraham's feelings he didn't care about lots feeling there was i don't know how many of hundreds of people involved in this situation and the only thing god cared about was he had told abraham to separate yourself and get out so god didn't care about the family feud he didn't care about the church split we move farther into the story and sarah comes up with this genius idea to have the baby brought forth by hagar and god don't even care enough to stop it because god was going to express what happens when you compromise with the promise i've made you and here we would be thousands and thousands and thousands of years later and he's laid this in the scripture for us to remember when we put our hand to a promise of god and we try to make it happen and we try to use our will and our ideas this is the result ishmael a wild man brother branham said unregenerable meaning he cannot be born again his hand the scripture says would constantly be against his brother do we think for an instant god could not have allowed that to not happen he was speaking to abraham on a daily basis he could have simply said don't do that but god didn't care enough to keep it from happening when we look at these situations and know that god could have prevented this but didn't then we have to ask ourselves why and in the why is how we will come to understand as much as our feeble minds will allow us to understand what god is trying to do so sarah deviates from the word hagar produces ishmael [Music] and god shows what interjecting man's ident to his promise does we move farther in genesis we come to jacob and esau i got one question for you when we look at jacob how much trouble would have would god have saved if he would have just let jacob been before born before esau just that one thing just that one little deviation just allow jacob to be born before esau and like we don't even talk about jacob jacob's got no problems he's first in line for the birthright he does not have to do everything that's written in the scripture about him and all his shenanigans and deceit like that's gone just let him come out first do we think for a second that god could not have allowed jacob to be born first but he didn't so because he didn't and all of this falls apart we have to ask ourselves why why why did god not care he remember he says before you were formed in the womb jacob have i loved and esau have i hated but he still didn't care enough to let jacob be born first god didn't care everything that's written in there about jacob jacob would lie to his prophet daddy and would have would take sheepskins and put it on his arms all the trouble and the effort that he would go through all of this could have been simply diverted by allowing him to be born first look at joseph god loved joseph he was born a special person and god so endowed him with spiritual gifts to where it was marvelous and the things that he would see and prophesy was incredible but god would pour all of these gifts and this love and this anointing on joseph but he wouldn't give him enough sense to keep his mouth shut about it he would give him eve all of these gifts and all of these visions but he didn't care enough to tell him by the way you might want to keep your mouth quiet about that so now he would come and he would start expounding these things to his brothers and to his parents and they throw him in a pit act like he's dead sell them into slavery send them to egypt and all of that could have been avoided had god cared enough to say just keep that part about them bowing down before you to yourself son that's just for me and you but it begs the question why god would do all of this but yet he wouldn't allow him enough sense you might not want to tell him that part of the story it's of god it will come to pass but just leave that part alone he comes to moses moses is born to deliver he's predestinated of god to fulfill this plan moses is in the mind of god he's an attribute of god he's coming to deliver god's people but god don't even care enough that a few years before he's born he allows the king to issue this decree that all the man child hebrew that are born they're going to be killed he sets him up for failure to begin with this is unusual is it not how simple it would have been for god to have withheld that king's order until moses is born he's grown but god had a plan and god had to express certain things so he allows this king to declare just prior to moses being born all the hebrew man shall kill him throw him in the river so we see god supernaturally intervene and he spares moses he raises him up in pharaoh's house and just when it looks like oh now i see what you did lord now i understand you slipped him in to destroy from within now i've got it now i see right before this transpires god doesn't care enough and he lets moses lose his temper and slay an egyptian completely ruins everything that he had just put together so he comes to the pinnacle comes to the position god's called him to and god don't even care enough to keep him there lets it all fall apart lets him lose his temper murder a man and be run out of the country he comes back down to egypt after he's been on the backside of the desert for 40 years he's now in position he's now ready his character has been formed he's been back there with his lovely wife molding him and god has him prepared now he tells him this is what i want you to do these are the signs go and do it moses says i'll go walks down before pharaoh gives his message they resist his message he says that's fine i got one for you throws his stick down that'll teach you see god is with me and god doesn't even care enough to keep the from being impersonators there and they throw their stick down and do the exact same thing that moses did you would think after everything moses had went through up to this point that god would at least care once he's got there and given his message he would make sure everything goes smooth but god don't care god allows there to be impersonators there janice and jambruce does everything moses can do see he had showed moses and he had told moses this is what i want you to do and this is what i'll do but he never told moses everything see we have got to come to terms with the fact god is not obligated to tell us everything the sooner we come to terms with that and the sooner that we're able to operate and walk in that the better off we're going to be so moses fortunately was so broken by this time due to his relations with his lovely wife that he says i don't know what to do i've done what he told me to do and here they are and they do everything that i can do i guess i'll just do what i do when i get in and argue with my argument with my wife and i'll just stand here and be quiet and it worked it worked god supernaturally moves on the scene moses is rod or a serpent at that time swallows up the other serpents moses takes it back up but god did not care enough to keep moses from that uncomfortable situation you look at naomi naomi god did not care enough about naomi to keep her from leaving the promised land she had made a decision i'm going to go and do this there's no food here i'm going to break the word and i'm going to go outside of the promised land and try and get some food and god did not care enough to keep her this is naomi the friend of ruth who god was going to use to bring boaz on the scene and express one of the most beautiful pictures of redemption in the entire bible and the written word that we have now but we have all of that because god did not care about naomi he did not care enough about naomi to keep her in the promised land he let her go she lost everything saints she left with her husband her uh son-in-law and her sons and her daughter-in-law and she came back with ruth she lost everything and god for the sake of me and you to have that story in the bible didn't care enough about her to keep it from happening you go to david there's a list with david there's a list he comes and he anoints him king over israel but he don't even care enough to keep saul from trying to kill him i mean david's already got it rough enough i would think he's the littlest he's the ruddy fella his own daddy don't even want him to be king yet god supernaturally moves on the scene and anoints him but he doesn't care enough to keep saul from trying to kill him he never told david that portion he just said i'm anointing you king oh by the way saul is going to hate you and try to kill you every day for the next however many years he never told him that david comes to the pinnacle he's king the people love him he's in position to move israel forward and god rips the kingdom from his hands sends them out he's getting spit upon cursed rips it from his hands because god has got to express the portion of a rejected king to prepare the people for when he comes in the form of jesus christ god does not care enough about david to keep the kingdom from being ripped from him even after everything he's went through to get to that point he doesn't care enough to keep him from numbering the people we we acknowledge the fact that god could have kept all of these people from all of these things right but he doesn't but he doesn't he allows him to number the people and bring a curse upon the country he allows him to commit adultery and have an innocent man murdered just to fulfill his lustful passions that he can't keep in control god allows that totally preventable but god allows it you go to samson god has anointed samson from a baby to destroy philistines but he don't care enough to keep him from this one woman everything that he did in samson's life but he don't care enough to keep him from this one woman why why does he not care because god wanted me and you to know the results of not giving our heart completely to him no matter what anointing no matter how much he touches us no matter how many supernatural things he does in his life he says remember samson and he did not care enough about samson because he cared about me and you enough to make us aware to write it in the scripture this is what happens when you fail to give just a small portion of your heart to me amen look at job let's turn to job just about took off preaching there so i got to slow down i'm not not quite ready to preach yet i still want to teach a couple things but i'm fixing to we'll read in job soon as i can get to job let's go to job one and six yeah job one verse 6. now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down to it and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job oh thanks thanks i give you thanks for all you've done lord i was been a good boy i was doing all that you commanded me to do i was covering for my children i was doing everything right and job's not even lying like if we have to say that then it may or may not be true but job's not lying he had the he had the proof i have been a good boy i am doing everything right and you don't care enough about me just to leave me alone you've got to bring me up before satan why why god could have picked anybody i assure you there were a lot of people doing a lot of things wrong that deserved satan's attention in that day but the one man who doesn't god don't care enough about him to keep satan from him go to job 2. and as if that wasn't bad enough he told satan you can touch everything but don't touch him if that wasn't bad enough god didn't care we go to chapter 2 and he says again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also amongst them to present himself before the lord and the lord said unto satan from whence cometh thou when satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job mercy goodness i'm sure job is at the point he's asking the question god why do you not care about me i am doing everything you've told me to do i am doing everything for my children you've told them to do just in case they don't do it i am doing everything right i have been a good boy i'm all i've already lost my children i've already lost houses and lands and sheep i've lost everything but myself and now he gives satan permission to touch his body god did not care how job felt because god had things he needed to express god allowed everything to come job's way except for death i want to move on to the next one and this is the one that god started dealing with me five or six years ago jonah god speaks directly to jonah tells him something to do jonah goes and gets on the wrong ship we assume it's because he's backsliding how do you know don't maybe he just read his ticket wrong that day and got on the wrong ship like maybe the ship was at the wrong port i don't know we assumed that he backslid on god brother branham said that he's always stood up for jonah that he wasn't backslidden that he was in the will of god how do we know that there wasn't a typo on his ticket how do we know that the ship hadn't parked in the wrong port but what we do know is there came a point in time that jonah recognized i'm on the wrong ship and in order for these people on this ship to be spared bind me hand and foot and throw me overboard why why this is god's prophet why would god let's just say he did backslide why would god allow him to backslide let's say he didn't backslide and he just got on the wrong ship why would god allow him to get on the wrong ship why would god allow the storm to come he's the master of the winds jonah says bind me hand and foot and throw me over i'm quite certain that at that point in time in jonah's life he was not sitting there whistling a tune how great thou art and thinking i am getting ready to express the very life of christ to be bound nailed to a cross be in the grave for three days and resurrected i'm quite positive that is not what was going through jonah's mind i'm pretty certain what was going through jonah's mind was god why do you not care about me but god allow it and that's bad like being tied hand in foot and thrown off a boat in the middle of a stormy sea this is not good this is bad how many wants to sign up for that how many wants to sign up to be i don't even want to be hogtied number one let alone thrown in the water hog todd let alone to be swallowed by a fish and spend three days in the fish's belly in seaweed this is bad and god don't care but as bad as that is i've got one worse for you jonah the prophet of god has now had to spend the last i don't know how many thousands of years being known as the backslidden prophet tommy handed foot throw me in the sea give me three days in this in the whale's belly in the fish's belly don't let me spend thousands of years being known as the one to backslid on god but god didn't care it's stunning to think that god did not care enough about jonah's well-being to keep him from being bound hand and foot and thrown into the sea to be swallowed by a fish to spend three days in a in a fish's belly to be resurrected vomited up onto the beach god did not care i do not find any portion in the scripture to where he came and he said jonah how you feeling today do you concur with this plan that i have do you like this are you happy because god knows there is people in nineveh that will repent if i do something a certain way and there is no record in the scripture to where he said excuse me my prophet jonah these people over here will repent if i do things this way would you like to do that because jonah's answer would have been no just like mine and your answers would have been no that's why god didn't care god did not care what jonah felt thought or even if he concurred with it and like i said that portion is bad enough but now if you come and you ask jonah you get on the wrong ship and a storm comes you'll be bound hand and foot thrown into the sea and i will spare the rest of the lives on that ship are you willing to do that maybe what happens to me after i'm thrown in the sea what if i tell you that all of the men on that ship will be converted if i do that now he's got jonah's attention you tell me one other way that the men on that ship read the scriptures they were converted saints they bound him hand and foot they threw him into the sea and the next portion of the scripture the storm ceases and they says jonah's god is our god you tell me one other way that that that shipload of men was going to be converted you tell me but god never told jonah that and he never asked joan if he agreed with that but back to the first phase of that god tells him just say pre-adventure god tells him all of this and he tells him you'll go through all of that the men on the ship will be converted nineveh will repent in sackcloth and ashes and i will save an entire nation are you willing to do this maybe he's got his attention now he knows i'm going to survive the sea i'm going to survive the wealth it's about the fish's belly god's going to save the men on the ship god's going to save this entire country like it's starting to even out here but jonah after you do all of that i'm going to give you the reputation of a backslidden prophet for thousands and thousands and thousands of years god did not care about jonah's reputation to this day god does not care about jonah's reputation what god cared about was jonah doing what he told him to do and what he cared about more than he cared about jonah's reputation and jonah's comfort and well-being what he cared about was the men on that ship and was the the people in nineveh because god knows there is only one way to get to these men on the ship and there is only one way for this country of nineveh to repent look at all of the things that god did not care about about a just and righteous man this was not an this was not a sinner this was not a bad person this was god's prophet and look at all the things that god did not care about you say why i'll tell you why because god does not truly care about anything that does not have an eternal quality joseph jonah's comfort does not have an eternal quality to it i hate to pop your bubble but yours doesn't either mine doesn't either i'm not even god's prophet jonah is what jonah was and his comfort was not relevant to god's plan god did not care and does not care about anything that does not have an eternal element i'll say it this way so you don't get mad at me anything anything that god truly cares about has an eternal element to it i would be a fool to stand here and tell you that god does not care about every aspect of your life because we know he does every aspect saints we know he cares about us god cares about us so much he cares about things we don't even know about yet god cares about us saints it's just a title to catch your attention to make you think and because god wouldn't give me another one god cares but we better come to terms with what he cares about truly because there's rough roads coming saints there is rough roads coming i know that may not be popular to preach but i'm going to preach it anyhow we have not seen it yet there are rough roads coming and we had better be comfortable with the fact that god does not care about our comfort he does not even care about you say we are the bride of jesus christ he will protect my reputation no he will not i'm just telling you he's not going through saints if he cares to protect your reputation he will protect your reputation if protecting your reputation serves his purpose he will protect your reputation but what if allowing your reputation to go down the tubes serves his purpose you say that would net i bring to you exhibit a jonah god does not care about your reputation he does not care about my reputation unless he needs to preserve that reputation for his plan god does not care about your health he does not care about your financial status he does not care about your house he does not care about your relationships he does not care about your sons your daughters he does not care about anything as much as he cares about expressing himself getting the preeminence and redemption that is what was in the back part of his mind and that is what everything else is subject to does he care about your health oh my goodness yes he cares about your health how many times has he touched us in our health does he care about our well-being the angels of god are encamped about us as we would go up and down the road saints we we come driving down the road and are almost in an accident in a crash until we realize god cares about us and he prevented that what we fail to recognize is the hundred that we never even recognize that he kept us from that's how that's how much he cares as i said he cares about things you don't even know about there were 200 million demons loosed upon who the bride do you think you left your house and came to this assembly this morning and you didn't pass at least one or two of them and you didn't even know it but god so intimately cares about us that he knew about it and he cared and he prevented whatever maliciousness that they had planned from raising its head saints he cares he cares more than we can ever imagine but remember in the back part of his mind he had a plan and everything that he cares about has to be subject to that plan because that is what he truly cares about to express himself to get the preeminence and redemption he will forsake caring about everything else before he forsakes caring about that jonah is the one that astounded me most because we spend i'm just preaching to myself now saints i'm not preaching to anybody else we spend so much time and effort and energy trying to keep our own reputation and i'm not saying that's wrong like we should care about our reputation we should i'm not telling you not to care about your reputation but if you think and i think for a second that we can keep our reputation we are sadly sadly mistaken even the scripture says unless god keeps the city the watchman watcheth in vain if we will acknowledge the fact that god cares about things that we don't even know about and prevents them from coming our way that in and of itself should make us realize we have no capability to keep our own reputation because we don't know what's coming next how do we prepare to save my reputation from what we don't even know is coming next and we also have to realize that there are multitudes and multitudes and multitudes of examples in the scripture of where god did not tell everybody the whole story so he'll tell you the beginning of the story and you'll get a picture in your mind and fill in the rest of the story and take off running and then the story's not like what you thought it was and now you have no way to preserve your story that you made up or your reputation or your well-being or your comfort or your health or your financial status or your housing status because god told you a little blip of the story and then you filled in the rest of the story that is not god's fault that's your fault that's my fault that was joseph's fault that was jonah's fault that was all of these other people's fault that he told them a part of the story and they filled in the rest of the story and then they're standing there thinking why don't you care about me what they should really say is why don't you care about my version of your story god don't care about your version of his story he cares about his story and here is his story expressing himself getting the preeminence and redemption that's what god cares about daniel this was a man so righteous that he prayed three times every day so that the public would see him god didn't even care enough to keep him from getting thrown in the lion's pit the three hebrew children men three hebrew men i don't care what scheme you come up with i don't care what you do we are going to keep the word of god like if there's anything to make god care about you and build a hedge about you and keep you i don't know what else there would be i am giving my entire life to god and to keep his word i don't care what you do to me i'm going to keep the word of god i don't care if throw them in a fiery furnace god did not care enough to keep them from the fiery furnace saints he didn't even care enough to keep them on the steps of it he made them walk all the way up the plank and get thrown in the fiery furnace before he came on the scene could he not have came on the scene prior to that could he not could he not he was he's almighty god he can come on the scene whenever he wants but they had already made the declaration he's able to spare us but i don't care whether he does or not we will not deviate from the word of god god says wow that's impressive i wonder if they really mean it so here they go billy boppin up the ramp the guards start falling over dead no retraction this is not a story saints remember they get to the top and the guards are dead i'm not the sharpest horn in the shed but maybe you turn around and go back this way no saints they went in on their own accord and said whether he'll deliver us or not i don't know but he's able and if he does it we will still not deviate away from the word and god did not care in fact he gave them every out possible he gave them every opportunity to not put him to the test and they didn't take the easy way out they went in and then i'll ask you the question did god care did god care oh he cared saints he cared don't think for a second that he wasn't on his way the minute that he saw them going up the plank don't think for a second that he had not already left and was on his way he was on his way saints of god this was his children but god had to express himself and god had to have the preeminence which he got at the top of the plank and now god has to redeem this fallen nation and you tell me how is he going to redeem this fallen nation if these children don't go through on his word and he shows up as the fourth man in the fire to where the king would look and he'd say you better count them again something's wrong here numbers are off and the nation is converted by three men totally sold out to god who god didn't even care about their comfort or not let's look at jesus let's turn to isaiah isaiah 53. and before we read isaiah 53 i'm going to quote john 3 16 to you again for god for god so loved the world for god so loved the world that he did not care about his only begotten son you say that's not what it says that is what it says you say well how can you say that because god so loved the world if he was willing to give his son for the world that means he cared more about the world than he did his son if you take a dollar out of your wallet and you go and you give that dollar for something that means you cared more for that something than you did for that dollar or else you would have never taken the dollar out of your pocket god so loved you and me that he didn't even care about his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life isaiah 53 who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant why can't he be a strong tree why does he have to be a tender plant this is god's son a tender plant as a root out of dry ground this is god's son why can't he be well watered he hath no form or comeliness this is god's son why can he not be attractive and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him this is god's son why no beauty why does not why does god not care enough to make his own son beautiful god did not care enough to keep him from being despised rejected of men god did not care he let him be a man of sorrows god did not care he allowed him to be acquainted with grief god did not care enough that even when he would put him through all of that we would hide our faces as it was from him he would allow him to be despised he esteemed him not god did not care he surely bore our griefs he carried our sorrows we did esteem him stricken smitten of god smitten of god and afflicted and god did not care verse 5 he was wounded for our transgressions and god did not care could god have stopped that brother branham says the trees were lined with angels one twitch of his finger and this show was over and god did not care to stop it he was wounded for our transgression god did not care enough he allowed him to be bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and god did not care god did not care and so much he allowed the entire iniquity of the whole world to be laid upon him his stripes for our healing got allowed to happen god allowed it he did not care to stop it he was oppressed and god did not care he was afflicted and god did not care he opened up his mouth not open not his mouth he would god would put him through all of this he would allow all of this transpire and just at the point in time to where he would maybe want to raise his head and say father stop he says hush i don't care i don't care this is my will this is my plan i wonder saints just at that moment when he had enough remember he was 100 man he was 100 god i wonder just at that point in time when all of this is laid upon him i wonder if maybe he wanted to say something i wonder just when he was right about to raise up and said father i wanted to but i can't i wanted to but i can't i wonder just prior to that if god the father looked down and he would say hush hush i care about benjamin sibo more than i care about you right now god did not care saints he allowed this to happen and i ask you the question why there is only one reason why he would allow this to happen remember this is not me and you this is the only begotten son of god that god turned his face as it was from him why for the sake of me and you for the sake of expressing himself for gaining preeminence in a man and redeeming me and you yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as sheep before his sheer as his dumb he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison god did not care and from judgment and god did not care who shall declare his generation uh oh 90 degree turn because up to this point at statements this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened this is what god has allowed this is what god has allowed and there is no part of god caring about this but now god cares about something because he's asking a question i have allowed all of this did he care saints oh my goodness the earth trembled he cared so much the sun hit its face he cared so much the whole cosmos fell apart he cared so much he cared but he didn't care as much as he did about me and you and about this purpose that was being served but now now he goes through this list of everything that he allowed to happen and now he mentions something he cares about i have allowed all of this to happen who will declare this man's generation now god truly cares about something because this is the eternal value of everything that he has just allowed now god reveals to us what he truly cares about what god truly cares about who will declare his generation i have allowed all of this to happen read through that when you go home nothing is good up until this point everything is bad everything is uncomfortable he is stripped naked he is whipped beyond recognition he has run a spear through his side and god did not care as much as he wants as he did about who it is going to declare this man's generation you would think after going through this the question would be and who will stop this who will intervene who will make this go away but it's not it's who will declare this man's generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he hath done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him it pleased the lord to bruise him it pleased the lord to bruise him saints god was not happy to bruise him he was not enjoying the bruising he took no pleasure out of the bruising but it was pleasing to him you say that makes absolutely no sense you're right it does not make any sense whatsoever unless you catch the revelation that what he was pleased by was the effects of the bruising because the effects of the bruising was allowing him to express the attribute of being a savior and it was allowing him to gain preeminence in a man and the effects of the bruising that he was pleased by was the redemption process that was going on did god care about the bruising yes he cared about the bruising saints but he did not care as much about the bruising as he did about what that bruising was going to purchase this should make us walk humbly just i mean this is the gospel 101 saints this is the raw baseline elementary gospel this should make us walk humble every day of our life god cared more about my redemption than he did about his only begotten son if that does not leave you flabbergasted i don't have anything else to offer if that is not profound to you i've got nothing else to give this is not an innocent sheep this is not a animal this is not even a good person this is the only begotten son of god that god gave for your redemption he cared more about you than he did about his only begotten son i'm here to tell you saints i love each and every one of you and there's some of you i'm not going to say all because i would really have to analyze it if i said all but i'm going to say most of you i would give my life for hey i'm just being real i'm just being real maybe not the most gracious but i'm just being real some of you i need to talk with a little bit more before i'm going to say that but most of you i know you and i know your character and i would give my life for you if it came push to shove i would but as much as i love you and as much as i would do that don't ask me to give william for you or seth or banaya i'll give myself don't ask me to give one of my boys not going to happen now think about what god did for you you parents you know what that means i'll give myself i will give myself but don't ask for one of my sons but god allowed all of this to take place to his son for you and in so much and don't ask me to explain this because i can't but i believe it but insomuch we know that this wasn't just god's son it was his son because it came out of god but this was god's son his only begotten son and this was god himself so he gave himself and his only begotten son and we would get puffed up because we know a little bit of doctrine and we know who the seventh angel is and we know what the seals mean and the thunders and the church ages lord have mercy on us [Music] have you given yourself have you given your only begotten son for this gospel we should be humble every day of our life take that into context and realize god did not hold out anything he did not care about anything more than he cared about you and me he literally gave everything because he cared about me and you we and thou shalt make his soul an offering when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors god allowed all of this and did not care in so much that as christ is hanging on the cross he declares this he says god why do you not care why do you not care why hast thou forsaken me if you've forsaken something you don't care about it anymore that's what he's asking what my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why do you not care about me anymore since we think we get lonely but i'm going to ask you this there has never been a person that was as lonely as christ jesus at this point in time when we get so lonely we can still rest and know that god cares about us he declares why do you not care about me anymore this was a man put in a position that heaven could not accept him heaven could not accept him because he is bearing sin and the iniquity and the transgressions and those 200 million million demons are all stuck on him and he's burying them all and heaven cannot accept him and he goes to hell and they don't even want him there you think you're alone i assure you as lonely as you hell will still want you this was a man that was so alone heaven could not accept him and hell didn't even want him that's lonely saints and god didn't care he allowed that to be laid upon him so that when me and you come to those points and times in our lives when we think we're alone we can never get to the point to say god my god why hast thou forsaken me there was one man that god ever turned his back on completely and that was his son and he only did that for mine and your sake do not ever accuse god of turning his back on you saints it's a slap in the face to what he did to his son god has never turned his back on you god will never turn his back on you he says heavens and earth will pass away my word will not pass away what is the word [Applause] brother brandon says what is the believer the words in the book heaven and earth will pass away my word will not pass away i will be with you i will be in you even until the ends of the earth i will never leave you i will never forsake you do not accuse god of forsaking you no matter what little imp of hell is sitting on your shoulder giving you depression and giving you anxiety and giving you loneliness that is a demon that is a lie of the devil one man god turned his back on and that was only for the sake of me and you heaven couldn't take him and hell didn't want him he goes to hell and they kicked him out they said get out of here don't come and torment us get out get out go back wherever you came from you say why would god allow all of this why would god go so far as not to care about his only begotten son let's turn to revelation 5. revelation 5 god did not care about anything else as much as he cared about revelation 5. brother branham says the most sublime portion of scripture in the bible if it's the most sublime portion of scripture in the bible i'm going to venture to say this is what god cares most about and everything else he does not care as much about even though he cares about it he cares saints nobody can leave here this morning and say brother ben told me god don't care i did but i'm telling you he does care about everything but he don't care about everything as much as he cares about revelation 5. revelation 5 verse 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain that's the portion of scripture that we just spent a half an hour on isaiah 53. so when it says as a lamb slain don't take that as just simple oh it was a lamb slain remember isaiah 53. as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and this is what god cared about this is all that god cared about because within this is the very essence and being an expression and character of god to express himself to have the preeminence and to bring redemption brother branham says all redemption hinged on this lamb taking the book john was weeping doesn't anybody care doesn't anybody care doesn't anybody care but there was one who cared saints more than anything in the world and remember this was not this was not a book saints this was not a book that was in his hand what is in his hand what is written in his hand what did jesus declare is in his hand me and you are in his hand i understand what i say when i say this i could take a lot of verses out of isaiah 53 and make it read this way god sent his only begotten son into the world and they did everything imaginable unto him because he cared about me and you being redeemed that is what isaiah 53 says that is what revelation 5 says because the lamb that was slaying the price for the book was a slain lamb remember what we said if you give a price for something that means that that price was you did not care about that price as much as you did about the something amen do we see the seals differently now do we see ourselves differently now do we understand what god is going to care about this is what he cares about the most sublime portion of scripture he did not care about anything as much as he cared about me and you saints and our redemption everything was secondary to that 1963 in a message called he cares do you care boy wouldn't that been a lovely title brother ram says jesus cared enough for the message of today jesus cared enough about the message for cared enough for the message of today to bring these same things to pass as he said till he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit jesus cared more about you hearing the truth than he did about the life of his only begotten son that is what the prophet said oh lord and we will leave it laying on a shelf and go to worldly entertainment and we even worse will listen to it and say that might be his opinion even worse will say i know brother branham said but let me read this to you again jesus also known as god cared enough for the message which i'll remind you came through one vessel brother branham of today to bring these same things to pass as he said as he said till he died he died he died for those tapes saints literally he died for those tapes and those books not for the plastic not for the paper but for the effects that they would have on your mind life he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit the comforter to show his ministry today that he's still alive he cared enough won't we care that's the thing won't we care he died for this ministry there it is point blank why did christ go to calvary you can say well he went for this he went for that he went for my healing he went for my he died for this ministry this ministry as defined by this prophet was two things to re return the faith of the fathers to the children and to preach the mysteries of the seven thunders which are the mysteries of the seven seals brother bran says that was his ministry christ went to calvary to restore your faith to the faith of the apostolic fathers and he went to calvary so that the seals could be loosed and you would know the spiritual principles that laid under those for your redemption to defeat to defeat satan brother branham says that is what he went to calvary for that is what he died for was there other things that he died for was there other things included in that absolutely but as pertaining to me and you here in this age and this day he died so that me and you could hear brother branham's voice and the effect that that voice would have on us that's what he died for there was a wise man that once said don't ever take this message lightly don't take it for granted saints what has been given into our hands the literal blood of jesus christ has been given into our hands the message the bleeding bloody word what god truly cared about he gave into our hands he died in order that the holy spirit could be here in this day to show these things he cared for you he cared to bring it here he cared to make the statement he cared because he loved you he cared enough to do it to send the holy spirit to do this to make this ministry today i remind you of revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him except for those who cared about amen whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world look at the disciples these were the disciples that forsake forsook everything and god didn't care enough about any of them except for john to make sure they weren't martyred after after after they had forsaken everything and given themselves completely to the word he still never kept him from being murdered he let peter be crucified upside down and didn't care even prophesied beforehand let stephen be stoned to death stephen a righteous man who had done nothing wrong living the word for his day god didn't care enough to keep him from being stoned to death you know why i'm going to tell you why because he cared more about paul than he did stephen brother brandon says paul never got over that affected him in so much that he wanted to be a martyr you tell me who god cared more about paul or stephen he cared about them both equally we know that but don't think for a second that he cared more about steven's well-being and his comfort than he did about the eternal effect that it would have on paul that's what he cared about in so much he would allow him to be stoned to death because he cared about paul and then he gets to paul and he allows him to be shipwrecked i don't know how many times allows him to be hungry allows them to be cold wet stoned left for dead beaten whipped this is his first church age messenger like if there's anybody he's going to care about you would think he would care about his first church age messenger god don't care even so much he told him beforehand i'm going to show you what things you must suffer for my name's sake so if god didn't care about stephen because he cared about paul and god didn't care about paul in so much as he cared about maybe me and you this is the first church age messenger and god would allow him to have all of these things transpired in his life for mine and your benefit he ended up getting his head cut off for the gospel saints the first church age messenger and we had a bad day at work somebody made fun of us one of our friends said something mean somebody didn't shake her hand i got a cold i got covered i got the monkey pox paul had his head cut off i was going to title this quit your whining but chad used that a couple of weeks ago so i can't type he took my title i've quit your whining i'm not preaching you that preaching to you i'm preaching to myself saints how silly we are how silly we are we know what the message says we know what the gospel says we believe it and then something in our life goes sideways and our immediate reaction is god do you not care about me paul had his head cut off we are not a church-age messenger like this is the first church age messenger if anybody has a right to complain outside of jesus christ i would think paul would have a right to complain don't you care about me like i've already been shipwrecked three times do i really have to be shipwrecked another do i really have to be stoned and left for dead like he had a list of things he could hold up and say enough's enough please we don't have that like i'm not disputing there's some of us been through some rough things but when you take your list and hold it up to pause we'd kind of just want our list up and throw it away why is the question why would god permit this why would god not care about these individuals in so much that he would care about me and you more let's look at brother branham hang with me i'm going to wrap this up tight and quickly so don't go to sleep on me stay with me we're coming to a close look at brother branham look at our messenger we looked at paul he's the first church age messenger but now come to the seventh church age messenger this is the seventh vial angel this is the seventh church age messenger i mean the list goes on and on and on this is the one that revealed the mysteries to john i mean his credentials his resume is quite astounding but god didn't even care enough to give him a decent house to be born in god didn't care enough to where in the winter when it would get cold his eyes would get matted shut from the cold and his mommy would have to bring up hot cone grease and rub it in his eyes just to get his eyes open and god didn't care he wouldn't even allow him to have a good pair of shoes to go to school in do you think for an instant that god could not have had him born in a palace with 20 pairs of shoes and 20 changes of outfits you tell me why god did not care didn't even have a good pair of shoes to wear to school didn't even have a good pair of clothes didn't even have a shirt wore his jacket couldn't take his jacket off god didn't even care enough that when he went to school he would sit there by the stove and sweat bullets and he couldn't take his jacket off because he didn't have a shirt underneath i'm going to venture to say that he got made fun of at school and god did not care you say well how can you say that because god didn't stop it did god care oh my goodness god carried saints those people were going to find out one day how much god cared but god didn't care enough to stop it god didn't care enough to where he would try to be a gentleman and carry a little girl's books home from school and he would get beat and his teeth mashed in by a group of bullies and god didn't care enough to stop it he would go home and said that's fine you'll beat me up i'll teach you a lesson he would go home and get his gun this is the seventh angel remember get his gun ambush them on the those that same group of boys ambush them on the way back from school not crazy not a wild man very focused and said they start freaking out oh he's going to kill us oh he's going he says stop it knock it off enough of that you're all going to die face it like a man get out here and see who's first he's not pulling punches saints he is not joking he is not pretending in so much he would tell him quit acting silly and acting like a bunch of sissies you know what you did to me i'm going to kill you here's my gun get in the line god didn't care this is not a story saints this is the seventh angel this is my and your prophet and god would allow him to be tormented and abused to the point that he would want to murder children we read about these kind of people in the newspapers and don't see it on the news nowadays i don't know that they'd had a school shooting up to that point how would you like to be following a prophet as the first school shooter you say all of that would never happen dad it almost did and it would have amen if god didn't care enough to stop it but now god looks down and at this point we'll say maybe he wasn't paying attention he was allowing all this to take place he didn't care because he never raised his hand about it but now all of a sudden he has taken it into his own hands to do something and now this has no eternal value linked to it and god says oh no i care not going to allow that to happen go ahead and pull the trigger pull it keep pulling it pull it till you empty your gun and he did and god wouldn't let fire why would god not care about everything leading up to that event but now he would care in so much that he won't let the gun go off those boys were worthy of it they were worthy of what they did to that prophet not even just a prophet just as a boy take his take his status away from him take his scriptural position away from him even if he's a rank sinner they still deserved it for what they did to him he never deserved anything they did to him and god permitted it they deserve everything that they got coming their way and god won't permit it you tell me why i'll tell you why is because god looked down and he said that does not serve benjamin siebold a purpose no you're not going to do that he lets a man poison the only friend that he has in the world his hunting dog prince like if going to school and getting made fun of every day is not enough not having good shoes not having clothes you've got nothing you've got nothing you know what you get for christmas you get an orange we come to reality we're spoiled to death this is the seventh angel and only only thing he gets for christmas is an orange but god would allow him not allow him to have all of this but yet he's got one friend in the world fritz two he had his horse sorry so he's got two friends he would allow a man to poison his hunting dog his best friend his only friend and kill him and god did not care enough to stop it brother branham had a bit of a temper he wanted to kill all their school children well guess what he wants to do to the man who poisoned his dog he says don't worry fritz i promise you i'll get him now let me let me tell you a little something about for those those of you that don't have a hunting dog you do not break a promise to a hunting dog has anybody ever read the book where the red fern grows you may make a promise to a person and break it and be sorry for it and not mean to have broke it you may do that but i'm here to tell you for those of you that don't have dogs you do not make a promise to a hunting dog and go back on it period he says fritz i promise you i'll get him i'll catch him out there and i will run him over he's going to make it look like an accident but he promised his hunting dog he was going to kill this man do not think for an instant he was not going to follow through on that do not think for an instant take it from somebody who knows you don't promise a hunting dog something if you don't mean it he meant it saints and he was going to do it but god said nope i care i don't care about all the torment you went through i don't care that you just lost your best friend but you're not going to kill that man in fact i'm going to let you be used to convert him and the story had a happy ending he didn't care enough to where he would have let he would let his hunting buddy blow his legs off with a shotgun god could have kept that from happening saints could he not have why did he not he allowed his barber to dump acid on his head do we think for an instant that god could not have allowed that to happen that he could have prevented that but he didn't he allowed his barber to dump acid on his head he allowed him to lose his wife and baby could god have had mercy and intervened yes yes yes but he didn't you want to know why because march of 1963 is a date on the calendar that cannot be moved this is the time that the lamb himself is going to descend from heaven and loose the seals that i will remind you all redemption hinges on march of 63. and it cannot be moved but there's one asterisk is god has to do this through a man because he's declared that's how he's going to do it and now god has from the time this boy is born 1909 to 1963 let's take away 12 years for the age of accountability if my math is right he has roughly 40 to 42 years to get this vessel into a condition that the lamb himself can step into it and break the seals that's why i never got by with anything that's why god never had time to deal with him me and you we can make a mistake god will deal with this over a course of years and years maybe whatever it is depending on the whatever it is march of 63 cannot be moved and this vessel is the vessel i'm using and it has to be in a condition that i can step into it in march of 63. i got 42 years to mold and to shape this vessel to where the mind of christ is in it to where when its mother-in-law would come and say you get back into that parsons just you be a good boy don't you be out there running around with them crazy people i don't want my daughter a part of that he learned that lesson one time god didn't have time for him to learn it again you want to know why because of my redemption if that vessel misses march of 63 everything is lost including me and you and the world i'm not making that up that's what john said everything is lost if by march of 63 this vessel is not of a character that the lamb can descend and step into it god didn't care enough to keep his wife and baby you say god cared brother branham said it was like he pulled a sheet down on me and said i don't want to hear you that is god not caring did god care saints absolutely he cared do you think that did not grieve god absolutely no doubt it broke his heart but god cared more about your and my redemption that he cared about his wife and his baby thanks saints what he has given us think of what he has done for us think of the cost to bring this to us he didn't keep him from getting worked into a mental state that he tried to commit suicide twice once by gun once by electricity could he have kept him from getting to that stage absolutely but he didn't he was a completely broken man so broken that he wanted to leave this earth and god wasn't even allowed god didn't even care enough to allow him to leave he comes to the pinnacle of his ministry and god uses him the land himself uses him to break the seals and prior to that god reveals to him when you do this tens of thousands of people you thought were your friends are going to leave you you know where i'm going with that one god did not care told him in advance tens of thousands of your friends are remember this is a man who didn't have any friends now has tens of thousands and they're going to leave him because what god has told him to preach now we see what god cares about the entire religious realm turns his back on him walks away from him labels him a fanatic and god did not care god didn't care to when he does all of this he is a good and he is a faithful servant his character is in such a spot that god can literally put the power of the spoken word on his tongue and say whatsoever you say that's the way it'll be and god don't even care enough to keep him from getting killed by a drunk driver because god knows that the first elijah went to chariot that elijah's got to go into chariot i got to make sure benjamin seabolt don't miss it let him go in a chariot do you think for a second god could not have allowed him to have a peaceful death in his sleep or just took him but he says no he's got to go in a chariot benjamin siebel's got to make sure all the types and shadows line up i got to make sure he don't miss it all of that all of the disciples all of the martyrs through the dark ages paul irenaeus all of the church age messengers all of brother branham's life all of that god cared less about that than he did about mine and your redemption because he gave all of that for it church age book brother branham says think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we have we all have trials we are all tried and and the son sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering is not being tried has not got it and is not of god you say yeah our pastor just read that wednesday yeah i know god would deal with a man for five years hard for a year and a half giving him inspiration to preach something and then he won't care enough to keep somebody from preaching the wednesday before god don't care about anything when it comes to our comfort and our well-being and what we want and what we think should happen the church that is not suffering that is not being tried has not got it it is not of god now this special condition and summer near must be applied hang on tight we're going to go fast now and wrap this up must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval i i could probably preach this every time that i minister from now until god takes me off the scene if you will grasp this it will change your life saints the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's approval disapproval meaning no external circumstance is a sign of god's disapproval that if you will understand that will alleviate 90 of your mental battles because that's what we do we see an external circumstance we immediately take it to the spiritual realm and say what's wrong with me the prophet said nothing it's no sign of anything if anything it's a sign that you're a son or daughter of god and you're being tried and that's needful be comfortable with it because god don't care the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water sign of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved election his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world what can any external circumstance do to change a predestinated elective love of god for you nothing so if nothing can change that and god don't care about it why should we care about it but why do we spend 90 of our time trying to fix external circumstances that are making us uncomfortable that's what we do saints i said we i didn't say you i said we i do it every day see external circumstance try to fix it for my comfort and it's no sign of anything you see they could not figure out god's love that's the problem they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election period that no matter what happened what happened what happened that covers a lot of things no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation he may commit you to death i thought you was telling me how much god loved me he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but is all with a purpose the purpose is what he cares about not the external circumstances if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled i've spent a long long long time telling you what god don't care about let me take a short time and tell you what he does care about you being made perfect being established being strengthened and being settled i'll read it this way would be made perfect in his word established in his word strengthened in his word and settled in his word that's what he cares about and he will forsake everything else to accomplish that god of this evil age brother branham says what would god call a people out of this age for out of this evil age the reason is is to try her how many wants to be called of god come on put your hands up you know you do it is a trick question but go ahead and fall for it how many wants to be called of god why would he do that in this evil age the reason is is to try her when she has made manifest been tried been proven proved to satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end he says we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve so if you want to be called you want to be chosen it's because god wants to use your vessel to prove to satan you're not like the first steve that's the purpose of him calling you and choosing you [Music] you say well i just wanted him to love me he does i just wanted to heal me he will i just wanted to take care of my finances he will i just wanted him to he will he will he will he will he will unless it doesn't serve his purpose and then he don't care if it serves his purpose to prove to satan that you're not like eve he will and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by his word christ is revealed in his own word 65 there ain't going to be no more big sweeping revivals this nation will never receive it you might have an intellectual gathering but i mean a spiritual revival we have seen all of it i hope you're catching it i'm saying it in such a way that i hope you will get it see it's over a fine minister said a while ago said brother branham if i could just have the joy of the lord in my heart i said son the revival is over that's encouraging i just want the joy of the lord in my heart it's over son forget about it god don't care brother branham is not saying that this man can't have the joy of the lord in his heart what he's doing is he's recognizing what this brother is saying the brother is saying i want a big sweeping revival like we've had through the 50s brother brown says it's over you better have the joy of the lord in your own heart you better have your own revival son the revival's over see now the stabilizers have been put on the ship okay now he's putting us in a mark in time revival's over big sweeping revival's gone never to be no more stabilizers have been put on the ship joyous times wonderful times revivals joy of the lord in my heart over stabilizers on the ship not the sharpest tool in the shed but i can pretty much guess what's coming you do not put stabilizers on a ship unless there's a storm coming brother branham declares the revival age is over storm's coming but the stabilizers have been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder this is 65 end of his ministry saints he's declaring great fearful things are ahead of us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore just stay stable stay stable just stay in the word those two are linked together if you are not in the word you are not going to be stable let it stay stable when you see all these great big old clouds around us storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them he did not say that god will make them smooth he says stabilizers are on the ship we will crest every one of them i'll break it down for you just in case you're not getting it the trials are going to come they are going to be great they are going to be fearful they are going to be real and god does not care to take them away but he has given you stabilizers to put on your vessel that you will crest every one of them you may gurgle water for a little bit but you will crest every one of them you may go under them but you will come out of them they are going to come you will go through them you may be under them but at some point in time god will say enough is enough and i've accomplished what i'm after and you will crest that wave if and only if you have put the stabilizers on your ship how many want stabilizers yes we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they they cannot sing us sink us they cannot drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again whatever it might be let it come if i live i live to the glory of god if i die then i die to the glory of god you i will remind you you do not put stabilizers on a ship when everything is calm unless you see a storm coming you are not going to get a free pass on all the troubles that the world faces saints they're coming they're real they're going to hit you as the bride of jesus christ just as they hit them and more so that's the reason we've been given stabilizers we have been given stabilizers for our health issues god may not care about our health issues for a little bit we have a promise he will heal us he does not say when he does not say how and if he has a purpose for a health issue to come by your way he'll let it come and he will not care if he has a purpose for a loved one passing he will let that loved one pass it's not an easy thing but if hit serves his purpose he will allow it to happen and he will not care enough to turn his hand for it because he has a plan and he is going to express himself he is going to get the preeminence and he is going to have your redemption if your job issue needs to serve his purpose he'll raise an issue if your financials need to serve his purpose he will not care i'm here to tell you that god does not care about money issues he does not care about economies collapsing he does not care about corrupt political systems it is serving his purpose he does not care about wars he does not care about famines he does not care about natural disasters it is serving his purpose and if it does not serve his purpose he will put a stop to it he does not care about pandemics he does not care about immorality here's a shocker for you he doesn't even care about false doctrines about around the message unless it does not serve his purpose and then he'll squish it real quick but if it serves his purpose he'll allow it you say god wouldn't that's what he did to israel he said i have raised you up false prophets to see if you will go after them instead of the word think he won't do that to us saints he will do it think false doctrines around the message as new it's been in every age around every message and god didn't care enough to stop it because he had a purpose god don't care about church splits god does not care about false ministries god does not even care about great fallings away he'll allow it to happen why to express himself to get the preeminence in you and to restore you to eden john 13 verse 1 as the musicians come john 13 verse 1 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil now having having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him you all said you wanted stabilizers a little while ago here's your stabilizers jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded i want to remind you that judas got his feet washed the one that betrayed him you think for a second he didn't know who he was the scripture declares he knew who he was but he lets him sit right next to him at dinner he'll stop and give to him he'll wash his feet he'll do all of these things knowing he's a thief at heart and he's the one to betray him why why why how easy it would have been just to kick him out god knowing this was the one that was going to fulfill this was satan incarnate and god didn't even care enough to keep him away from his only begotten son why because god had a plan jesus comes to that revelation and he doesn't even care enough to keep him from the last supper why because the stabilizers have been put on the ship verse 3 jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands what were those all things me and you saints what's in his hands read the scriptures what's in his hands we're engraved in the palm of his hands let me read it to you this way jesus knowing that the father had given him benjamin seabolt in his hands my life is in his hands saints my life is in his hands and on his mind when he makes this decision knowing that god had given him the redemption of benjamin seabolt put your name in there and that he was come from god and went to god stabilizers on the ship he rises from supper and washed the devil's feet we get a revelation we came from god and are going to god and we sure don't wash our disciples the devil's feet sometimes we're so haughty we won't even wash our brother's feet how pride and prideful and arrogant we can be somebody will do something to rub us a little the wrong way we'll fall out of fellowship with them speak evil of them won't shake their hand won't wash their feet avoid them jesus knowing this was the incarnate devil washed his feet based on the revelation that all things are in my hand i come from god and i'm going to god the reaction and the response and the result he humbled himself and washed satan's incarnate feet we have no right to be proud for about anything we have no right to react in a negative way if we get our feelings hurt none i would remind you at the very very very beginning the scripture says in ezekiel it says thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god that was walked up and down in the midst of the stones and fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thine heart now let's go back to the very very very very very beginning of when god didn't care do you think for a second that god didn't know he had didn't have iniquity in his heart he created him anyhow he's the creator he can choose what he does and does not create what he does and what he does not allow but at the very beginning this is the original sin this is the beginning of things going sideways and god didn't care enough to not create him even knowing that iniquity would be found in his heart why we stand in this day and in this age with the knowledge and the truth that no other age have had has things now we can look at our lives in the face of the open book and recognize god has permitted all of this in the scripture he has permitted all of this in my life because he cares about expressing himself getting the preeminence in my life and my redemption anything that comes along your way that you think god doesn't care about chances are he don't as much as he cares about using that circumstance to express himself to get the preeminence in your life and for your redemption you know why because god cares more about the person he's going to use you to redeem than he does about you that's the pattern saints why didn't he care about stephen because he cared about paul why didn't he care about paul because he cared about the churches why didn't he care about those churches those martyrs because he cared about the next church age why didn't he care about that church because he cared about the next one why doesn't he brother bran says we pray for comfort and peace and god in his wisdom gives us the best he has to offer why [Music] if we are the bride of jesus christ elected before the foundation of the world would he not care about us and our comfort and our peace it's because there's still somebody that needs redemption and if that means him bringing an inconvenience by your way a health issue by your way running your reputation if that means he has to do something that's uncomfortable in your life for you to express his attributes and his characteristics in order to attract one of his children for their redemption do not think for a second that he won't do it it's been the pattern that's why he didn't care about the one before is because he cared about the one after it's not that he didn't care about the one before saints but he cares about the one before and he'll get the stabilizers on their ship and then he'll let the waves come why to express himself let's stand together to express himself to get the preeminence and to facilitate redemption that is what god truly cares about and he will forsake everything else to accomplish that that is what he had in the back part of his mind now the challenge for us is whether we really believe that or not whether we're going to operate by that or not because it's easy well i won't say it's easy it's not been easy to preach it but i've preached it i've got it off my heart and i hope you've taken it in the way that i've tried to express it it's not a condemnation and it's certainly not trying to tell you that god does not care i've told you that god cares about every intimate detail of your life even things that you don't know about but now can we conduct ourselves by that revelation or when we walk out of the doors and on monday everything goes sideways are we going to start asking him why he don't care why he's forsaking us why he's allowed this if you'll look at every one of the church ages in the book of revelation there's a common theme and the common theme is god comes and he tells them i know he knows saints there is nothing in your life or my life that has snuck up on god if he knew everything in the church ages what chance do you think there is that he doesn't know what's going on in your life right now and he'll come and he will tell you the same thing that he told them i know i know what did he do every day and every night tens of thousands of times through the prophet's life people would come on the platform and he would tell them what's going on in their life why so that that person brother says the vision does not heal you it makes you aware of the presence of god what made them aware of the presence of god was the god speaking to them and telling them i know i know you have this i know you have that i know this i know this i know i know i know i know if god knows and we truly believe he knows it should humble us to put ourselves back in the position we belong in he knows he's my father i know where i came from i know where i'm going he'll deal with it appropriately that was the purpose of all those tens of thousands of examples not to mention all of the scriptures we have the purpose i'm here to tell you this morning saints you think you're going through some stuff and you may be in fact i would probably say you are and it's real and it has a real effect on you and i can tell you in the name of the lord he knows and it is not to destroy you it is to express himself it is to get the preeminence in your life and it is for your redemption or maybe even the redemption of somebody else one saw was worth ten thousand worlds if one soul was worth ten thousand worlds do you not think it's worth a little bit of our discomfort and trials and tribulations ten thousand worlds i think we can have a little bit of discomfort and trials to express an attribute of god for him to use for an eternal purpose without complaining about it brother branham says the decision the real decision is whether we'll conduct ourselves with joy amongst these trials he says that's how we show our love back to him his love is set it's undisputable it is unmovable it is not going to change he loved us brother brandon said he proved that he loved us because he brought his truth by your way did he bring his truth by your way if he has brought his truth by your way it is his proof you are elected and he loves you your response is only one thing to conduct yourself with joy or unpleasantly amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring by your way it's the only decision only option out there and i'll just remind you if god has an eternal purpose for the things you're going through he's not going to care about the temporal sufferings that you're going through and if he doesn't care about it why should we i say that we back up a step refocus on the eternal plan and purpose of god that has been delivered to us expressing christ having christ the free giving christ the preeminence and redemption for ourselves for our family and for this lost world that we live in and let everything else be brought subject to that and conduct ourselves with joy amongst those things two last comments brother branham said joseph was the type of perfection i've quoted this here before but i'll remind you brother branham said he was the type of perfection because joseph conducted himself as such when things went sideways he never said why he never complained he simply asked god please reveal to me what part of your foreknowledge you are revealing and expressing through me right now that is a whole nother level of saints i pray that god gets me there i know he's trying i pray that i can yield to that and come to that point because our atoms are not going to change until we do we have got to come to that point before our atoms are going to change the last comment that i want to make is this if you'll just play something softly please all things are working together for good to them that love the lord or they're not they either all are or they're not you say well you don't know i made the bad decision it was my fault i did this all things all things include your bad decisions and your mistakes all things self-inflicted or not self-inflicted all things work together for good to them that love the lord and are called according to his purpose it is either true or it's not true you need to answer that question before you walk out of them doors it either is or it isn't the last thing that i'll tell you is the lamb is either on the throne or he's not the lamb is either in control or he's not the lamb being in control does not deviate with your bad decision your wrong decision your bad mistake you may suffer for it not going to dispute that [Music] there may be scars from it it may have very bad effects for you and other people not disputing any of that but either it's working together for good for your purpose or another purpose that god has or it's not either the scripture is right or it's wrong either the lamb is still in control on the throne or he's not i say we leave this building by bringing those 200 million million demons subject to those stabilizers and if you will do that you will be settled you will be established you will be strengthened and you will be stable for what lays ahead because the waves are coming let's pray precious lord jesus lord we thank you for this time that you've given us lord lord we thank you for truth lord and i've been so lengthy lord i try every time not to be but it just happens lord i i apologize for not being more efficient lord father but i pray that you would take the words that's been spoken and i pray more importantly that you would take the spiritual principle that you wanted to express here this morning and that you would reveal it to your people the way you wanted it revealed i pray that they would be able to look past the vessel and look look past the delivery and see the spiritual principle and truth that lays there and lord i pray that you would take that and you would establish it in our hearts that we would move forward an example of perfection as you declared in joseph lord that we would move forward established settled strengthened and stable so that when the waves that are coming comes we're not tossed to and fro like children lord but we're rooted and grounded and we conduct ourselves the way that we should and we express ourselves the way that we should that we allow you to have the preeminence lord for we know that you are using us for the redemption of others to bring the truth that you died for to others lord what attraction would there be to the world as if the gospel we have causes us to fall apart the same way the world does every time something goes sideways lord may you come and supernaturally change us and allow us to conduct ourselves based on this revelation that you've given us we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ praising you for all things and giving you the glory in jesus christ's name amen god bless you saints we're going to sing you'd be dismissed as you will i do apologize for being lengthy i did not mean to do that but i'll probably say it again next time i preach but i don't mean to be but i want to make sure you get what's on my heart i've delivered my heart i pray that you've seen what god is after and i pray that it's a blessing to you you just pray that god makes me more efficient god bless you saints let's sing together brother solomon concluded all his vanity now my heart believes that it is true it took me all this time to find reality all i ever really want is you [Music] you and your plan oh everything today nothing now all i ever really want is you so take the grandest thing you know that life can oh [Music] one thing i have learned in all
