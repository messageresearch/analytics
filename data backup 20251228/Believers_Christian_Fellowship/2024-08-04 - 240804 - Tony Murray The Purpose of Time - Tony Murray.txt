[Music] amen we just want to say thank you to the specials they were wonderful God bless you for for sharing that with us also uh I introduced brother Tony and his family he's here with his wife Vicky and his two oldest children they have four but the two oldest are with them Sister Sarah and sister our brother Daniel and it's good to have you guys we've enjoyed some fellowship with them over the last few days and and I we've never met before and I didn't know brother Tony he just sent an email one day asking if we'd be here this weekend cuz they're Trav in the United States and they'd like to stop by and say hello and we said that'd be fine so they surprise us by coming in on Wednesday and at that point I didn't know brother Tony and I didn't really know anything about him but we had a chance to fellowship and the fellowship was just glorious it was just Heavenly places and I I learned that he had been a minister for quite some time and he began to share some things and and I found such a continuity such a joy and the things that he was looking at were really thrilling to me and I really had in my heart that I wanted the whole congregation to get get to hear these things and so I asked him if he'd take the service and you know I had to persuade this just a little bit amen but he was gracious and accepted and I'm really excited about the word this morning our brother lives in New Zealand with his family and and some of you may remember a big project that brother Tony worked on about nine years ago came out and it got passed around quite a quite a lot throughout the world and throughout the message and he did a a a timeline a power Point timeline animated timeline from Genesis to Revelation and took what brother bham said and had the quotes and the and the audio scriptures and the animation to take you uh in the Plan of Redemption from Genesis all the way through to Revelation and it was glorious it was well done and the brother worked on it and he's the one who produced that if some of you remember that and I remember watching it enjoying it amen but I never realized one day I would meet the man who works so hard on it that God used so we want to thank him for that if you'd like to look it up it's on YouTube it's called timeline then you have a dash from Genesis to Revelation timeline Dash from Genesis the Revelation and I know you'll be blessed I was very much blessed by him so we want brother Tony to come and relax his first time here so we want him to feel welcome immediately amen we want him to feel that kindred spirit because because we believe the same word we serve the same God Amen we want to pull on the word to make it easy for him and my goal is always that when a preacher comes to preach that I get my portion and that I pull so hard that he enjoys preaching amen so that's what we want to do again today so we just want to invite brother Tony with a song brother BL we'll open our eyes Lord we want to see Jesus [Music] to reach out and touch him and say that we love him open our ears Lord and help us to L open our eyes Lord we want to see one more time and open our eyes is Lord we want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him and say that we love him open our ears Lord and help us to L open our eyes we want to to see Jesus amen what a privilege amen that we can have that we can see him today we can see him in his word we can see him in one another amen we're a privileged people and uh I just want to bring greetings and I just want to say that we come into the CH church on Wednesday night and we could just feel the presence of God you know I text brother uh Chad and said look we're coming straight down from Detroit once we land and we're going to going to come straight to the church and we're about 15 minutes late but we walked in halfway through the song service and you can just feel the presence of the Lord was is like this feels like home you know so uh I believe you know brother Chad and I we've had some Great Fellowship together and we feel like we've known each other forever then he we both said well in some ways we have you know so that's really good so God bless you each one who may be seated for a few moments then we're going to stand again and read the scripture so certainly an honor and a privilege for us to be here and brother Chad said this morning that he was surprised that he wasn't preaching and I and I'm more surprised that he wasn't preaching you know so uh but anyhow here we are and I trust that there's something that we can say today that would be a help be a blessing I know that you're you're a mature Christians you know the message well I haven't got any new quotes we've got nothing new to say but perhaps we can say things from a a different perspective maybe than we've looked at it before and brother Chad and I were just talking before but uh when you're looking at an object if you if you can look at it from all different angles different perspectives you get a greater understanding of that a greater appreciation for what you're looking at and so that's what Fellowship is about you know we talk to one another and this is how what I'm seeing in the word that was the water that you promised good so so that's what we want to do if there's something that we can say this morning that would just give maybe another dimension to what you already know quotes you've already heard that's what we want to do and uh I was telling brother Chad you know we really appreciate his ministry and and I I think any Ministry should be a snapshot of the message you hear somebody preaching and if it sounds different if it has a different flavor than what the prophet said the alarm Bells should start to go off so we we don't want to be saying something different we want to just perhaps be brother renam says he looks forward to when the young men would break down the message to the people so that we can kind of see it in a little bit more detail but the overall that we want we want it to be a snapshot of what the prophet has said because we know that was the word of God direct from God speaking to us amen and we're so thankful for that we've enjoyed fellowship with uh a number of the Brethren we've had some really good homecooked uh meals from the sisters which we appreciate and uh so we're just looking forward to even this afternoon perhaps catching up with a few more of you folk and and we love you and the Lord uh we're going to have going to have 10,000 years plus a whole lot more when we get to the other side so uh we'll look forward to that as well so God bless you and we'll tune to the word in a moment I was speaking to one of the brothers I think uh we had some fellowship with brother gabes and we were talking over lots of different things and that was good and I enjoyed that uh sharing things was brother L was there and brother Josiah and some of the other brothers and sisters that was nice then with brother Steves the other night and uh brother Greg brother Ron different ones were there I think it was brother Greg I saying to you know brother Bren talks about being a Salesman for Life assurance eternal life assurance and I'm I'm very convinced about the product I'm not so happy with my sales pitch you know sometimes you you try and explain something it's just it doesn't quite come across how that you'd like to and sometimes even ministering it's like I don't think it quite got across but the product is perfect amen so if we can just concentrate on the product not the sales pit not the delivery but maybe there's something that we can just see a fresh that will give us a little bit of inspiration and uh and courage for the journey that's ahead of us I trust that can be the way that it would be amen and uh we were talking with brother uh Jeremy and brother Chad having some fellowship and uh they started using all the quotes that are in my notes and all the scriptures and I'm like we've got to stop Brothers we got to stop you know you're singing from my song sheet so we we just need to we just we'll talk about this tomorrow you know so as far as talk singing from the song sheet we were traveling around the US and somebody asked me we went to a church and they said oh do you or your family sing you know would like to do a special for us I said brother if I sing it'll clear the church faster than the fire alarm you know so we we don't want to do that you know but um maybe we can speak something on the word that that might be a blessing so if you'd like to stand with us again and we're going to read out of the book of uh Ecclesiastes and the message that I uh want to speak on or the title of it I've called it the purpose of time and I said to brother Chad you know when he asked me I said listen I don't really have uh a preaching message so much but it's a little study that I've done and I know that brother Brenham sometimes he will say and I'm not going to preach today we're going to have a Bible study and he preached some of the most dynamic messages that he preached you know so but it it is a study and I trust that you can see hopefully by the end of it we can see the purpose of of why we've been uh capsulated into this this Epoch of time because really we're creatures from eternity going to Eternity but we're passing through this period of time and it's for a purpose and trust that we can see that as we go through amen so Ecclesiastes chapter 3 uh 1-8 and it's uh it's probably a very simple sort of a scripture we've read it maybe all the denominational churches would refer to this and possibly at times of funerals and things we talk about all these sort of things but we want to look a little deeper than that the Lord willing so here we go Ecclesiastes 3: 1 says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a Time time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to seow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we come before you we just read some words out of the book lord the pages of your book The Bible Lord I just ask that you would open the pages to us now help us see Lord that you have a purpose you you have a plan you're working out in each of Our Lives you're developing something in us through our sojourn through time so I just ask now that you would be with us may your presence be with us anoint the speaker and the hearer alike we ask in jesus' name amen amen God bless you may be seated now we're going to start right at the beginning uh of the scripture and it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and then brother BR says period or full stop and he says when he did it and how he did it he doesn't tell us that was way Way Way Back in the eons of time and he makes a great differentiation between Genesis 1 1 and Genesis 1:2 but we could say technically time had begun because we can say that when he made the original creation of the universe it was billions of years ago and science would say 13.8 billion years ago that the that the they say the Big Bang happened and the creation began so it's a long long time ago but it's not our time it's just the time of the universe but when we get to Genesis 1:2 that's when we start to work on our time and that's when the clock starts ticking for us and in the C our current creation but in the intervening time God was not just sitting idle he was doing things in fact our bodies are made up of Stardust they're made up of stars that have blown themselves to bits and supernovas our sun the the the heaviest element that the sun will make when it combines two hydrogens together makes helium and then when it uses up all of the hydrogen and starts combining other atoms till eventually gets to iron but that's the heaviest element it makes but stars that are big enough that when they they collapse and then they blow themselves to bits it's called a supernova all the other elements that we're made up of were made in supernovas Maiden Stars big enough to Supernova and those particles are spread throughout the Universe and then they coales together to make rocky planets terrestrial planets like our Earth brother BR says God was like a great contractor that's right and he was getting all the elements together but that's how he made them in supernovas yeah so we are when it calls us the stars of God we are literally made of stars yeah that's where we come from so he was doing lots and lots of things he was he was making galaxies he was blowing stars to bits and uh you know I think maybe one day the Lord's going to let us have a you know a view back into what he was doing in some of those times we say oh there's a the the in in heaven you know there's a picture theater on tonight about the creation you know he's going to show us I don't know I think he want to show us all those things tell us what he was doing but right now because he didn't write those things they're just unknowns to us but if he wrote something in the scripture or if he spoke it by the prophets it became a Bible mystery and and the prophet tells us that the mysteries of God are going to be finished Revelation 10:7 so if he wrote it or if he spoke it he had to make it known but there's many many things brother M say that God did that he hasn't put in the Bible he doesn't have to tell us right now he's saving those things for his bride and he's going to say when I put that star there brother Chad I was thinking of you that's brother Chader this one over here see all those things it's it's a reality but he's saving it for later so he didn't write it he didn't say it and you we could say the seventh seal is like that you know when brother brandom says in in Matthew 24 he was talking about the seals and he goes through 1 2 3 4 5 6 he says nothing about the seventh that's right and then he go through Revel and he talks about the seals and there's a mystery with each one 1 2 3 4 5 6 the horse riders and then the souls and the souls and prison you know Souls under the altar sorry the to the Jews and then the tribulation the sixth SE seventh seal half your silence he says it's silent because he doesn't have to declare it now it's his secret it's everything to do with the coming of the Lord so if he didn't write it if he didn't speak it it just remains unknown it's his secret but what he did write and what he did speak he says I'll reveal it to you in the end time and that's right where we are right now amen so now we get to Genesis 1:2 and it says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and now time starts ticking for our creation so he was creating things before the prophet tells us he had the fossils and all the different things that you see in the ground he was doing something before but but it eventually came to the time where the whole Earth was void of life and darkness upon the face of the deep he says now I'm going to start on the current creation and I'm going to replenish the Earth replenish means it had something here before and he replenished the Earth starts in our current creation so you can start the timer and he and he worked on creation for 6,000 years brother Brenham says 6 days and we'll look at that in a moment so God had a purpose that He is wanting to fulfill so in this creation because he dwelt alone in eternity before but he's like but I'm going to make something and here we got a quote from brother Brandon M of Christ as the mystery of God revealed now he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed uhhuh there we are straight away we we catch the key here's something he wants himself to be expressed amen because first there wasn't even a moon or Star atom molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object to worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and in him was to be a father and in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God Amen attributes in them but nowhere to express them he had to create a platform he had to create a workspace where he could express his attributes amen and for that workspace he created time said that's where I'm going to express myself and brother B tells us about these uh on the screen there the threefold purpose of God he says first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence in his church the bride and thirdly to restore the kingdom amen I'm glad we can see straight to the end of the story it's like he just gets right there to restore the kingdom I've read the back of the book and we win you know let's just go straight there we've got the whole book let's read the and he says yep the the uh the Saints get the kingdom that's good okay okay so this was this time element is actually this dimension of time is God's invention if you think of it like this go we can't think in Eternal terms we just can't we're a finite we can't think so God was he never had a beginning never had an end but you think about like this that God was eternal like that and he could had to try and think in finite terms it's just as hard for him to think in finite terms as it does for us to think in Eternal terms he had to think completely outside the box of everything of reality to him to come up with this brother Rems here who do you say this is he says in the beginning he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again cuz his thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we're right here this day we are the manifested thoughts of Jehovah God praise praise the Lord amen so firstly before he even created time he had to invent the concept of time he had to think I'm going to make something which is temporal in the midst of Eternity just a little box and it starts off eternity we're going to go into time and we're going to come out the other end back into eternity and there's a purpose in doing that so he invented it then he had to design how time is going to work and just initially we would probably think that's very very easy you know time is yesterday was gone today is now and tomorrow is Future and it sounds really easy that the Earth is 24,000 M around it spins at 1,000 M hours at the equator that's 24 hours and we get get into the next day but time is a whole lot more complex than that and we're going to have we look at that a little bit of science than that don't get too worried about that I did have one lady used to come to our church and she says I hate your science lessons oh okay I said well you know the great the greatest scientist of all was Jehovah God he made it all we only discover little minute parts of it you know but um yeah Jehovah God he had to think it all up invent it design it and then create it amen this temporary Dimension so we're we're blessed even that we can um we can get a little insight in these things and some of the greatest minds I think is Einstein you know uh he he was amazed that from from the perspective of Earth that we can see so much and we can discover so much of God's Universe because there's places in space where we could be you wouldn't be able to see anything out but we're in between the different spiral arms on our galaxy that we can actually see out other galaxies we can see around we can observe what God's been doing and what is God is doing if you've got the eyesight to see it all right one of the reasons God had to create this dimension of time is that to fulfill his purpose he needed an enemy he needed an enemy you could not be tried you could not be tested you could not have the the the the the testing times that it takes to develop in you the character that he wants without an enemy and neither could he so he had to he he realized I have to have an enemy but he couldn't have this enemy in eternity he said I've got to make a temporary Dimension where we battle with his enemy we can't have this enemy in eternity only in a temporary Dimension and eventually that temporary Dimension and the enemy are going to be gone that's right amen who is going to deceive Eve if there was no enemy who is going to nail Jesus to the Cross if there was no enemy right who is going to persecute the church down Through the Ages you know we read Hebrews 11 The Heroes of Faith we wouldn't even know them if there wasn't an enemy that fought against them now we say they The Heroes of Faith amen and the bride of Christ in this last a and the trials and the tribulations we go through the pressure we're feeling the enemy against us but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood he's going to raise up a standard amen so it takes the pressure from that enemy to develop what the Lord's looking for in us so he knew that he had to have this Angel called Lucifer and he he made him beautiful but he also knew that he would get lifted up in Pride and when he got lifted up in Pride eventually it would play out he would become the enemy of his own Creator yeah because he got lifted up from Pride so God knew that would take place and then he knew that he had to bring that war not in heaven anymore but that war had to come down on Earth Earth that will be fought brother R says in the minds of humanity the human mind is where the battle is fought in the minds of men and women and boys and girls amen so not in eternity nothing could go wrong sin couldn't exist there in in heaven we we we're like I say we're from eternity go back to Eternity but it's here where we get tested in sin when we get across even in the Millennium when we get into into Glory it's not even going to be a possibility to sin it's only here and the real purpose of that is that it is we're talking about this just before the service it it's free moral agency that's that's the reason he purposed to place man in time on the basis of free moral agency to be able to choose right or wrong I give a little analogy if I had a bag of sweets here and uh they're all green I say you can choose whatever color you want but they're all green you don't have a choice but I've I had red ones and green ones and I say now you have a choice but don't choose the red ones cuz they taste terrible have the green ones now you still have a choice but I'm telling you the red ones are bad and the green ones are good now that's exactly what God did he opened the spectrum of choice but he says but don't choose evil choose good and live amen we see the scripture here in Isaiah 457 he says I form the light I I create Darkness I make peace I create evil I the Lord do all these things and in Deuteronomy 319 I call uh Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live he set the choice there but he says but don't choose evil he just opened the Spectrum he couldn't say you have a choice unless he did that but even we're talking also brother Chad just before the service now talking about the Rich Young Ruler you know when the Rich Young Ruler came to Jesus the Bible says Jesus loved him if if if he possibly could have given life eternal life to him he was the Rich Young Ruler was inquiring about eternal life and Jesus wanted to give it to him says he loved him what a thing we so we want Jesus to love us and he does love us but he can't take away free moral agency he couldn't make the Rich Young Ruler choose to to go the right way he had to open the Spectrum and say you choose and he chose the wrong way did the wrong thing H all right so after he had made this dimension of time God himself had to step into this Dimension that was the condescension he had to come and become a man come into this Dimension himself because he couldn't fulfill his purpose as the great Jehovah of God and here the next quote we got here from Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says he could not do it as that great Jehovah that covered all space time see he couldn't do it he had to become a man and he took kingship with man that was lost amen and became a man God made flesh amen let's take this off that's right he uh he made himself a body he came in human form he allowed himself to be subject to the same constraints of time as you and me the same constraints of being tried and tested of being ridiculed of being misunderstood of being hated that we go through just the same when he was 33 they thought he was 50 you know that that sinless body didn't have to age but to be a kinsman redeemer he allowed it to age it wasn't under the curse but he allowed it to be under the curse so that it would age but time 33 they said you're not a man over 50 they thought he was already that age he could be tempted as a man and he was and yet without sin the Bible says but you know what the Bible also says God can't be tempted but Jesus was he was so much a man he was God but he became so much a man that he could be tempted he was tempted and yet without sin amen he could suffer as a man and he surely did and he could die as a man which he did did to redeem his lost bride but the incredible thing is that God in his Humanity was where he won the victory you think about this Jehovah God it was when he was in his weakness in his Humanity was where he won the victory amen it's just that's something to me you know he could conquer sin in that form Hebrews 59 says he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him and God did that but as a man and you know he's got that confidence in you as his bride he says you're not actually from here you're not actually human and limited to humanity but while you're here he says you're going to win the victory I'm telling you I've read the back of the book that's what he says the bride is going to be victorious they're going to be there without spot without wrinkle he so how can that be he said so am mean that that's how we know we don't look at ourselves we don't look in the mirror we're going to be disappointed but he said so amen and that was the same thing that when Jesus was here he was relying on the word that said who who he was and and that he would be victorious amen also some other our fellowship you know just to probably put it into context when Jesus was born he was just born a baby he he just he didn't have any more understanding than any other baby he grew up as a little boy and he played games and different things and and so forth like any other little boy but by the time he was 12 he knew who he was he was he was disputing with the scribes and the elders and the church he knew who he was by the time he was 12 so somewhere between being a baby and being 12 the Revelation struck him and he looked out the window and went wow I created all this as a little boy he knew that it came to him wow that's actually who I am the Amnesia of humanity was drawn aside and he could see who he was and you know what he did once he knew who he was every time he talked to them he brought up in conversation something about who Christ was who Christ was and so we should be doing the same that we should be identifying who we are in him let the conversation come around to who he has made us we are his workmanship it should the conversation should be coming around to the fact that he's getting his bride ready for a catching away amen that should be on our minds as it was on his mind so he is the author of Eternal salvation something which is eternal was achieved through a dimension which is temporal something which is eternal was achieved through a dimension which is temporal amen all right so although God is he's outside of time he transcends time but yet he understand stands time he in he invented it created that he's the master of time he was before time he's after time he's both the beginning and ending of time amen he's not subject to it but yet he harnesses this time that we're working through to fulfill his purpose in US brother renam says here all the prophets came just exactly on time that was God's word living in each uh living on Earth exactly on time sometimes we see things in our life and say wow that was just the right time yes sir it's his time amen it surprises us but it doesn't surprise him he says Luther was right on time wisley was right on time Pentecost was right on time nothing out of order amen the prophet tells us that Israel is God's time piece and if you think about what's going on right over there right now I saw a news article that in Israel there's quite an uprising with within the uh the religious order because they say now that all this is happening the Messiah must be just about here must be just about here well yeah we know that's true because the bride has to be called away before Israel gets to hear and they're going to hear exactly the same message that we've received there is no other gospel this is it the the the seals have come off the book so you know to them the the the trumpets and the uh so forth have come to Israel they're going to see the same message that we see amen has clock's time just exactly I firstly the one about Israel he says uh if you want to see what day you're living look where the Jews are Jews are that's God's time pieces and out of proving his word he says the clock is timed just exactly to the split instant and everything's working just exactly right you know we've had many times in our lives where things have been like that I remember when Daniel that's sitting here now he's almost 30 years old but when he was just a little we guy he was standing on a balcony and I just at a friend's house and it was a two-story drop onto a concrete path if he'd gone over the edge and I just saw him he stood up on this balcony and I came over and I grabbed his arm like that and just as I grabbed it his feet had already gone off and he was going out through the rails it's like the T the Split Second timing I pulled him up through the rails set him down it's like thank you Lord he allowed me to see him just at the right moment just to catch him our little girl Julia where running in a as she we in a car pack and where's a big mall and she was only little and she took off running and I could hear this P pet p a p of feet rning she ran around a big vehicle ran a van and so I ran over and I put my arm out like that and she folded across my arm I couldn't see her coming I just could hear her and she folded across my arm and a car went swom past like that like thank you Lord it's like he's watching out you know he's watching out and he's doing that for us every moment of every day amen I just believe that all right so there's nothing wrong everything's going to turn out all right brother Ram says don't be scared God's Big Time piece is ticking right along and it'll be there it'll have a church without spot or wrinkle praise the Lord now many poets and and philosophers and so forth are written about time and some of them are quite interesting I quite like them there's a chap You' probably heard of Dale carnegi he wrote remember that today is the tomorrow that you're worried about yesterday I thought that was quite a good little saying you know today is the tomorrow that you're worried about yesterday and sometimes we we we overthink things you know ahead of time but um it can be like that but brother renam comes along and he says he actually said this is what time is so I'm going to read that to you it's out of the message Perfection he says now time time is this little Loop that Loops down speaking from eternity talks about eternity being a big loop and he says there's just a little Loop Twisted in the bottom of Eternity Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but he stepped down into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or to put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity you see it he said that's all time is I like that that's you know everybody else got something to say and this is what are this and some of them are interesting but he said this is what time is redemption he was just coming com to redeem this Earth the people from the earth that are his people and then back to Eternity again there's the purpose amen sometimes you might have seen documentary sometime and they have uh maybe a a camera and it zoomed right in maybe on a Little Flower and you see the center of the flower and all the the int intricate details of it and then the camera starts to zoom back back back you see the whole flower then you see the garden and then you see the park that it's in and then you see the whole city and maybe the whole state and then you can see all of maybe United States and it zooms back see the whole world and keeps going back and you see the solar system and you see the Milky Way galaxy and we disappear into space and even our galaxy becomes a little Dot and you think that's the perspective of where we are and God's Great economy but when we talk about time here we are in time but actually it's just a blip in eternity right it's just a blip if you had it on a slidebar of time you'd be going eternity eternity Time Eternity eternity eternity and we're we're locked all we can see is this a little bit of time but it's just a blip and it's for a purpose to develop something in new amen so let's not get too excited about that not get too worried about that uh we talked somewhere about uh sand castles and I think brother Chad kind of like that little concept I talked about but you know everything that we do in this life is actually going to pass away you know we've I've built a couple of houses and and we're quite quite happy with the way they came out and quite nice houses but I said to the to the family remember this house is not our Castle it's it's one day it's going to be a puff of smoke it's just going to disappear just like that so we our goal has to be in glory amen everything here is going to sweep away and if you know anything about building sand castles I know you're a long way from the beach but uh uh you build them below the high tide line where the sand is wet and then it sticks together you can make and if if you're building a sand castle with the children and you can get really into it you know really enthused and you make it look as nice as you possibly can but in the back of your mind always you know one thing the tide is going to come in and it's going to take it away You're Building below the high tide line it the tide is going to come in take it away now the Lord is not against us building sand castles as long as we remember our sand castles that's right if you start using some cement on your sand castle you're going to be disappointed the tide of time is going to take it away and he's going to let the tide come in sooner because everything here is temporal it's designedly that way so that we can go to a place that is not temporal for eternity amen now in the scripture we know that brother brenon brings us out as well that the Thousand Years as far as God's concerned is counted there's one day 2 Peter 3:8 it says beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a th years and a th000 years as one day and question answers the prophet said 1,000 years upon the Earth is only counted a time for a parable like to God as one day I just like the way he says that that's put it in there it's like a parable we like God knows what a thousand years is but as as far as he's concerned that's just one day two days it's it's it's no big deal you know and when he created the heavens and earth he did it brother says he took 6,000 years it didn't take him 6,000 years but he took 6,000 years but as far as he's concerned that was just 6 days just 6 days and then the seventh day he rested that's just one week seven in the countdown he says seven is the number of God's Perfection six days he made the Heaven and Earth and the seventh he rested in 6,000 years the world is to labor against sin or the church CH labor against sin and the seventh is the Millennium the Sabbath yeah I heard a preacher denominational preacher doctor so and so and uh he was saying about the creation is 6 24-hour days okay I have to listen to this you know we have a more sure word of Prophecy but I wanted to hear what he had to say and he said uh so because it says the morning and the evening of the first day and the morning in the evening of the second day and even scoffield says in his notes all that means in the Bible and it uses it in other places it means that there was a definite beginning and a definite end and a definite beginning and a definite end to each phase when he made the animals and when he made the different things that he made they had a beginning of that part phase of creation and an ending and he moved on to the next the next next so um that's that was the morning and the evening so that was his first part of the argument and the next thing he says well the fossil records the fossil records prove that it all happened uh then because something had to die and nothing could die until the fall so that sounded all right too but it's not what the prophet said so brother renim tells us that there was a previous creation before our creation he calls it a previous civilization and there may have been many we don't know because that's in between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 what he was doing we don't really know but we can see in the fossil record that there was many things there was dinosaurs all sorts of things were here we don't know about that but what we do know is that they all died that's right and brother Brenham tells us this and this is a little bit of if you like Tony Murray Theology and I'll just tell tell you that just right now but um brother bam does tell us though he says that God in his nature doesn't create something to destroy it it's not in his nature to do that he makes something that's why he gave freedom of choice but when the freedom of choice means that people corrupt something if it's corrupted it has to die maybe I tell you this too while I'm at it and I trying to remember to come back to that but uh most churches really the way that they teach the Garden of Eden they teach it as if they teach God as a narcissist they teach him that that he says here in the Garden of Eden you have all this fruit to his children you can eat whatever you like but if you touch the apples I'm going to kill you well no father would do that that's not how God is he said let every seed bring forth after its kind but if you hybrid it it will have to die it cannot live forever and the moment Humanity became hybrid it had to die so Satan somehow in the previous civilizations he was already Lucifer already dealing with God already I believe this is the B that I said is my my thinking on this already uh God was somehow training him that if he perverted something it had to come to an end it had to come to an end because and we find that the Earth had come to an end and everything was void of life and darkness upon the face of the deep when he started with our creation so the devil was here long before we were and something was going on and brother Brenham I think uh Rebecca asked brother Brenham Rebecca um brother R's daughter said she we learned in school that there are millions and millions of years this world is old and she said isn't that contradict contradictory to the Bible I said no sir I said it isn't it says in the beginning might have been hundreds of billions of trillions of years eons of time but God created the Heaven and the Earth period that settles it that was the first step and he makes no mistakes I just wanted to say some of those things so you know that that the prophet actually speaks that that it was just the heavens and the earth and the the creation happened so so long ago but when he talks about our creation that's what happened 6,000 years amen so in God's economy of time the whole process from when he began our creation until the end of time is six is 2 weeks it's 2 weeks I'll show you like this first week started in Genesis 1: 12 the creation six days of creation seventh day he rested that's one week and then we have from the time of Adam until Noah was was 2,000 years that's 2 days from Noah until Christ 2,000 years 2 days from Christ until the time of the Rapture 2,000 years 2 days that's 6 days and then the Millennium seventh day that's another one week so two weeks the whole program of God and we're home amen amen all right now I want to talk a little bit about science you all with us all happy okay um from the science point of view a little bit of a disclaimer to start with you know brother Brenham talks against Science Education and so forth and I want to just probably probably explain a little bit how that is because science has a couple of uh things that they they're trying to achieve one is that they're wanting to brother says they they're interfering in God's laboratory they're hybriding things they're C causing uh genetic modifications of things brother and says it's just bringing death he says science is bad um and the thing that they're trying to do they're obsessed with this thing to try and prove that everything that is came from natural processes without a a a Divine creator that that's science the the the obsessed with that to try and prove that everything came without a Creator they they cannot do it they know they cannot do it but yet that's still the story that they try and sell to the public with if you go deep enough into the science you can ask anybody and I've done this uh I've worked with people people that are that are biologists and and all sorts of things and and we've gone into it in in depth and they say uh in reality the big questions where life came from why we're here where we're going science can't answer of course it can't answer because the answer is God and the Rapture message brother B says he says how education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of rag weeds the educational system science and civilization is of the devil amen so on that sense and that way that we just talked about that's true and Tim 1 Timothy 6:20 says oh Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoid profane and Vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so-called in other words not true science because true science is just discovering what God has already made so we with our PE brains are trying to understand what what the the mind of Jehovah God has actually made and we can just only scratch the surface but we can still enjoy what we can see it's what God made we were somewhere the other way other day and there was a little little boy little toddler and he had a great big basketball for him it was pretty big compared to him and he would he would throw it and immediately would make him sit down and he go and pick it up again he throw it and I sit him down he he he was doing science that's what he's doing he was discovering Newton's third law to every action there's a reaction sit them down but we all do those things you know we you discover things that's that's why we don't don't get so badly hurt on different things because you realize there's an action and a reaction so that's on that basis that's what I want to look through brother brandham himself he he said he went to a lecture I don't think Einstein was actually there I think it was a recording but he says he went to a lecture of Einstein and he listened to what he had to say and he was he was intrigued by that because he said you know uh Einstein was telling him saying that if somebody went out at at almost the speed of light not quite but near the speed of light for 150 million light years and then turned around they came back for 150 million light years when they came back they'd only be gone 50 years oh that sounds strange but to everybody on the earth it would seem like they've gone 300 million years but to the person that was on the spacecraft it would seem like they've only been away 50 years so it would be possible to actually leave the Earth if you went fast enough on a spacecraft when you come back you could be younger than your [Laughter] son that's true it's not actually just a theory it's actually is true yeah so time itself the science calls it the fourth dimension and right through this place here where this church is people have walked through here people have planted crops through here people have probably built houses through here and we don't see any of them because that we're separated by the dimension of time they were right here but they're not here right now because it's a different time and that's the only thing that Dimension is separating us the three dimensions is not the problem it's the fourth dimension of time that is separating us from them in fact Einstein he said he made a little statement which was kind of humorous he said time is what stops everything happening all at once so we're kind of glad about that but time is not constant and that's what I was saying about this travel business time is not constant it's dependent on your speed and it's dependent on what they call the gravitational potential so how much gravity we're under it actually slows time or they call it it dilates time it makes a difference so when they send a satellite out maybe for the GPS it's sented out from the surface of the Earth and it has it's in a less gravitational effect but it's going faster and and the less gravity means that time on that satellite goes faster by so many NS but then then the fact that it's traveling faster time goes slower and then they've still got to correct because it's the uh the amount that is different from the face of the Earth they've got to correct it's something like 14 NCS they've got to change the time on the GPS satellite so that it works on Earth so that you could get to church if you didn't know how to get here cuz otherwise your GPS would lead you wrong and if it was 1 second out your GPS would be 186,000 Mi wrong which is 7 and a half times around the earth so you you want those satellites to be right or you're not going to be here on time so that's just how it works all right yeah I've got that quote there about uh he was listening to a lecture from Einstein I'll just skip on here now we can't keep time very well uh ourselves because although we do have to have a body clock but if you were put say in a cave somewhere where there was no natural light our our Cadian Rhythm which is the Natural Body clock it clicks at about 25 hours in a day so by the time you done one month you would have lost a day so we're not very good at keeping time ourselves and there's a spiritual significance to that because a lot of people think I know where I'm at I I know but unless unless our body clock is aligned every day with the light from the sun within a month we're whole day out that's right unless spiritually we have something that aligns us regularly with the day in which we're living the Sun for our day we're going to get way out I know two churches one of them that think they're in the Millennium and one of them that doesn't think we're in the end time they more than a day out that's right so we need to know and back in the day when they the first sailing ships came out with navigation time was the thing that stopped them being able to navigate initially they had a sailing ship they could Sail Out out under the sea they could as long as they could see the coast they knew where they were but if they left the coast suddenly without time they didn't know where they were because you need time say the Greenwich Mean meantime or grenwich Meridian which travels through Greenwich right down the length of the Earth when you say the time at Greenwich when it's noon at Greenwich and then you're further around the earth and you say well now you see the sun's up here it's noon here well how long since it was noon at Greenwich and however far around you are if you're around there and you're 1 hour later than so your noon is 1 hour later than noon was at Greenwich you know that you're 15° west of Greenwich but they didn't have a Time so they didn't know where they were and eventually the clocks that came in they had pendulums there was no good on a ship and and then they came up with a a windup one that had a spring and suddenly they could navigate and brother R said even about all those things as far as being able to navigate around the world he says you know that's when they went out and colonized the world and everybody talks about oh how bad that was they colonized all these different places for brotherr and says yeah but God used that to spread the gospel he head to allow them to invent a clock so that they could navigate so they could cross the ocean so that they could spread the gospel everything is ticking right on time am me yeah exactly that's pretty good so in this last day now we've got atomic clocks and atomic clocks you know man's pretty clever but he's only discovering and he's only tapping into what God has already done there's a there's an atom an element it's called cesium 133 and the the between the nucleus of the atom and the electrons it vibrates continuously at at a constant rate and atomic clocks use that vibration and count how many times it vibrates per second and it's completely absolutely constant and just so that you if you want to do a little bit of counting it it vibrates every second at 9,192,631,770 times a second and it counts that and it says 1 second and now we go on to the next and it's so accurate that it will only it'll be 1 second out after 300 million years wow wow but we're just tapping into what God actually created yeah he's accurate amen praise the Lord all right the prophet tells us you know he talking about times and seasons and so forth tells us that we have the seasons because of the time of Noah that the Earth tipped over at the time of the flood so we know these things we just keep moving along amen uh in this the times and season Jesus speaks about it uh let's go to acts 1:6 it says uh when they the disciples therefore come together they asked him saying Lord wil th at this time res restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the father put in his own power now a little later on we're going to find that to the scribes and Pharisees he say you should have known the signs of the times though but but to the disciples they saying are you going to restore the kingdom now and he says actually it's not for you to know the church ages right now that's what he telling them you don't know you don't know the times the season so it's because everybody down Through the Ages until it got to us thought they were in the last days all the Believers all of the Bride thought they're in the last days and technically they were because it's only two days they were in the last days but but as far as the coming of the Lord the catching of the Bride no one knew when that was going to be only this age like wow we're we're blessed you know but he really the prophet explains that he did that because it kept them kept them fervent if they said oh it's going to be like 1500 years till the Lord comes they might have not they might have been slack you know but we're thankful that he's made that known to us in this day and then to the the Pharisees he rebuked them because they couldn't discern the signs of the times the Pharisees also with the sedes came and tempting him decid that he would show them a sign from heaven what a silly thing to say he was a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it'll be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it'll be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left them and departed and brother Bram says the sign of the Prophet Jonas was the sign of the Resurrection because as Jonas was 3 days in the belly of the whale so was Christ going to be 3 days in the heart of the earth and then he was going to raise up again but he said but that sign was actually going to be to the wicked and adulterous generation and the prophet said he was prophesying of today this is the wicked and adulterous generation you you can't imagine you can't look through history and find a more adulterous generation than we live in right now that is actually adultery is the normality of the of the rest of the world it absolutely that's just that is we have to accept that that is normal for other people but it's not normal in God's economy a wicked adult generation and in this age this is when the Lord himself has come down demonstrated that he is here the same type of ministry the same type of Miracles the same type of gift that he did before the Risen Lord has identified himself in this day through the message of the hour amen as far as time the Gentiles and slide here we've got as you'll have seen this before Daniel saw Nebuchadnezzar's dream and explained it to him the head of gold and the shoulders of silver and belly of brass and the legs of iron and clay and the feet of part or the legs of iron and the feet of part iron and Clay I've just put this up here to say nothing is out of cater the Lord told Daniel via nebuchad is's dream that there's going to be these kingdoms it has to play out this way just you rest you're going to go and sleep but at the all this is going to play out to the end time and here we are we've seen that played right out and we see brother REM says and these the feet of iron and Clay is Roman Catholicism and the protestantism that's throughout the world and is is gaining more power actually by the day and eventually we're going to be the target of that power that's just true okay now this might seem a little strange but here we are we're in in the dimension of time but as Christians were actually multi-dimensional beings we we think we have a we got a physical body but we know that actually the prophet tells us we have a theophonic realm somebody hears that audible sound waves they convert it they think about what you said they think about it in spirit realm and you know when you hear from the Lord brother says you're hearing from your theophany you're hearing from another dimension again amen the prophet says here and uh who this milisic you bypassed your theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies and then lat a little later on he says then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image image of the Living God you heard from your theophany amen you have been formed into the image the living image of the Living God Amen wow am you heard from your theophany amen praise the Lord all right now just for a few minutes we're going to talk about times of trouble is that okay times of trouble and if you haven't had any you're not alive you're a zombie because the whole purpose of us being here is that we have some things to overcome and sometimes people say no one understands me you know what that's absolutely true you're you're right no one understands you because you don't understand yourself I don't understand myself who can understand the heart of a man see only God and he's your your trials are custom made just for you but I tell you what when you get like I'm I'm 58 now and I've had a lot of different trials along the way I did I had leukemia at one stage and I've had all sorts of different things go on in life but all of those things are now behind me and I really don't give it much thought because that that's a hurdle that we came over and everyone's got a story and say some of those hurdles were so big that we said there's just no way around this this this is insurmountable but they they're now all behind me and that's the Lord's faithful he says he's faithful he he allows trials to come but he's faithful he's with us he won't allow us to be tried above something that we can stand amen all righty so I'm going to look here just a little bit at Solomon and uh out of Ecclesiastes again and and the despair that he comes to and when he considers all that is in life in this human life and he if you read through Ecclesiastes he's like he says I've tried this I've done this I've built houses I've planted Vineyards and I've done this and he almost like as if I've done it for your sake I've tried everything for your sake and I found it's all vanity and vexation of spirits it's just a waste of time so let's just read this here I'm not going to leave you hanging with despair okay but I want to tell you that this is the the Viewpoint from natural man okay so Ecclesiastes 3:10 says I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it and then in Ecclesiastes 2:15 he says and I said in my heart as it happeneth to a fool so happeneth even to me and why was I then more wise and I said in my heart that is also that ALS that this also is Vanity and there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fo forever seeing that which is which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool therefore I hated life because the work that is wrought Under the Sun is Grievous unto me for all is Vanity and vexation of spirit yay I hated all my labor which I taken under the sun because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me and who knoweth whether he will be shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored and wherein I have shown myself wise Under the Sun this also is Vanity therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took Under the Sun oh what a sad story oh he done many great things you know the porch of Solomon and all the different things and he built the house of the Lord and so wow what a great man it's all is Vanity vexation of spirits frustration to him job Sayes a man that's born a woman is a few days and full of trouble but job then he starts to start to see a purpose and he says in verse uh 5:1 17 behold happy is the man whom God correct therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty for he maketh sore and he bindeth up he wounde and his hands make whole he shall deliver thee in six troubles yay in seven and there shall no evil touch thee wow his his his eyes is starting to come open to these different things and then we jump into the New Testament and and they take take it to a completely new level James 1:2 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations okay I just want to ask a question uh who does that when you fall in this is not uh even even great trials this is Temptations ever been tempted Jesus was tempted but the Bible says count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and if you lack wisdom let him if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him amen and then 1 Peter 1 wherefore you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire may be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen the Paradox of it is that God can do more in your life through adversity than he can through Prosperity yeah it it seems seems like a painful Paradox but adversity is where he does great things in your life and often that often one of the hardest trials that we go through is we have to wait we have to wait why do we have to wait for this and wait for that and wait you know some days when you're kind of going through that you come up to the traffic lights they'll always turn red oh wait and you go in there and you go to the the store and then you get in the C I have to wait in the you and and the person that you sto behind they've got the biggest trolley you know it's like wait everything's waiting but the reason all that's happening is that we're in time for only a little time and the Lord has to make use of this time to create the character that's in you it's custom made amen adversity is more value to you than prosperity for our light AFF fiction Affliction this is 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding in Eternal weight of Glory remember like I was saying about the Lord Jesus how that he in this dimension in time he achieved something which is eternal Eternal salvation in Corinthians here it's saying the light Affliction which is but for a moment it's working something in time and in this finite Dimension which is a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory wow to me that that's profound that he can use something which is finite temporal and and even in our such limited capacity but he's making something which is of Eternal weight of glory amen and 1 Peter 4:12 beloved not think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy amen if somebody who got the Olympics on at the moment and I don't take much uh stock on that myself but uh if you were going to be going to the Olympics as a weightlifter then the first time you lifted weights would not be at the Olympics you you said I'm going to save my energies for them no you would practice you would train you would but there's one thing about the training you would be careful not to overdo it I worked with a man and he was doing weights or something in a gy and he ripped the muscle off his arm and that took about a year to come right so he overdid it but you know the Lord is arranging this weightlifting he's arranging this training exercise and in 1 Corinthians 10:13 it says theath no temptation taken you but such is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it so the things that we go through he says I'm I'm limiting them to your ability when he gave out the talents remember he said he gave them according to your several ability when the man came say it was just too much for me he said no it wasn't I gave it according to your several ability amen and so I saw somebody had uh made this statement I quite liked it it says God gives his strongest battles to his strongest soldiers so when you think I'm going through such a hard battle no one else is going through it so he's just credited you as one of his strongest soldiers yeah and if you look and see what the Lord Jesus went through and if you look and see what all the prophets went through they went through the hardest battles the strongest soldiers got the hardest battles amen all right in the Masterpiece message if we've got that there he says speaking to his bride here he say she stands [Music] alone uh she stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of man despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his Masterpiece he's making another Masterpiece I think I've got another quote on that at the moment and you know when when uh when job was here God actually set up that trial for job it was not it was not Satan that did that that was God that did that he's going Satan have you considered my servant job you know we be thinking the Lord should be protecting him keeping Satan away and that's what Satan said you are keeping me away he said no no no come and have a look there's no one like him in the land god starts bragging on job he he starts he starts needling the devil about job he's such a great man there's no one in the earth like him so Satan he says you can Satan says well I can't get to him God says you can but don't take his life but God sets it up this way because as job was a great man and God was impressed with job but God said I can make him greater I can make him twice what he is by by giving him a trial that he becomes an overcomer and job was twice the man that he was at the beginning and right now the Lord is bragging on his bride he is behind the scenes he and Satan are having a conversation he's bragging on you sometimes that causes our trials he's making something beautiful out of your life yeah that's true and I heard somebody say this too and I I can identify with it being true if you had a choice of all the different trials that that are available which ones would you pick would you pick brother so and so's trials brother sister so- and so's trials well you'd pick your own own trials so leukemia would you choose that well I'm on the other side of that now so he say praise the Lord I'm glad that I've been through that experience and he delivered me I'm glad to have that on my record he's the delivering God you know when I was I was lying in hospital and only certain simple scriptures could come to me I couldn't think too well are pumping me full of drugs and things but Romans 8:28 just stood out all things work together for the good all things and I thought that all things that means right now all things and I got myself up out of the bed I was there by myself in the isolated room for 7 weeks and I stood up I said Thank You Lord all things it means that right now this is for my good tears running down my face and the presence of the Lord just came down on the room and when my wife came back and I said I'm going to be well presence of the Lord's been here all things are working together for good he wants to hear his bride quoting his word amen that's just that's what it's all about amen everybody else you know walks away cuz I think part of the reason just maybe the final thing about trials that the trials that we go through sometimes they're filters because the elect is going to carry on regardless the elect cannot quit that's right like Peter to whom shall we go there the words of eternal life that this quitting is just not in the equation the bride is always going to go but others though 10,000 fall at my side oh they've left the message oh they've left the message oh look it's I got blinkers on I know in whom I have believed amen praise the Lord and brother renam says here in this greatest battle ever fought I forgot that there these two armies when the enemy comes in like a flood as it's coming today what did God say he'd do the spirit of God would raise up a standed against it and the prophet said are you one of them when the enemy comes and are you one of those ones that God's going to raise up as a standard amen praise the Lord like Joshua as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord I'm going to try and hurry here now but uh Esther if you remember the story of Esther and uh when Mori came to her and said you know there was trouble for the Jews she said he said maybe it's for this very purpose that you were raised up who knoweth where Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this he says Deliverance is going to come to the Jews from somewhere but maybe you've actually been put in this place right now for such a time as this that you would make a stand and in the breach there brother R talks about I'm not going to read it to you but he talks about the seven horns that were on the lamb that was slain in in the Book of Revelation and he says that the horns were the Lamb's protection and he said it's a god group it's a Gods sent group of people that are th is the protection of the word we are the protection of the word in this day amen maybe you're just a bit quiet shall I read it to you so you know that I'm telling you the truth seven horns was the was the seven churches see the seven Church ages because that was the Lamb's protection what he protected his rights with on earth a God sent group of people that's protected amen see the horn on the lamb seven eyes eyes of the seven messengers of the seven Church ages seven eyes seven seers so there is a role for us to take we are the protection of this word in this day amen because somebody's going to live it when it comes Judgment Day people say nobody could live this message all all these people did and you know we're talking about Esther then talk about vashy vashy she she would have intended to go back to the king at some point because she was the queen but she wasn't going to go then she wasn't go going to go and he asked because she was having a girls party and she'll go in her own good time and a lot of people treat God like that it's just not going to walk it doesn't work God's not going to play sick and Fiddle to anyone when he calls we need to respond Amen brother brandom this is out of the prayer line I wanted to read this to you uh this is Faith by experience there's a kidney trouble lady lady right back there with kidney condition you believe God makes you well lady if you do raise up your hand accept it and then he says respond to God's call you missed it I'll show you whether you missed it or not it falls on this lady sitting right here with the handker chief over her mouth this lady sitting right here had back trouble too isn't that right lady didn't it yes sir you just come for an operation a cancer operation that's right your name is Virginia that's right you are healed Virginia Jesus Christ makes you well and then he says you missed it Mr Anderson because you didn't respond see see oh how much can you unbelieve you see the sovereignty of God when God calls like for the young people don't just don't just be ho hum don't don't be uh just casual about the things of God he's calling but he won't be calling forever it's like we need to respond you know I gave my heart to the Lord when I was a 7 years old and I and I my testimony may be compared to a lot of other people come out all sorts of other things might not sound very great but it should be the greatest testimony we're kept by the power of God Amen that's what we want we want to be kept by the power of God it can keep you I gave my heart to the Lord when I was seven but all the way through as keeping power has been upon my life and I'm so thankful for that and some people you know have complained you know about all all the legality in the message and not allowed to do this and not allowed to do that for a while that that to me that was a school Master it stopped me from getting a worldly girlfriend it stopped me from going to parties it stopped me from getting into drink and to drugs and smoking it stopped me from all that you say because the prophet said don't so like we don't but there came a time a little later on where actually came into me it it was my own personal revelation yeah I was filled with the spirit of God say I don't want to do those things but I don't have to look back and say oh now I did all that see the school Master Paul say don't despise a school Master just don't stay there even for for children growing up in the house don't don't make mom and dad always be the school Master get the Revelation yourself get get your own relationship with God that you want to do what's right amen and then you'll be say oh I'm thankful for the school Master amen yeah so we want to respond to the word amen the prophet uh talks about Redeeming the time here uh firstly the scripture Ephesians 5:15 it says see then that you walk circumspectly which means carefully purposefully accurately not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil and out of his wonders to perform 958 the prophet says the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we ought uh the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings we have too much time to watch television too much time to read the newspaper or listen to something that we ought not to be listening to but we are not Redeeming the time we're giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus and the Bible said man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Christians live on the word amen all right in this uh day I was got a scripture here about the Watchmen that was that's the next one here but um I just want to jump ahead and say the Watchman for this age is the prophet of this age you know the the real word Watchman is where we get the word watch they can tell the time that was one thing that the Watchmen could do they would see if there's storms and see if there's troubles coming but they could tell the time Watchmen what of the night is it's such and such an hour he can tell the time the message that we have in this day we want to know the time this this message identifies the time that we're in and then you have a Watchman for the church we have a pastor for the church he's a Watchman over the church he's a Shepherd of the flock he says if you want to know whether something is appropriate for the time ask the Watchmen and then in each household if you have a Godly father he's a Watchman for that household it's designed need to know the time that we're living in and need to know of the dangers that are ahead okay just about finished here but I want to talk about the real purpose of it brother Brenham says the only thing that we take from here is character right that's the only thing that we take through time and out into eternity is character out of the SM Church age and I think we've got that uh slide there brother smon and church age that was uh oh yep that's it Okay the reason in uh the reason this is brother and say in Romans 8:17 18 then of children then ears ears of God and Joint ears with Christ so if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and then he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign I know you know these scriptures but just let's read this the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a a man without character cannot Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sit down with his in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Victory tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh the treasures that are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen amen and you know the prophet when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw all the people that were over there and they said oh we're so thankful that you came we're so thankful that you came with the message because now that that entered in Beyond the Veil it was all worthwhile amen it was all worthwhile then all right I'm going to just skip on because I feel that we need uh let's go to the time is oh I haven't got a quote for this here but time is fleeting time we often if we look forward to something coming it seems to take so long but the moment that arrives it passes so quick right it's just gone and then it's forever is is history or our history so when when looking forward to something where it's like oh yeah it just seems to drag out drag out brother R says man's always praising God for what he has done and always looking forward to what he's going to do but failing to recognize what he's doing right now and I wanted to say that to say this that the now seems so insignificant now what's what is God doing in your life today it seems insignificant but it is making history it's going on your record and as far as saying even when say brother Chad when he's ministering the word you may say oh I've heard that before heard that before it's the now is the only bit that can do you any good because if it's still waiting for it or if it's now in history it can't do any good it's the moment of now is when we can be stared and we need to be aware of the now because yesterday and tomorrow are always going to be Out Of Reach it's only now that we get to make a decision it's only now that we get to make a change in our direction of where we're going we want to use the now for the purpose of God all right um job says uh in job 7 he says what do man that thou should us Magnify Him and th should us set thine heart upon him and th should us visit him every morning and try him every moment and the prophet said he says in the SM Church age he may commit you to suffering as he did job that's his prerogative It's he is Sovereign but it's all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he'd be the author of frustration and not the author of Peace his purpose is that after we've suffered a while that we will be made perfect be established strengthen settled as job said he put strength in US you see he himself suffered and learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered and just to wrap up like this firstly I said God needed an enemy he needs us to have the different trials and different things that we go through so that we can become Overcomers so that he can credit you with being an overcomer and he can say Well done because you cannot say if you had somebody working for you and they just sat on the chair all day and did nothing you would never say Well done but you may want to be saying well done to them but you're wanting them to do something well before you can say Well done and that's exactly what the way it is with God he's got all these different little hurdles that he allow allows in our lives and I've previously I preached a message artificial difficulties they artificial things that he puts there and you have to overcome them and he says well done well done because the natural consequences of living a Christian life would be love joy peace rest long so everything is going great for Christian that's the natural consequences of living a Christian Life and we know that because when we get to heaven that's why it's going to be so when you see a trial and and a trouble come along that's not a natural consequence that is that is ordained of God to it's it's a credit in Waiting he's like I'm going to give you credit for this one that's right but it's a hurdle so don't despise those things just commit it to the Lord ask him to help you and he says it's not going to be Beyond you it's just custom made amen and really in reality it's the unbelievers that we should feel sorry for should drive us to want to share this gospel because to the Believers to the elect everything that happens to you is for a purpose every little thing is for a purpose that's what Romans 8:28 says all things all things are happening for good to them that love God the called according to his purpose so but to the unbelievers when they have an accident when they have a Calamity it truly is a Calamity that's right most of the world is stage support for the bride think about it Millions brother bam says are going to lose their lives in a nucle holocaust millions and millions are going to be counted as Canon fod for this atomic age he says but they have to be there you know what stage support is right if you have a drama and you have all the different things behind you the they got the trees and they've got this and all the even the different actors that are just like the secondary actors so that the main actor can come out on stage that you need the stage support the rest of the world is stage support right for the Bride of Jesus Christ to develop the character of Jesus Christ and then she can go home in the wedding supper go home in the Rapture to be with him forever more amen that's that's the whole purpose and plan of our time here in time and just in closing to bring a little balance I believe St John he John the Revelator he had this uh he had the spirit of Christ when he wrote this he said beloved I wish above all things that there mayest prosper and be in health 3D John 1:2 yeah beloved I wish above all things that there mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth I believe that's the will of God he wants everything to go well for you he wants you to be aild your s castles he wants you to enjoy life he wants you to have joy he wants you to be happy enjoying the the the blessings of God but there are times when you have to go through something that's going to build this character Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end why we should take courage we should be thankful for that Jesus himself in Matthew 18:7 says woe unto the world the stage support because of offenses for it must needs be that offense has come but woe unto that man by whom the offense cometh amen and perhaps we don't have time really to go through this but Ecclesiastes the scripture we read at the beginning um we kind of think that you know that was uh Solomon talking about All the Troubles of man but if you read it through with the thought brother R says that uh the whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ he has a bride so I'll just read the first few verses to you again to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven a time to be born and he was a time to die and he did a time to be planted and he was John 12:24 says very very I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit a time to pluck up that's the Harvest Time A Time to Kill Satan's coming to an end a time to heal to heal his people a time to break down Revelation 18 it says with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all a time to build up Ephesians 2:20 says and the Saints are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone sorry brother I haven't got these on here so I can see you searching for it a time to weep remember Jesus brother says the human emotion that Jesus expressed most was that he wept he wept often A Time To Laugh the prophet says when we get to the other side he said we can everyone sit under your own fig tree and laugh and rejoice forever in his presence when he comes back as king a time to mourn and a time to dance in the Psalms David says there has turned me from mourning into dancing a time to Cast Away Stones you know John 8:7 it says he that is with without sin among you let him come asked the first stone ader I think there was a lot of casting away of stones going on right then you [Laughter] know yeah time to gather Stones together David gathered some Stones together brother bam said it was faith in Jesus yeah wrought the victory amen all right I I'll read the rest of them we're almost done a time to embrace brother REM says if you receive him Embrace him love him and hold him in your heart and love him a time to refrain from embracing when any religious people Embrace both nism and bism and have the political financial and and physical power to back it up there's only one direction they can go that direction is right into Jezebel Doctrine that's a time to refrain from embracing a time to get Proverbs says get wisdom that's the principal thing and all I get and get understanding that's getting Revelation a time to lose whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it a time to keep he that overcometh and keepeth my words to the end to him will I give power over the Nations amen a time to Cast Away brother brenham's praying and he says may the power of the devil be broken the Holy Spirit fall upon the audience and Cast Away the evil spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ a time to R and a time to sow I believe that's what the prophet did it was a rending of the false teachings but it was a sewing together of all the loose ends in this last day a time to keep silence remember Revelation 8:1 when it opened the seventh seal there was a silence half an hour and there's a time to speak that's when the spirit and the bride say come amen it's a time to speak a time of love this whole message is the love letter of Christ to his bride it's it's the coming of the son of man the marriage of Christ and his bride amen the Rapture to take her and him to the wedding supper of the Lamb the millennium the honeymoon brother Ram says and then their future home all together it's a love story this period in time is the love story when he Woos his bride he saves his bride he redemtion for his bride he makes the character in his bride that she can spend with him for eternity that's what he wants that's that's the whole purpose of it being here then it says a time to hate Revelation 2 6 says this thing they haest they hatest the Deeds of the L nians which I also hate a time of War that's going to be the Battle of Gog and Magog that's the last war and then a time of peace and that's the Millennium amen amen Christ is the mystery of God revealed in this last day but the bride is also is the the mystery of Christ revealed amen we see that that's what's taking place in this day in which we're living that he's actually wanting the very character that was developed in him to to be developed in her so that she becomes him amen Christ in you the hope of glory that's what it is brother R says here in the rising of the sun we are just closing folks he says uh as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life she is him amen amen amen and for out of the Masterpiece for nearly 2,000 years God has been making himself a masterpiece because he struck Adam to get a piece off of him a part of him a rib to make him a w a wife for him now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled see the New Testament and the new and old is husband and wife am it's a glorious position but there's a process we got to go through to become like him amen and it taken the old to for fores show the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece is in making now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam the second Eve ready now to return back to their home amen the whole picture has been Redemption from where it was bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back that's back to Eternity again amen and then he says soon time will fade into eternity we believe we're ending up this world's history and soon time will fade into eternity we want to be ready for that hour if there's anything that we can say that would encourage you be ready for that now amen he said soon time will be no more Time and Eternity will blend together when God and his people Blends together Ah that's what it's all about this time is just going to run out but it's going to run out when time when God and his people blend together then there's no more need for time and then we're back into eternity forever so This Time and Eternity will blend together when God and his people Blends together and we pray God that at this time at that time that will be numbered among those that will BL be blended into Christ that's called his bride amen the prophet tells us also here he says that when we get there on the other side we won't even remember the concept of getting old now to the young people that's not a big deal but for a lot of us that's a big deal but you won't even be able to understand what it is to get old prise God because you're thinking you need Turnal terms so of course we're young what what do you mean young you know we're just this is just the age we are see that's just how it will be I want to close here I trust that there's something there you you've got out of that but just to see that we are uh we're just a passing through it's like if you could draw it out as a box we come from eternity we've got to come through this experience the Bible says that even Jesus himself was perfected through the things that he suffered so how can God himself be perfected and the way that it is that in eternity he never did have anybody that was battling against him he did never had anybody that was belittling him imagine belittling Jehovah God that's somebody that was saying you know nothing you are nothing and he allowed himself he humbled himself till he yet you allowed them to nail him onto a cross that happened in time but actually he was winning the greatest victory that ever has been one and he says and my bride's going to come through the same process but I'm going to be with her I'm going to walk through the corridors of Glory with her this is my redeemed bride but this is my Victorious bride this is my overcoming bride and she and me we're one we're co-equal that's what it is the bride is co-equal with Christ in glory because she's been through the exactly the same process so don't despise the Journey Don't despise the trials they're working something in you which has an eternal weight of glory amen and I want to close with this prayer it's brother brenham's prayer maybe if you'd like to stand with us ask brother Chad if you'd come and it's out of the deep call us the Deep message brother and preach this and I I find it very moving when he when he prays this prayer but he says and when all of life is over here on Earth the last prayer has been prayed and the battles are all done the Smoke's dried up and gone away arms is stacked the Bible's closed and we come up to your house that great morning breaks Eternal bright and fear when the chosen ones are G Shall Gather to their home beyond the skies as the poet said Lord as we see that great table stretched out there for that suppe out thousands of miles long looking across the table at each other battle scarred vetrans tears of joy running down our cheeks the king comes out and his Beauty Holiness walk down along the the table and take his own hands and wipe the tears from her eyes saying don't cry no more it's all over enter into the joys of the Lord he said the toils of the road will seem nothing then father when we get to the end of the way amen amen amen God bless you you know the purpose of time is really that has been to equip and I've got a slide there to be to equip the King and Queen of Heaven of Heaven and Earth with the character to rule and Reign for all eternity and really we are the purpose of time in this age amen God bless you each one we love you in the Lord look forward to seeing this afternoon Amen brother J God bless you brother God bless you will this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door I can't feel at home in this world anymore and oh Lord you know that I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore well they're all expecting me and that's one thing I know I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago I know he'll see me through though I am weak and poor and I can't feel at home in this world anymore and oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I came can't feel at home in this world anymore just over in glory land we will live eternally the Saints on every hand are shouting Victory the songs of sweetest praise drift back from Heaven Shore and I can't feel at home in this world anymore and oh Lord you know will I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home well then Lord what will I do the Angels Beck in me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world Amen I'm so glad to know that time is only a box that we pass into pass through and come out of have gained something feels like every day we lose something is that right more troubles more trials more difficulties we we lose hair for some of us it turns gray we lose the years we lose strength we we we we we give up so much but we don't realize in it all we're gaining so much and the whole purpose is for gaining I don't know about you but I'm encouraged I'm encouraged to go back and face tomorrow I'm so I'm encouraged to wake up Monday morning and do Monday morning things because it's all part of God's Eternal purpose amen thank you brother God bless you it's encouraging to me it's the experience that we all have it's the life that we all live and it puts it all into a greater perspective it's not just drudgery it's not just one difficult circumstance to another it's molding and making a bride fit to rule and reign with Christ oh you know it's the things that have no purpose that are hard that are so daunting it's the things that make us hopeless and bring us to despair how many of felt hopeless in despair if you felt hopeless and despair it's because the thing
