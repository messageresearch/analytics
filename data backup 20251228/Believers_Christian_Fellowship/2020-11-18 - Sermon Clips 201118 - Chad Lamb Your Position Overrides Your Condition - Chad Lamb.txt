========================================

the only place to have joy the only place to have victory the only place to overcome is in the secret of the tabernacle because out there are enemies that want to eat his flesh out there there are foes that are gathered around out there is every force that would try to destroy him but the place of rejoicing the place of joy amen the place of security the place of safety is in the pavilion in the secret of the tabernacle up upon the rock and that is our position friends and our position in this rapture cycle transcends our condition our position amen is overriding our condition because it doesn't matter what condition we're in you can be sick you can you can have complications you can have distresses you can have work pressures but your position overrides your condition your conditions should never override your position you can see because there's been a place provided for us because there's been a rock that has been revealed to us in this day the revelation of jesus christ christ the mystery of god revealed opened amen as the seals were open now there's a place up on a rock up above our enemies where our head can be lifted up and then we can go into the pavilion of the lord and through the chambers of the lord into the secret chamber of the lord to the secret place of the tabernacle and in there we have joy and there we have rejoicing and there we have shouting and there we have security and there we have peace and there we're feasting with the lamb feasting on the lamb eating the manna that has been preserved seated with christ jesus in heavenly places but i want to tell you in this day that's the only place to be everywhere else amen will bring distress amen we'll bring stress amen we'll bring depression we'll bring anxiety we'll bring fear i say if god has provided us a place in this rapture cycle then it behooves us to stay in that place and the whole goal of the enemy is to get us to look outside and the war now the struggle is just to stay in the place that's provided
