Lorraine to minister for brother Nathaniel sias but they've been struck with sickness again sister Susan is sick and uh brother Gabe is experiencing some pain in his neck and shoulders and ankles I just want to have special prayer I believe brother Gabe's been doing damage to the kingdom of the devil lately and the enemy is not happy amen been plaguing their family with sickness and and he's planning on ministering this weekend and so I'd like as an assembly to hold him up before the Lord so let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the privilege of standing

Gabe you've called him to minister your word and he's being called by a a pastor in Lorraine to come and help the assembly there and we see the enemy trying to derail but oh God nothing will stop stop your Divine Purpose but God you called on us to see with our eyes to hear with our ears and to pray with our mouth for Lord there was a time that you saw the field widen the Harvest and you knew there was a need for Laborers but you told your disciples look into the field now you pray to the Lord of the Harvest God you know this need and Lord there's a plan but God you're calling us to see with our eyes to hear with our ears and then pray with our mouth so that you can move on the scene and so we are asking you to touch our brother gave and relieve his pain whatever has gone wrong in his neck and his shoulder Lord and with his ankles I pray that you'd bring that body correct Lord that you would do the alignment for you who built the spine and every muscle and every fiber of his being Lord you can write every wrong God you who who made the organs to work in the immune system Lord you can work in his the health of his body and his and and his family Lord that you can fight off this sickness and you can Purge Lord that sickness out of their bodies we believe it in Jesus Christ's name we ask it Lord that you would defeat your enemy in all of his Works Lord and that you would give them health and strength that you would anoint his ministry and that you would bless the Believers there in Lorraine God bless us tonight as we look into your word God pray Lord that you would just move this vessel out of the way may you take over lord and may you break the word Lord to your waiting sheep and may we gain strength and understanding by your word may we be equipped for this time life Lord may you use us Lord to spread the gospel To Shine the Light to be Lord your representation on this Earth help us father we ask you would take preeminence You' have your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all thank you musicians amen let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Matthew together Matthew chapter 10 just want to say God bless you brother Cornelius it was good to have you sing for us so you all got to meet brother Cornelius cuz he sang a song special amen God bless you brother he had a difficult Journey his journey was derailed and his flight was delayed he missed his flight to Amsterdam which made him uh that flight was late which made him miss his flight to the United States he had to stay the night in the airport catch a flight the next day he arrived one day late so I said oh that's always the precursor of good things amen good things are in store for our brother so pray for him that he gets his sleep and rest and has a good visit with us here he'll be leaving on Monday amen so he'll be with us for a week amen let's look at Matthew chap 10:38 together Matthew chapter 10 verse 38 and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me and he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find him he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward man God bless you as you're seated amen so we're going to cover some familiar territory this is not unfamiliar and I want to do a little bit of teaching amen tonight but I really had this on my heart uh I was going to go into this a little bit on Sunday but I just felt checked and and I'd carry it over today and I want to preach on a subject called Mercy extended beyond the bride Mercy extended beyond the the bride and uh we're going to talk about that here for a little while uh when we look at Matthew here it's very interesting when we come to to verse 40 he says he that receiveth you receiveth me what a scripture friends how many people want to receive Jesus but he said he that receiveth you receiveth me now all of a sudden he's he's he's he's doing he's giving something to his disciples he's giving something to his followers that's absolutely amazing he said if they receive you they receive me if they receive me they receive him that sent me amen what what what an amazing thing amen sometimes we want to go uh uh uh we don't know where Christ is but Christ is right here Among Us amen he's in a many membered body he said if they receive you he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now he starts talking about reward and the rewards are for the reception if they receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you'll receive a prophet's reward if you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man you receive a righteous man's reward but then he goes in down he says and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple it means just a disciple not not anybody with a a title just a disciple a cup of cold water amen verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward brother Brenham says in Elisha the prophet from 1956 he makes this statement so Jesus said if you give one of my disciples a cup of cold water at the Judgment it won't be forgotten we fail to see the power that God has placed in his people remember if you receive a prophet receive a righteous man he that receiveth you receiveth me all of the sudden amen the picture keeps getting clearer and clearer that we are his ambassadors on Earth we are his representation on Earth amen we are here to reflect his life that his life can live through these vessels we are flesh and bone of him now he says we fail to see the power that God has placed in his people God is in his people you believe that God was with his people one time when he walked on Earth but now God is in his people a little while the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for I personal pronoun now will be with you and in you to the end of the world God dwells moves Works in mankind amen so there's a tremendous blessing that goes with that let's turn to Genesis 19 we're we're going to look at this in a couple places here in the scriptures and then build on this thought like I said this is not a new subject we've been through this several times but I just wanted to bring it in relation to Mercy Genesis 19: 27 and in Genesis 19 God has told Moses that there's going to be a destruction of Sodom and Moses we we remember so clearly Moses starts bartering with the Lord amen to to hold off the destruction he starts saying but what if there's 50 righteous surely you wouldn't destroy it and God says for 50 I won't destroy it and they start this bartering process amen back and forth and then he comes back for 40 and then he comes back for 30 and he keeps working God down amen and and and you you begin to look and say what an interesting uh set of circumstances Abraham is here God has told him I'm going to destroy Sodom and Abraham is now now interceding for Sodom trying to find a way amen for God not to destroy Sodom and finally God stops the conversation said for 20 I won't do it and he walks away from Abraham amen we know he didn't find 20 so he destroys Sodom but do you have to wonder what was Abraham interceding for and we know what was in Abraham's heart Abraham had his family in his heart he had lot and his family was down there in Sodom and that was in Abraham's heart but we get here to verse 19 or chapter 19: 27 and it said and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and behold and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt God didn't remember lot God remembered Abraham it was good that lot was associated with Abraham because God remembered Abraham and sent lot out amen this goes back to the this goes back to the quote brother B said we fail to see the power that God has placed in his people if somebody gives a cup of cold water and to one of these little ones only in the name of the disciple he shall not lose his reward and brother Benham said it won't be forgotten at the Judgment yes and now lot is associated in life with Abraham being his nephew we know Abraham greatly loved him we know after his father died he took Abraham along when he left his home and came into the promised land and we know we know all of that amen and and lot got down into Sodom and he got into that situation there but Abraham had a heart for lot and when it came to the destruction of Sodom God remembered Abraham and sent lot out praise be to God and we are Seed of Abraham by faith we're in the same family we're in the same lineage amen he is our Father Abraham is the father of Faith he's our father we're children of Abraham by faith amen so we're in the same lineage let's go to Revelations chapter 20 we're going to take a look at the white Throne judgment we're going to spend some time looking at this Revelation chapter 20 we're going to start Revelation chap 20 we're going to start at verse 6 Revelation 20 and 6 blessed blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of God and of Christ Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so we know that the bride amen is in the first resurrection she comes up in the first resurrection amen and so the second death has no power over her and she'll be in the Millennium and she will be priest of God and of Christ shall reign with him a thousand years so she bypasses the judgment and will will not be coming up in the second Resurrection for the white Throne judgment she'll be at the white Throne judgment but she won't be in judgment we'll talk about that as well in just a moment so let's go down to uh uh verse 11 and pick up the white Throne judgment Revelation 2011 and I saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire so now we see a judgment being set we know this is the great white Throne judgment and when it's being said it said the books were open and another book which is The Book of Life and judgment and they're judged according to the things that are written in the books according to their Works amen this is not the Judgment of the Bride she bypass judgment amen but whatever is found written in the books and then they're judged thus and whoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire that is the white Throne judgment now we know the bride will never be there the the the C Gene of God will never be there let's go back to John chapter 5 and let's look at the reason why John chapter 5 in verse 24 John 5 and 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life so if you've heard his word and Believe on him that sent him you already have eternal life and shall not come into condemnation this word condemnation means judgment when we look at the definition of the word it's it's translated 48 times it's used 48 times in the New Testament 41 times it's translated judgment 41 out of 48 so it means judgment amen you shall not come into judgment but you've already already passed from death and the life there is nothing to judge in the bride she bypasses judgment she doesn't have to stand judgment why because she was judged in Christ at Calvary when the word was judged she's part of the word Amen brother B said uh uh he made me pay for my sins when I was in him at Calvary amen because she's part of the word amen she bypasses judgment so if you hear his word and Believe on him that sent him you already have everlasting life and you'll never come into the Judgment for you've already passed from Death un life so we know we're secure amen we're absolutely secure we were secure before the foundation of the world it's just coming to manifestation in this day as we receive the word it's coming to manifestation but now we want to talk about Mercy being extended beyond the bride last time we talked about brother B said hey you can never exhaust God's goodness and mercy to his people but we know that we we we see we want to look at there there's Mercy extended even beyond the realm of the Bride there's going to be more Mercy extended and that's what I get excited about friends Romans chapter 8 let's look together there Romans chapter 8 verse 1 Romans 8 And1 said there is therefore now no Nation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit by spiritual New Birth and now now you're not walking after the flesh you're walking after the spirit and there is no condemnation that's same thing judgment there is no judgment to them who are in Christ Jesus I thank God for that that's God's grace to us but now let's start looking at everyone else amen let's go to Matthew 25 Matthew 25 is another scene of the white Throne judgment we looked at it in Revelation 20 now we're going to look at it in Matthew 25 now remember that Judgment at the white Throne judgment after the second Resurrection when all the dead amen stand before him both small and great and they're judged the books are open in another book and they're judged out of the books according to the things written therein and then we we look here at verse 31 which is a a a parable about the white Throne judgment so Matthew 25:31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the Sheep on the right hand but the goats on the left then shall the King say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily verily I say unto you in so much as ye have done unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed un Everlasting fire depart for the devil uh prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and impr prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hunger or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you in as much as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away and to Everlasting punishment but the righteous unto life eternal this is also the white Throne judgment brother brandham in the sardan church age section of the church age book he refers to this and he and he makes this statement said to further clarify notice specifically the words of Matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that the shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd so let's go back and look at that verse 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats Amen brother I I love the gift of a prophet he can hone down on the word and he can tell you amen any misunderstanding because he doesn't want you to misunderstand this can't be the separating of sheep and goats because the Sheep are the Sheep of his pasture they're the righteous they're the redeemed they're the bride so this can't be them there in the Judgment but he's separating them as a Shepherd separating he's just showing why how he's doing it he's doing it as a she Shepherd would separate these two he's not calling them sheep and goats oh my goodness I love that God sent a prophet who knows the author of the word and could look down at that because you and I can debate that we can look at language we can look at Greek we can fight back and forth on what that means but when a prophet comes down he's got the mind of God on the word and he he points right to it and it's exactly as it's written Amen brother frankco if you could pull up the Whiteboard I want to I want to draw this out on the Whiteboard he he says I I'll read this again it does not say that that a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd and that's capital as in the church age book as a shepher dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white Throne judgment the Sheep are in his fold they heard his voice the word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the Judgment but these do not have eternal life it's beautiful friends and they are in the Judgment they're in the Judgment because they don't have eternal life amen the bride cannot come into the Judgment because she has eternal life where did she get it before the foundation of the world when she was in the mind of God the SE Gene of God inside has life on the inside amen because she heard his word and believed on him that sent him she already have everlasting life it was the evidence she already had it so she cannot come in the Judgment but these do not have eternal life they are in the Judgment then he says they are allowed to go into eternal life oh I love this friends the righteous are all to go into eternal life why they didn't already have it amen they weren't listen they didn't have the C Gene of God they didn't have life already inside of them they didn't have it brother B says they were never born again amen but they're allowed to enter into eternal life amen and when they enter into eternal life this is at the end of the Thousand Years this is after the Millennium this is at the white Throne judgment this is the ending of all time from here on out we move into new heavens and new earth and there is no more time it's back to Eternity and I'll ask you a question if you get entrance into eternal life and you get life that goes beyond time now there's no more time but you're alive what kind of life is that you've entered into eternal life you don't have it on the inside but by the grace of God by his Mercy he's allowed you to come into it and now you're in there you have Life Beyond Time am praise be to God why do we get excited cuz this doesn't this doesn't matter to us amen because we already had it we always had it we could have never lost it oh but friends amen we want to see Mercy extended we want to see those whom we love come into eternal life that's why we get so excited about this amen that's why amen I I I I I've preached this before and I get really really thankful in my heart because this message actually declares the very nature of God in his true righteousness amen the denominations all have their own ideas about salvation and you have to have it their way and if you don't come their way everybody else is damned to hell and but oh my goodness this message comes along and begins to show God's loving nature his Tender Mercies and his desire to save it reflects his true nature so when we come to to the white Throne judgment let's just do it this way let's just say we have a throne Before the Throne there's two sections because he's going to separate them as sheep on I want to read this and make sure I get right because if I draw it wrong I'm going to be in trouble okay the Sheep sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left so he would be facing them this would be the righteous on his right hand so over here you've got all these people multitudes of people over here you got multitudes of people so when you look at this it looks like you have these that will be eternal lost and then you have the King on the throne and you say well we've got three categories of people but actually according to scripture we have four categories of people because the king is not alone on the throne beside the king is the [Music] queen God Amen when Jesus begins to speak here in the parable he says unto them verse 34 then shall the king say that's one person to them on his right hand to the to the righteous come you blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world and we know he speaks to the ones on the left hand those that will be lost and he tells them they didn't take care of him they didn't look after him they didn't serve him so that's we got the ones on the right the ones on the left and the King on the throne but listen to what he says he says I was hungered and he starts to say I was hungered I was naked you clothed me I was in prison you visited me and they asked uh then they then they asked uh in verse 38 I mean verse 37 then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and thirsty and gave thee drink when they didn't even know when they did it they're standing here looking at the king and he's saying you fed me you you clothed me you visited me you you served me and they said Lord when they they never saw that figure they never serve that figure if you understand what I'm saying they they're confused about how they fed him and how they clothed him and how they visited him but then he makes a statement he and he says and the King shall answer verse 40 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say to you as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it to me that's the fourth group that's the mystery group at the white Throne judgment everybody else is uh uh defined and easily said the one on the right the one on the left and the King on the throne but he reveals a mystery group at the white Throne judgment he says when you have done it to these these my brethren that are sitting here on the throne with me then you did it unto me oh it's always been the mystery group the bride's been the mystery through the the whole Bible she's been the mystery group and still in the white Throne judgment she's the mystery group but a prophet has come and revealed the mystery who this mystery group is it's the bride and she is judging with the King praise God oh I love that I'm going to keep reading here these do not have eternal life that's why it says the dead were judged this is the Judgment of the Dead and it seems wrong to think that the foolish virgin and and and the righteous that but they don't already have eternal life so this is the Judgment of the Dead But at the end of the Judgment of the Dead there'll be a group that go into eternal life and a group that go to the lake of fire but these do not have eternal life and they are in the Judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already had his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren that's the scripture they are not his Brethren that would make them joint hirs with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share No Throne Etc with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God per perhaps like Nicodemus and gelo they stood for the children in a time of trouble that's super interesting we'll come back to that if this seems the smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the Lake of Fire the names of many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day amen all right we're getting some really good principles laid down now their names were blotted out others names remained in The Book of Life they went into eternal life on what grounds because they were good and kind to the Brethren amen the other group didn't serve Christ didn't feed him didn't clothe him didn't they didn't serve him him and it says they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day when it comes down to the Judgment it's actually all about the word it's all about the the judgment is all about the word amen when he says you did it to the least of these my brethren it wasn't it it wasn't about being nice to be nice and nice to it's not about flesh friends it's about the manifested word that was manifesting in that body of Flesh at that period of time it's not a judgment based on flesh it's a judgment based on the word what they did with the word they came in contact with is how they're judged here at the white Throne judgment and because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day I think interesting too that that that that uh oh my goodness I think it's very interesting that he mentions Nicodemus and Gia here because they're he he's using them as examples of those who would serve God's people maybe in a time of trouble amen maybe they would stand up for them maybe they would Supply a need maybe they would would meet a need like feeding when they're hungry clothing when they're naked you see you see what we're saying here in Matthew 25 and you go to realize that God would have wrote names in the book of life because he knows that he would have a need somewhere down the road when he was coming in the flesh of Bob and the Flesh of Chad and the Flesh of this there may be a need down the road so he would write a name in The Book of Life and somebody would meet the need of the word made flesh at a time amen and for that they would get entrance into eternal life it's all about the word it's all about the word all right let's go to Genesis chapter 20 I want to keep laying this principle down we're going to go back to Abraham Genesis 20 and verse one Genesis 20 and verse one this is after Abraham and Sarah are turned back young and they travel down to Gar and Sarah is now beautiful and young and uh aimc takes her for a wife we know the story really well but we're going to read it again in this context uh chapter 20:1 and Abraham journeyed from then toward the South Country and dwelt between Kadesh and shur and sojourned in gar and Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my sister and ab that king of gar sent and took Sarah but God came to aimc in a Dream by night and said to him behold Thou Art but a dead man for the woman which thou Hast taken for she is a man's wife but aimc had not come near her and he said Lord wilt thou slay also a righteous Nation said said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this and God said unto him in a dream yay I know that thou did this in the Integrity of thy heart for I also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered I Thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and and and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that that know that know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine lot of THS there aimc is not doing anything wrong and he takes Sarah because of what Abraham told him and then we know Abraham's protecting himself and and now he's going to take Sarah but God in his Mercy comes to not a c Gene not what Abraham is but somebody else amen and he comes down to aimc and he warns him in a dream don't do this and aimc says Lord you know the Integrity of my heart I I didn't know and I want to read it again here and verse six and God said unto him in a dream yay I know that thou did this in the Integrity of thy heart God knew that aimc was not doing this on purpose God knew he me he had no ill intentions to Abraham he was not trying to defile another man's wife that he says would you do would you treat the righteous that way is basically what he's saying and God says no I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I warned you in a dream oh I love the righteousness of God Amen but he says uh so he says I know we're in verse six still and I know that thou did this in the Integrity of thine heart I also withheld thee from sinning against me amen I thought he would be sinning against Abraham by taking Abraham's wife as another man no I kept you from sinning against me this is my word Abraham's my word Sarah is my word amen and there's going to come A Promise something through them they're fleshing out my word my mind is on display here in these two and I had to keep you from sinning against me because you're righteous and you had Integrity in your heart and you're pure in heart and you didn't do this on purpose and I know that but I I come to you to warn you so that you wouldn't sin against me now restore that man as wife so so aimc wakes up and he knows exactly what he's got to do let's go down to verse 14 now and ailec took sheep and oxen and men's servants and woman servants and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife and aimc said behold my land is before thee dwell there where it pleaseth thee and unto Sarah he said behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes and to all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved so Abraham prayed unto God and God healed aim and his wife and his maid servants and they bear children for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the House of ailec because of Sarah Abraham's wife oh praise God now aimc does the best thing he can he doesn't just say here's your wife he said here's some oxen here's some sheep here's the here's some gifts here's a thousand pieces of silver and here's the land go anywhere you want because now he realizes what Abraham is in relation to God Amen and what he needs to do now is bless Abraham so that Abraham can bless him so that he can be blessed you know aimc wasn't wrong amen we we know Abraham in this situation Abraham was wrong but Abraham cannot come into condemnation he cannot come into the Judgment because of who he is amen but aimc amen will be in judgment if he makes this mistake so God has to spare him and show him mercy and now he's got to go to who who does he go to to be spared who does he go to to find this Mercy who does he go to amen he has to go to Abraham and Abraham now prays for him when Abraham prayed the Judgment of God was already upon him because he had already closed up the wombs amen but now when when Abraham who who should be the guilty one but now when Abraham prays God hears Abraham's prayer and he reverses the curse and he opens up the wound yes sir you see this is not just a new testament principle this is the entire Bible amen now where brother Brandon when he sees this clear he sees this through the whole scripture and he sees it through the context of God's [Applause] nature praise God Amen so oh God help us give us eyes to see Abraham becomes to aimc life or death depending on how he deals with Abraham in this situation Abraham is standing there and aimc is in judgment and which way it's going to fall life or death depends on his attitude towards Abraham and Abraham's intercession for him are we seeing the picture sir and we are Seed of Abraham again in the sardian church age Prophet says thus if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that I accept it if it is also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the for knowledge of God they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also and and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely yes you got that word solely right solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live amen I'm going to take a little turn a little deviation and we'll come back let's go to Revelation 21 and I think we'll find that it's no deviation at all Revelation 21 all the way back at the end of the Bible Revelation 21 and verse 23 ver uh Revelation 21 and 23 and the city had no need of sun neither of moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb was the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glor they and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it praise God I I I just want to look at this for a minute in verse 24 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light that is not the elect that's not the bride that's everybody else who entered in to life and through the white thr judgment and brother B says this in the Philadelphian Church age he says the city he goes ahead and says which is New Jerusalem see New Jerusalem I'll put on him the New Jerusalem now the bride or the church is the new jerus Jerusalem so who is this city it's the elect amen and now the light that's going to shine is going to shine from the city in the New Jerusalem how many knows that the church itself is the New Jerusalem let's prove it in Revelation 21 amen he's going to say here now I think it's where I want all right let's look back here and show you the Bible says prove all things Revelations 21 and I saw a new heavens and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband amen it's the new church the Gentile Church the bride the bride is the Gentile and the Gentile has his name he took a people out of the Gentile for his name's sake and he says he's going to put on them brother R dealing with the name of the city of his God the New Jerusalem amen so now he says now this city is as a bride adorned for her husband brother B says it is the bride the city is the elect we know there'll be a physical City so don't think I'm getting away from that and the new heavens and new earth we know that physical City will come and sit over top the mountain that'll rise up amen but that City now is the dwelling place of God where the temple of God is and all of these that are saved to the Earth they're going to come to the city they're going to walk in the light of the city and they're going to come through the Gates of the city amen and they're going to have access into this city amen and they're going to bring the honor of the Nations into the city we'll get to that later now let's look at chapter 22:1 and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations this tree is in the city in New Jerusalem and this tree we've talked about it many times so you understand this well this tree is the tree of life and it's growing on either side of the river so when you look there's a tree on either side of the river but it's one tree of life it looks like two trees because the tree is on either side of the river the river is Flowing between it amen but this is male and female bridegroom and brid tree come back together again and so brother B says now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he is the seed the woman's seed the Tree of Life In The Garden unless they put forth their hands and move this tree theyd eat that tree and live forever and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life and that be the word then the word of God which Eve turned down in the garden even of Eden then here is Christ the word made manifest and when he come on Earth he was the Tree of Life do you believe that in Rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree he became a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a brid tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him what will the what will the bride tree the Tree of Life restored back to him again as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden oh glory be to God by the same word the same God made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again so what's he doing in this day he's bringing forth the bride tree and he's uniting the bride tree and the bridegroom tree because brother bam said the bridegroom tree without the bride tree doesn't produce fruit so now we see the tree of life amen is on either side of the river and they're standing there together with the River of Life coming from the Throne of God right in between them it's coming out and this tree Bears 12 manner of fruit in its season and the leaves of this tree are for the healing of the Nations and here's what brother brm says in future home he says the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations that is the kings that live in there bring their honor in when they bring their honor in and Lay It Before the Throne of God just like the outside the 11 tribes brought in every one of them a tenth to Levi when they bring their honor uh into the Blessed Land from the Blessed land in that they'll reach from the Tree of Life break off a holly leaf or a tree of life leaf and they'll walk out together there's no more war everything's at peace the leaves are a memorial for the healing of the Nations brother Chad what are you talking about We're Here There and Everywhere Abraham was standing there as a tree of life yes that's right to reject that tree was to reject life aimc was in trouble because of what he was going to do with the word made manifest but there was an opportunity for aimc if he would restore if he would restore the man's wife and have that man pray for him Abraham became a source of restoration and a source of life for ailec because aimc was as good as a dead man if it wasn't for Abraham Amen in the new heavens and new earth what's going on in the new heavens and new earth there's a Perpetual life there's a healing and there's a peace amen there's life beyond time and what are they doing with this life all of those who live outside of the city all of the Nations and all the kings what are they doing in this life they are Gathering From The Blessed land all outside the city and they're bringing their tithe they're bringing their honor into the City and when they bring their honor into the city now they go over and in exchange for coming into the city and bringing their honor and Glory into the city they reach over and they break off a a tree a leaf from the tree of life and they walk out in peace because the leaves are for the healing of the Nations there's an exchange taking place what's to exchange they're serving those in the city with their tithe and they're getting life from the city from the Tree of Life why is this going on in the new heavens and new earth CU this is exactly how they got there they got there by serving the word amen when the word amen whether it was in print form or whether it came in flesh and you and I are are the Saints down through time are like Abraham when they served the word amen they were blessed to enter in amen because why because you fed me when I was hungry you clothed me when I was naked you visited me when I was in prison enter you into the joys of the Lord when did we do this Lord when I don't I didn't recognize you I didn't see you I didn't know I when you've done it to these why because these are also this is the Tree of Life restored from the Garden of Eden this is bridegroom tree and brid tree back together again sitting on the throne and they'll be in that City and all those who enter in will be perpetually coming and bringing tithe into the city for exchange for Life Hallelujah the reason they got there is perpetuated through eternity now think about that think about Abraham standing there as a tree of life for aimc Jesus Christ was standing there the tree of life for all of Israel and they refused life and they scorched it and they cut it down they hung it on a cross when Jesus comes or brother Ram comes to the message that day on Calvary he says now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he came in the and the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others okay let's go back to the white Throne judgment and go back to Matthew 25 you fed me when I was hungry you clothed me when I was naked you visited me when I was in prison now you enter in Lord when do we do that when you did it to these now you enter into life there'll be people entering into life because the word was made flesh because the elect C genene of God was on Earth in that period of time and because they were there somebody served them yes and when somebody was good and kind to the Brethren they went into eternal life do you realize that's you and me friends do you realize we stand I'm going to say something but please understand what I'm saying do you understand we stand as a tree of life we stand as an opportunity for somebody to enter into life amen there's somebody whose name is on the book of life amen who's going to enter into life and because of what they did for the Brethren what they did for Christ the word listen don't don't look at your flesh this is not about your flesh amen this is about the word that God has planted in your soul before the foundation of world this is the word that's been anointed by the spirit of God to come to life and live and manifest through your flesh it's not about your flesh it's about the word that's the life listen this is not tree of life so don't start looking at this and and and and over promote this that's not it it's the eternal life of God down on the inside and that life amen is here creating an opportunity at life for somebody body at the white Throne judgment my goodness how glorious will it be for us to be sitting with the queen next to the King when he separates the sheep and the goats and there's one amen there's one entering into eternal life because you had a need one day and that person met your need and you're watching them March through the gates into eternal life you think that won't be a day of rejoicing that won't be a day of shouting why because I was here they had opportunity I didn't put myself here God ordained for me to be here God ordained for them to be here it's all ordained of God but praise God living for others is eternal life I'm not here for myself I want to get that out of my head so bad I'm here for others and you say well I'm here to promote the message I am here to promote the message I'm here to live the word but I may be here to save somebody that has no other opportunity at the internal life but that they were good and kind to this part of the body so that that affects the way I live my life now I don't want to live my life unchristian I don't want to live my life contener I don't want to live my wife this is why we don't go into communal living we're all we're all going to sell out everything go out to North Dakota in the middle of nowhere and let's start a little commune no because living for others is eternal life I've got to go to work I've got to go to the market I've got to be amongst my unsaved loved ones why so the day amen can come oh praise God that they can come and bring honor into the City and take a leaf of the Tree of Life at the same time we're not just taking up space we're not just wasting air we are here by the purpose of God and the purpose of God is For Life those who enter into judgment do so of their own accord because they refused life when they came in contact with it but they had an opportunity because they came in contact with it I love the mercy and Judgment of God that he'll create a way listen where there was no other way this is a way where there was no other way brother brandom tells a story and I think it's super interesting there's so many things that the prophet understands that I don't understand so I'm just going to declare I don't understand but he says it and I believe it yeah and he comes to adoption in 1960 he said speaking to an old doctor yesterday one of my doctor friends buddies 80s something years old and his sister-in-law is here at the church tonight and she's been just a teeny teeny bit worried about him and I went to see him and as soon as I began to talk to him he brightened up he told me about a hunting trip he had taken many years ago in Colorado the very same country I hunt at just as brilliant and bright I said Doctor how long you been practicing he said when you were nursing way down I said and many times he said I've practiced taking my buggy I put my saddle bags over my horse I took the little satchel and I've walked and I said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with your flashlight trying to find a house where a little child had a tummy ache or a mother in labor pains that's right and I said you know doctor I believe across this dividing line here between Mortal and immortality God has a place for good old doctors that serve like that I love that quote don't ask me to explain it mechanically I can't you can say well maybe one of those babies was an Alex I have no idea how that works out I just believe what the prophet said and it brings joy to my heart God has a place for good old doctors that serve like that now listen great tears come in his eyes and he started crying he reached up his feeble hands and said brother I hope so across the land god judges a man's soul what he is then I give him the satisfying scripture many times plowing through those dark muddy fields at night trying to help somebody maybe never get a penny for it but it's all right I I said Jesus said in the scripture blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and that is true that was the consola scripture that brother brandham gave the cons him to console him and that comes out of Matthew 5:7 that's the scripture but I'm going to read that to you but I want to read the next one to you too because it blesses me he said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and then next blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God what did he say to aimc aimc said you know the Integrity of my heart he said I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I kept you from sinning against me because I know the god judges a man by a soul what he is on the inside God knew what aimc really was amen aimc was caught in a trap and that trap was going to be his damnation damnation had already set in amen but God knew what was in AMC's heart and God shined Mercy on him because he knew he had a pure heart in this situation and God spared him by Mercy and gave him an opportunity to come to life why because he had his word there in Abraham praise God now let's go to Matthew chapter 7 I want to bring this in just now because I want to show God judges by what's in the heart and you can think well my that's great all you got to do is be merciful and do a bunch of good deeds and you're going to go to heaven I don't even know if I'm bride I don't even know I don't even know if I'm bride but if I'm just nice to the bride this is man is so intellectual as such nonsense floats around in our brains so I'm going to secure my position maybe I'm not the bride I don't quite have the faith to reach that far so I'm just going to be really good to the bride and that's going to be my ticket in listen every one of those the white Throne judgment had no idea why they were going into eternal life they didn't have it preconceived and figured out it wasn't intellectual reasoning it wasn't a bunch of works for Works sake it wasn't works with a false motive they were pure in heart when they were doing these things they didn't know it was going to equal life they didn't know that it was for Jesus Christ that so see see what I'm saying friends drop this intellectual nonsense and reasoning and saying I'm just if plan a fails I'm going for Plan B you're never going to make it there anyway so just forget it you got to throw all your stock into plan a with faith because you've heard the word so we're not hedging by I'm going to really be nice to the bride you should be nice to the bride anyways out of a pure heart if you're doing it to secure passage that we're going to see this right here in Matthew chapter 7 let's go to verse 21 Matthew 7: 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity what I did all of this in your name cast out devil many mighty Works healed the sick I've done all this and Jesus never denies that they did it there's no denial so the works in his name we're not going to get them into heaven listen look at what they did we prophesied in thy name am and I name cast out Devils that's good works they helped a lot of people cuz if you're casting out Devils you're really helping people and then I and and thy name have done many wonderful Works amen and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity that's the problem is Iniquity brother Bram said in the power of transformation what is Iniquity David said if I conceive iniquity in my heart God will not hear me see iniquity is something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it sir you know better but don't do it it's iniquity see you know they should stay with the word of God but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you stray from the word of God and do what the organization says all the good works and all the healing and all the blessing God's people and all being merciful to the whole world it didn't do one ounce of good for them because they had iniquity in their heart they didn't do it out of a pure heart right so you can see all the schemes of man they come crumbling down amen when we're standing there at the white Throne judgment there's not going to be any argument that day he's there Discerning the very thoughts of your heart so these who are the Righteous who enter in they were the ones there's there's going to be several categories that are saved at the white Throne judgment we're going to talk about that in a second but these righteous who are there solely because they were good and kind to the the Brethren they were surprised pleasantly surprised when they got down to judgment and they found out that that deed they did with pure motives and a pure heart not even knowing who they were serving or why that what they done secured their entrance into eternal life they were surprised friends they were shocked they didn't know it was Jesus they didn't know that they did these things to him they didn't why they were doing it out of a pure heart right amen they go into eternal life why because they were pure in heart and so I want to I want to write down the categories of those that will be over here you have those that were good to the brethren we're going to have two more categories as we go but I going to read them first back in the sardan church age he says it's the second Resurrection Resurrection where the foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became part of that bride but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the Millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed so who else will be here the foolish [Music] virgin some of them no doubt were also kind and good to the Brethren like Nicodemus and Gia but he says here these people are separated god-loving people in trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end of time it has to do with the word even the foolish virgin their salvation has to do do with what they did with the word that they had and that they were helping in the work of the Lord not their own work somehow they're helping in the work of the Lord however they're doing that I don't know I'm not going to put labels on it but they're because they're an aid and a help in the things of God and they're trying to keep the word the best that they know it's still all about the word their salvation is linked to the word those who are good and kind to the Brethren because the Brethren are the manif ested word those who are foolish virgin because they're promoting the word amen and the next group is going to have to do with the word too let's look at this next group it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar is set forth in the fifth seal Revelations 6:9-11 are given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of white robes further down in the quote he says they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word these are the Jews amen the Jews amen that died from the time of Christ on this is the Jews under the altar in the fifth seal so they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word and notice how these are crying out for re Revenge they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek and cries forgive them Father they know not what they do these are Jews they have to be because they are in the fifth seal and it's the for seal of the Gentile bride has gone in the Rapture so these Jews aren't born of his Spirit they don't even believe that Jesus is the Messiah but as they were blinded by God for the Gentiles say God gave them eternal life on the grounds that they that that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died for it as multitudes died under Hitler Stalin Etc and will yet die so now these are the Jews of the New Testament of the New Testament dispensation why are they saved the word because of the word because of the word let's go to John chapter 1 John chapter 1 John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life yes and the life was the light of men what is in the word life who is the Tree of Life Christ the manifested word what happened to each one of these they got life because of their attitude their approach or their service to the word why is it we have life not necessarily because of our attitude approach or service that all part of it but we have life because we are the word and always had life because we were always part of his thinking we were always part of the word so now we see as these go marching into life they go into life because of the word we're here why are you on this Earth to manifest the word am amen and being here to manifest the word is creating an opportunity for somebody maybe to come into the city maybe to come into the City and bring maybe a service an honor into the city in exchange for leaves from the Tree of Life you know what's interesting about this city when we get to New heavens and new earth this city has Gates yeah you know you know what gates are gates are doors right but when you get to New heavens and new earth all the doors are open and they're never closed by day or by night and the light is always shining in the city yesu and they can come to the city anytime they want there's no closed access so do you know what my goal is now in this life I want to be part of that City and I don't want to be a barb wire fence I don't want to be a metal door I want to be a gate that's standing open in the city where somebody can come and partake of life amen where the light is shining forth I don't want to be a wall to prevent or to hinder I don't want to become a hindrance to life but I want to become an open door where somebody can come to the city Amen in exchange for life right say praise be to God what is it all about it's not not it's not me it's not you it's the word that's down in us when they serve that word God loves it to fight the word brother B said whose names are they that were in The Book of Life and blotted out of the book of life he said it's very clear whose names were there and then blotted out it's those who fought the bride those who resisted the word and those who fought against the word like Judas he had his name on the book but his name was blotted out why he came to the Tree of Life and he rejected it but there was those who came to the tree of life and accepted it God has given us a privilege friends I want to live as a display of the city I want the light to shine I want his throne where was his throne his throne was in the top of the city and his light was shining down through the city and the walls of the city were Jasper clear as Crystal amen I want my life to be clear as Crystal not smutted up with the word world but clear so that the light that's shining on me will shine out of me and I don't want to close door I don't want to commune I don't want to shut everybody off and I don't want to treat everybody horrible and grouchy and and contentious I want to be an open door where the light shining out where somebody can come and bring something to the city in exchange for the tree of life when you look at all three of these you look at all three of these and for one reason or another right they could not receive Revelation not because they didn't want to but because they couldn't because as for the foolish virgin and those that are good to their Brethren they did not have the Cene of life on the inside remember when Jesus come come to the woman at the well and the woman at the well when Jesus began to speak and began to receive exactly what he was saying and it quickened that seed like that and brother bam said why when all the Pharisees and all the others were hearing of him they didn't he said they had nothing to receive the word with they had nothing to believe with but she had something inside to believe the word with you and I have something on the inside to believe the word with and we didn't give it to ourselves that was the grace of God that was decided before the foundation of the world that shouldn't make us proud or arrogant or contentious or a closed door or a smutted up wall that gives us tremendous amounts of responsibility that if God placed that in me I want to be like this city but these my friend they didn't have what you have and they could never have what you have and they can never believe the way you believe that's why we don't that's why we don't uh have any attitude towards those who can't receive it amen if they they can't receive if they don't have the seed they can't receive it it the Jews can't receive it cuz they were blinded intentionally so that Grace could come to the Gentiles and because God put his hand over their eyes he's a merciful god and he's just and all said because I did that as long as they'll hold to the word that I gave them I will give them white robes at the white Throne judgment the the the foolish virgin amen they're god-loving separated people but they don't have a SE gene on the inside that can receive Revelation but yet there's something in them though they can't receive the Revelation they love the word and they love the people of God and they want to support the work of God Amen but they cannot receive the Revelation you and I can receive and those that are good and kind to the Brethren some of them listen this may shock you some of them may not even be churchgoers but something in them love something in you without this sing so now you've got people who could not receive the Revelation that you and I can receive but by the mercy of God by his by the by the extension of grace through the Tree of Life they're now to enter into life why because of their attitude their approach their service their work for life which is the word and I for one say thank God this message is so so beautiful because it accurately portrays the nature of God [Music] himself blessed are the merciful they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart not the ones with iniquity blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and I say thank you God thank you God now our attitude towards all the those around us listen there's no reason to F fight there's no reason to cram anything down anybody's throat you know the woman at the well she couldn't get enough Jesus would say one thing and she would ask another question Jesus would say something and she would say oh that's it now now now they tell us that we worship here what what what do you tell I perceive you're a prophet now you tell me then then he gives her another answer she never walked away and says let me think about what you're saying I'm not so sure it doesn't make sense to me she comes right back and she says we know that when Messiah comes when Messiah comes he'll tell us these things listen Jesus never was ramming it down her throat saying stay here let me explain it again come back over to my house one more time we need to do an additional Bible study you're just not getting it amen we have to realize that in the Book of Life there's several different categories that serve God's purpose in several different ways let God sorted out the thing to do is spread the seed just cast the seed if it falls on good ground it'll come forth and bear fruit you don't have to worry about that because the ground is prepared before you seed the seed we don't have to have negative attitudes we don't have to press we don't have to push all we have to do is sew the seed and listen if you ever get a hold of a woman like the woman at the well don't worry she'll come back you give her one answer she'll come for the next you give her another answer she'll come for the third you you don't have to push and you don't have to broaden you don't have to handcuff and force feed right sometimes you realize oh they didn't catch it not that they were against it not that they spoke evil not that they condemned but it just went over their head just let it go let them come in God's provided way and you'll still have Fellowship in the great Eternal regions of forever when they come into that City guess what we're going to greet them and fellowship with them and enjoy our fellowship for eternity praise be to God let's just thank god let's stand I thank God for this message I'm so glad I don't have to walk around contener and angry and forcing everybody to see it my way and to believe everything I believe I can just so see you know the seed sewer that went forth to sew he you know I hate to say anything negative about somebody I never met but he wasn't really skilled he got seed in the byways he got seed in the path he got seed in the thorn he got seed everywhere and he happened to get some in good ground and so I don't think God's expecting us to be uh tactically laser beam uh accurate in our sewing of our seed we hold back the seed and say I'm going to wait I don't want to waste any seed and I don't want to sew it in the wrong ground so I'm just going to wait and okay I think you're good ground I'll give you one no he just had a bag of seed and he was out there TOS let's just toss seed let's just live the life let our life speak the word let let our life our families our our relationships our conduct our dress and our speech let it spread seed everywhere and if there's good ground don't worry the good ground will receive the seed it'll grow it'll bear fruit we don't have to be worried about it friends all we got to do is live a Christian Life don't don't fail to testify don't fail to give the message don't fail to speak the me don't don't mean don't don't don't misunderstand what I'm saying share the word but if it doesn't take don't worry about it it'll be okay if there's a seed there don't worry next time they're around you they'll be you know him huling around and wanting to ask you a question but not wanting to ask you a question cuz something inside of them stir listen there's no way they're going to be able to resist it it's like magnetism a seed genus magnetized to the word if they found a source of where the waters flowing amen there's a magnetic pool they'll come back around and say Hey you know that that thing you said the other day I'm not so sure about can you run that past me again then inside you can just smile and say I'll just go to throw some more seeding God knows who's who God knows who's who everybody who's going to come to life is going to come one way or another but I thank God for his plan I thank God Mercy was EXT extended beyond the bride yes and I thank God that I can stand on this Earth as a source of life not because of me but because of what he planted inside of me is a part of himself and there's an opportunity for life that walks around clothed in this Veil and I'm thankful for that and it changes my attitude towards my interactions with people people let's be conscious of this friends let's be wide awake and realize what we are and who we are brother bam said in the first quote I read he says we fail to see the power that God has placed in his people God is in his people the tree of life is available the word is here let's bow our heads and pray dear Heavenly Father we thank you God for your goodness for your grace and for your mercy Lord God when we look at
