so many times amen us men we make mistakes and I made mistakes early in my marriage and truth be known I still make mistakes because I I think my wife should think like me and I don't understand why she doesn't think like me and when she's not thinking like me I'm thinking what is wrong with you you're not thinking like me and she's over here thinking what is wrong with you like for me the picture's so clear for me over here the picture's so clear because we have two different perspectives based off the nature that's been placed within us and and because man is given to rule over the woman he's given the rule over here but according to knowledge giving honor unto her as unto the weaker vessel how do we honor a weak Professor well if you have a vase that's worth a lot of money you honor it by putting it on a pedestal you keep it safe you put it in a case you put it up High where the kids can't break it that's giving honor to one as a weaker vessel and this is how we're supposed to care for our wives giving honor to them as a weaker vessel means we protect them we guard them we shelter them we protect them amen we're not too harsh with them I mean we're not too rugged amen I I can talk to another man rough uh I've done it with my friends before I've had a conversation and it's just been straightforward I mean not me nobody was mad we're straightforward I'd say no I disagree with you if you see two men working amen and you guy calls all those buddies ever they're going to build a shed and all of a sudden they're standing around well I think you should do it this way I said no I'm not going to do it that way I want to do it this way but what about this I think you're going to have a problem later you say leave me alone I know what I'm doing and all those guys can work on that project and they're fine at the end of it amen they go eat some pizza they pat each other in the back they had a great day you throw one woman into the mix and she's in tears in the house wondering why everybody's so mean and why do you talk to each other like that the problem is she's of a nature that God wants her to have and the man's of a nature God wants him to have neither one are wrong but when I begin to if I don't dwell with my wife according to knowledge and I expect her to act like me view everything like me respond to everything like me then what I'm doing is because I have the headship and I'm giving headship that way I'm pushing her down and pushing her down and pushing her down and all of that feminine nature that God wants to be expressed is being hindered inhibited Limited right I don't think that's what God wants I don't think that's what he wants in his marriage I don't want to think that's what he wants out of his bride I don't think God Amen I don't think God wants a Ministry so harsh and so hard and so legalistic that the bride has no expression she's hindered she's hampered she has nothing to say she hasn't she's never right she doesn't know what she's talking about I don't think that's what God wants I think God wants both expressed male and female I think he created it so I think he's expressing male and female I think he wants an expression of male and female
