========================================

because he hates the spiritually revealed word and the one that he hates the most is a spiritually revealed word to the individual that's the thing that he hates make it a church system please make it a church system make it a group make it all of us let's just say everybody who walks in these doors this sunday we're all bride we're all okay we're all part of it we got our stamp on our card we came to church we came in this building this is the right place with the right doctrine and the right teaching we're all okay that's that is the teaching that he loves [Music] he loves that teaching because if we all settle down in that teaching all he's got to do is bring an anointing to one or two at the top of that ladder and he can sway the whole group into deception but the truth that he hates is that this revelation is to the individual to the end i know myself i mean i don't need a group i don't need another teacher i don't need a priest i don't need anybody to tell me because god himself has told me i met him in the backside of the desert and he told me who i am and all hell is against this revelation amen he wants to make it a group he'll try to do it in the message make it a group we hold this doctrine we hold this doctrine this group this group don't be part of any group amen it's an individual connected to christ and satan is fighting that revelation well we all believe like this group we've all been like this group i don't want to believe like any group i want to believe by revelation that he gives me personally that i see it in the word that i'm not a parent repeating a preacher but i've got my own revelation of who i am and what the word is for this day and where i fit into the picture all hell is against that revelation that's why amen if you preach that revelation teach that revelation and bring that revelation you better be ready for trouble because satan hates that trouble comes in all kinds of forms to bring discouragement to bring disappointment amen to bring exhaustion but what's he trying to do he's trying to stop that truth from being expressed and catching the individuals because he has no power over individuals with an individual connection to the throne of god because god can make a move amen and all the believers in the whole world will catch it because they don't have to wait they don't have to wait for a certain group or a certain teaching to come out or a certain man to say it amen they're catching their own revelation from god they have their own connection with god
