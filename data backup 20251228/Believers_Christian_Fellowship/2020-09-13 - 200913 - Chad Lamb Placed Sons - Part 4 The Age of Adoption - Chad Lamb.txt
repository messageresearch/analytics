be here with you and while you're standing let's just take our bibles and let's just turn right to the word i want to remind you that today at four o'clock we're going to have the celebration for brother tom davis over here in the pavilion so we encourage you all to come back to that and we're looking forward to that that'll be a nice time just to celebrate all the years of service of our precious brother also i wanted to give a little update i got a call from jeremy sanders on thursday on his brother roger he said that thursday they sent roger home from the hospital is that right brother roger thursday he went home thursday he went home from the hospital he had a liver transplant sunday afternoon at 4. everything went perfect they sent him home thursday and usually they're still in icu at that time they sent him home and from what jeremy was explaining to me is all the doctors are absolutely stunned at his recovery and amazed and we just thank god let's give god a hand clapping praise we thank god for that god is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we could ask amen also we want to welcome the tim finley family somebody told me they're here visiting so god bless you you're welcome we're glad to have you here and before we read the word i'd like to have a word of prayer i had heard and found out that brother ron spencer's in the hospital he's been diagnosed with coven 19 and pneumonia and so he's been struggling with cancer already so we'd definitely want to hold our brother up in prayer that god will just touch him supernaturally and i guess some in the assembly they had a bit of an outbreak in the church and some in the assembly are sick as well so as we pray over the reading of the word let's just go ahead and bow our heads and we'll pray for our brother dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for you are so precious to us lord you're a present help in the time of trouble we've watched lord as one by one you take care of every enemy that would come against you lord every foe that would try to defeat us or discourage us lord you have defeated them one by one by your word and though we're standing upon your word asking lord that you would meet the needs we lift before you know we ask for the entire assembly at brother ron spencer's church that you would bless each one and deliver them each one from this illness and the sickness you've been so faithful you've healed so many lord and delivered them from such circumstances we pray you would do the same for their whole assembly may the trial turn into a blessing and a testimony of your power and god especially for our brother ron lord he's already been struggling you've been helping him lord but we ask that you would just supernaturally touch him now and deliver him from this coven 19 and the consequences from that and the pneumonia and that you would bring him out lord and you would show yourself mighty on our brother's behalf but we ask in love for our brother we ask that you would just do a work that no human can do but we're not trusting in you to do it lord that you would raise him up for your glory that the testimony would reverberate around the world lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever we love you lord we ask that you would bless us as we read your word we pray god that your inspiration would be upon us lord to preach the gospel and god that you would give us ears to hear all that you have for us in this day that you would encourage us in places by your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen while we're yet standing let's turn to the book of ephesians chapter one we're going to continue on with play sons part four but my subtitle for this is the adoption age or the age of adoption either one you want to word it ephesians chapter 1 we'll read this three verses here and then we'll have you be seated ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love i don't know what it is i've read that scripture hundreds of times and i can never get over the fact that he wanted me holy and blameless before him in love no matter what the devil tries to accuse me of or put blame on me god before the foundation world chose me to be holy and blameless verse 5 and having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved amen you can have your seeds so right on the shoot we read this we've been over so many times we've expounded upon it but i can't get over how amazing it is that god before the foundation of the world already determined that i would be holy already determined that i'd be without blame already determined that i would be placed as a son amen and all for his good will and all for his good pleasure he has made me accepted in the beloved it wasn't based off my efforts my works my oh you know how good i got anything it was based completely upon his will and his desire from before the foundation of the world that that is a place to set our anchor that is a foundation to put our feet upon amen so if we i want to read here from the uh smyrnian church age out of the church age book brother branham says in this message now without getting too involved in the subject of the sovereignty of god for that would take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these verses jesus christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride amen how many of you believe you're the bride of jesus christ amen that wasn't your choice amen all we did was surrender all we did was respond back to his choice amen and john 15 16 says he ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9. and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose oh let that lock in the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing i'm going to read that again i mean if you want to get to the heart of a matter let's get to the heart of the matter right here the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world amen there's so many things that that we can talk about and get caught up in and so many things that can be debated around scripture and around denomination and you know around scholarship i say on the word you get so much scholarship on the word and they start debating you know uh we can debate all the doctrines you may debate on the oneness of god versus trinitarianism we can debate on the serpent seed versus eating a physical fruit we can debate on water baptism by immersion water baptism in jesus name i mean we can have all of these discussions but really when it comes down to it what's the heart of the whole thing what was god's heart when god dwelt alone amen when he was just alone with his thoughts what was the very core purpose of god his heart that he wanted to express through the entire bible everything he created was for this purpose amen everything he created in heaven and earth was for this purpose everything he done through every prophet that come down through the age was for this purpose everything he allowed to be put in this bible was for this purpose do you understand everything that god amen would do was for this purpose and what was his heart purpose to have amen to take a bride of his own choosing and if you find yourself in that place you can say thank you lord jesus i'm so thankful to you lord let's turn to isaiah 46 and look at a couple scriptures here isaiah 46. isaiah 46 and i'm going to look at verse 9 isaiah 46 and 9 and remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure i want to focus on this verse 10 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done so god was declaring the end from the beginning in acts 15 18 it says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so that's very clear there's no other way to understand that that if it's if it's a work of god if it's god's work he knew it from the beginning he knew what he was going to do like i said before god is not adjusting to the times he's not adjusting to the situation it's not like god will do something then see what you'll do then he'll adjust his response based off what you do no all of his works were known to him before the foundation of the world so much so that he could declare the end from the beginning so he's not waiting to see how things will transpire amen and adjusting his plan according to that or making addendums amendments to his plan it's fixed amen he declared it from the beginning he knows what will be he knows all those works from the beginning are we clear on that so let's go back to genesis 1. genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 i don't know about you but i love serving a sure god where things are sure they're fixed they're solid there's not the shifting sand of men's ideas that change over time and adjust and flex by situations amen every church has its church decree amen and that the church decree of the church dogma begins to change because it's built on the ideas of man so it's always shifting it's always changing but god his word is solid as a stone it does not shift it does not change so if you ever can put your foot on that you can rest assured that thing will never move out from under you you're solidly placed on the word of god and god knew what he would do from before the foundation of the world and he declared the end from the beginning so if he declared the end from the beginning then i'd like to go back to the beginning and i want to find out what is it he's declaring from the beginning that's going to show what the end is going to be so we go to genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so now we come to the to the very uh beginning we're in the beginning uh when god is fashioning and forming the earth as we know it today and and and he and he takes you know the the six days of creation to come down and on the seventh he rested and and then he decrees and he and he says let us make man in our image in our likeness and let's give him full authority and rulership upon over all the earth so the plan of god from the beginning was to have a son fashioned in his own likeness amen and to make that son male and female amen and take that expression of himself in male and female and place it as a god upon the earth because adam was a minor god he was a son of god amen if he's a son of god you know a son of a dog is a dog i a son of a human is a human a son of god is a god amen there's no way to get around that he's not god amen he doesn't take the place of god but he's under god as a son of god and adam was placed as a god on this earth amen he was he was given charge over everything and he was given dominion and rulership over everything amen but we find as we go on that that within the man was male and female amen he was in one being he was male and female but god amen had a plan and god is declaring the end from the beginning see this isn't just a story that we put in a storybook and make little colorful pictures so little kids can see it everything god's wrote in his bibles for a purpose and it's placed specifically in order for a purpose so we come right down here to the very beginning and when when god is is building up he's making a setting he's setting the scene on earth with the plants and the animals and establishing the heavens in their place he's setting the scene he's setting the atmosphere he's setting the place for his great masterpiece to set in and that masterpiece is a man made in his image male and female them so he builds the setting he builds the backdrop then he takes amen his great desire the great desire of his heart amen and he takes that desire and he places it there amen but god's not done and unfolding what's in his heart amen because we find out that that he says it's not good that man shall dwell alone it is not good that man shall dwell alone i will make a help meet for him so they they search in all of creation for help me no suitable help meat was found amen so god lays down the man and takes a rib from his side and fashions a woman amen and any and the brother of him tells us he takes that feminist spirit amen that was in adam and he splits that out and puts it in the woman and now the crowning act of all creation is when he takes the man and he takes the woman and he puts them together amen and we know that that god said that he made them male and female and called their name adam god was not that god was not looking amen for this another expression to have another identity or another name or be or be another person amen these are these are two of the same amen these are two of the same male and female put back together as one he said that that's why he said they'll no longer be twain but there'll be one one flesh amen it's not a cue story it's not a type it's the living reality he was declaring from the beginning what is going to be in the end this isn't you know this isn't for flannel graphs this isn't for sunday school this is an absolute living reality of god god establishing what has been his heart's purpose all along amen was to have a man amen and as a as a minor god upon the earth and his bride with him the two being one and he called their name adam and what's he doing he's declaring his very heart purpose because after he did this work he rested i mean this is all written the way it's written for a reason he he did this work because he had finally expressed what was in his mind he finally expressed his very heart purpose he got it all set in place he got it all established and he had a son positionally placed as god upon the earth and now he could sit back and take his rest because he had completed amen the masterpiece he completed the work that would show what his desire was so now we can see in isaiah that that he's declaring the end from the beginning that's why in genesis you find the man and his wife as one amen living as as gods upon the earth having dominion over the whole earth and you find that they're in perfect harmony perfect harmony with the earth perfect fellowship with their father god amen perfect union with one another everything was established in perfection until sin came in and corrupted that they remember when god took his rest when god said and that when god took his rest he was declaring that it's now perfect because if it wasn't perfect he wouldn't take his rest he would keep working god doesn't do things halfway he doesn't do them the wrong way he doesn't leave him undone so when god took his rest he was declaring that it's now done this is perfect and when he looked at all that he had made he said behold it is very good so now we find that this being god's purpose from the beginning he's declaring the end and this is book of genesis that's why if you skip all the way over to the book of revelation and start reading and the end of the book of revelations it starts saying let me show you the bride the lamb's wife now we start finding at the very end of the book in genesis there's a wedding taking revelation there's a wedding there's a union taking place and many he goes to show you the city and the city's adorned like a bride he shows you the bride the bride looks like a city see aaron mentioned this a few weeks ago and i mean it sparked so many things in our hearts but and then and he says behold i'll show you the the i'll show you the the bride the lamb's wife behold i'll show you the marriage of the lamb you get all the way to the end of the book in revelations 22 and you have the spirit and the bride now say come so it starts off with a man in his bride and it ends with the lamb jesus christ the man the last adam the restored adam and his bride united back as one put back on the earth in dominion as gods on the earth he has declared the end from the beginning and if you want to understand all the symbolism in genesis you are in revelations you've got to understand the symbolism in genesis and when you understand that what he did in genesis to declare his heart's purpose when he says it is now very good i can now take my rest amen when that became corrupted now we see what the whole bible is about because god awakened from his rest and went back to work to restore his masterpiece and he will not stop until the masterpiece is restored again why that that from the beginning was declaring the end it was perfect it was the way he wanted it it was the image that was displaying what was in his heart and it was marred and now there'll be no rest there'll be no stopping this plan of god until we come right back to that thing again praise be to god so where are we going if you want to know where we're going just look where we've been if you want to know what god's doing look at the beginning the beginning declares the end and so now now we've been given a key amen through a prophetic ministry in this last day who would come and unlock these things by the grace of god to us that key now unlocks amen when he when he preached christ is the mystery of god to the whole is one purpose one goal one thought that god had one thing that he wanted to achieve that's why when he comes to priests christ is mystery of god revealed he says i take from my text the entire bible he goes to an opening scripture but that opening scripture is just to start pointing you in the right direction what he really intended to preach on in christ is the mystery of god revealed is the entire bible because the entire bible has been one purpose one goal one great work that god wanted to achieve and he had already declared it from the beginning amen and it already got marred and now he's he's reworking that masterpiece image to bring it all back to what it was and this whole bible is about god restoring back all that's been lost so now with this key we have a key of revelation a key of understanding because now everything in this bible must fit into that purpose if we start to get things in here that that don't relate to that purpose do not fit into this purpose then we have to ask ourselves what picture are we painting [Music] where are our puzzle pieces what picture what is the picture we're trying to get back to what is the thing we're trying to display because god has one work one goal one purpose one thing one heart's purpose that he's had in his heart amen to have a bride after his own choosing and every work that he's worked has been working to this end and now if we begin to look at the scriptures and we can't see that theme in the scriptures we're looking at amen then it's time to ask god for some revelation because because we're going to get something misfit somewhere because that's god's purpose and so we find then through the old testament the prophet of god tells us that god was building his body back and through the prophets amen through the law and through the the prophets it was based on the pedicle of the the four patriarchs and then then it was built up through the prophets and through the psalms and all of these things and until finally it come to the head which was a man jesus christ a perfect man the perfect lamb of god the the body that god made for himself to dwell in and that was the last adam or the restoration of adam but god already declared from the beginning what he would do his goal was not to get adam back in place as a singular figure with dominion now now jesus christ comes to the end of his ministry and he says all power in heaven and earth is given unto me what he's come back to to what adam lost and more because now he's reconciled heaven and earth not just the earth so all power in heaven and earth is given unto me and you think that's it finish line no not finish line because adam dwelt alone and god said it is not good it's not adam was there naming the animals he was there as god he was there as a god over the earth he was there doing uh he was the minor god he was the image of god he was he was there in a perfect setting in a perfect world but god would look down and see his he would see his son he would see oh go back to god's language genesis chapter 1 we'll make a man in our image after our likeness and he made them male and female he made them so when god made it in his image he made it male and female so the image of god is expressed in male and female and we look there at adam when adam was made in flesh there in the garden he was both male and female and god said this is not good that he should dwell alone and so although he had power although he had never sinned he was in perfection everything was just right seemingly it was just right it wasn't just right because it wasn't good that he should be alone because from the very beginning before there was a beginning before you could say beginning back in the eternal before there was time before there was creation before there was anything god had a heart purpose and what he's doing in genesis is declaring his heart purpose he looks down he says it's not good that's not good that man shall dwell alone i will make it help me and the only help me he could find was the help meet that will come from the side the ingredients for the help me were in adam because he had already made him male and female he was already made male and female in the spirit he was put in the flesh so he took a piece of his flesh and split the feminine spirit and put it into another vessel and he combined them back together amen and there was a prophecy that went forth from adam and said for this reason shall man leave his father and mother amen and they these twain shall be one and god said it is very good so when he worked through the old testament building building building building till he got all the way up to the perfect image of a restored atom the bible calls him the last adam why they'll never need another the last adam jesus christ the lamb of god the son of god he's standing upon the earth now he's done what god said he he's there decreeing lord i've done all that you asked me to do i've done only what the father showed me i've kept all of his word i've done everything that he told for me to do and he says all power in heaven and earth is given unto me but you realize we know that that's not the finish and how can we tell well we've got the benefit of being here at this end in 2020 looking back and say well it wasn't done then but in that day you could say it's not done if you understood what isaiah was saying that he declared the end from the beginning and if that's true then it can't be the last atom restored in a singular vessel now within that vessel has to be the female because it was already declared from the beginning the end will have to show the same thing the beginning showed and so now inside that singular vessel of jesus christ there was a bride inside and that's why god smote him through the rib amen took out the ingredients to make a bride amen and for seven church ages for the new testament he's now been building back the bride so now the whole bible declares one purpose one goal not 66 books one story one heart purpose one desire and everything has been working to this one desire old testament come to the headstone come through the capping off and there was a man with the fullness of god dwelling inside and then that man was male and female god would take that man to calvary like he took adam laid him down and smote him in the side took out what he needed to make his bride the spirit come out of christ amen the water and the blood came out and would begin to make a bride and now that bride would begin to be formed over seven church ages but in the end time what's he going to do at the end friends what's going to happen at the end of the seven church ages how will we know where is the prophecy laying where's the image that's going to tell us what's going to happen go back to genesis what's he going to do at the end after he gets his bride formed and fashioned and made and got to the place that she's supposed to be now he's going to bring adam back on the scene adam was asleep during the forming of amen amen adam was asleep during the forming of of his bride amen in jesus christ amen have been separated because because of the fallen nature of man and because of the fall through the first church ages he had been absent amen but now he's been building and building and building and building his bride but at the end what's he going to do he's going to do the same thing he did in genesis he's going to take these two and put them together and they'll no more between but they will be one one flesh one body one head united to one body amen connected together and you're gonna see the oneness displayed in the last day and god will declare it is now very good praise be to god see friends where do we find what we believe it's the whole bible that's why that's why you can have somebody ask you questions about the seventh seal what's the seven seals seven seals of mystery the seventh seal listen the mystery's been unveiled but what is the mystery where is it where is the seventh seal brother bear said i can show you all the way back in genesis the seventh seal coming right up what is the seventh seal it's the coming of the lord how is the lord coming amen the same way god made his first son coming in the form of man then splitting off of the man the feminine then uniting the two back together what is that that's the seventh seal what's this whole bible declaring the mystery of the seventh seal when those seals came off the bible it opened up the whole bible the whole bible has one mystery that one mystery has three folds amen to get preeminence in a man amen the last adam jesus christ he did that jesus christ get preeminence in the bride he's doing that now and to what restore back to the garden of eden that's the whole bible friends what is that that's the seventh seal so where's the sims deal show me the scripture show me where it's open where do you want me to start i mean should we just start genesis 1 1 and read all the way through it's all the seventh seal it's the seventh seal and then coming right on down through and god's showing us what his heart's purpose has been he never let out the mystery all at once and he only let it out in parts never revealing the whole mystery but he would save that for the end time and he doesn't tell everybody he only tells those who can receive it ram says in christ is the mystery god revealed is it predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on the earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now remember we're talking about adoption and that word adoption is two words combined together that means the sun placed or set or put so it's the placing of a sun a sun that was already a sun a sun that's been a sun all along but that sun now is taken after it's after the sun's matured been tested by the tudor been trained by the holy ghost and placed into a position of power and authority and so now brother brennam's saying now he's going to he knew he knew that eve would fall but he had in his mind already hart's desire to have a bride after his own choosing she was predestinated she was predestinated not to fall i tell you friends if that doesn't take the scare and worry away i don't know what will amen no i'm afraid i'm going to fall away i'm afraid i'm going to backslide my if you're part of this you can never backslide enough to take yourself out of the mind of god in his heart purpose that he decreed before the foundation of the world what he determined the names that he wrote in the lands book of life before the foundation of the world there's not an eraser that can erase that there's not a deed you can do there's not a backsliding that you can do to take yourself out of that book if you were placed there before the foundation of the world as a bride as a as the elect member of the bride if you were placed there as an elected member of the bride amen chosen to be part of this final bride amen there's nothing you can do or anybody else can do to take you out of that so let all the scare go away just relax and be what god called you to be and let god flow through you all that nervous tension and fear and worry up and down it's never going to accomplish the purpose of god in our lives is going to tie us up in knots and bind us down amen we've got to get rid of that and say if god's word is true and i know that his word is true and i believe that i'm part of that word then i can no more fail than god can fail no more be lost than god can be lost if i'm a part of god if i've come from the mind of god if god knew me before the foundation of the world and determined that i would be here to play this part amen nothing is going to take that away from me so now what do i do now every bluff and scare tactic and mind battle of the devil i just resist it in jesus name because i already have my feet planted on a solid rock of god's word that is not shifting that has not moved since before there were rocks before there was a rock before there was an atom before there was a molecule or a bit of star dust he already decreed that i would be here in this day and not fail that's a rock that we can stand on friends that will give us confidence to face every trial face every trial every circumstance that comes our way the devil he's always bluffing bluff tactics and the scary thing is these bluffs look so real but we know this life is the vapor the mist the real ones on the other side so he can make the vapor and mist look so scary but don't don't worry this is the temporal not the permanent the permanent's coming he he said there would be a bride that would not fall regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestined to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand how will i stand when all the pressure comes how will i stand all the rejection how will i stand if the whole world turns against the message how will i stand because you've been chosen predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ you've already been placed to make the stand in the mind of god that's your position the bride's position in the end this is the adoption of children by jesus christ if you're here at the end time and you're part of the bride then you've been adopted or positioned or placed in the mind of god before the foundation world to make the last stand in the last day and you won't fail how will i do it i don't know but look how everything else worked out in the bible i mean read the bible god's plan has never been thwarted his purpose has never been overrun i mean he's never lost yet everything that he chose to do he's doing everything that looked like it was going bad worked out good i don't know how he's going to do it but he's going to do it and that's my adopted place my place is to make that stand on the word and not fail on the word if god chose me to do that before the foundation of the world that he must have a mechanism in place that'll ensure that i get the job done he's not just depending uh you know he's not just depending on the fallacy of human flesh and a human intellect in a human mind but he has unlocked or released his spirit in full measure in this day because the spirit of god's been bound through false understanding and false teaching and false doctrine and got everybody so cobbled up and confused in their minds they don't know where they came from they don't know who they are they don't know what their purpose is on life and they don't know what god's plan is next but god amen and because the word was bound by denomination and doctrines and ideas of man the holy ghost was limited chained bound could not move in freedom but god had a mechanism in place in the last day because he had a bride chosen in him his heart's purpose to have a bride of his own choosing who would not fail on the word who would make the last stand who would reverse whatever was done by eve this bride is going to reverse the damage that was done there because she's not going to fail the same way amen so what mechanism did he release he opened his word he took the seals off of the book and when he took the seals off of the book the holy ghost himself in full measure came to abide in his bride and now it's not you or i but it's christ in me the hope of glory now it's not it's not just all the mechanisms that i had in my brain when i was born and all the ability that i had gained through life but there was something more amen there's a literal life of jesus christ abiding in his bride giving her the ability the strength to stand on the word and not fail by one word you realize eve fell by one word that means this bride cannot fail on even one word or she's in the same position that first bride was so she must stand on all the word how are we going to do it brother chad i don't even know that i understand it all it doesn't matter amen he's here he's leading us he's guiding us it's his spirit it's christ in us the hope of glory we just have to yield to that and trust in that trust in what he's made us trust in where he's put us you know he didn't call you in luther's day he called you today he didn't place you in another age he placed you today if he placed you today there's a purpose to be fulfilled in that place see he says i'm going to repeat this last statement he said regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to the word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now you see this secret now you see the secret do you see it now what's the secret amen she's the secret how do you know she's the secret because the beginning declares the end there was a secret in adam when god made adam and put him in flesh there was a secret in adam because there was a woman in adam and the animals could rub up against him and the animals could hear his voice and hear him call and he could speak and name them and he could do all the things that he could do in creation amen but there was a mystery there was a secret inside adam and that god intended for that secret to be expressed and that secret was a bride and then i wonder how surprised all the animals were when all of a sudden they saw two but had to realize that there's not two there's only one it's still hard for some of these animals to recognize it looks like two it looks like more than two it looks like a mini member body it looks like fingers toes hands it looks like thousands it looks like down through the church ages all compiled together it looks like possibly millions amen but they don't realize that's just one now you see a secret what too to restore falun eve as she was a prefigure of the church and now notice as god opened up the side of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminist to feminists and put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing taking out of the sight of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word making up his church eve see back to himself again he's not making something else back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now god's great mystery now being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but pete prefigured it all the way down through now watch we find that he did that he did that and here here in ephesians and many other places but they will give you enough to now down through the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery that's why we say the whole bible is one story it's down through the ages he's been unfolding this mystery and now we've come to the end time where god is taking the mystery away from the mystery you realize it's not a mystery anymore it's a secret it's a mystery to the animals but to the children of god it's a secret because he's whispered his love secrets in our ears he's revealed to us the mysteries for us it's no longer a mystery it's a secret in the stature of a perfect man i'm going to spend some time in this message brother ben preached this in october of 1962. he said in this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells so when when brother bran was preaching stature of a perfect man this is his subject so he's talking about statue of a perfect man we can many of us know statute of perfect man we've read it we've listened to it he starts talking about the virtues that are in first peter and we'll turn there and read through those and you know you have all these virtues that are building up to the capstone of love seven virtues and the eighth is love and and we we can see this we can look at this um we can we we can look at this message and almost begin to look at it mechanically in a way that that these are steps of progression that i've got to go to faith and i got to go to temperance and i've got to go to all these things but what brother bannon's really trying to get us to back up and see is that god is building a living tabernacle for he himself to live in that's his subject and so don't don't lose the subject with all the details but focus on the subject and i'll read again this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle now his title statue of a perfect man but his subject is building the living tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells where is god in his dwelling place in his tabernacle where is that brother brethren's trying to show us let's go to ii peter we'll read some of this together second peter chapter one verse 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so i'm going to stop here and look at this word partakers of the divine nature you know we're given exceeding and great precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature amen and when i when i think sometimes if a partaker is something that you take or you take it to yourself or you take and you partake of it you eat it or whatever commune on it but i looked the word up partakers and in the word here means a partner an associate a comrade or a companion so it's not that we're just feeding on the divine nature or taking bits of it but we're called to be a partner in the divine nature a comrade a companion in the divine nature why it's back to male and female again his nature in her so by these precious promises we are made to be a partner an associate a comrade a companion of the divine nature having escaped the corruption is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ back to stature of a perfect man in paragraph 77 a body has thou prepared me god dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship i just want to stop and think about that perfect worship oh i mean we could try to get the atmosphere just right in here and the songs just right and come and pray just right amen but but if we just come into a building and try to sing the right songs and hear the right word is that the right atmosphere we could never have perfect worship because perfect worship is when deity is tabernacled inside of you and you have fellowship with god in you christ in you the hope of glory amen jesus told his disciples my father and i we will come to you and make our abode with you this has been the purpose amen from the beginning that god would dwell in man amen he says a body has to help prepared me god dwells in the stature of a man reflecting himself into that being perfect worship god in us being his tabernacle god manifesting in worship when we use the word worship there's we we have the terms praise and worship praise is to sing out or shout out his declaration or to speak out his glory or to sing a song but worship really means to bow down in subjection to so we're going to have perfect worship perfect worship is the same as allowing him to have preeminence so god wants to be tabernacled in flesh in human flesh god wants to dwell in the tabernacle of human flesh amen and to have perfect worship there we have to worship by subjection by bowing down and allowing god to have absolute preeminence in us so there's no longer our thoughts our desires but it's his word on display through us it's his thoughts his will his desire perfect worship tabernacled uh being his tabernacle god manifesting oh how we could stay on that to you almost suffocating here from the heat notice that god has always at all time reflected himself in man further down the same message we're not building an organization i'm not here this morning to build an organization christ never sent me to build an organization christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word by his word see building up the individual to that place not building an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to sons and daughters of god oh i tell you friends if brother banham wanted to he could have built a whole movement centered around himself he could have been the the great the almost like a god upon the earth with a denomination around him but he recognized that wasn't his purpose amen if he had done that he would have defeated the purpose of god because the purpose of god amen was not to just have another prophet that would show up like jeremiah isaiah or all that but he was wanting an eleazer to go and call him a bride amen he was he was wanting something more amen not just another display of power not just another demonstration of god's power and ability but he wanted to he wanted to show and vindicate this vessel so that the bride would trust this vessel so that he could go and fetch a bride amen for the son and so he said i we're not here building an organization we're not trying to have the best church waste of time we're not here trying to have the best assembly the bestest or the best at or the best church or do things the best way it's all an absolute waste of time friends because someday this building is going to crumble it's going to be on fire it's going to be whatever it's going to be amen but the purpose that we have amen is to go he says christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word that's why if we as a body of believers are successful in this amen it doesn't matter if the church disappears the building disappears tomorrow amen if we've worked to make individuals into the stature of jesus christ so that they will be the powerhouse of the spirit the work of god will diminish not one fraction of a second if this place vanishes if it burns down to the ground in an hour's time amen nothing will stop because our purpose is not to have a nice building nice church nice group of believers better than everybody else the purpose is to build children amen unto the stature of jesus christ that they might be the individual powerhouse themselves of the spirit the empowerment the encouragement the establishment the adopted placing of the bride of jesus christ is our only focus to call those at the bride amen saying come out of her my people and be ye separate and then move them into the stature of jesus christ by the word so that they're established on the word so that they become a partaker of the divine nature and they become the powerhouse of the spirit by his word brother branham is basically just quoting ephesians 4 the purpose of the faithful ministry ephesians 4 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ that's the building up till we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so what what's the purpose of the faithful ministry to build individuals into the statue of jesus christ so that they might be the powerhouse of the spirit by the word i'd say it this way the church is not here to support the ministry the ministry is here to support the church the bride to help the bride find her place to help the bride awaken to the word be established on the word to her place because she's to be one with christ she's to be the manifestation of jesus christ on the earth not only in the pulpit but in the body brother said again in the statue of a perfect man now that is the house that god dwells in not a building with a big bell on top of it and a high steeple see but a body has thou prepared me now if you think really clearly when brother man starts using this term a body has thou prepared me he is speaking of the tabernacle of jesus christ the old testament prophecy of jesus christ coming he says uh uh but uh but but god doesn't dwell on the temple made by hands but a body has thou prepared me showing that he was going to dwell in a body in the body of jesus christ now brother branham is picking up that same scripture you realize friends that scripture that that every other church knows about that everybody else in a in the christian world knows and they can apply that to jesus christ but a body house thou made me he comes suddenly into his temple amen the temple of jesus christ the body god dwelled in in fullness the fullness of the godhead bodily amen we can apply that scripture but there come a prophet in our day that can pick that scripture back up and say but it's not done yet how do you know it's not done yet because the beginning declared the end we haven't hit the end yet until we've seen what we've seen in the beginning [Music] so he picks that scripture you see why understanding how he declared the the in from the beginning shows you how to place the scriptures brother branham knew that that scripture wasn't done so he can pick it up and he says but a body has thou prepared me a body that god can dwell and god can walk and god can see and god can talk and god can work and amen living instrumentality of god god walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of god god walking in you for ye are written epistles read of all men and if the life that is in christ be in you you'll bear the life that christ bore this is this is the way if we recognize the last adam that's wonderful we recognize the whole christian world recognizes the last adam but you realize that's not the complete heart's desire of god amen when god saw that in the beginning he said it wasn't good that he should dwell alone he was going to make a help me so if we stop there we've stopped in the not good part the incomplete masterpiece the unfinished work i mean we've got to the place where we stopped before god stopped because god didn't stop and rest until he finally had these two back together as one so it's god walking on two feet in you god walking in you i know that's a tall order friends but it's the truth it sounds so impossible sometimes to human intellect but it's what god wanted it's his heart purpose from the beginning when john the baptist come walking out of the wilderness clothed in camel skins and eating locusts and he says repent for the kingdom of god as i hand it was god walking in two feet because john the baptist was the literal manifestation of the word and god is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us not only in jesus christ it was all encapsulated jesus christ all the word was there but it was the word in moses it was the word in jeremiah it was the word in david it was the word in solomon and all of it was in jesus christ but when john the batters come walking down amen it was the word of god walking out of the wilderness because the scripture said he would when he was when he was crying repent when he was calling them to repentance and baptism what was he doing he was making all the high places low and he's making all the low places high it was the word the word was now embodied in this vessel of john the baptist it was god the word encapsulated in a human being and he was the word walking on two feet jesus christ came the fulfillment of all the word come in him but now he's out a bride through seven church ages but he's promised that there would be a bride without spot a wrinkle one that was washed by the water of his word he's going to have a bride of his own choosing he will have a bride amen to declare at the end what he already showed at the beginning he will have a bride that will fully unite with jesus christ and the two shall be won it will happen because the beginning declares that he will happen so when you and i walk week by week and surrender and obedience to the word when we lay down our will and take his word when we surrender our thoughts and take what the prophet taught us on the word and let the word shape our thinking and not not the laodicea not the world amen not america culture but we let the word shape our thinking we repent to our foolishness and we take god's word we surrender our will to his we are the word god walking in skin again it's not it's not just i woke up and i i brush my teeth and i go about my business no this is the this is god's business you're here on god's business you're here on by god's plan by god's predestination by god's order by god's adoption placed you in this age and it is nothing less than the word of god walking in skin again when brother branham came and he was preaching and declaring all that he was declaring it was the same thing it was in john the baptist it was the word in flesh manifesting itself in that day we have no problem saying that was john the baptist we have no problem saying that was brother branham but we have a little bit of a problem when we bring it home to ourselves and i'll say we've got to go back and look at the beginning and if we got any struggle at all amen making that same making that same movement of thought and translating it into us as an individual we've got to go right back to the beginning again because until he's got a bride amen on this earth and united back to him that work is not done this bible is not complete [Music] and that's nothing less than the word it's not a sub word it's not a second word it's the word amen he is the word amen just a few things i just want to share i just i'm trying my hardest to take my time stop chad stop brother says in the statue of a perfect man he said these fellows once who required what these fellows are brother bam now he draws out on the board the statue of a perfect man and he lists these seven virtues going up to the capstone of of love and he goes all the way up and then he starts drawing the church ages beside it seven virtues seven church ages and now he's starting to say now these wasn't required what these was now he's showing that we've talked about so many times that that luther lived a greater life in the age of luther than they lived under the dark ages he recognized salvation by faith justification by faith amen and they began to move up and now there was more required to have that faith in the word and then then we moved into the wesleyan age and now they they had more than the lutheran age had because now they have sanctification you're justified but you also must live a clean and holy life and begin moving up and he said this one wasn't required but this was required and what he's showing is brother branham now has been talking about how god brings and he says the stature of a perfect man now when we look at the stature of a perfect man we could get all boggled up in our minds and we could say this is the stature of a man who never has any fault or failure ever in his life when you think well that'll never happen but he's saying when he's talking about the statue of a perfect man he's talking about a complete man or a mature man brother branham is talking about maturity which is exactly what ties into adoption because you adopt a son when he comes to maturity and shows himself a mature son so now he's talking about the stature of a complete or a mature son now he's talking about the church ages he goes from the individual now he flops over to the church and says see these weren't required what these were and this one's was required more than this and as it goes up as the revelation unfolds that there's more required because to whom much is given much is required so then he goes on and he says this wasn't required what this one was see but he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he's brought his people up and blasphemous names the next month just two weeks later he says this has to be first and when you have faith true knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly love then the holy ghost comes down and seals you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit that's what i want to focus on now the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like eve was made out of adam a rib from his side i want you to hold on to this thought and i'm going to go somewhere else i'm going to come back to this thought but when he gets to the statue of a perfect man and then again in blasphemous names he's starting to show that that that god's saying that that that at faith at the base amen somebody is born again amen they're born again by faith i mean they have the baptism of the holy ghost but they're working their way up in maturity and becoming a partaker they're sharing in the divine nature amen and at the top they come they come to maturity they come to completionist and they come to adoption i'll use those words and the holy ghost caps it off and fuses it all together and all these words that brother branham uses but he's describing this and he's going to flip over now and say now the church ages is the same way the way he does the individual that's the way he caps that's the way he encapsulates seals the church ages so now you realize whatever he's talking about for an individual the same thing's playing out for the church ages now brother branham says or no let's turn to matthew let's look at matthew together matthew 17. matthew 17. i'm going to really start getting into the meat of where i want to be all of that was foundation matthew 17 verse 1 and after six days jesus taken peter james and john his brother and brought them up into a high mountain apart this is what we know as mount transfiguration it's amazing after six days there's going to be a mount transfiguration after six days or like maybe after six ages so matthew and mark uses the same language that after six days but luke is a little different luke says about an on the eighth day and you say what's going on here matthew and mark if we just read matthew and mark we would say after six days so on the seventh day amen we're going to have a mount transfiguration experience but luke goes over here and he throws a little wrench in the works he says about let's just look at it together let's go to luke chapter nine we've got time right we're not going anywhere oh you can i'll stay luke 9 and i think it's verse 27 but let me look okay yeah luke 9 and 28 and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings where did the seven go these guys should have got together before they wrote this because they're going to confuse people because we understand there's going to be something that takes place on the seventh day there's gonna be something that takes place in the seventh age but that thing that takes place in the seventh age is going to be a transition into the eighth the seventh is never mentioned after six after six and about on the eighth day and you wanna wonder what what are they talking about hey they're all talking about the same event they're not talking about two different events or two different happenings they're talking about the same event something's going to happen after six days that is going to bring them into the eighth day the bible is written so specific friends it's it's written the way it's written for a reason there's not contradictions there's mysteries laying there that god intends to move from a mystery to a secret so there's something going to happen after six days obviously on the seventh but but it's also going to be on the 8th amen if you can figure that out then i'm going to say there's a spirit of revelation in the room because we know we've if we've made that transition ourselves so let's keep reading back in matthew 17 matthew 17 verse 1 and after six days jesus taken peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto him moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou let us make your three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias while yes spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard this no i'm going to stop there here ye him is where i want to finish so now they they're on mount transfiguration and jesus is transfigured before them and they also see moses and they see elijah and it's amazing the spirit of revelation that is on this mountain because we'll put it this way peter james and john didn't have bible story books with pictures even if they had the drawing of moses and elijah would not be accurate to the way moses and elijah actually looked so these three men have never seen moses elijah nor a depiction of moses and elijah but when they get on mount transfiguration and they get caught up into that cloud where jesus was transfigured all of a sudden they have a spirit of revelation and i know who two these guys are they weren't introduced to them no there was no names exchanged but somehow they all come down why because they were caught up into the cloud on top of the mount where jesus was transfigured before them they saw him in his glory and when they did they knew who these two guys were there's things amen that are laying in this message there's things that are mysteries to some but secrets to another and there's something when god catch you up in the revelation all of a sudden you just know that's the way it is i know that's who that is i know that's who i am i know that's the way it is you hear somebody preaching something and all of a sudden they they take two scriptures and they just mention two scriptures they tie together and all of a sudden bang you were caught up in a cloud and saw jesus transfigured before your eyes and you knew what that scripture meant praise be to god hallelujah so now we see him caught up with moses and elijah and brother bram tells us moses represents the law and elijah represents the prophets so when you know when they when jesus says the law and the prophets were until john what jesus is saying is all of the old testament was till john but now we're moving so that term the law and the prophets just meant the whole bible as they had it to that day so when moses and elijah appear as witnesses moses moses and elijah represent the entire bible to that day the law and the prophets and and peter gets enthused in that atmosphere and he says oh let's build a tabernacle into all three and then the law the prophets and jesus and and listen to the voice he says this is my beloved son this is my son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him he is everything they were talking about you don't need a temple to moses and a temple to elijah and a temple to jesus all you need to do is hear him he's the fullness of what they brought he was the full revelation of the full word you didn't need three temples you need three places of worship all you needed was the one who had been transfigured in his adoption brother branham calls this jesus adoption brought him up on a high mountain changed his garment before them he was transfigured they saw him glorified amen he was witness to by moses and elijah and god declared this is my adopted son in whom i'm well pleased hear him he's speaking for me praise be to god brother the man says in the message desperations from 63 god did the same thing by the son of on mount transfiguration he was overshadowed or a cloud was transfigured in his raiment shine like the sun and the voice said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased moses and the law had failed and this is him here ye him he was placed he was placed as what he was placed as the fulfillment of the word you understand that moses and elijah are there to testify he's it they they want to go back to moses elijah he said forget them not not in a bad way don't don't mistake what i'm saying but don't look to him if you want to see moses elijah look here hear him this is him this is it so he was placed as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets brother says is your life worthy of the gospel he said he was worthy of the gospel so much that god said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him my word is he he is my word he and i are the same hear ye him my word listen my word is he he is my word he and i are the same now make sure we don't stop with adam in the garden by himself because the masterpiece isn't done yet the work of god's not finished being declared if all we have is the second adam in the garden by himself all power in heaven earth is given to me i'm the declaration of the full word and we stop there on mount transfiguration we have not finished the masterpiece or what god was declaring to be at the end when he showed us in the beginning that's why brother brahm could pick up this scripture a body house that'll prepare me he could bring it right back to our day and talk about the bride of jesus christ because he recognized what god declared from the beginning so he says my word is he he is my word he and i are the same mother says in the masterpiece but let us not forget that in the beginning when he smote the side of adam he took something from his side now the smiting of christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected then he had to smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but the same creation so he got his masterpiece done he had brother brahm tells us that he had gone to jordan to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and he had been tested and tried and proved himself a son and he'd been through every trial and every test and stood on the word and never failed the word and answered all their questions and stood all the trials of rejection and mocking and all this and he finally comes to mount transfiguration and in mount transfiguration he's declared to be the fulfillment of the word i'm adopting him i'm placing him it's all in him hear ye him and when he got to that place brother baby says now it was just a short time from there to calvary because he had an adopted son on the earth now he's got to keep working this masterpiece he can't rest he can't stop it's not over now he's got to say i got the second adam i've got him in position i got him in place he is all the word encapsulated in one body there's nothing left for me to do but strike this body and pull from his side something to make the bride [Applause] he got him adopted he took him over and smote him amen now he laid him down and now amen he's fashioning a bride praise god now i'm going to keep reading this quote i didn't even finish it now the smiling of christ was for a cause might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected he had to smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took part of the original creation then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word living god in the word if adam was the original he had to take from the original to make the woman and if christ is the original word adopted son placed in position he had to strike him and take out of him the original he took out of him the original what was he what was she she's the word he's the word she's the word they're two parts of the same thing see brother goes back to blasphemous names now he says see a family when a son is born into it a son but the son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of son he never became heir but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he became heir of what the father had and that's what god is was doing on mount transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proven to be the right son see and that stood all the temptation he took him up on mount transfiguration and overshadowed him hear ye him he says and now moses and elijah jesus was glorified before them then his ramen shine like the sun now what was he trying to do here we find out that he went up there they found a cloud overshadowed him his clothing was changed the vesture that he was in and it shined like the sun and brightness and a cloud was over him and a voice saying this is my beloved son whom i am well pleased hear ye him he says who do you say this is from the end of 1964 and while he was yet speaking there was a voice come down said this is my beloved son hear ye him that's when they look back they seen jesus only there he stood he was the word that's all you have to hear is that word that's him in any age see what the word says for that age and watch god anoint it and go with it that's all when they they were wanting to go back to moses elijah but they didn't realize moses and elijah was only part of the masterpiece building up to the head now when jesus christ came amen he was in flesh all that they were and all that will be in the word was brought unto him he said hear ye him amen and and when they they were wanting to look back but he says no they looked they saw jesus only he said see that's all you have to see if all i have to see is jesus how do i see jesus you find the word for your age that's made manifest for your age and there he is don't look back look to him amen look for him and keep moving now i want to i want to make another jump and we're going to go back i want to go back and tie in where brother brahma said the way he works as individuals the way he works the church now remember jesus received the baptism of the holy ghost is the way brother brahm said it and explained it in the jordan and he was led by the holy ghost in the wilderness to be tempted to be tried to be tested because that was his stage of the journey but then he would come to mount transfiguration in the mount transfiguration he'd be glorified before them and he would be declared to be the word and hear ye him and a short time after that he would go to calvary so you have you have let's see this way you have the holy ghost baptism but at the end you have an adoption a placing a declaration an understanding to them of who this is he's my son he's speaking for me now i want to fast forward and go to sunset mountain because in sunset mountain is where that pyramid of cloud came down amen it was a brother man calls it a constellation of angels it's interesting he calls it a constellation because what else do we call a constellation whenever you talk to a constellation you're talking about stars so he's talking about a constellation of angels because these angels are the seven stars of the seven churches it's a constellation of angels and he he says here in the message of saying ashamed he said you see the picture the other day how he turned that picture sideways there and the very picture of those seven angels being lifted up turned it to the right hand side and there is the face of the lord jesus looking down to the earth again so we've all done this many times you see that that pyramid-shaped cloud constellation of seven angels brotherhood talks about you turn it to the right and you can see in the in the background hoffman's head of christ you can see the face of jesus christ and it was made or formed by brother branham said the wings of the angels or the seven angels actually formed the image of jesus christ in the sky and then the message uh approached our reproach for the cause of the word in 62 he says right at the end he's right in december 23rd said i can just see them and their heads kind of turn sideways he's talking about the vision he saw the angels coming before he went out to arizona he's still in jeffersonville he's talking about this experience i can just see them and their heads kind of turned sideways those wings tipped back full armored and here they come so whoo like that and just go right down and just took me right into this pyramid of the constellation of them i seen i was off up off the ground so brother branham in the vision now he's describing the vision and he he sees the little birds go fly east a little pyramid form resting fly east and then the little doves come and resting in the shape of a pyramid fly east and then all sudden he hears a bang and here comes these these angels amen and they pick he said they picked me up into the constellation of themselves to take me back east and so now you find out that brother branham now he's in the vision he sees this happening in the vision now he goes out to arizona and he's out in arizona hunting and and now this whole event is going to take place where there's going to be a loud bang and there was a a constellation of angels a cloud amen and brother ben said i jumped up off the ground those angels stood right before me they told me go back east for the opening of the seven seals so here you have mount transfiguration jesus caught up on the mountain and up on the mountain he's in a cloud and in the cloud is moses and elijah moses and elijah the law and the prophets the old testament but now we're coming to the end of the seven church ages at the end of the seven church ages there's a prophet on the scene in fulfillment of the word but that prophet was more than just the prophet he was also part of the bride and as part of the bride also he goes to sunset mountain and he's caught up in a cloud just like mount transfiguration caught up in a cloud and in the cloud it's a constellation of seven angels or seven church-aged messengers representing the whole new testament it's the same thing friends same thing and now he's going to go back go back east amen for the opening of the seals and brother comes back for the opening of the seals and when he opened the seals he said it opened up the entire bible what was he given he was given a sword in the hand he was given the word of the lord and then he opened up the entire bible all of the mysteries revealed the great mystery of god revealed at that time but see it wasn't just for brother branham i mean the scripture says that that that mighty angel tore off those seals amen threw them down to the seventh church messenger who gave him to the people so it wasn't just for him what came for him came for you and i see i'd like to say it was more than just a man getting caught up into a cloud but if you'll allow me to say it this way it was the bride getting caught up into a cloud he was the wave chief the first one to come to harvest maturity the first one that could come to an adoption but he wasn't going to be the only one amen he was the first of an entire harvest that was coming to maturity amen and as the wave sheep he was the example he was the display he was portraying what god was going to do in all of the rest and so he goes up on sunset mountain amen at the closing the sun set for gentile age sunset for civilization sunset for church ages and on sunset mountain all the sudden he's caught into a cloud and in the cloud we find out later that that cloud was jesus christ and it was the seven church age messenger now it's not moses and elijah jesus fulfilled that but now it's been the entire new testament from the time of paul on now is all encapsulated in this cloud jesus christ the headship coming back to the body and brother branham representing the bride gets lifted off and what does he do he meets him in the air for what for the adoption of the bride all the way back in pentecost on the day of pentecost there was an outpouring of the holy ghost is that right just like jesus all the way back at jordan baptism of the holy ghost all the way back in the first the beginning before the first church age back in the first church there was an outpouring of pentecost the holy ghost fell but there's got to be a capping off time if jesus had a capping off time this bride has to have a capping off time and the way he did his sons the way he did jesus christ was an example to us the way he does the individual is the way he caps off the whole church age and he built the church age up through seven church ages he built jesus christ up through the law and the prophets and jesus was standing there in a cloud with the law and the prophets moses and elijah and he built the church up through seven church ages amen and there was brother branham the wave sheep representing the bride standing there with seven witnesses with seven stars with seven spirits declaring what now we've come to the adoption age at the end of the seven ages this is capstone age love age adoption age amen the maturity the bride has been maturing through seven church ages this one needed more than that and this one needed more than that this one needed more than that until finally he got a church that would break away from the nomination break away from man's ideas break away from man's thinking and where was that church represented it was represented in that one wave chief offering and they talked that wave sheave offering and took him to the top of a mountain encapsulated him in a cloud that was the presence of jesus christ with the witnesses of the seven church ages to say this is him hear ye him and when i say hear ye him i'm not talking about that man i'm talking about the same jesus christ when he said hear him on mount transfiguration mount sunset is declaring the same thing it's the holy ghost the person of god person of jesus christ himself has been bound by denominations and chained but to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the people again what is it it's the adoption age amen now we don't have to know where we're at i'm not in luther's age i'm not wesley age i'm not in the pentecostal age amen this is not the seventh age the world's in the seventh age but he lifted he lifted brother branham up into a cloud to show we've come to something else now about on the eighth day we've come to amen this church i'm not talking about us as individuals now don't take this in the individual way they're still being individuals being born into the body of jesus christ growing up into maturity being placed in the positions that's still currently going on friends but i'm talking over the last 2000 years there's been an adoption process going on amen and it started when he declared this is my children this is my body these are my sons amen all the way back on the day of pentecost and the holy ghost leadership has been leading the church and training the church they've been learning from taking men's ideas and falling in the dark age and suffering persecution same thing jesus christ went through coming through coming through coming through working through seven church ages until he comes to the final one after six days about on the eighth day now it's going to be the adopting of the church that's why brother brennan will come right back to preach the seals and they'll say i no longer call you church what's he doing he's placing the church this is positional placing see before the the spirit was always in in revelations uh chapter two and three the spirit is always speaking to two vines but now brother branham he's coming to an adoption time and he's not speaking to two vines anymore because one of those vines is getting the adoption and the other ones not and now he comes and he says i i'm not going to call you church any longer this is not the intertwining of of two branches this is not speaking in general term this is not the maturing and growing up faith amen now i'm not talking individual now i'm talking in a hole look at 2 000 years i'm no longer this is no longer growing up and building through justification sanctification baptist holy ghost restoration of the gifts all of that was maturing maturing maturing maturing because this bride is not just made up of you and i here at the end time but the bride is made up of the bride amen through all seven church ages he's been building up in maturity releasing his word slowly unfolding his plan letting out the mystery until finally he can come to a church that's come to maturity and say i'll adopt this church and in this adoption amen there'll be no creeds no dogmas no doctrines of man and i don't care what's happened in what's so called the message anymore that has nothing to do with me what's been happening over the last 50 years but there's been an adoption that's taken place and there's been a people who want the word and the word only that's been lifted out of denominationalism that's been lifted out of man's ideas and just want the word coming into an adoption and brother branham showed and jesus christ you know he's got he's got this three and a half year ministry he's got this baptism in jordan three and a half year ministry then he got mount transfiguration a capping off and declaration and here you him and then he says he's got just a short time to calvary in that short time the calvary is a short time not just to calvary but to resurrection to resurrection and rapture and now take that same pattern and lay it over the church ages you've got a baptism at pentecost you've got 2 000 years of seven church ages amen then you've got an adoption process on mount sunset and then you've got just a short time brother jesus was just days or weeks so he went to calvary but it was based on a 33 year lifespan and a three and a half year ministry amen now we're going to take it back and overshadow that over the whole church what is a short time maybe 60 years maybe 65 years but after he comes to that adoption it's just a short time now to resurrection brother brahm says all the way back in revelation chapter 4 part 2 in 1961 he says he's referring to john in revelation chapter four he says and there was a living creature what john represented the entire church was taken up he said i told you one person hearing a vision can represent an entire body of christ covered don't think brother taj is coming up with this on his own amen one person in a vision can represent the entire body of christ amen and brother branham and the vision was caught into the constellation of angels and one man in the vision can represent the entire body of christ he says in the message it is the rising of the sun as christ was the first one to race from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheep what was the sheep the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was sheep hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i live you live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now when i say it's to be waved again in the last days that wave chief was waved again one man can represent the whole body of christ oh was that amazing that brother ben got caught into that constellation of angels where was he caught up into if you turn the picture to the right you can find out he was caught into the mind of god and to the mind of christ he was caught up into the mind of christ to go back to reveal the revelation of the mysteries that have tied up the entire book for all these years and in revealing those mysteries it was the in the entire bible the entire mind of christ was open in that day i'll tell you friends don't let brother brennan be the only one that was caught up in that cloud the cloud of what the seven church ages the seven churches of what making up the headship of christ the word restored amen through the seven church ages coming back the restoration of the word the headship coming back to the body what is the headship the headship is the word all that's been lost is restored back that's what all those seven angels represent everything that was in portion portion portion portion portion now is all here don't let brother brendan be the only one caught up in the constellation don't let him to be the only one that goes into the mind of christ but i say oh god this is the adoption age adopt me lord give me that mind give me the revelation of jesus christ in this hour let me see the mystery that you declared from the beginning that i'm watching unfold in my life here at the end brother branham he goes from this experience early at night well late 1962 he has the vision 1963 he has the episode of sunset mountain comes back in march of 1963 preaches the seals amen comes in july preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed then then we go all the way through to to 1960 3 the end of 1963 in october brother branham goes to colorado knows what happened in colorado i just want to quickly go through the events in colorado with you because i want to show that this whole idea of adoption is not just a little trivial idea but god proved it right god backed it up let's go i'm just going to read through some quotes brother branham's preaching he's telling the story he tells us several places but i'm going to pull mostly from he that is in you brother man we know was in colorado hunting with a bunch of brothers in october 1963 63 starts off with the cloud the happening at sunset mountain coming back to preach he's ending it off here and he's talking about there's a blizzard that was coming and everybody heard the broadcast blizzard coming blizzard coming and brother bam told him in the camp you want to stay you want to go they wanted to stay and try to get their deer and he says well if it just starts you just get right down to camp because i've seen that blizzard you can't survive it you'll get lost and all of these other things so all of a sudden the weather starts to turn bad and starts to break out and he said speak to those winds in that storm and it'll it'll go away now this bible lays before me which my life is in that i raised up i said i do not doubt your voice lord i say cloud snow rain sleet i resent your coming in the name of jesus christ go to your place i say that the sun must come out immediately and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and i leave with my brethren he said immediately the wind started it was just roaring it just lightened up and a wind came from another direction and just pushed those clouds up and pushed them away and here you have a man a redeemed son a redeemed son a son that was born part of the fall a son that was born wrong but a redeemed son that had come to an adoption now he's saying you say to the storm it'll obey you this isn't jesus standing on the bow of the boat amen this is god in another form amen in a form of redeemed flesh he says you seek to storm and he spoke he just spoke out simply he said storm i resent your coming go away amen and son come out and shine for four days so that's exactly what happened he said then he says i picked up my gun wiped off the scope started to walk back down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through the wilderness walk with me i said yes lord with all my heart i would be one of the greatest things i could do was walk with you so i put my gun over my shoulder and i started walking down through that never an axe laid in it virgin timber walking through there and the message testimony says a great cathedral they were walking through a great cathedral virgin forest you know it goes on he says and so i went along like that something taken place all of a sudden in every motion principle i was a boy i thought as a boy and i had my head down and i looked up and i just as plain as i ever saw her there she stood before me with her arms out and i stopped rubbing my eyes i looked i said meeda is that you honey further down he says and that doe come walking now listen there had been hundred men shooting at them up there for four or five days scary the first sign of red and i had on a red shirt and red cap the first sign they're gone but they were standing there all three of them looking right at me i said mother take your babies and go out into the woods you're in my hands your life is in my hands but i ain't going to hurt you i promised god that i wouldn't and she walked closer she would look at me all of them walked closer till they came so close that they could eat out of my hands nearly they in the wind blowing right on them so she turned around walked back to a little piece all three of them and here she come back again walking right up to me i never moved just stood there i said go on out in the woods i love it too live see your life is in my hands but i'll spare you further on he says and i i wiped my face like that and just then something happened a voice spoke out just as clear right out of the blue skies not a cloud it all been within just a bit a little bit of time and a voice spoke out and said you remembered your promise didn't you i said yes lord he said i'll remember mine too i'll never leave you nor forsake you the burden left my heart it hasn't been there since may it never again in the message testimony he refers to the same thing he said i had been i had been feeling that horrible burden i've cried i've prayed i've confessed what can i do what is it that i've done like you had done something real evil like you had hurt somebody and you know you ought to make it right what was i condemned about i knew not i said lord if you'll only reveal it to me i'll make it right but what have i done but stand and preach and do all that i know to do and i've tried to live clean clear and just according to your words but what have i done and still that burden would not let up year after year i thought about on the mountain that morning and i started down and that's when he spoke to him said you remembered your promise he said back in the message he that is in you notice isn't that the truth isn't that the way it happened the rains just ceased and the wind ceased to blow what was it at my word no because he told me to do it and greater is he that is in us than any nature isn't the same god that would still the waves on the sea could make the winds go back to their place isn't he the same one that would darken the sun would make the sun shine well greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world brother branham after sunset mountain after going back and preaching the seals after positionally placing the bride i'll no longer call you church i'll call you bright i don't want you to be confused about who you are you're not in this mixed multitude anymore you've been brought out and established your bride he goes to this colorado and has this experience where brother says there's a blizzard blowing a storm blowing in and he said it's it's sure death and so in the face of sure death god speaks to him and says go back to where you came from he's walking out he was trying to get to safety go back go back into death god was going to show him something we don't have to be afraid to face death we don't have to be afraid to face whatever storm comes whatever blizzard comes whatever it looks black as night imminent death no way to find your way out of it if god says go you go because this is the adoption age this is the time for the manifestation of the sons of god now and into the millennium he told him to speak to the storm he gave him back control over nature he said i turned young again in every way i was a young man the way i thought he said one quote i looked at my hand looked up and there was my wife she was young too the animals had no more fear and brother brahms trying to explain how they've been shot at by a hundred men up there and all of this they should have scattered and they wouldn't leave it but he says go away and they come closer he has control of nature he's turned young again his wife is with him he's in virgin timber virgin timber and a cathedral a virgin timber never an ax laid to it and he's walking with the lord everything that adam lost was right there in that experience in canada or colorado adam had lost eternal life his youth forever amen he had lost his fellowship with god god could no longer come down in the cool of the evening and walk with him in the cool of the evening he had lost his fellowship with god he had lost eternal life he had lost harmony with nature he had lost his power to control nature and for a moment's time up on that mountain in colorado god took him to an experience that would show that this is the adoption age friends this isn't for another day this is for today this didn't happen far off this was not a preview for some far-off thing this was things that were taking place in our age to depict what age we're in so we could see we're not in the period of weight and weight and someday in weight we're in the period of now today this is the age of adoption this is the bright age this is the placing at the end of the church ages this is the bride that he wants to live in this is the bride coming of christ this is christ in the formation of the bride he wants she to be him he wants him to be so much alike that she will be in his very image we're not brother baby says we're not going to the marriage he said the marriage is here this is the time this is the age we're all individually individuals one coming in growing unto adoption getting placed but friends we are all every one of us know where we are in this age of adoption amen we're not back there in laodicea we're not back there in pentecost the pentecostal we are right up here in the adoption because he showed us all things are possible to them that believe all the words have been unveiled everything's been given to the bride amen all we're doing is just learning preeminence so god can tell us what to do and when to do it amen all the potential's been unlocked the way she's demonstrated it in ways that that are absolutely amazing in ways that we have not ever seen before and it was done that way so that we would know where we're at we've come to the adoption now what god wants to do he's going to do in and through his bride is that right yes when he brought jesus to mount transfiguration he says hear ye him they wanted to look back at moses they want to look bad elijah they wanted to build a tabernacle to them and he says no hear ye him now the bride has come to her age of adoption amen and now if he's going to do something on this earth he's going to do it in and through the bride i'm going to read a quote that's super super familiar but let's go back to genesis chapter 3. a couple weeks ago aaron mentioned this scripture you read it and it just was amazing i want to look at it genesis chapter 3 verse 8 this is after they have sinned adam and his wife have sinned genesis 3 verse 8 says and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden they didn't see anything in this scripture they heard the voice of god walking in the garden they didn't hear his feet you read the same thing i read they didn't hear him walking in the garden they heard his voice there's something amazing that's being established here at truth then in order for god to be present tense walking all you have to do is hear his voice and they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden they hadn't seen anything yet but they knew he was present because they heard his voice they had not seen him but they were hiding from his presence because they heard his voice walking in the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden same thing i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself this passage of scripture never declares that they saw him but they heard him brother branham in this in this sermon in colorado i won't have time to read it all but in colorado brother branham says i looked to see something i couldn't see anything but i heard him i know his voice and he said why don't you walk with me what did adam lose that god coming in the cool the evening to walk with him he lost that fellowship brother branham he said i looked again to see because a lot of times i'll hear that voice i'll see a pillar of fire i'll see something he said i looked and i couldn't see anything i couldn't see anything but he said why don't you walk with me he said i'd love to lord and when the deer come and wouldn't go he said you dear go i'm just enjoying myself in the presence of the lord how did he know he was in the presence of the lord he couldn't see anything the only way he knew he was in the presence of the lord is because he heard his voice and he was walking with a voice he was walking with the voice of the lord and he knew it was the presence of the lord that's what brother bran would say to us it's not me i'm just a microphone i'm just a voice that he it's not the seventh angel it's the son of man it's the revealing of the sin you say it's not me he's just using my voice but when we heard that voice and it was god it was jesus christ the lamb taking the book and breaking the seals amen we were hearing the voice of the lord only it was coming through that that that man amen that man who lived on earth his vocal cords his tones his inflections amen but it was the voice of jesus christ because he didn't know those things he came and revealed them to him one by one it was god speaking to us so i want to with all of this in mind the age of adoption the adopting of the church at the end with hear ye him on mount transfiguration with all of these things i want to now read this quote out of the laodicean church age from the church age book it says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again pure word was lost for organization tense toward dogma and creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god and then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who looked at us who took this revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until the last day there was again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age oh would to god the church would code or hop best of best of all she should be fervent hot but she is not sentence has been passed she is no longer god's voice to the world she will maintain that she is but god says not oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later god doesn't live in a house made with hands but a body has thou prepared me when we come to the first fulfillment of that scripture it was a body jesus christ it was born in a manger and grown up and god dwelt in it and he says the words that i speak unto you they're not mine but what i hear of the father well it was god in flesh walking in their midst they missed it it was god in flesh speaking his words through human lips and they couldn't hear the voice of god god because sent a prophet in our day and he didn't know what those seals were he didn't make them up it come to him where did he get it he got it from the lord the lamb himself who was that that opened the seals who was it that broke the seals who was it it was the lamb but all we saw was the man in the pulpit in fact i didn't even see that all i heard was the voice but when i heard that voice what was thundering in our heart was more than the words of a human being to me it was the voice of god calling to me adam adam where are you i'm here lord there's been a redemption there's been a price paid we don't have to stay hidden anymore from the voice that comes walking in the garden but now when we hear the voice of god come walking in the garden what's been restored the word has been restored the word of god has been restored and now where is that word of god that word is in the bride restored through a prophetic ministry given back to us amen in forms of print and forms of tape but that word now is living taking on flesh and the bride god he always wanted a tabernacle to dwell in and now there's a tabernacle of a bride on this earth and the headship has have to has to have a body to unite with and we are in uniting signs and times christ is here in his bride it's the bride form christ in bright form and now the world there's another voice to the world but what is it it's the voice of god walking in his garden in the cool of the evening he told brother brandon won't you walk with me and in that experience all that was lost in eden he now no longer had a guilty feeling he didn't know where it come from he didn't know why he carried that burden he didn't know how to get rid of it but all of a sudden that guilty feeling that was that mysterious guilty feeling was gone no more condemnation no more dread no more guilt youthful wife restored to him virgin timber walking with god how did he know he wasn't gone not what his eyes could see but what he heard the voice of god and god come down amen to unite with his bride amen and his bride is his garden read song of solomon his bride is his garden that great city the new jerusalem is a garden water comes out of the throne and goes over every trellis and in every yard and every tree it's a giant garden you are his garden you're his planting you're his husbandmanship you're the project that he's been working on since the beginning and now i'd like to present to you the voice of god is walking in his garden why because the word's been restored not shrouded in church age not shrouded in dogma not shrouding the denominationalism but the holy ghost himself is here my brother said he has no voice but yours and mine he has no lips he has no hands he has no feet but yours in mind we're living out the word friends this is the adoption age what he always intended for a church to be this is the church that'll be that there'll not be another one it's this age we've come to adoption there'll not be another messenger there'll not be another great display of a messenger it's already done we've come to the age of adoption it's been shown what he's going to do what he's done and now it's for us just to have confidence in that and say god whatever you want to do do it right in this vessel i'm yours i'm not waiting anymore i'm saying i surrender all to you right now i'm yours you want to have a voice use these vocal cords i have nothing to say i have nothing to offer but if i just say what the word says then it's not my words if i just say what the prophet said then it's not my words amen it's his we've come to the age of adoption singularly there's still individuals coming in but this church has been capped off by the headship of jesus christ divine love and now we're not waiting we're not looking we're just surrendering as we walk brother branham you realize as a human being when brother branham was manifesting things that were absolutely extraordinary he was doing it in such an ordinary way when he was praying for his wife's tumor amen this is the last time there was a manifestation of the third pool that he begins to talk about his wife's tumor and he speaks the tumor out of existence but if you listen to that story brother brethren says we had prayed and prayed my wife and i and family and that tumor seeming like seemingly like wouldn't go anywhere so you realize brother branham wasn't he didn't come to this place of adoptionist place of maturity and he'd go around and nothing will stop me and i won't have any of this you got no tumor he come to a place of maturity where he knew how to handle himself in the word even in trials and difficulties and unanswered prayers this adoption isn't i'll speak the word nothing will ever happen nothing will stand are you kidding me jesus didn't live like that when they mocked him he just turned and went away when they were going to throw stoned he slipped through the crowd quietly he didn't call down fire from heaven and he he knew he was learning he knew how to act in maturity with the word brother branham comes he's had this experience in colorado he's had the sunset mountain experience he's had the opening of the seals he he spoke squirrels into existence and his wife has a tumor and they've prayed and prayed and it won't move pray don't get the wrong idea of adoption friends it's maturity it's place where god can put confidence in you you're going to stick with the word no matter what comes they prayed and nothing moved and it kept getting bigger and brother ben is worried and he's saying well they're going to have to have a surgery i don't want her to suffer but if they have the surgery now we can't make it back here for christmas they understand he he didn't come to this super revelated position where he always knew what was going to happen in every circumstance and had to answer for everything and could just speak whatever he wanted he was walking in humility and submission and god had a vessel so surrendered when god said speak he'll speak and if god didn't tell him to speak he wasn't going to speak come to this position and we didn't know what to do and he goes i was in the home and i was awful lonesome been there a couple of days and no one was there he he had just been returned back to an eden condition in colorado and now he doesn't know what to do about his wife's tumor and he's so lonesome and worried about his wife he kneels down to pray like he's prayed before you realize this wasn't a three-day fast this wasn't a super-duper something meeting council it was just he knelt down to pray like he had prayed for his wife before but this time god said stand on your feet he stood up on his feet he says whatever you say is what it'll be he said before the doctors touch her what did he have he had the power of the spoken word but he didn't have it in arrogancy and pride and self-assertion and his self-will he had it under absolute god had absolute preeminence over this vessel when god told him to speak speak when god told him to speak it was the same as god speaking we've come to the age of adoption but don't make it anything different than what brother bradham showed us the character the humility the reverence the respect the worship not having answers not knowing i think sometimes we think of where the bride we've come to adoption we come all the way we should have the answer for everything brother braham didn't have the answer for everything and we we try to figure out everything god's doing he didn't answer it but he didn't answer this prayer because of this reason and because when this moves then this will happen that's just spiritual pressure trying to explain everything instead of just walking as a mature son that says if he didn't tell me i don't know why didn't he answer your prayer i don't know but i trust him anyways we prayed for that wait a minute i don't know but i'm not backing down on the word by his stripes i'm healed we've come to adoption it's been proven it's been shown it's without question but that's just where now he can have confidence in this bride to carry this word and she has the word and the mind of christ will know what to do with the word she's not going to go with her own mind with her own way trying to prove something trying to make something happen trying to work something up she's just going to walk with absolute confidence that god is here he needed a vessel i'm the vessel it does i don't have to prove that to anybody you want proofread the adoption age point to sunset mountain point to colorado you don't have to prove anything god's already proved it we don't have to prove who we are we don't want to prove anything god called us god brought us into his kingdom god has showed us where we're at in time it's already done all we have to do is just surrender to it have confidence in god and not keep backing down on our confession and when god's ready he'll say stand on your feet whatever you say oh friends when god nudges you like that whatever you say it's the same as deity speaking don't question where we are it's already been shown it's already been broadcast this bride's come to adoption individually we're coming to our position in placing but god's got a bride on the earth that he can speak through he's walking in his garden right now let's all stand musicians if you come how many like me would say i want to be a clearer voice for him i want to be a clear voice for him i want to be whatever john the baptist was when he came walking out of the wilderness and he was the word made flesh that's what i want to be i want to be whatever god saw before for me that's all i want i don't want anything else i don't want my own idea i don't want my own i don't want anything i don't want to prove anything i don't want to show anything to anybody i only want to do what he wants me to do is there power released to the bride without question is every promise available without question can she do the greater works without question i hope you don't question that without question but i want it to be him doing it i want it to be him and me i want it to be so perfect and so pure and so without flaw because it doesn't have any of my human instrumentality but it just has god i want to be confident where i'm at and not questioning i want to be confident in what he's told me and not questioning i want to say god i believe you i believe you when those seven angels were there testifying that it's the full measure of all seven churches i believe you i believe you that this is the full word i believe you i believe that this was your messenger i believe you and i believe when you said i'll no longer call you church i'll call you bride i believe you and now i'm going to be your bride and whatever you want me to be is exactly what i'll be amen let's sing brother ben i give my mind [Music] completely to you [Music] fill me with your thoughts make it all brand
