========================================

this living word of bread of life the lord jesus christ the word of the hour when you get a hold of it amen it begins to change you amen it begins to affect you it begins to change the way you walk and afflictions come amen but that's not the time to turn loose of what you gotta hold up amen because that's the only thing that can save you jacob got a hold of it amen couldn't turn it loose even after being crippled couldn't turn it loose the angel is now saying let me go what if god looked at you and says leave me alone that's what jesus said to the woman who had a child grievously vexed with the demon he said leave me alone he called her a dog and said the children's better not for dogs amen she wasn't contesting that she didn't care if she was a dog or whatever he had to be called she just knew this is the man that can change the situation and nobody else can if he calls me a dog if he tells me to go away if the disciples make fun of me it doesn't change anything because that's the only source i have to go to she says she says oh son of david she called him by the wrong name she had no rights to him the son of david have mercy upon me and he just ignored her she cries out again and he says it's not right to give the children's bread unto dogs most of the people in this world if they come in contact with the living god and god says something like that to them they just put their head down and walk away god is not looking for those kind of people that is not what god's searching for god's searching for the one he can afflict and they won't let go he's searching for the ones he can shake and they won't turn loose he's searching for the ones he can call a dog and they won't leave he's searching for the ones that he can say leave me alone it's coming the break of the day and he's looking for the ones that'll say i will not let you go because he's looking for the other part of himself he's not looking for people to make a church he's looking for the rest of himself he's looking for the counterpart the one that recognizes the one that holds on the one that endures to the end the one that knows this is the only hope that i have i have no other hope i will not turn loose i don't care if you slay me yet will i serve
