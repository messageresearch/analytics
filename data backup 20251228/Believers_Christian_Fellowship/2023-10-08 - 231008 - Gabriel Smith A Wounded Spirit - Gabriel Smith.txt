wounded Spirit who can bear it I like to speak to you this morning by the help of the Lord on a wounded Spirit let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father truly thankful to be able to gather Lord around your word this morning and Believers of like Precious faith and Lord we want to surrender to you and ask Lord that you would have your way in this service Lord uh just a mere man and sinful in nature and struggling through through this life same as my brothers and sisters and Lord we want to confess our faults before you and ask Lord that your blood be our sufficiency this morning we surrender to you we yield to you Lord asking that you would have full sway in this service thankful Lord for the unction that you've given us by the Holy Spirit of promise and the clearing and the Deliverance that it brings in our lives and so we look to you this morning and ask Lord that your word would go forth the way it's intended I Surrender myself to you Lord is the only way I know how Lord I ask that you would help me to say only what you once said this morning we commit all that we are into your hands we love you and we praise you and we ask these Saint to be soow in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can be seated if you like and just uh want to um send uh greetings to you this morning from Brother Chad and we just talking sent text back and forth one another and so he wanted to make sure that I greeted you and so uh and wanted to make sure I did that uh and appreciates our pastor thankful for brother Chad and and we appreciate the uh coming back from the retreat is that awesome you know I I uh I uh what my is everybody okay this morning everybody happy to come back from The Retreat there now listen now just because we're back home now I y'all was getting loud back at the retreat now y'all he so don't just come in here and everybody get all quiet Brother G we got a suit on this morning well we need to loosen that tie a little bit and right and so uh I just just uh I got a little something on my heart you know I I wondered about what what to bring it as far as a it's really kind of like a part two it's a it's a part two when I preached a couple weeks ago on uh on the works of God and then then uh kind of a part two for uh the young people when uh we uh we we preached the 5 to 12 years old on the on before and after and then it's kind of a part two for the for the Youth service when we preached on uh uh oh well we we we did uh here we go we did before and after with the 5 to 12 year olds there and and oh my look at that guy woo have mercy and uh you know God can do some amazing Transformations can he man Hallelujah and uh see that he he can there's some bad ones too there before marriage and after after marriage man now that's not just that's mine that was back it was mine back in the day and you know what then sometimes we we got the before and after Westwood Barbers there [Laughter] and amen so we had a good time at the 5 to 12 years olds you know that and uh but but my point of it all was we had a before Retreat and then what are we going to be after Retreat I hope we all come back a little bit different you know a little bit closer to the Lord a little bit less of the world and a little bit less uh of our struggles and complexes and and you know speaking of complexes when we we uh spoke to the young people it was on the human grab bag and you know brother BR talked about the human grab bag is when he went to the doctor and had a stomach condition and you know he didn't really understand what was going on and that that um that that doctor told him well that's just out of the human grab bag you'd always have it and unfortunately that human grab bag gets passed around to all of us right we all get different things different struggles we wonder why in the world did I have to have this and uh you know and uh trying to bring to the young people uh something about the Lord Jesus because you know when you when you think about the Lord and all that he was you know when when he could you know he had first dibbin to pick whatever he wanted out of that human bag but the Bible says that uh there was no comeliness there was no form and there was no beauty that we should desire him that when when he uh walked the the the streets of Galilee and and Jerusalem that when you looked at him he he wasn't a big seven-footer and shoulders like barn doors and but there was no beauty that we could desire him he he didn't look like a preacher he didn't look like the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and you you think about the the character of God that whenever he would uh think about reaching into the grab bag that that he he would purposely say no I don't want no Splendor yeah amen no Majesty right uh in in matter of fact the Bible says that he would take upon himself the form of a servant when he would be found in fashion in the likeness of men that uh God in his great Majesty he would he would he would humble himself in such a way that that he wouldn't stack the deck in his favor right but but I I I wonder if if we this morning had that same opportunity how how would we stack the deck oh my I I you know I don't know about about you but but I'd be stacking the deck right right think about it I I mean you I would have shoulders like barn doors and you know I mean uh I I I i' had them this right right but but but the Lord he he he didn't he didn't he didn't choose that for himself when he when he very well could have been but but he wanted to feel every shortcoming and adequacy that that we H so that he could be the right kind of a mediator and and it lets us know that that that that whenever we have those type of shortcomings in our lives that that when we do have uh pulled something out of that human grab B and man I wish I could get another chanceen well well he's done walk that road too he knows all about it he he he knows what it feels like to to to suffer through life and to struggle through life and and so so thinking about those things I I I I just something you know I don't know to me this message means so much because when you when you look at it when we talk about Seven Seals and seven Thunders and and all those things those are those are great things but but to me just the the the the the understanding is one thing but I need to be able to apply it in my everyday life right understanding that you know brother Brandon part of his ministry was at seven seal and that that's wonderful and that's powerful to see him fulfill his portion but what about me where am I at in the economy of God and and if I am in that portion of being the elect of God then why do I feel the way that I feel why do I act the way that do I act sometimes why do I do the things that I do and and this message in this gospel gives me a great understanding of why I do the things that I do why did I act the way that I act sir and and and so the Bible tells us that that you know when God made the spirit of man that that it was you know man is built in such a way that that even in himself even without God he has a he has a great ability to sustain himself matter of fact if if if brother B tells us that that if if if you got just the right kind of an attitude you can almost retire a disease and and that's just in that second realm that if we can just have in our own spirit yeah have have the right kind of approach it'll cause a great change in our Liv but the but the problem of it is is sometimes we get wounded in our spirit and and this morning you know we we we can we can pick out the Sunday Best and make sure the tie matches the shirt and make sure the jacket matches the pants and hold this tie up and the children go now d right but but I wonder if we could all have eyesight to look a little deeper sir how many wounds in our spirit would we truly see you know uh we we we like to talk about how strong we are but you know even the Lord Jesus died of a broken heart amen is that right amen the prophet of God teaches us that and and told us that that that the Lord he had died of a broken heart with such grief of this world until a chemical reaction taking place in his body that could not take place in you you cannot suffer like that there's no way for you to have that kind of a grief but the Lord of lords and the King of Kings had the ability that he could pack that kind of grief so that he could suffer under the weight of sin so that we wouldn't have to suffer if we could somehow just tap into that on our everyday lives sometimes we lose sight of that sometimes life gets heavy sometimes life comes at us in such a way that we didn't expect it and you know sometimes we carry things for things sometimes we carry things for a whole lot longer than we really should that's right amen the the Bible tells us that that it says oh in Jeremiah 4:14 oh Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall vain thoughts Lodge within thee amen and and when we think about this you know and brother brandham taught us the the that we are a Triune being and and that wasn't something new that he had he come up with the Bible plainly declares it and and matter of fact when when he when he talks about saying in that Spirit realm of of conscience memory reason imagination infection uh that that's something I I would uh presume that he got from Clarence Lin uh because Clarence Lin uh he was alive back in the 1800s and if you look at some of his writings and some of his teachings he had already had those things pinned out and but if you study the message brother brandham he'll use different uh terminologies such as conscience and Love and Desire and so forth and so but the point of it is is in that Spirit realm is our as the Bible tells us the seat of emotion and and a lot of times in life th those that realm is a realm that's not seen but it's a realm that affects us on a day-to-day basis on an hour hour basis on a minute to Minute by basis and a lot of times something that happened 20 30 40 50 years ago affects us yet this morning because we let those things large we let those things take residence come on friends that's right and and you know that's what I love about about this message because it helps me understand my Humanity it it helps me realize why I tick the way that I tick and and why I am the way that I am this message gives me a peace because when I feel a certain way you you you may feel that way but the word says right you you you you you you you may you may you may and and and sometimes we realize that it's all together lying vanities and it gives us a strength that we can deny those things and say no the but but God's word says I'm delivered no matter what my reasoning says God says I'm delivered I'm not acting those things out that's just in my spirit realm that's just my memory coming back to me that's just my imagination that's affecting me but God has changed me deeper than that and it gives me a faith to push that thing [Applause] aside when my imagination takes hold there ought to be something anchored deeper that takes even a stronger Hold That cast that thing down that's the whole point of a Christian friends that's what gives us the ability to push those things aside that this book just becomes more than a book but it becomes a reality in my life you know our our minds are so powerful and our Spirits are so strong that only the holy spirit is able to tame it yes sir am and you have to be willing to surrender that you have to be willing to allow the Holy Spirit to tame that thing you know brother brandham teaches us this he tells us he says he says you see you you you can say you see that there and you just keep saying yes I believe it and I believe it so much till actually you think you see it when you don't see that's right but that's psychology it's just got you so mentally pressed towards it till you just imagine it so imagine it so much till it becomes reality Lord you can just imagine now now I I want to stop there because and and I'm not preaching so much on somebody imagining are you imagining somebody hates you that's not what I want you to focus on but my point is our mind is so strong that we can imagine things that aren't real but they become reality in our mind yeah right amen it's not just the fact that that person don't what what they looked at me wrong or or or they didn't shake my hand and they shook amen right you know and and we would think well we should be farther along down the road than that brother gay but but that's not true because we're still in this house of Flesh and and we are still no matter if we're 49 59 69 79 sometimes we're still that little 12y old boy or that 13y old girl that got picked on and because we we suffered such abuse or trauma at an early age it still plays a role and a part in our life you know you know the thing of it is trauma is something that's that's that's that's that that that's so uh overwhelming in our lives that that that only the Holy Spirit can help us and it's something that we have to be mindful of on a day-to-day basis amen because listen there's so many people here this morning not everyone of us lived under the shelter the umbrella of the revealed word of God and had a holy ghost filled mom and dad that watched over them every day of their lives and never let them you know go uh uh do sleepovers or never let them do this or never let them do that and they've always been watched over and you know never heard a raised voice and but some of us grew up in the well amen the other side of it and and so and so some of us got some scars that we deal with some of us got some trauma in our lives amen and those things those things still affect us sometimes on a day-to-day basis see cuz we get wounded in our spirit and those things take sometimes decades to heal right you know and you know what sometimes we can talk we can we can talk about Seven Seals and Prophets of God and denominations this and Antichrist that and but you know what that trauma is still right there that's right see that's but if you think about it that shows the beauty of God that in the midst of all of these deep Revelations God would anoint a prophet to to to to Branch off in certain areas to help us deal with those traumas in our life right to give us to give us Insight on how to handle those things because because and and I hope I hope you understand we can we can say seventh seal Redemption and and you know and and the plan of God and and and and and it's my Redemption I'm redeemed and all these different things but what about my spirit praise God what about this wound that I have you understand what I'm saying and I understand Redemption happens and and and and and and to see that God can step in and and transform us and change just but I don't know about you friends I know what God has done in my life and I know that I'm not what I used to be and I know that I'm not what I ought to be but thank the Lord I'm not what I was back then and all those things are true and those things are real but there's still trauma that raises up there's still wounds in our lives and I think Lord how am I going to go on am I the only one no am I the only one listen even in message homes sometimes as much as we as Parents try to shelter our children and protect them there's look even God himself couldn't totally protect his children in a garden called Eden how are we going to do it in Satan's Eden and so there has to be that ability friends where we well we can't smother our children in such a way but what we have to do is we have to understand where they're at and time and we have to allow them to be what they are sir and allow them to grow the way that they that God wants them to grow I don't know about you but I don't want to hinder my children as much as I want them to go a certain direction I don't want to put my hands on the wheel because God may have a different plan for their lives and we all have to be mindful of that our children do not come to this world Born Again amen right even though we've had family devotions even though we've had Sunday schools we've had youth meeting after youth meeting we've had all these different things there's still a portion of them friends they got to have their own birth and if they ain't had their own birth and you've got to give them space for Grace you have to allow them a space to repent and you have to intercede for them knowing that they are not held to your accountability because they don't have what you have right and so there has to be an ability within us to stand back and go God Lord please don't let me hinder them am let me be a help let me just be a blessing because a lot of times we get in way and we we think well you can't be doing that how's that going to oh it's time for me to take the jacket off in the tie and man I'm have to go find the khakis and the polo and man we F to have Retreat praise the Lord I don't know friend I you know I was so nervous today uh yeah I would woke up and I you know no matter how hard I try to put this thing together you know I love to teach and the Powerpoints and lay these things out and when I get up here it just goes [Music] up you know you try to pull it back in you try to reel it back in and you so I I hope I hope yall just labor with me and I trust that the something be said this morning that would be able to be a help to you because because we live in in Satan's Eden and it's the greatest battle that was ever fought and the greatest battle that's ever raging is not so much between you know Russia and America but right now it's right here this is where we battle this is where we struggle this is where we have this great fight that goes on in our minds and and a lot of times we we we we imagining things listen little children you you you as little ones don't just think this is for brother for the for Mom and Dad you little ones can imagine things in your mind you little ones can have have a a a uh maybe somebody on the playground or somebody maybe a cousin or whatever and say something about you and make fun of you and that thing can Lodge within your spirit that vain thought can rest there and you start imagining it you start thinking about it and if you ain't careful little one that thing will will start building and ruining you in in a way that that that clogs up the channels of God yeah amen listen the Bible says you're fearfully and wonderfully made but a lot of times we listen to to our our our friends and our Companions and and then you know when we get around the young ones and we get around our friends well well these are the cool kids and these the ones that's popular and I'm not popular and I'm trying to be popular I want to be popular right oh I remember that listen you know I I I I don't know if I said this before but I remember one back in the days you know I was the little fat kid that got picked on and uh and uh uh man I hated it they they they they used to make fun of me so hard I had these two men uh two boys his name was uh Larry something Larry and and Chuck oh man they they just rode me day in and day out they they made fun they called me the certain name I I told my children I ain't going to tell you I'm 49 years old and I still it makes me tremble to sh to even say it you know anybody ever had that in life like no brother Gabe I'm bride of Jesus [Laughter] Christ well pray for me then since you so strong but since you so much bride and don't have no problems and but here I am 49 years old I still can't even say that name they made fun of me you know and they would just ride me and ride me and ride day in and day out I was in seventh grade and then we moved and we went and I and so I moved to another another another another place in in uh in my town and uh and so I went to another school got a fresh start oh man well I got in trouble again and there was this one boy named Mark Mark sever man he me and him got into it and he said oh yeah he said let's fight Friday night rain tree Plaza oh my the challenge was on brother Derek and you know what I accepted that challenge I was tired of it and uh so here I am seventh grade and this is back in the day we didn't have video games we actually had to go to a room we had to go to a the arcade right so we go to this rain tree Plaza and everybody go to the arcade on Friday nights right so here I am seventh grade at the arcade and all of a sudden uh oh Mark shows up oh man well we we we go out we we go we go uh uh we I don't know how we got there but we go behind rain tree Plaza in this Factory parking lot we get in the fight oh man sister Joyce I put it on him I put it on him sister I did I don't know how I think I was just fighting for my life you know but boy I put it on him and you know instantly instantly now I had Street cring oh yeah I think my voice got deeper after I got done beating him up had little gravel at seventh grade you know but anyway so so I I I I we got in the fight I got I beat him up beat him real good and I I don't recommend that for children now please understand now little ones I was was not saved not serving the lord but anyways you know sometimes I wish sometimes I wish I would have got beaten up because I think man maybe my life a little bit different you know but anyways so what what I'm showing you is as I understand what it's like to go under that when you're constantly getting picked on and beat up and picked on and maybe you understand it it affects you it hurts you but you know what when I come back to school Monday morning boom I went from a from a zero to a hero right instant instantly I was one of the popular kids instantly but the problem of it is now I had to keep up the Persona see now I had to keep up the Persona and now I had to be something that I really wasn't and that started me on the wrong road yeah that's what I say I wish I wish man I think man maybe I maybe I still could have met my wife somehow through it all and i' have been a nerdy kid hello Susan we go out with me [Laughter] please you know it didn't happen that way little bow tie on what's going on with me please but but you know things happen the way that they do and we don't really understand why those things happen the way that they do but listen children the the the point of the matter is is when we go through life sometimes bad things happen to us but you you got to be careful that in the midst of all of that that you choose the right road because there's always these things set before us there's two different paths and there's no matter look you may have been baptized at 10 12 13 years old but listen remember every day of your life is a choice that same Choice is still set before you and you have to choose the right you say I've been born I don't doubt that a bit but listen sometimes we have to make the wrong choices and if we ain't careful that that wrong choice or that situation that happens a wound can come in in our imagination in our memory in our reasoning in our affection right right because that's the Battleground friends that's what we all deal with and and and and here's the thing those things happen to us and and nobody nobody knows the wounds that we carry and a lot of times because we are bride well we can't we have that same Persona just like just like here I was still look from Friday night to Monday morning I was still that same little short fat kid that got picked on even though my status changed nothing changed on the inside I still had those same insecurities I still had them same shortcomings and a lot of times we have that same thing happen to us is when we when we become when we when we're coming to the church and we're tore up and we're we're we're we're busted and broken but something happens to us and we get changed and everybody goes wow look at them they're real Christians and then we have this oh then we have the Persona God calls us into the ministry and oh but you know what listen listen that short little fat kid still in there it y'all know what I'm talking about friends and because we're message and we have this standard that we all are striving for but many times in our life we can't meet what we're striving for but because of our persona come on Friends y'all wasn't this tight at The Retreat look look you what what what what has changed from Retreat till now just a building but because of where we're at y'all has been tight y'all been tight the whole time where was y'all loose and happy and what what do we need to go home get some get some khakis and get some jeans and give brother Brian a t-shirt I mean my goodness said give him a t-shirt say huh come on Friends y'all know what I'm talking about what but what happened is it's because of where we're at but nothing we still have that same Spirit on the inside of us am that was at retreat but because of the Persona amise the Lord come on friends but the wounds is still there what we got to do is get get out of uh this this realm and this thinking and and this mold that we have this Persona being some tough guy we ain't tough ain't a one of us tough without the Holy Spirit ain't no one of Satan will chew us up and spit us out if it wasn't for the grace of God this morning every one of us would been on a drunk or or some kind of perversion or filth but it was the grace of God that kept your mind this weekend it was the grace of God that kept you off of that internet it was the grace of God that got you off of Facebook it wasn't your ability it was the grace of God that gave you that overcoming ability and it's the grace of God that's going to keep [Music] you is this okay I I we just got listen for I just want to I want I want so much I want to be real I want to make Heaven friends I I just I I just want to see the King of Kings and the glory of Lords one day I just want I just want you know brother B says uh you know we spend 10,000 years of peace I'm going be in that line I'm going be in that line but I got another line to wait in first yes sir and at the end of it when it's all said and done and everybody's all gone and Jesus is still sing just me and him and nobody around everybody oh my oh my to me that's what it's all about because he's done something for me yes he's done something he's changed me in such a way that I couldn't change myself he made me a new creation in Christ Jesus and he's helping me to deal with this old Spirit realm that raises up all the time my conscience my memory my reasoning yeah listen friend I'm a mess I'll be honest with you I'm a mess my imagination catches a ho sometimes and it just oh my my affection have mercy but there's something on the inside God gave me a faith amen God gave me an anchor deep down on the inside that when those things begin to rage and roll there's something that that gives me a peace cuz whenever that thing comes up it just something oh I don't need a iPad I don't need a Macbook I don't need a iPhone I ain't got to search nothing out there's just something on inside starts ringing it'll be a little scripture there that little ring in your heart and you go oh yes Lord that's exactly right yes that's exactly right see that's what it's all about to me friends I I I many times many times you know there's this there's this young girl brother brandom talked about she was she was like young 10 12 I don't know 13 years old and she had a murmuring in her heart and she said in that prayer line and had and and she had received her healing what was later on in life she had another heart problem she got with the wrong boy and brother bham tells us that that that boy left her married another but she still had that affection towards this boy she still had this imagination rolling the reasoning oh I know he's I know Johnny still loves me that affection was taken in that Spirit realm and she had got and so worked up in her mind brother Brenham says that she created a world and lived in it all by herself all by herself Johnny loves me I know he does he loves me someday he'll come back to me I know he will and so that tells us and shows us friends that there's and listen this ain't just for the little ones this ain't just for the teenagers I wonder I wonder how many of us create a world in this message because we take so much criticism following a man man follower you worship you know you understand what I'm saying you know all these different things going on and brother brandom said and you know he did this and he did that and we live we get bombarded by that from so many angles that if we ain't careful we will create a world we will create a bubble and it won't be the Holy Spirit bubble that we need it'll be our walls of security and safety yeah sir right be because it's easy for listen it's it is not hard to have your heart crushed by a Lov one by a person that's that that still sits in the congregation with you and then after you get crushed and your heart's in pieces and then he hey brother how you and you go hey brother how you doing hallu come on friends come on and you know what happens is we create a world and you know what happens oh we'll be nice we'll be nice but really we just have our Inner Circle yeah it's just our Inner Circle and you know what we love a big church cuz we can blend in give me a big church I don't want a little church I just want a H in and I want to hop out cuz then I can have my own little world I know this is I know this is hitting home friends but listen it's true yeah it's true friends because nobody wants to get hurt because we still may be that little 10-year-old girl that got picked on and now the sisters they listen you you know I just my my my children you look at all three of them especially especially sisters they're very self-conscious you know got to have the long hair then you like a Vidal Sassoon oh hello hello but you know brother Bram said you can let that get to you brother Bram said first thing you know get a little stuck up feeling about yourself yeah right oh come on now you Brothers ain't got no sh short hair y'all know what I'm talking about you Brothers keep quiet sisters amen come on I'm let me squeak it amen out of you thank you thank you brother Brian's like Amen brother you you got short hair like me brother you don't know what I'm talking about but now listen cuz all three of my children ain't a one of them ain't a one of them ever cut their hair well kind of one of them got some gum in at one time and and she was worried that dad was going to you know excommunicate her from the congregation and and so she cut it out but that was just a little piece you know I won't tell you who it is but it's not her birthday and she's the oldest and then uh and then uh Mina I can't remember what she did she had some scissors in her hand she cut a little something off you know whatever and I'm not Mak a lie to that but my point is ain't no one of them ever cut anything off nor has my wife but if you look at all of them my wife's hair had her shoulders and so as a sore spot in the spirit realm oh yeah oh she's had some preachers just look at her and just boy on see on the seat of the scornful right but in that Spirit realm in that reasoning in that imagination in that affection look all three of them Naomi Mina she she she's the middle one her hair down down to her knees right look at Anna she should have some Anna is right right in the middle of her back and so in my home I know I know what the sisters go through and a lot of times when we're in the congregation in the church is We compare ourselves by ourselves and that is so unwise friends because what it's because of our Persona it may not be how tough we are but it's look how [Music] long my glory right come on sis y'all know what I'm talking about right it happens see but but then we fail to [Laughter] realize but then we fail to realize the pain that goes with those things and if we ain't careful we'll we'll look in that Spirit realm we can let those things Lodge within us you may say brother Gabe listen those things that that little girl she was a little girl and you know that that but that don't affect me okay well hold on cuz I got one for you how many's ever read the story or heard brother Bram do his private interview on sister Bruce oh my if if uh if you have never heard of it uh or if you ain't listened to it for a long time you need to listen to it again amen cuz I was struggling this morning and I listen to it and oh it blessed me so much now if you think about this in the big picture in the big picture brother brandom's getting ready to preach masterpiece now think about the setting and think about how mindful God is yeah because this is this interview is actually conducted when brother bram's getting ready to preach Masterpiece he's he's getting ready to talk about how there's going to be another Masterpiece in this last day right and here he is interviewing a church amen amen amen and and it's so powerful because in the middle of that interview they're singing about the blood I think it's there's power in the blood and and and then after they get done singing that the congregation gets quiet and then brother bam starts whispering and I'm thinking oh that's so beautiful just loved it but the thing of the but but what I want you to want to catch on this is that that of all of the thousands of interviews that prophet of God did there's only one recorded that we know of yeah only one amen and it's right before he preaches Masterpiece amen praise the Lord the little ding that made it the Masterpiece right and and as he's preaching getting ready to preach that there's a sister Bruce and she's in a in a having a private interview and during that private interview what is she worried about I've never had experience with the Holy Spirit and as she's pouring out her heart she's trembling you can oh you feel so sorry for her and brother Brandon just so gentle and sweet and and he says some of the most beautiful things to her he says sister he says listen you're a makeup and I'm paraphrasing but you can hear it he goes you're a makeup and and you get somebody on your heart that you that you want to pray for and you just can't get it off your heart he says you're just that kind of a way nervous type of person and he goes and he goes and he goes sister he goes listen you are a real Christian and she's yeah but brother brother and she sitting there you know you know brother B but I make so many mistakes and he goes sister I've I've seen your life under Vision oh wouldn't you love to have the prophet of God tell you that yes sir and afterward she still arguing yeah but I that's the same way we do go God will preach a message one day and you oh hallelujah oh right you's got to preach another one oh right and he says he says sister I've seen your life under vision and if there's anything against you God has hid it from me so so when we think about Des what I'm what I want you to understand is this is an elect lady amen amen right as an example for us when we're in the greatest battle that's ever fought God has a recording for us to go back to and listen when we go through those struggles God I made a mistake I did this I did that I don't but but did you search out your life did you make that thing well yes I made that right okay then the blood of Jesus yeah but no no no no no no no yeah on Amen if you confessed and you repented you went back you made it right listen you don't have to do no obedience yeah right amen that is your spirit realm telling you to do them obedience yeah that's right you know you know I used to work with a man a Salesman he was a Catholic you know what he told me one day he said he said he said gab he said you know Catholicism is mainly guilt amen and when he said that it's always stuck with me cuz I thought man how why would you want to be a c Catholic anyways right why would you want to serve a God that's mainly guilt on now and and if we would if we would be honest with ourselves a lot of times we struggle with them same things like we got to do some kind of penance to make it right but if you would be honest with yourself that's just your nature and this message came for you to look at your nature and separate it and go no that does me no good God sees no glory in you doing a be you that's right he sees no glory in you taking a cat of nine tails and thrashing your back and walking up and down stairs on your knees and all that God don't look at that go that's my boy right no friends but a lot of times we do that in our spirit realm we we beat our own selves up and there is no reason for it when you meet God's requirements you have to rest in that fact that God requires nothing else when you repent and you go make that right to that person you're like brother I'm so sorry I made a mistake man I I did I messed up and he that's okay brother it's all right no problem and then you walk away and you're like man I probably should have said a little bit differently I should have no that's when you got to realize wait a minute that's my conscience that's my real that's me that's look how many times do you go you tell your children you go you know how I am oh none of you wow but you know more more is like I didn't talk to brother Chad brother Chad I know you going to be way but why don't you just let all of them I stand here I sit here and they can stand up and they can all have five minutes they preach to me man I [Laughter] just but but when but when we go go through life friends we have to be mindful of our weaknesses and whatever that is then you have to be mindful that that is just you and then set it aside because no matter look we that is just out of the human grab bag and there's a portion of and listen though though sister Bruce had that that that maybe that insecurities and she worried and stressed but God allowed that to happen why because she could inter for somebody and really intercede cuz she didn't do it half-heartedly she put everything into it and God used that Frailty in that weakness because he wanted a prayer Warrior right amen prise God and so if we would really look at our weaknesses and go no when I because the Bible says when I am weak he is oh thank you sister Karen he is strong that's exactly right yes in my weaknesses his strength is made perfect yes that's exactly right but a lot of times we don't look into the mirror of God's word we look into and in our mind we start working things up yeah and we see things that's not reality yes sir that's right and then what happens what then we then we pull off and we start to isolate ourselves because of our insecurities because of our listen friends every one of us look in that mirror and see something that's exaggerated right we all somehow look and we see something that we don't like and whatever we don't like about ourselves it's this great big right right but in reality really is it no because everyone every one of us is dealing with the same insecurities whether it be different ways we all got shortcomings and we all have things we struggle with and what we have to do is not look at that mirror but we have to look at the mirror of God's word that mirror is that is that not what the Bible tells us it is a mirror and when we look at I I I was you know I was witnessing to a man at work Friday and uh and uh and he was like yeah he's like you know and man he was just eating it up we like 45 minutes I'm thinking man I need to get back to work I'm thinking oh goodness I felt bad afterwards cuz we talked so long but he just he had me captive you know and and so I thought Lord I don't know should I work an hour over to make this up I but uh but but but but he but he asked me said what what what's what version is right I said I told him what the prophet said I said what the King James the most tried and true he said yeah I said but how do you know I said I tell you how I know I said cuz when I look in here and I say and I see David and I look at his life I say that's me right am when I look at the thief on the cross I don't I don't I don't I don't need to see any Greek Hebrew I don't need to see any I don't need to read the emphatic diaglot to make sure that matches up and I don't need to get a copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls because when I see that thief on the cross I go and that's me and and and you know I know brother brandom said that about the about the little boy that seen in the mirror and he says mama that's me but whenever I hear that story I look at that and I go well that's me amen right and and it becomes more than just what brother Brenham said a quote in the very depths of my heart I can't explain it but when I see God's word open I look at it and I go well that's me when when I when I when I see these stories and these Parables and I see these scriptures come to life in my life I go that's me that that's how I know this book is true that's listen people people can be critical with brother brandom and you know and talk about he did this he did this wrong he did that wrong and this and then and then you know you you got brothers that want to defend him in all these different things and to me listen I don't need to defend [Music] nothing I I if somebody wants to be critical let them be critical I pray for them and say you know what but hey it's the grace of God that I see what I see listen God sent brother brandham to me and and brother brandham is my Prophet Jesus Christ is my God God sent William brandom to me and and if God didn't send William brandham to anybody else I can't help that the only thing I can say is that God sent that prophet to me he did behold I send you Elijah now people may say no that didn't say William Bram yes it did that's right you show me another man that that that meets the Elijah description I I ain't found one that his life so perfect L I don't know how to explain it friends all I know is it's a reality in my life and as I feed upon this word my life has changed and he changes me in such a way that I can't get past it and I if I would you know I I don't even understand how people can walk in this message and then deny it and then look at the Bible and then what do you do with Ruth right I mean what what do you what do you what do you do with Elijah I mean where do you where do you put him at I mean do you just leave him aside and don't talk about him I mean I mean how much of the Bible do you have to put aside when you walk away from the message and where where where do you how do you type and I mean you know you understand I'm saying I mean how do you read the Bible and then just leave all the principles that that that I mean I understand that eyes are blinded in things but you understand what I'm saying when I look at the Bible I think how in the world there's no way that one man can can take this Bible and lay out principles that go from Genesis to Revelation and that are unfailing you you take what brother brandham said about John when when when John brother B said John was a reflection of that Eagle right when you take I I I've done a study on this and uh and uh and I don't know I I I shared it one time with the with the young people at at Sunday school but you take the Book of John yes sir and you you you you pull out all of the Gospel stories that only speak of John yeah until you look at brother you know but when John when John was walking with Jesus he sees the very first miracle ever done water turned into wine do you you know no other disciple wrote about that but John being the eagle when he saw that that captivated him because we as Eagles see this water made wine amen and he would catch the first miracle yeah I mean when you look when you you know when he talk about the woman at the well do you know John was the only one that writes about her but he would have to yeah because who was that a reflection of the Bride of Jesus Christ and so John would be the one that catched those things and so when you read the book of John and you see everything that he pulled whereas Matthew Mark and Luke was right beside him when it unfolded and Matthew is you know Luke you know he's looking at the book but John's like wow but it's because of his anointing that he would be able to pick those things up and catch those things now and and it's a beautiful study uh uh when you look at it if you ever get time it's really easy to do but just just grab every story that only John speaks of and when you do it is an absolute Picture Perfect reflection of this last day amen praise God Amen now by God's grace you could see that with one book you get critical brother brand did all this and birthday here I don't know all these different things whatever but how what do you do with that where do you where do you make that fit and go well it was a coincidence okay well what about the other 65 books that go with it I mean you understand what I'm saying and so when people do these things things you know what it is friends it's the grace of God because to me the Bible it is so plain amen but we should never ever ever take it for granted because for what we see it's God's mercy that he anointed our eyes with an eyes have that we could have eagle eyes that when it's the darkest and the blackest we could actually see light when when when it when it when it's gross darkness and there's no love we can't help but to put our arm around somebody and say I love you buddy I love you there just a joy and a warmth listen I I you know ain't it so beautiful to love your enemies yes sir you know you know you know man can't do that but but whenever you can look at somebody that would disagree with you bitterly you can still have a you you still have a oh brother you just you want to you want to hug their neck and be like listen I've been there I know what that bitterness does I know what that anger does I know what that is God bring Deliverance you know why cuz you don't matter no more amen right and that's the beauty of it because the only person that matters is Jesus Christ he's the only one that's important nobody matters but him oh my that's right Hallelujah you my 12:15 1030 don't make fun of me I I don't got I I can't count I just hold on you all my hour and 12 15 minutes my goodness I'm so sorry we we didn't uh we didn't we didn't get too far but um and I don't I well no you know Hey listen listen and I I appreciate that but you know what sometimes especially preachers they can go we can go for hours I I get so worried I get so stressed out you know I got aund LS you know and 15 of them was Mina you know you know understand what I'm saying and then you just but but there's this message is so inexhaustible but listen I'm I'm preaching to people that can be exhausted and so and so uh uh we the uh the main thing of it is friends I just to me when when I want you just to I want you to to be honest with yourself when it's all said and done listen if you got something in your heart that's wounded you there's some bombing [Music] Gilead listen listen little ones sisters wherever you at look you you may look sister you you may have hair down to your knees but it may be something else that's hindering you and and you've built a wall well listen today by Grace recognize that wall and go God I I don't want this anymore that's that's what my heart is to you today and it may have been broken and I I I don't I don't mean to discredit you know the the depth of God's word and the inexhaustable of it but to me friends that does does no good if we're still sitting here wounded you understand what I'm saying it does no good if if we if we come into the church want to hear the message and then we bolt out as fast as we can so we don't get because remember listen are you going to get to heaven and just bat to your mansion and it's eternity you know what I mean where you bolting to but but but listen if you be honest with yourself you're bolting because there's a reason for you to boat if you're insulating yourselves if if you're isolating yourselves listen today is the day where you be honest with yourself and go Lord wait a minute wait a minute I didn't have that attitude at retreat but some OD reason it's coming back lord what why do do I act that way why am I feeling that way why do I let those why do I let those uh memories affect me in such a way cuz I I believe I believe that no matter what you struggle with in life the Lord Jesus can set you free from it I I don't care how hard life you've had listen you say I've been abused you you may have been abused in ways unimaginable but God can take that and set you free from it he can give you a peace and a love that needs to be in place of whatever thing that you're carrying and packing I I and I listen I you know sometimes I I I'll be in the I'll be in the church and see a family look all sweet and perfect and I think man why in the world I wish I could have had that I see these children I see them all so innocent you know what I mean got that clean look about just just look just wide as the snow you you just want to watch over them you know what I mean protect them make sure you know what I mean just want to keep an eye on them and I look at that and I cuz I look at it I'm like it's the Envy like sister meia had for brother when he held the baby you know what I mean little envious you know think man love to have that love to have had that but I can tell you one thing that even though portions of my life have been robbed from me God has Place something in its place of that robbery that that will that that gives me a satisfaction and it gives me an assurance it it gives matter of fact it gives me a courage and and a peace that I can share it with you unashamedly and and the reason and and and the reason is because I got peace on it because all of us go through these things but you know the what what it is is a lot of times we we let that thing actually keep us in prison because of Pride that's right but but whenever you really look at that thing whatever it is and you get Deliverance then it gives you a freedom where you can actually testify of it and go you know what and be the worst thing ever and go this is what happened to me but God Set Me Free right not that you brag on it not that you glorify it but you go well well well I know well maybe you're not with this is how bad it was for me and then God did this for me and now there's Deliverance now there's Freedom now there's joy when I had pain and hurt and anger and strife but God has Set Me Free there is there is a reality in this gospel that is that is something that Hollywood will never touch because it's a it's a supernatural reality that gives you peace and courage it makes you a lion it makes you bold it makes you calm it makes you peaceful it makes you sweet it makes you humble it it makes you it makes you a warrior and yet and yet you're you're gentle and you you understand what I'm saying am I even making sense in all this what is it it's the gospel it's what the lovely one has done for me he has changed me in such a way that gives me I'm just telling you how the candle got lick I hope that's okay but he has changed me in such a way you know you think you think I was in drugs I was in alcohol but listen I tell you what the past six seven years brother I was in some of the darkest places I've ever been I mean and and so I I know I know what it's like to sit in a message Pew and be miserable I know what it's like to hear the prophet and though you can hear him it's it's and though you you know it's true it's not ringing in your heart cuz there's a cloud of Darkness over you not that you deny the message but you feel like the message denied you sir where you thank God I know it's real but is it real for me I'm talking about Blackness I'm talking about Blackness where you think the only reason why I'm I'm up and going is because I I would see you ever ever see a picture of of little birdies Little Birdies new newborn babes and they got their mouths up ch ch ch ch you know how many years I had that imagery in my mind and and and the guys would be working they' be like man you working overtime what are you doing and I tell them you know you ever see them little birdies with their mouths open ch ch he go they go yeah like they don't know what that food comes from all they know is they're hungry and they look at me kind of funny okay but that's what got me through I thought in my mind neither did Ne needless did I know it wasn't but the tender hand of Jehovah carrying me the whole time but what I'm telling you friends you may be in that position where it may not be Little Birdies but you feel like the reason why I'm here is because my family and I'm this and I feel like this and that and nobody likes me nobody and you know what's all you're doing building walls isolating yourself insulating yourself nobody understands well listen I promise you there is one that does and I'm trying to share with you just a little bit of what I've been through so maybe you can understand oh yeah I've been there too or brother Gabe I'm right there right now but listen there's hope amen amen all I all I say friends is look just one step all you have to do is say I can I will I do believe I can I will just keep walking listen you all them conscious you got to be mindful cuz at the end of it when I was was I when I was you know know 5 years ago four years ago I didn't have an orange jumpsuit on nothing like that but you had to go back a few more years I whole another story but but but even though when my conscience my memory my reasoning my imagination was telling me this is not for you God hates you matter of fact you know I I I would think I said I'm just here I don't even know why I'm here God I my children I don't want to be a bad example but I don't I don't I don't I don't I I literally felt like an orphan and what is an orphan is when your your daddy and Mama's dead you was abandoned and you think sometimes we have those things but you know what that didn't have nothing to do with the faith that was down there that's right but listen friends I didn't get born again when I came into this church I already was amen but what I'm saying is as we go through dark times in life sometimes it's really really black sometimes it's really really dark sometimes we look in the mirror and we get things worked up in our minds sometimes we imagine things and Things become so real but there's no truth to it it's just you that's doing it right if you could just be honest with yourself this morning amen if you could just look to Lord and say God I I need help if you know if you want to go free this morning I I don't know if today is the day as we can stand this morning maybe the musicians come if we could stand and with stand this morning and I I don't know what you're going through friends I I trust that somebody in here this morning is wounded in their spirit cuz I couldn't get away from it this morning and there's got to be I don't think the Lord would have put this on my heart in vain I don't I don't I don't think I missed the mind of the Lord in the sense of this little thought and so there's got to be a brother or a sister that's wounded there's got to be somebody this morning that's hurting and maybe it's to the place where it's unbearable a lot of times we pack wounds for years decades maybe gray-headed stoop shouldered something happened way back when you still pack it well you you may be an old oak tree but maybe today can be the day that you lay it down cuz you got some little acorns that needs to hear that testimony maybe you got some you may have some other old oak trees that need to hear that you know why because they're packing the same thing listen friends it ain't just preachers that get up here we need everybody's testimony that I was once bound sir but God set me free thank you Lord I was once blind yes but now I see but now I see yes amen thank you Lord mercy and prise if we could just be honest with ourselves in the quietness of this moment maybe every head bowed thank you every eye closed I thinking I just want to tell you a little story as they play something softly you know there was a there was a great music magician one day by the name of Harry Houdini and uh he put out a challenge that there wasn't a prison that could hold him wasn't a prison cell that could keep him that challenge went out across the country and there was a chief of police that took him up on the [Music] challenge contacted Harry Houdini The Great Escape Artist so Harry he goes to the sell the police chief closes the door walks away Harry Houdini and all of his arrogancy and confidence approaches the lock and every effort comes up up short minutes turn into hours ours turn into exhaustion and eventually that arrogancy and confidence crumbles in exhaustion and as Harry Houdini yields himself in defeat he leans against the cell door and it opens that chief of police left it unlocked the whole [Music] time see Harry Houdini he was captive in the prison of his own mind yes Lord his own making and I just want to challenge you brother sister this morning morning that whatever is wounded you you can go free this morning there's Freedom there's liberty there's forgiveness I give it to the there's peace that passes all [Music] understanding won't you just surrendered it to him this morning Heavenly Father unto me Lord with heads bowed and Humble Hearts take me now God you see the burden of your children

we walk out of here each one a little bit lighter Lord that the Good Samaritan had come by and poured in the oil and the wine bound up our wounds so thankful Lord for your tender hand of Mercy that's been extended to us in this dark hour so thankful Lord for this loosening of redemption that set us free and gave us a title deed of freedom and liberty gave us the ability Lord to push back the enemy

your word the ability that it can push back the darkness and give us light and life and life more abundant I pray Lord that each one as we all search out our hearts from the youngest to the oldest

just a little bit brighter that we could have that that freedom them Joy bells in our heart ring just a little bit louder God as we approach that great day Lord might we just continue to unfold ourselves to you as you unfold yourself to [Music] us in Jesus name we ask Lord that Deliverance would have preeminence this morning that every sorrow would be turned the joy every tear would be
