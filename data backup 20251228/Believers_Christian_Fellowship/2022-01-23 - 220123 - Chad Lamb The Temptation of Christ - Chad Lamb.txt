ourselves over to you and surrender and lift our voices and sing of your glory and your goodness i pray lord that you would abide in the praises of your people and god that you would use the foolishness of preaching to save our souls that you would speak to us the living word lord of eternal life god the word that will bring us into the position you foreordained us to be in in this last day all right i pray you take this vessel unto your control and that by the power of your spirit you would speak through a gift you've placed inside and that you might be the great shepherd that would come and feed your sheep with your own hand for we give you preeminence now have your way among us lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you it's really really good to be in church today and we missed a couple services and you know sister angie got sick and she kept getting sicker and we finally gave her a cover test and she tested positive for kovitz so we had to isolate and do all of those things and the rest of us felt fine none of the rest of us got sick we were just stuck but not sick so but we appreciate all your prayers and then she was actually quite sick she got it kind of hard for four or five days and she was down and out and so we appreciate your prayers we appreciate the cards the text and then all your love and your concern and the meals that you brought it was a real blessing for us and we thank god the lord healed her she's about 100 percent now feeling really good and i'm glad she's feeling good because i was a homeschool mom for a few days and that is a really tough job amen and uh yeah i won't say anymore you you mothers and homeschool moms you have jewels in your crown in heaven i guarantee it amen and i was willing to pluck some of mine out and give them to her to decorate hers more after that few days of being a homeschool mom so i was ready to go back to being a pastor amen may god bless you all we appreciate you and so for us it's a real privilege it's a real it's a real treat to be here this morning with you and and we were the most excited and then when i saw the snowstorm was coming i said no no no no no no i can come back to church now don't do this so we thank god god was really good to us and really merciful so we appreciate that amen let's while we're standing take our bibles and turn to matthew chapter four while we're turning there i just want to uh show our appreciation for brother steve miller he's probably still out plowing but if you get a chance thanking him and he's plowing the snow so that we can come in the parking lot and also want to say you know whenever we have weather like this we usually say this every winter but i haven't said it yet because we thought we were going to have a winter with no snow but you know if you're uncomfortable getting out don't push yourself if you're not comfortable driving and the conditions and we continue to have service amen as long as we can get enough people together to have a serviceable stream amen so don't ever push yourself beyond your comfort level or get out there and feel obligated amen we're going to keep the doors open if we can unless it's just unsafe for everybody so that we can still have a service and still stream to those who weren't able to make it i saw some of you have driven quite a ways god bless you amen may the lord bless you for that and also i just wanted to let you know it was on the overhead but brother glenn tamblington called me yesterday to give me the details for the memorial service for sister lori they'll have that memorial service this coming saturday at 3 30 there's information on the bulletin boards it'll be live streamed from their church and i know many of you would want a chance to to see that also i want to just mention to you to remember sister nancy morrow and her family and prayer you know brother john passed away yesterday and uh yeah you know sister nancy has gotten coveted and then brother john had gotten it and he had to go to the hospital and he started when he got in he started doing really well we responded to the auction really well he was doing good for about two days and then he started to decline and we went in there and talked to him and we prayed with him and he just he just fell off really really fast and one day he just totally turned around so we went in with the family and we prayed and we said lord you know our brother is 91 years old you know he's lived beyond the promise god has been good to him and he said lord we'd love to see you raise up our brother because we believe in healing but if it's your time to take him home we just pray that you take him home peacefully that he wouldn't linger in between you know sometimes you know the people would linger in such a terrible condition especially with covet and we prayed that prayer and after we prayed that prayer it was no time just within a day i believe it was that he passed away peacefully you know so we thank god that there wasn't a struggle wasn't a long-term struggle and our brother has gone to his reward amen he's blessed and he's happy but remember the family there'll be a memorial service this weekend we don't have all the details yet but as soon as we get those we'll send it out on email and text everybody so that you'll know it'll probably be saturday but but we're going to put those details together in the next day or two so just remember sister nancy especially also remember brother tim aaron as he recovers from his knee surgery just a little over six weeks ago he had one knee done now just six weeks later he had another knee done so i'm really excited to see the brother walk in these doors amen with two knees without the pain he had without a walker amen and it may take some time for him to get the full strength but we're praying that the lord will take him there quickly and to see him walking without pain in his knees would be a real treasure a real treat a real victory so remember him as he recovers remember his family sister janet i'm sure is tired she's been taking care of him for one knee surgery and then through the other and nursing is not easy i had a little taste of it i don't want to be a nurse or a homeschool mom so praise god amen god bless you brother nathanael i feel cheated that you're there and i'm here i would rather be there and you're here but but god bless you it's good to have you and sister charity and the kids here it's just good to be in church amen it's good to be back together whenever you lose that privilege for a couple services boy it's really nice to get back together again while we're standing i like to read out of matthew chapter four and i'd like to preach on the temptation of christ this morning and i really feel to just take some time and teach amen this is so familiar to us we know it so well but it just i don't know it's just been stirring in my heart i was reading through it out of luke in my just my personal devotions a month or two ago and it just struck me in a real unique way and i started looking at it and it opened up to me a little more so i just want to go through this whole familiar story and see what's there for us but let's read it here in matthew chapter 4 verse 1. amen then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him up into a holy city unto the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get the hint satan for it is written thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold the angels came and ministered unto him may and god bless you as you have your seats and may the lord bless his word this morning amen i want to go if we could we're going to look at a few scriptures and we're going to get over to luke but let's go to genesis chapter 3 together genesis chapter 3 verse 6 we're going to look at the temptation of the woman by the serpent and we know that the serpent was incarnated by satan himself amen satan was working through the serpent to deceive the woman and so here we see this temptation on the earth i would say this first temptation in this dispensation amen of time and he says in genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons amen let's turn from there to james chapter one james chapter 1 verse 13. let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so the scripture in james is telling us clearly that every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust the lust is already in you amen if you go to sin you're drawn away of your own lust and and when lust hath conceived it bring forth sin and when sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so it's all based on lust and lust is just a desire lust doesn't have to be evil in the bible this word that is translated into lust is not always in an evil connotation it can be good or evil so this word that we see for lust in the bible is also interpreted desire and so when jesus told his disciples i have desired to eat this supper with thee when he goes to the last supper with them that's the same word so all it means is a desire amen and so our desires we're tempted by our own desires and when those desires don't match the word of god amen they lead us away from the word of god are contrary to the word of god and when those desires conceive they bring forth allah bring forth sin and sin when it brings it will bring forth death when sin is concluded it'll bring forth death so we we have these desires and these desires are can be good or they can be evil but it's the desires that lead us into temptation let's look over here at first john while we're back in this part of the bible first john chapter 2 and verse 15. it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever so we know that this lust is wrong lust what leads us to to sin amen is what's of the world is the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life i'll read that again verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so this kind of love is a lust is a worldly lust this kind of desire this lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life is of the world and is not of the father and the world will pass away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever amen brother branham tells us in the laodicean church age out of the church age book a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition and matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only i want you to hold on to that he overcame by the word and by the word only he didn't need anything else to defeat the temptations of the devil at his time of tempting but the word in the word only he didn't need the word and supernatural gifts he didn't need the word and and and experience it he all he needed was the word oh i love that something exciting to me because if if the word was enough then the word is still enough if the word was enough there the word is still enough here and if and if if the word would defeat the devil there the word will defeat the devil here so brother brown tells us that jesus showed us how we could overcome and he put it in the hands of the weakest christian and because he didn't use his supernatural abilities he didn't use his supernatural gifts what he used was it is written showing that any christian can use the word and defeat the devil anytime anywhere any place under any condition amen so so we don't have to have super gifts amen amen gifts are part of the church it's part of the experience of the new testament church and brother bannon said those gifts are there to keep the church clean but we don't need the gifts to defeat the devil what we need is the word amen that's why i think you know we can oh lord help me it is so it is so easy to to to get the wrong mindset and go in the wrong direction and have the wrong desire when we start seeking gifts and supernatural things and tangible things to see and things we feel and sensations and all that because those things are wonderful amen those experiences are one that have been wonderful to us they become anchors in our life in different places in our life amen but those those in themselves are not enough to defeat the devil amen there's many a gifted man that has fallen by temptation there's many a man that's been very gifted and had mighty works in their life and in their ministry and power and demonstrations and all of that and have fallen into sin and fallen into ruin showing that the gift was not enough but the word is enough amen and he defeated him by the word and the word only and it's amazing that at the end time what would be restored to us at the end time remember the gifts were restored under the pentecostal revival amen but what was restored in the bride's revival was the fullness of the word so the gifts came back in the pentecostal revival because they belong in the church they're part of the new testament church it's part of the word and must be there amen but in order for the ultimate victory over the temptation the complete victory over the devil requires the word only so at the end time it's not a pentecostal revival it's the bride's revival and the bride's revival is the restoration of the word back to the church so the church can have a complete victory over sin [Applause] if the gifts were enough amen the pentecostal revival in this restoration of the gifts at azusa street would have been the final move to bring rapturing faith to overcome all the world amen but it wasn't the final move the final move come under malachi 4 when the headship was restored back to the body when the word came back and that was the final thing the church needed to have ultimate absolute complete victory in this day praise be to god so he said i'm going to go on here matthew 4 when jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life jesus overcame by the word john tells us all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the and the pride of life jesus overcame all that was in the world these were the things that eve was tempted by and foul these were the very same things the temptations of jesus corresponded with the same temptations of eve in the garden of eden so jesus was here reconciling what was lost by the fall in the garden he was reconciling by facing the same three temptations which is all that's in the world and he overcame them by the word amen let's read that again for by the in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation in the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word he fell to the to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way sorry this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you're an overcomer because the word can't fail the only way to be an overcomer is by the word what do we have today the restoration of the word we have the ingredients for overcoming so we should be above all people most thankful hebrews 4 15 i'll just read it to you hebrews 4 15 says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin in all ways he was tempted like we are in all the temptation the world can offer but he never deviated from the word he never disbelieved let's go back to luke chapter 4 and i want to pick up this temptation in the wilderness over here in luke chapter 4 and we'll begin at verse 1. and jesus being full of the holy ghost return returned from jordan was led by the spirit into the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command the stone that it be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god and the devil taketh him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whosoever i will give it if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve and he brought him into jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone and jesus answered and said unto him uh unto him it is said thou shall not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season i like that word for a season he didn't depart forever just because he had victory he departed for a season now i want to look at this word tempted if we go back up to verse 2 it says being 40 days tempted of the devil this word tempted means to try to prove to a save to examine these are the ways it's used in the new testament to tempt and the definition they give from the concordance is to try whether a thing can be done to attempt to endeavor to try to make a trial a test for the purpose of ascertaining his quan quantity or what he thinks or how he will behave himself so this temptation is a test to see how he'll respond to see how he'll handle this situation it's a test to prove or to quantify or to qualify whatever you're testing in this in this instance they're testing the son of god the son of god is being tested to see what's in him and what what what he is amen how he'll react and then when we get down to to verse 13 he said the devil had ended all the temptation this word temptation means an experiment attempt a trial a proving the trial of a man's fidelity integrity virtue constancy also an enticement to sin temptation whether arising from the desires or from the outward circumstances in eternal temptation to sin so it's a trial approving jesus amen after he was filled with the holy ghost amen he was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil amen so the baptism of the holy ghost the indwelling of the holy ghost for jesus put him straight into a trial to be tempted of the devil it wasn't amen i should say it this way the the baptism of the holy ghost amen did not equate to then everything going perfect and no more trials and more no more temptations and everything no the baptism holy ghost now equipped him to go face to trial amen and brother branham said this happens to every believer after you're filled with the holy ghost then the trials really start coming down upon you amen so jesus goes to the wilderness to be tempted to be tested to be proved amen to find out as it says in here the fidelity the integrity the virtue the constancy that is within to prove him as a son of god amen so he overcame everything that he fell by brother franco if we could pull up the white board i'm going to draw this out real quickly if i can i will try i like this whiteboard app because really what i should have done is made a powerpoint but this is a cheap way to do a powerpoint it's easier for me amen so we have what did i do so we have three temptations brother branham said they directly correspond with the temptations of eve so you have lust of the flesh and for eve for eve she saw that the tree was good for food right for jesus he was asked to turn the stone into bread why he had fasted 40 days and was hungered so it was the lust of the flesh then number two is the lust of the eyes for eve she saw that the tree was pleasant to the eyes for jesus he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and the third one we have is the pride of life for eve the tree would make one wise and for jesus and brother brahm gets into this a little bit later was to prove his sonship by a miracle all right so these are and brother bam said there's a direct correspondence between the the three temptations of evil the three desires or lust that she had and what jesus overcame in the wilderness and he goes on to say in the message how can i overcome from 1963 in the days of daniel's time there were four overcomers that could stand the test of fire and lion now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson my brother back there also he that come with the god must first be tested tested what with the word that's god's test you believe it he that cometh to god must be tested that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you i believe it's written in scripture peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it is a testing time it's one good evidence to us that god is with us when we're tested for all children of god are tested and tried so if we're all going to be tested eve was tested jesus was tested brother benham said we'll be tested i think it behooves us to look at who failed the test and who passed the test and learn from jesus the example that how we should pass the test but not just how we pass the test also the tactics of the devil when he brings the test so i'm going to look at the tactics of the devil and i want to look at how jesus overcame those tactics because we're told that we must be tested and he came as an example for us hey listen in reality folks when brother branham said that if you are expressed attribute of god a seed gene of god then you were in jesus christ when he walked this earth amen that's why you don't have to pay for your sins you already paid for them when you were in that body in calvary so that means you already passed this test in the wilderness in that body amen and so now the testing is coming amen the bride is being tested as well she's being tested what with the word how she overcoming with the word amen it's a word test for a word bride to prove that shall stay with the word and the word only and so brother graham said every child is tested man i want to look at galatians chapter 5 because i i view this as a critical scripture for what we're talking about in galatians chapter 5. galatians chapter 5 and let's start with verse 16. this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh i think this is a critical spirit for what a critical scripture for what we're talking about walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh what do we need to do we need to get in the spirit and we need to walk in the spirit we need to get in the sphere and stay in the spirit amen we need the we need the baptism the holy ghost but we must stay in the spirit and stay in the spiritual realms and stay under the influence of the spirit and we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh because that's what he fell by that's what everybody has fallen by these three examples of all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life that's all that is in the world and it's not of the father amen and and how do we overcome it because if we walk in the spirit we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so this is a critical scripture verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would so i say praise god amen god has given us his spirit not in partial measure but in format full measure amen the portion that was in jesus christ amen that day that he went to the test that same portion has been poured out to the bride universal today amen the same life that was in christ is the same life that's here and if you walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so it's it's this is when we start to teach on this we're not coming up with an abcd formula for overcoming no none of this works if you're not in the spirit amen and if you're in the spirit you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh because we're going to find out the dev that the devil's tactics are so subtle amen they're so deceptive amen they're not they're not simply detected that there's no way that you're going to overcome unless you're in the spirit unless the spirit of god amen is discerning in you unless the spirit of god is the interpreter of the word in you unless you've got the spirit of god which is the life of the word amen to to give you the correct understanding of the word without that you'll never overcome this temptation so you have to walk in the spirit that walk in the spirit to me it denotes a constancy uh uh uh uh you know walk in the spirit is not be filled with the spirit because you can be filled with the spirit and then walk another way but this walk in the spirit shows a daily life it shows a constancy a consistency a walking in the spirit all the time and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen and if we'll just really be honest with ourselves and really think about our own lives it's those times that we've been filled with the spirit of god but when we begin to walk with other things amen that we get tripped up in the lust of the flesh amen but if we would walk in the spirit we should not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen what has been given to us is an opportunity that no other age has had amen when the fullness of the word came the fullness of the life of that word came with it and we can walk with that life amen and i think we for for me it's worth the effort friends it's worth the diligence it's worth the sincerity to me god has been really dealing with me later lately that i want to be in the spirit like i don't just want to take for granted amen that i've been sealed i'm sealed to the day of my redemption i believe that with all of my heart but i want a greater earnestness i want a greater devotion to god god has been dealing with me in these realms that i don't give him a cheap devotion because my salvation was not cheap amen the sacrifice of christ was not cheap amen those who have sacrificed their lives before me to lay down the word through the church ages to lay down the word that we have in our bible it wasn't cheap it wasn't without effort it wasn't without i mean it's a real sacrifice of life so why would i take everything that's been given to us in this time and offer god a cheap devotion my spare time 15 minutes here or a service there i don't want to give him a cheap devotion i want to be devoted to him and so god has really been just dealing with me in prayer and dealing with my life i want to be in the spirit amen and to be in the spirit i've got to say no to other things and i've got to turn from other things i've got to be diligent and sincere i have to put forth effort i have to be decided and determined to do what i'm going to do on a daily basis to walk in the spirit because i can listen to a message or i can listen to whatever news podcast on something i i i'm interested in or trying to learn whatever it might be amen i'm not talking about good versus evil i'm talking about just diligently saying amen i've got to walk in the spirit and give christ my whole life because the second great fold of his threefold plan is to have preeminence that's first place that's the right to rule inside of his bride and he's a gentleman he doesn't take what's not given to him so i want to give him a greater devotion because i want to walk in the spirit i want to live a spirit life i want to walk in the spirit i want to be directed by the spirit i want to walk into the spirit and not fulfill the lust of the flesh and so when jesus testing time come he showed us that he was in the spirit the spirit was in him john had seen the holy ghost in the form of a dove descend and rest upon him and immediately amen the spirit led him into the wilderness to be tempted but he was walking in the spirit and he was able to overcome all that is in the world in that temptation brother brahm said in the message the god of this evil age in 1965 we find now this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve oh we've preached on that before but why is the world so evil to prove that she's not like eve why is it you've come in the darkest time in human history why is it that you've come at the pinnacle of satan's eden why are you here in satan's eden why are you here in the darkest time why to prove that you're not like eve we find out this evil age oh praise god this evil age is not to give satan victory this evil age is not not not god's defeat or the defeat of the word this evil age is to prove to satan she is not like eve that she is not that type of woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as adam's bride was tried by the word and adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise and he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she has come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word you know when when eve was in the garden amen adam and the woman were in the garden of eden she had the full word for that day she had the word she needed for overcoming she was equipped with everything that she needed to defeat the devil in all of his tactics and she had the full word for her day amen and she let down on the full word amen because of their desire because of the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life she let down on the word when she let down the word that's how the fall came into to being and jesus christ was here on earth to reverse what eve had lost there so he faces down the same three things and overcomes them by the word amen so eve was given everything she needs to overcome we have been given everything we need to overcome and everything we need to overcome is in this word that is why amen for me there is no watering down the message there is no neglecting the message there is no making excuses for the way brother bradham taught a scripture there is no there is no cleaning up the message amen god brought that man to bring us the correct interpretation of the word with divine vindication so that we would have everything we need in this day to overcome the devil and if you start playing around with that word amen you start correcting a prophet and you start saying well he didn't really mean that in that scripture he he kind of misused that or he meant he meant millennium when he said this you start to do that you're going to start to deteriorate your ability to overcome the devil and all of his tactics amen now don't don't don't go farther than i'm going with that because brother benham said well i had that wrong or i made a mistake there and that was not 700 it was 7 000. listen we're not talking about those things but the way brother branham teaches a scripture and when he uses that scripture he knows what scripture he's using amen he knows where to place it in time he's not misplacing that scripture he's not misplacing that word amen he knows exactly what he's doing that's like when he comes to the uh choosing of a bride ameni he starts with two scriptures at the beginning of choosing of a bride he starts with eleazar going and fetching a bride for isaac then he goes right to the seventh vile angel pouring out his vial and in that message he preaches the choosing of a bride and at the end he says oh capernaum oh capernaum what is it it's the seventh angel pouring out the vial he wasn't out of kilter with the word he knew exactly where he was he was using a scripture that tied to the seventh vial angel and he was there fulfilling it at the end of that message saying oh capernaum capernaum so we don't want to we don't want to deviate from this message that's brought us back to the correct understanding of this word because eve had everything she needed we've been given everything we need but tell me where you got it if you didn't get it from this message i found some truth on the internet and i found this teeth bible teacher and if listen if you didn't get it from this message how do you know it's pure [Music] how do you know it'll defend you in the day of trial how do you know and i hope that you understand this better as i go on how how true that this statement is he goes on in this quote let me just back up here he said the bride will be tested by the word just like adam's bride was tested by the word she has to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word for in the beginning of the bible man was given the word of god to live by one word misinterpreted by a man called satan and a person of an animal called the serpent satan and a person could talk to eve and misinterpret the word to her and was lost see it must be every word see what was the serpent doing what was satan doing in the serpent he was saying yes i know he said but but think about it i mean he didn't really mean that you'll not surely die amen but i have heard that same voice do that same thing with things brother branham taught things he taught on marriage and divorce amen things that that he taught on oh you just name all kinds of subjects that he taught i've heard that same voice take this beautiful message that was given to us and start trying to to say well i know he said but amen if you start listening to that voice you're going to lose the wall of protection amen you're going to lose the very thing that's been given to us to overcome the devil in this day amen so i want to look at uh three things that the devil tempted jesus by one the first was his position as the son of god he knew that he was hungered he had been 40 days in fasting and afterwards he was a hunger and he says if thou be the son of god turn this stone into bread and brother branham says here and god's power to transform from 1965 satan tried and tried again to spray it he took him up and said if you if you are what you say you are then do some of this healing here for me show me how you can do it turn this bread and this stone into bread let's see you like take a dive because the scripture says you'll do it you see them religious devils today still saying the same thing what are they doing to brother branham if you've got the power to heal let me one said let me take a little girl and cut her hand and we'll stand here in the midst of the brother and you heal her it's the same devil if there is such a thing as divine healing here lays brother so-and-so let's see you heal him that same devil stood at jesus at the cross said if thou be the son of god come down off the cross the word said he was the son of god the spirit proved he was the son of god isaiah 9 6 was fulfilled and the other night many of you in the broadcast heard how that we give 60 some odd scriptures almost i believe about proving what that the scripture said that that was him so jesus knew who he was amen he he had his identity given to him by a revelation from the father he knew who he was but the first attack that the devil brings is an attack against his sonship his position in god and he said then he says if you be if you be the son of god turn this stone into bread because you're hungry amen but jesus never took the bait because what's he trying to do the devil amen is trying the devil in this tactic he's trying to get you to look somewhere other than the word for your sonship if thou be the son of god turn the stone into bread if thou be the son of god come off the cross you understand and so jesus amen never took the bait because if he would have went down that line then he would have never been able to find ultimate security in his position and his sonship because it would have been from one hoop to the next hoop that now if you're the son of god and if he would have turned the stone into bread which brother branham said i believe he could have he could have if he would have turned the stone in the bread then the devil can ask the same question in the next circumstance that he has a need and then the next time he has a need the same it's an endless cycle of questions because he's looking to manifestations as evidence of sonship and jesus was not going to take the bait to go to manifestations as evidence of sonship his evidence of sonship was a revelation of the scriptures [Music] you have to have an individual encounter with god who reveals to you your position in him and he will reveal that to you out of the scriptures so that your faith is based on your experience and the word amen so jesus had had an experience with god just before this when the when the spirit as a dove in the form of a dove descended and rested upon him he had his experience he had his revelation he had the scriptures he knew who he was we know because at 12 years old when he was when he was speaking with the with the the doctors of law and the scribes and the pharisees amen and mary came and said my father and i thought he was tears amen he says didn't you know i must be about my father's business he knew at 12 years old that he was the son of god amen so he knew he was he had an experience with god and he didn't need anything else to prove his sonship and he didn't need to prove his sonship to anybody else oh this is look at the tactics how many times has the devil come to you you're sick you need this you pray and and and god forbid amen you take the bait and you pray and god has another plan for your life and he doesn't give you that job he doesn't change these circumstances he doesn't heal you immediately and you go on and continue sick and all of a sudden you've taken the devil's lie his misinterpretation of the word and you've taken that and now because it didn't come to pass now you're questioning your sonship based off a manifestation and you've totally walked away from the word amen that's right the bride's going to stand on the word and the word only brother says in the message to see jesus from 1954 it says and we see satan then tell him said now if you be the son of god let's see you do a miracle for me now i'll give you something to do and if you do it i'll believe you're the son of god in so many words now here you're hungry now you can turn these stones into bread nothing bad about nothing bad about that you make them bread and eat and sit down there and eat and turn them stones to bread and oh i'll believe you do you think he would have believed him no you can't make a deal with the devil because he never keeps us into the deal i'll believe you and i'll never i'll never question your sonship again you pray this one time and if god moves supernaturally according to your prayer i'll never question your sonship again you lay hands on your daughter and she's healed from fever this time i'll never make you doubt your sonship again he's a liar and the father of it amen don't take the bait don't step into that if if god will he listen oh manifestations are never equal to sonship praise god he says now you're hungry turn these stones into bread turn them stones of bread and i'll believe you why jesus could have done that i believe but he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone he just found out satan did that he wasn't meeting moses that time he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god look at what jesus said he said a man doesn't need bread only but what he needs is every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen i don't need the bread amen to live i live by the word i don't need the bread and then also tell me where you see in the scriptures amen where do you see in the nature of christ and the servants of god where do you see that they take a gift and they use a gift for themselves to ease their suffering to benefit themselves amen brother brahm said his gift wasn't for him he would stand at the pulpit and his stomach would be wrenching and he'd be so sick he could hardly stand and have to grip the pulpit to keep praying for people and he says but the gift wasn't for me it was for you amen and so you see that jesus now is is conducting himself in the nature of the word amen because the nature of the word the servants of god always sacrifice themselves amen for the word and for others they don't ever take a gift of god and use a gift for self vindication or for self pleasure self satisfaction amen self uh preservation or self blessings so when you see a man start taking and using a gift and that gift becomes his vindication amen you see that there's a man there who's insecure about his position in christ because he needs the vindication of a gift to prove his sonship and the devil can twist that insecurity so easily that's what he was trying to do with jesus he first comes to him and he tries to find if there's any insecurity in the sonship because if he finds an insecurity in the sonship he can twist him so easy because what what do we want more than anything in this world i want to be a son of god amen there's something in me that craves to be a son of god i want to please the father i want to be a son of god i want to be connected to him and if there's an insecurity about that the devil will come in and manipulate that insecurity so easily so that was his first attempt with jesus but he found out jesus didn't even care for his own life what he cared for most was every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god because a son of god wants every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god it's more than our daily bread it's more than this natural life to us when this natural life is over that word will carry me to the real life amen this one's just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow so he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god skipping a paragraph he goes on to say so he found out that he had met a little more of a student than he was and so finally taking him on the pinnacle of the temple and out into the mountain and tried to tempt him in every way through the word but jesus would not clown for satan and he doesn't yet you don't have to dance to his music you don't have to respond to his questions listen the devil was always trying to get jesus to move from his position over to the devil's position so he was always coming with goofy questions you know by what authority do you uh why by what authority do you do this in the temple when you turned over he says well i'll ask you a question you answer my question or answer he never felt the need to prove to anybody anything he never got pulled out of his commission of his calling he never had an insecurity that the devil could manipulate to pull him away from his purpose in life he stayed true to that purpose and when they would ask him a question he would just give him an answer or said you know you answer me and i'll answer you and they couldn't answer him and so he said neither will i answer you well i mean what is it that makes us feel the need to answer every goofy question about the message and every doubt and every question somebody has and somebody says well there's no you can't find any birth certificate for brother branham i don't care if you can't find a birth certificate what does that matter to me and i'm not going to go hunting for a birth certificate i'm not going to go through records and try to find one what does the birth certificate prove anyways amen i'm after the word amen that prophet was called of god and ordained to restore the word back to the church it was the word it was always the word it was the headship it was christ that's the whole purpose of the message not when somebody was born not where they lived not how many people fell off a bridge not any of those things the whole purpose was always christ himself returning to the church the fullness of the word uniting with the body that's always been the message if you can't find a birth certificate what does it have to do with that you see so what's the need to answer the silly questions there's no need to end they say you know i can't even think you know you answer this question i'll answer your question i don't even know what to ask him i just said i don't have time sorry i can't answer that email why because i'm enjoying the message which is union with my lord and the message how can i overcome from 63 says when he came to that show off with jesus he said get up on the temple here and jump off he said it is written don't tempt the lord thy god see he met him with the word and every major assault no true servant ever tries to show himself off with god's power he he if he does he loses right then no servant of god ever tries to show himself off with god's power you know any gift that we have and any power that's been given to us to overcome amen it's not our victory it's god's victory it's not our vindication it's the vindication of his word it proves that he's faithful to his word it doesn't prove anything about us because i mean how many people that were not predestinated seed of god could believe the word of god and receive healing in the prayer line of brother brennaman and prayer of multitudes of other christians and they they're not they're not predestined not see genes of god they're not children of god at all but they can they can believe a promise and by that promise amen they can receive healing amen that's not their vindication that's god's vindication that his word is true so god's gifts and god operating his gifts by his spirit are never our vindication as a people or as an individual it's always god's vindication that his word is true and so when god brings his word to pass in you and you somehow get credit for that and it becomes a vindication then somehow you've added yourself into the mix amen and you've gone between god and god's manifestation and you're diverting some credit away from god unto yourself and brother baby said when you do that you lose right there because as soon as you do that amen the devil will find there's a weakness that's the spot where i can get him to fall let's look in matthew chapter 7. matthew chapter 7. and verse 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so tell me if you can have confidence in gifts tell me if you have confidence and manifestations this group jesus you know jesus never denied that they did any of this and i've said to you before here they are at the white throne judgment i don't believe anybody is lying to christ at the white throne judgment i don't think they made this up i don't think this is i don't think they're they know good and well that they didn't heal the sick and they didn't cast out devils but they're saying jesus didn't we no nobody is trying to pull anything over if there's one place there's going to be absolute honesty it's going to be at the white throne judgment and here they are saying lord did we not amen cast out devils did we not heal the sick did we not do many wonderful works in thy name and jesus never denied their works and i believe that they did them but he said depart from me i never knew you ye that work iniquity so so you can we we jesus never falls for the devil's bait these people when they come to jesus they had a false security they had a false sense of sonship amen because now they're they're looking to jesus at the white throne judgment and they're saying listen hey hey we cast out devils i'm your son i mean we're on your side uh we cast out devils we healed the sick in your name and then your name did many wonderful works he said depart from me i never knew you so you see themselves they thought that they were justified they thought that they were right amen because they could look at a string of works and those works were their testimony that they were right it doesn't work friends so don't take the devil's bait that's a temptation of the devil to get you and i to doubt our position in christ and who we are in god's economy amen based off whether we can or can't or we do or don't or there's a manifestation or something works and trying to tempt us that way amen we shouldn't be tempted that way we should have a confidence in who we are by our experience with god and the scriptures that he's given us and we could go back to the scripture and say by his stripes i am healed the rest is up to him amen at calvary he saved me he washed me clean he filled me with the spirit the rest is up to him i don't have to perform amen to get anybody convinced and i certainly don't need to convince myself see the only reason you need to convince somebody else is if there's really a need to convince yourself but let's go back to the word and say god give me a foundation in your word so i no longer feel a need to convince myself so that i'm convinced of who i am in you by your word i want to go back to luke chapter 4. i want to go to the second temptation we're not done but we'll come back there's so many things i want to say and i'm so afraid that i'm going to forget them i'm just asking god to bring out what he once brought out amen matthew chapter 4 verse 5 and the devil taking him up on a high mountain showed him showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time i want you to catch that wording he showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee in the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will give it if that if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve brother bam says this in the second seal now listen carefully to what he says satan took jesus up to a high mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world that ever was or ever would be in a moment of time he showed him past present and future what kind of eyesight was this and what kind of mountain was this brother branham said in the message three witnesses from 1951 when jesus was taken up on a high mountain by satan he let him look down through the stream of time and showed him all the world and the kingdoms thereof and said their mind is that right and i'll give them to you if you fall down and worship me is that right jesus knowed he'd inherit them anyhow he said get thee hints satan and then over in revelation said rejoice ye heavens and ye holy prophets for the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ in 1953 he said in the message resurrection he says and then he took him upon the pinnacle of the temple and then he taken him from there upon a mountain and here's what shocks we people brother i said this is a shocking statement here's what shocks me people and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time just think of that in other words he just opened up and he saw all the kingdoms of the world united states was the united states around in a.d 33 or a.d 30 russia great britain all of them see what what we read these we read these stories so much they become common but we don't realize that this temptation was a supernatural temptation you realize if jesus is going to be tempted now think about this when god was going to have an adversary he had to have a worthy adversary so god did not create a wimp to be his adversary to prove his greatness but god got a worthy adversary to show how wonderful he was meaning that satan has power satan has rights satan has wisdom satan has beauty satan has talent satan is loaded down with every gift he can be loaded down with because god needs a worthy adversary that's why when we start calling him names and start start trashing the devil it shows we have absolutely no understanding because if god needed a worthy adversary to show his greatness and all his attributes and we make him a puny little wimp that we can stomp on and spit on and call nate and he's dumb and he's stupid he don't know nothing he's ugly and he smells bad [Music] what kind of worthy adversary is that but he was made in beauty and splendor and perfection he was given every gift that could be given he had the highest rank of an angel that an angel could have before he fell amen he is deceptive he is beautiful he is wise he has powers and abilities and so now when jesus is coming to a temptation it's not the same way amen it's not that god's going to give him little pretend temptations just do this little pretend temptations to prove that your son of god we know it's all fake and we're just going through the motions we're playing some sort of game okay uh i make the bread i'm not going to make it bread okay not scene two no this was a real temptation and when we look at this temptation it was supernatural amen it was beyond nature amen he was lifted up in matthew 4 says in an exceeding high mountain and in the exceeding high mountain he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time like a twinkle of the eye listen this is not natural if it is tell me which mountain he stood on where he could see all the nations at that day and all the nations in the past and all the nations in the future all the way to the united states russia and great britain show me where that mountain is so we can go stand on it it wasn't a natural mountain amen it wasn't natural vision but the the second deception that he came with was vision and the supernatural listen friends the devil is super deceptive deceptive this was jesus conquering what eve failed in these weren't light trials these weren't just little things this was a real temptation and when when when satan came to jesus to present him this this this uh proposition did he come with a long tongue hanging on mouth and horns and a fork stick i wonder this is just me i'm not going to give you the answer because i don't know the answer but it's a curious question in what way was he presented to jesus and in what form and in what image and what did it look like did it look like something evil or would it look like something good because he we know that the satan comes as an angel of light and he comes to jesus and he takes him on an exceeding high mountain and listen this was not everest mount everest is supposed to be i think that if i'm not i'm not good in school and geography but i think everest is the highest peak in the world is that right does anybody know geography this wasn't mount everest this was another kind of exceedingly high mouth this was taking place in the spiritual realm friends this was a spiritual trial these were spiritual supernatural vision and things that were taking place jesus was carried in a vision supernaturally and to an exceeding high mountain and on this mountain in a moment of time he could see every nation that has been that is and that will be all the way down to now and he was offered the power of them and the glory of all of them if he would worship this being that was able to show him all of that [Music] see this is what began to strike me so deep when i was doing my devotions i've read the story and read this story and read the story and did not realize the impact of what i was reading how deep this deception was how supernatural and spiritual it was how good it would have looked how how he would have been lifted up into vision and listen no doubt jesus had seen visions before this and my question is would this vision be much different than the visions he'd seen before or would it be similar because does the devil do things completely different or does he copy all right so the devil copies what god does and if god could show jesus a vision and carry him away supernaturally now the devil is doing the same thing the father has done now satan is carrying him away in a vision to an exceeding high mountain and listen i want you to think differently about mountain and not think physical because mountain in the bible many times represents a kingdom or a nation when jesus casts saying out he cast him out of his holy mountain amen when the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands it comes down and smote in the feet the image and it grew into a great mountain that filled all the earth that is not a natural mountain that is the kingdom of christ so an exceedingly high mountain amen he took him out the devil took him into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and saved their mind this is just my personal belief amen that he jesus or satan took jesus up amen to the supernatural dominion of satan that he has over every nation and over all the earth because satan has a kingdom this is satan's kingdom this is satan's eden and he took him to an exceeding high mountain means this mountain is over every other mountain so he took him to the pinnacle of his kingdom amen to the top amen and he showed him in a moment of time past present future all the power and all the glory of all of these natures that this was a supernatural i would say it this way mimicking supernatural vision supernatural experience that the devil gave jesus christ i hope you don't feel like that's too far out on the limb because that's exactly what happened that's why friends when this word came we've got to stick with this word because god can give vision and supernatural experience and satan can give vision and supernatural experience how will you know the difference if we don't have the true interpretation of the word [Applause] tell me any false system false move false doctrine that doesn't have supernatural that goes along with it that they claim is a vindication i mean you take any of the religions of the world you take any of the denominations that started out hey listen you you know it's got to be appealing friends it's got to be a copycat amen you can't trick somebody amen with counterfeit money that doesn't look anything like the money you're trying to replace it with but if you want to have good counterfeit you've got to get it as close to the original as possible without being the original and listen the devil has got counterfeit gifts he's got counterfeit vision he's got brother man said counterfeit he he said devils can drink blood out of a human skull and speak in tongues and interpret it that doesn't mean god can't god's the original there's an original tongue's an original vision an original supernatural an original laying on it there's original of everything but the devil he brings counterfeits and the counterfeits are for deception so if it's deception it's got to be so close that it could deceive the elect if it was possible oh praise be to god this temptation in the wilderness that jesus overcome was far more than what i thought it was all my life all my life i've read it like like i don't know a children's story out of a sunday school coloring book satan said make these stones bread i will not you know my image was very childish very immature amen and take him up i don't even know what i used to think about an exceeding high mountain seeing all the kingdoms of the world i don't even know what i used to think about it but i tell you what i used to think is not what i understand now that if that had happened to you you would have a very difficult time knowing is this god or is this the devil i mean what is going on here amen i mean i i've been given a supernatural experience where i've been carried out of the natural world up into exceeding high mountain into a supernatural realm and i've been given vision in a moment of time to see every nation the glory and the power of that nation from the beginning of time all the way to the end of time amen you would have a very difficult time knowing whether that was the devil or if that was god and jesus had to first face that to overcome that to reverse what was done in the fall and how did he overcome it he overcame it by the word friends there was listen if i could just put it into my own words and just this is my own words but there was just something just wasn't right about it it didn't have that ring to it there is something i mean it looked good it looked right and what was he showing him he was showing him what he was predestinated to listen the devil was not showing him something that he didn't have a right to the devil was not showing him something that was not his inheritance he was not showing something that didn't already belong to him it's not like he was trying to convince jesus to do something that was way out in left field jesus was born to be the son of david to rule all the nations of the world and to have all their glory and honor and power directed towards him that's what will be in the millennium so the devil was not oh i could say the devil was not way out in left field with this the devil was coming right down the word line he was coming right down the promise right down the inheritance he was coming right down it looked like he was right down the middle with this but there was just a little curve to that ball because it wasn't the nature of the word it was the word it was the destination this was the right person but it wasn't right because because jesus was not destined to have anything without first paying the price for it there had to be redemption there had to be reconciliation there had to be suffering amen so that he could have all of that and all of us with him when he had that so it was it would look good it was right in so many ways but he was trying to offer him the kingdom with no suffering and brother branham said jesus was or satan was content to let him have it because if jesus would have taken what was right what he had a right to what he was predestinated for what was his inheritance if he would have taken it before his time he would have disrupted the whole plan of god so although it was the word you had to know the rest of the word to know if this was the correct timing for this word it wasn't that it wasn't the word it wasn't that it wasn't supernatural it wasn't that it didn't look good but it didn't fit the whole plan of god you have to know the whole mind of god to know if this fits or not so so jesus is looking at this and this is just brother chad again it just doesn't have that certain ring there's just something odd about this and i don't know if he thought of other scriptures i don't know what came into his mind but here's what brother brenham said and how can i overcome the third great assault satan offered to forfeit this kingdom to him he did satan said these see these kingdoms of the world these are mine i do with them whatever i want to i'll forfeit them to you but remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost so why was the devil so content to give jesus his kingdom and his right to rule because if he gave it to jesus and jesus took it and the rest of the attributes of god would be lost and no redemption then the devil would have the ultimate victory because god would then be lost because if the attributes of god are lost god is lost the word has failed satan becomes ultimate victor over all of the creation of god he was content and listen don't forget this the person who gives you something is the one who has more power than you that's why he said i'll give this to you if you worship me because that's the way it has to work amen the one who gives it to you has more power than you the one who gives you something becomes your head and i don't know how long jesus thought about this i don't know what scriptures went through in mind i don't know anything really but there are things that that are just interesting to think about he said he was trying to get him to forfeit without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom but he must come but but he must come back he i'm sorry yeah he could have took the kingdom but he must come back he must he was tempted to do it now is that what brother ben said he was tempted to do it listen this test doesn't mean anything like if you want to give me an entrance exam to university don't put on the test one plus one equals this is the entrance exam to harvard find the noun in this sentence know you know what state is columbus in that's not the kind of test jesus went through brother bram said he was tempted to do it listen he was in a human body that felt every pain that you feel that feel heat feels cold feels hunger feels headache feels everything that you feel he felt in that body and when he went 40 days with no food he was afterward or hungered he was hungry after 40 days of no food and when the devil said turn the stone into bread and he had the power to do it don't think there was no temptation there this was the temptation and brother branham said when it comes to these kingdoms he said he was tempted to do it think about the reasoning listen the devil is a master of reasoning if you're the king of all the world then you set the laws you can make the whole world follow god's word you can bring all of this to line with god's word and he could have he could have begun ruling with a rotten iron rod of iron right then but if he had there would be no redemption for the elect seat of god there would be no reconciliation of what had fallen before amen it would just be him ruling with a rod of iron but his brethren would be lost the rest of the attributes the family of god would remain lost and brother branham said he was tempted to do it i believe brother brandon death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross jesus was literally tempted now listen you say wow what if it happened to you what if you are lifted up into a supernatural realm and placed on an exceeding high mount what did that kingdom look like what all they see we don't know but in a moment time you see past present future glory power all of it and it's all handed to you and you could be the king of it all amen don't think that you wouldn't be tempted amen jesus was tempted the bible says he was tempted in every way like we are that's what makes him a faithful high priest he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get thee behind me satan he didn't do it he came and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we this morning willing to do to take the same route that he has taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to god forfeit all the world and the things to serve him see now he failed to do it willingly to forfeit it satan was to him but he didn't he didn't do it though jesus was tempted he overcame for us although he was tempted he overcame why did he overcame he overcame so you could be redeemed he overcame for us he endured all temptations for me and for you he could have took it right then but what did he take the other route for so that we could come be with him and if he paid such a price as that then how little would we be not to take it when remember there's nothing here anyhow so now jesus was tempted but he took the route now listen let's just bring this down home amen how many times oh my goodness how many times are we tempted to do something that's a little deviation from the word and from the plan of god but it's not something that's completely wrong amen well you know what about what about uh i don't know even i don't what about taking a job amen and taking that job moves you away from fellowship or takes you away amen from church or takes your family away and you say but you know i've got to support my family it looks like god gives this to me but you know the word says don't forsake the assembling together of yourselves you know that that is the word and it doesn't mean that you never never have to work a job never miss a service i'm not talking about that but i'm just talking about a principle brother ben brought this out and i thought it was so good the principle of it not the law but the principle you can take in a relationship you know this relationship is forbidden by god the prophet speaks against it amen but what you can do is then you can start praying about it and don't think the devil can't give you supernatural experiences to tell you that that's okay don't you think that circumstances won't start lining up or you'll have a dream as a confirmation or somebody will call you up and say you know i was thinking about so-and-so or all right have you ever thought of employment over here don't you think that the devil cannot work in the supernatural and you think it's god giving you the permission to go against his scriptures because it was supernatural but because it was supernatural is no right to go against the word of god so we can look at jesus temptation but what about our temptation what about the things that come to us what about when we know good and well the prophet taught this the word of god is against it the scripture says but you know what i'm going to go to prayer [Music] why if you go to prayer you better be praying that god gets that desire out of your heart so your desire matches his word don't go to prayer to ask god for permission to do something his word forbids listen i mean this works in all kinds of circumstances i mean i mean if you want to leave one job to go to another but god hasn't given you permission to leave that job it's not wrong to leave a job to go to another that's not sin but we want to be led by the spirit we want to be led of god we want to ask god god do you want me to leave this job and go to this other and you can pray about that until you get supernatural signs and what is it really you'll pray until something matches your own desire that's why brother branham said you have to first get neutral when you go to pray there are things that are forbidden there's things that there's decisions we make we just need god's leadership and i understand that but we have to first get neutral and that's a hard thing to do i mean i it's gonna probably take a lot of prayer to get neutral and then let god lead either way but there are some things that are specifically forbidden preached against by the prophet spoke against in the word but because we still desire it we'll begin to pray for it and then when and i've seen it so much till it's just so odd to me somebody will say you know i was praying about that and you know i i wanted to do this or that and all of a sudden i looked up on a billboard i saw a word and that word was in the title of the company i want to go work for and i said that's a sign what it was is an expression of your desire you wanted it to come to pass so you looked for anything that would give you a vindication for it to come to pass and then you said it's of the lord but don't think the devil doesn't know that too and the devil can work supernaturally he can anoint people to say things to you he can anoint people to call you amen he can he can give all kinds of supernatural experiences and you say oh it's the lord it's the lord if it matches the word but i'm going to say something more than that it's the word it's the lord if it matches the nature of the word i'm going to get into that next so praise god let's go back to luke chapter 4. i want to go ahead and get into this luke chapter 4 verse 9 and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of a temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone and jesus answered and said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god look at verse 9 and he brought him up to jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple what did that journey look like were they walking through the wilderness and then they had to get you know a couple days journey to get jerusalem when they got to jerusalem they get some ladders out and start climbing up the pinnacle and the devil's dragging him up on the next next ladder you know he's pushing jesus up okay get on to the next these are supernatural temptations they have supernatural elements to them they have things that human beings can't do themselves attached to them he brought him up he he took him to jerusalem hey listen this was not just in the spirit because he said cast yourself down his flesh had to be there how did he carry him i don't know but maybe he could copy a mechanism of god where he could carry philip away and philip could show up miles away i don't know how he did it but the devil is a copycat of god and we know philip disappeared after baptizing the ethiopian eunuch and he found himself over far away in joppa and now all of a sudden they're in the wilderness being tempted and he carries him to jerusalem and sets him on the pinnacle of the temple this cannot be this is just me but i don't believe it could be just spiritual because he said cast thyself down amen so you don't dash your foot so your body is not injured there's a promise that angels will protect your physical body from injury it had to be his physical body on the physical pinnacle in physical jerusalem how did he get him there what a temptation what if you found yourself on top chase tower you're at home you're eating cereal you're standing there on top of the tallest building in lima and somebody's quoting scriptures to you doing something a human being can't do i shall say it this way the devil is super deceptive let's go to hold your place in luke 4 but let's go to psalms 91. psalms 91 11. for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone did the devil quote a true scripture did he quote it correctly and was he speaking about the right person the devil is super i just want to say i hope you catch this he is super deceptive so much so that he could deceive the very elect if it were possible this is why the message had to come to break that power of deception that is exactly why we cannot play games with the message we cannot alter it to our liking we cannot change what the prophet taught we cannot change what he said we cannot change the scriptures he used if you do you're going to fall by deception of the devil because he is super deceptive and i'm going to look at the third deception that he uses the third deception that the devil uses an indentation of scripture so when it comes to you the devil can use your position in christ as a temptation vision and supernatural experiences and the scripture all to get you off of the word now listen how are you going to do that yourself you've got to have the baptism the holy ghost and you've got to walk in the spirit listen i hope after this morning's message more than anything in your life you'll cry out for god to fill you with his spirit and keep you walking with the spirit because there is no way to overcome these kinds of deceptions with our own mind and our own strength and our own will we will fall prey to them every single time amen but god has sent something in this age that has never been in any previous age and it's here to give the bride victory if she'll just rely on it believe in it stand by it walk in it amen be filled with the spirit walk in the spirit and stay with this word brother branham said in victory day should he come to the day that satan took him up on a mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said i'll make you a king now you say you're the son of god and you got power i'll give you i'll give you the ruler of all nations just what the antichrist is trying to do to be today but there was a v-day he found right through it said if thou be the son of god there come a time when he was challenged by the word if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread see and you're hungry now eat them see if you're the son of god you can do it he could have that's right but there had to be a v-day he won the victory over that temptation he said now you can be a great person you can show yourself what you are took him the pinnacle of the temple said drop off i'll quote the scripture to you it's written he'll give the angels charge over thee lest at any time and i dash thy foot against the stone and bear thee up look at that theologian that satan is see get thee behind me satan came the word it was v day he come to every v day in 1950 he said believe us down this say remember jesus had all the qualities of the father in him do you believe that sure he did all the fine gifts of god was in in christ his son for he was the offspring of god but notice when he met satan for your example he never used any gift on him when satan come to him he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word proceedeth out of the mouth of god satan caught him again upon the pinnacle of temple jesus said it is written and he took him up to the top of the mountain and jesus said it is written see it is written that was the victory it is written you know brother branham tells us brother brown tells us about the showdown amen in israel when ahab and jehoshaphat were going to go up together the war and there was all the prophets of ahab and they began to prophesy and they give a prophecy and they all consented to the prophecy but but uh jehoshaphat asked for another prophet and they got makaya and mekiah got the true word of the lord and he came down amen and he gave him the true word of the lord and listen zedekiah the head of that the ministerial association the head of those prophets he looked at him he said where went the spirit of god when it went out for me listen zedekiah had received a spirit it was a lying spirit and god permitted it to come down he asked micaiah saw on a vision he said there was a a conference in heaven and and and god was saying how can i bring my word to pass brother branham dramatizes and shows us he said how how can i bring my word to pass and a lying spirit said i can go down and be a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets and god said that'll work you go and so listen zedekiah and those prophets received a spirit and a supernatural experience and that spirit and that supernatural experience was a confirmation of a scripture that came from moses that this section of the land that the syrians had taken away belonged to them they had scripture for it and they had a supernatural experience to go with it but micaiah uh i'm going to make a statement but just listen to what i'm saying and don't misinterpret it macayah so those the lying spirit used the scripture and a supernatural experience mikaya used the word you can have the scripture without the word but you can't have the word without the scripture many times the scripture has been used to get people to move away from the word it's a misuse of the scripture to get people to leave the word amen they had the scripture and makaya had the word because he was looking back to the previous prophet that was before and that prophet put a curse upon them and said this is going to be a curse and the vision that mackay had matched the word which also matched the scripture that moses gave because they're looking at one scripture but but uh elijah when he put a curse on ahab was referring to another scripture that as long as you keep my commandments i'll keep you in the land but when you forsake me you'll lose the land amen and so they were looking at a scripture here you have two scriptures both of them true scriptures both of them come from moses but the true prophet gets the right application of the word for the season that they are in and mekiah checks his vision with the prophet of that day because the prophet of the day has the right application for the word for that season zedekiah in them had the word but it was out of season wrong application of the word here's what brother branham said about micaiah in them he said let me tell you something god has a purpose for everything stay with the word what the bible says stay with it it's god's urm and thumb and old micaiah the prophet stayed on the word of god walked down there just as boldly as a lion that night the lord gave him a vision he knowed where he was standing and watch oh brother the others had a vision too brother brown said the others had a vision to yeah they had received a spirit and where did this where did the spirit come from from the presence of the lord was that spirit in the presence of the lord that the lord telling me it could go there was a spirit that came from the presence of the lord it wasn't the spirit of the lord but that spirit came down to them and they had a vision and they they had scripture the others had a vision too but their vision didn't compare with the word of god but they had scripture but it wasn't the word oh i hope you catch that i mean everybody claims to be a bible believing church this is the bible believing church this is a bible believing church this is a bible believing church when they preach when ministers stand up and denominations and sex and and cults and everything all over the world they'll read to you scriptures amen but just because you read scriptures doesn't mean you have the word amen in order to have the word you have to have the right application of those scriptures in its season and how will you get that without a vindicated prophet in your day to bring the right application of the scriptures and it sees it and when you have that you have the word when you have the word you have the mind of god amen so zedekiah had a spirit and vision and scriptures mecha had a spirit and vision and scriptures the difference was the prophet for that age had brought the right application of the word and the vision and the scriptures macau had matched that prophet's ministry he says the others had a vision too but their vision didn't compare with the word of god but micaiah's was with the word of god because elijah which had the word of god the prophet the seer had already said what would happen to ahab so how could mackay say something good was going to happen when the word of god said bad was going to happen see he was with the word oh praise god brother brahma also says in absolute he had a vision they had a vision too but the vision didn't compare with the word and the message won this from 1962 he says satan took him up there and said it's written just like he said to eve it is written it is written jesus said it is also written it's written he'll give his angels charged over thee the bible said see boy he's a scholar who's he talking about he's talking about the devil boy he's a scholar it's written he'll give his angels charged concerning thee lest thou dash thy foot against the stone and bear thee he said it's also written thou shall not tempt the lord thy god see although there was a scripture out of psalms 91 that promised physical protection for jesus for the son of man when he came lest he dash his foot against his own there was angels surrounding him to keep him going amen those angels were not there at the will and direction of christ they were there at the will and direction of god so jesus says listen he brought him up to the pinnacle of the temple he said cast itself down amen because of this scripture amen he's trying to get him once again to prove something by by a miracle to show what he is by a miracle using the scriptures amen but jesus didn't fall for that because that scripture was not there for jesus to use at his whim that scripture was there for god to bring protection to that body until it could get to the cross see there's many such scriptures that are there promised for you and i if you think about the promise that brother branham gave us the promise that said amen nothing can harm a child of god until his purpose on earth is finished now god has already ordained your birth god has already ordained your death is that true is that the word if you begin to take that to your own will and begin to live recklessly and dangerously and no value to your own life say hey i can't die anyway so god's purpose is done with me i'll just do this and i'll just do that and i'll i'll drive 150 miles an hour on a motorcycle because i can't go before my time well the truth is you can't go for four year time but you can limp the rest of your life by playing with god's word see there's all kinds of scriptures like that in the bible amen but those scriptures are for god to use at his will and discretion not for you to force god into a your will and discretion that's why he looked at the devil and said the scripture also said don't tempt god that word 10 means to test or to prove i'm not here to test god and his faithfulness to his word and make god do something amen that word was there for god to use at his will at his discretion when he saw fit that's not for me to force his hand at my will in my discretion and you see the word can be preached in such a way that makes us we do this and god has to do that and god has to do this for us and god god hasn't got to do anything according to your will and desire god does it according to the purpose that he's laid that word there for not for you to hijack it to your own purpose to vindicate yourself and prove something to the world although the word's true and it has a true application for you but we're not to tempt god by his word so before i move on he tempted him by his position as a son of god he tempted him by vision and supernatural and he tempted him by the scriptures what kind of temptation do you think you're going to face listen to what brother branham said i love this quote out of restoration of the bride tree in 1962. so when that same group of men sent a lady down and said brother branham if the aims of the lord told you the angel lord you know his picture here there if the angel of the lord told you that we'll believe it she's talking about water baptism in jesus name in chicago the ministerial association had a problem with baptist water baptism in jesus name they sent this woman as a delegate down to say brother branham if you'll just tell us the angel of the lord told you that we'll believe it and listen to what brother bram says i said anybody that a minister or group that would be that weak if the angel of the lord said if the angel said anything contrary to this word it wouldn't be the angel of the lord [Music] it doesn't mean an angelic figure a being of light a spirit wouldn't come to you and tell you amen the right way to baptize you know if a light pillar of light shows up and the foot of your bed tonight and wakes you up and says the true interpretation the scripture is the baptized and the name of father and of son and of holy clothes according to those titles amen you could reject that wholeheartedly no matter how much tingling was all over your body no matter how bright the light was no matter how deep and rich the voice was you could reject it based on the word of god brother branham says in the way of a true prophet of god in 1962 it says one day satan come like that like christ crowned golden slippers on stood there he's talking about an instance out of the life of saint martin golden slippers on stood there and said blazes of fire all around him said don't you recognize me martin i'm your lord worship me martin looked at him there is something wrong there this is where i get that statement i made it just didn't have that certain sound like i mean it looked all right and i mean it was blaze of fire there was a figure there crown everything it was really there supernatural experience really there and saying martin do you recognize me i'm your lord my brother brahman says he looked and he says uh he makes this statement he says uh there's just something wrong there it just wouldn't settle in martin's heart it was a true vision he was seeing it it was glorious it was beautiful but something just wasn't right he said martin can't you recognize me i'm your lord and savior said worship me he said that three times and martin looked around he seen christ would be crowned by his people at the coming he wouldn't be wearing gold slippers he said get thee away from me satan boy wouldn't pentecostals eat that up a bright shining angel he goes on this is another quote from anointed ones at the end time in 1965 on the same story he said i want to show you how deceiving the devil is one day he was sitting in a study up come a mighty angel crown on his head golden shoes on lace around his garments of gold said martin do you know me he said i'm your lord and savior i'm the one that saved you worship me martin but that prophet knowing there was a little something strange there he kept looking at him listen you wake up in the middle an hour i think he was at his desk riding and appeared before and said worship me you would feel pressure to get up to be obedient to drop on your knees but with martin just something wouldn't settle in his heart something was just wrong and he kept looking at him and three times he said martin i'm your lord worship me martin i mean listen you you think you've been through temptation before this is the temptation who doesn't want to worship the lord who wouldn't want an appearance of jesus before him that they could bow at his feet and worship him i would give an unfathomable about the money to be able to do that and who would want that opportunity and not worship but here's martin just looking at him he says it again children of god are strange creatures he says it again martin i'm your lord worship me i don't know he says martin i'm your savior jesus christ worship me don't you know me martin martin kept looking at him the scripture running through his mind he said satan get away from me he said you've got a crown on your head and the word of god says his saints will crown him at the end of the age wouldn't that have been pentecostal bait watch that word brother that's where it pays second corinthians 11 14 tells us it says no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light he doesn't come looking wicked he comes as an imposter he comes in deception looking like the real thing he's he spent millenniums and millenniums of time before there was time he spent time impersonating the genuine what how do you think he brought a deception over the angels two-thirds of the angels in heaven how did he bring that deception unless he spent all his time mimicking the genuine he didn't come at something different he comes copying the original then brother branham says in the message satan come down in the garden of eden as an angel of light what was he doing and he was bringing more light praise god brother brahm says when jesus nazareth was here on earth he never used his power yet he was god manifested in flesh he never uses power when satan come against him he said it's written he had to do that because eve broke down on that and what eve lost christ regained where eve let down christ fortified again it is written man shall not live by bread alone it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god it is written it is written what is it he stayed with the original artillery but eve let down she began to listen to reason you want artillery stick with the original word amen i want to look at one more thing here as we wind down to a close i want to look at three more things what am i doing wrong okay that works oh there it goes okay let me write this down brother branham said there's three things that you must not do with the word you must not miss you know once we get past two syllables i get nervous writing up here you must not misplace and you must not dislocate this is the way to handle the word of god or to mishandle the word of god he says here in christ is revealed in his own word from 1965 now in order to study the scriptures paul told timothy study it rightly dividing the word of god which is truth them is three must in the scripture and using god's word there's three things that you must not do now let's study those for the next ten minutes three things that you must not do and all out in the land wherever you are across the nation be sure to put these down in your mind if you haven't got a pencil you must not do these things we tell you all the time how you must do now i'm going to tell you what you must not do you must not misinterpret the word you say well i believe it means this it means just what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of these it throws the whole bible in a confusion and in a chaos brother brahma goes on further down in this message he starts to explain these so i'm going to read this as he explains him if anybody misinterpret jesus christ in the bible of not being god himself making him the second person or one god out of three this would upset every word in the entire bible it would break the first commandment you should not have any other god before me all right it would make the whole christian race a bunch of pagan worshipers worshipping three different gods see what kind of a bible you'd have then it'd make us what the jews say we are said which one of them gods is your god see see you mustn't misinterpret the bible where jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible when he's made manifest in the age that that that the part of his body is being manifest if it's a hand age it must be a hand it can't be a head age if it's a voice age well then it can't be a foot agency and now we're at the i age and now next is him himself see seeing prophetic so after the prophetic comes the knowledge that understanding the word the headship he himself after this seeing which is prophetic ministry of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 after that is he himself see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet luther come back out through wesley then the pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no side of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's god himself it's becoming to a place he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam did at the beginning like adam was rather at the beginning this is christ coming into this manifestation now he's going to go on this is where he's going to start explaining the other two yes god this would set the whole bible in a confusion break the first commandment and make a god a pagan god of three it would just ruin the whole picture of the bible so you must not misinterpret the bible now that's just one thing then every scripture in the bible has the same application you've got to set it in its place and to misplace it you might make him god in one age and the next age you'd make him a history to misplace him so you mustn't misplace the scripture he is god all the time if you made him today a god of history that was back yonder and he isn't the same today what you're going to do with hebrews 13 8 see he's the same yesterday today and forever now see what this would do and what it has done is already done it make him deny his own word to misplace the scriptures to dislocate the scriptures you might put his body together wrong this is so good to dislocate the scriptures you might put his body together wrong the foot where the head should be or something see other words you might have jesus teaching moses message or even wesley teaching luther's age you might now rh teaching pentecost the pentecostal message you see what a mess it would be in pentecost has already shown its colors luther has already shown his went off into denomination it died right there the age struck there it went so i want to look at this over here in the temptation in the temptation of jesus christ in the wilderness the devil did all three so jesus faced three temptations that that were directly representative of the three that eve fell by by lust of the flesh lust of the ice pride of life there was three temptations that come to jesus amen tempted by a sonship tempted by vision and supernatural and tempted by scripture and now these three things that you don't do with the word satan did all three of them in this temptation he misinterpret he misinterpreted the word let me write this down here he made sonship equal to miracles or manifestations now i'll ask you the question do sons have manifestations yes must they have manifestations yes the word has to be made manifest in your life but he made sonship equal to miracles as in if you have miracles then you're a son of god and that is a misinterpretation of the scripture okay he misplaced the word let me make that better he promised angelic protection he promised angelic protection in a way god didn't promise it it was the word of god it was a true word of god for that manifestation for that person but he tried to get christ to force god's hand and applying that scripture by jesus's own will to prove that jesus was somebody special and was who he said he was that was a misplacing of that scripture we see another example of this when jesus has brought the woman that was caught in adultery when the woman that was caught in adultery was brought to jesus they come to her and said this woman was caught in adultery in the very act like they found her in the act of adultery you cannot commit adultery by yourself it takes two people so that she was caught in the very act of adultery but they just bring her and they bring no man and then they apply the scripture but they misplaced the scripture because they said the law says she's worthy to be stoned but they've misapplied the scripture because the scripture says that she and the man she commits adultery with are supposed to be stoned together and so jesus so easily picks up on the devil's deception because though it was a true word it was a misplacing of the true word because you had to have the two culprits together and when they were together you had to have witnesses when you had witnesses then you could do the stoning so here they're bringing the word but they're misplacing it in a wrong application they're trying to trap jesus by the scripture they bring another temptation by the scripture but jesus amen knows the scripture knows the nature of the scripture and knows that this is a misplacing of the scripture and he doesn't take the devil's bait there are so many things that are promised to you and i but do not let the devil misplace them and dislocate the word tried to get him to have a kingdom before sacrifice that would dislocate the word of god was it was he to be listen if you if you go if you go all the way over to revelation chapter 11 under the sounding of the seventh trumpet he says now the kingdoms of this world have been to become the kingdoms of our god and is christ will jesus christ inherit all the kingdoms of the world absolutely that word that prophecy that scripture was for him it was him but the devil tried to dislocate the word and tried to get him to bring the millennium before the sacrifice before the reconciliation and before the full redemption was it the word yes was it dislocated yes and when you dislocate the word amen you break the word and the power of god amen you're using word but you're using i should say this way you're using the scripture but you're using the scripture to move somebody off the word because he was dislocating he was getting things out of kilter praise be to god so when we look at this temptation in the wilderness it's so much more than just a sunday school story jesus goes he says no the word the word the word no these were real temptations he was tempted to take the kingdom he was tempted amen to prove that he was a son of god he was tempted by hunger he was tempted by these things but what was the devil doing the devil was doing the same thing he's always done with the word he misinterprets he misplaces and he dislocates but what is he tempted by your sonship my vision in supernatural and by the scriptures i say friends without this message what would be our chance when we look at what christ has overcome and and who was that i want to ask you who was that withstanding that temptation in that day that was the fullness of the word made flesh and the fullness of the word amen that that was full of the spirit of god led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil that fullness of the word with the full life of the word was there to withstand amen the lust that are in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the the pride of life and he was there to withstand the misplacing misinterpreting this locating and dislocating or misinterpreting mislocating dislocating of the word and how did he overcome he was the fullness of the word so what is the bride manifestation it's the full measure of the word all brought into a capstone ministry and a bride in the end time with the full measure of the word the headship that has been restored to a people on this earth with the full life of that word there to bring it correctly into correct manifestation if we don't have that we won't pass the test but this bride has to be tempted like adam's bride tested like adam's bride was tested and what will she be tested by shall be tested by the word listen don't think because you've got a scripture that you can do anything you want that scripture can't be misinterpreted can't be misplaced and can't be dislocated well brother chad how will i know if it's misinterpreted misplaced or dislocated i'll tell you real simple find out what the prophet said about that scripture go back to the message and find out what the prophet said about this doctrine this teaching this circumstance in life this scripture find out what he taught and when you find out what he taught you will find the application of the word in the right season in the right application with the right interpretation for the day that you're living don't play with this message don't cut pieces off don't cut the edges don't trim it up don't make it palatable don't make it more appealing don't make it more appetizing this message is the same thing that was standing there that day when jesus was withstanding the temptation in the wilderness that same manifest that same life that was in that manifestation that same life is here withstanding the same thing in this day and what is it it's the message the message is christ amen the message is the full measure of christ the full word with the full thought of god with the full life of the word that has come back to a people and without that we won't have victory we've got to lay in the message amen lay in the presence of the son bake all of the greenness out of us until we can overcome all that's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life how will we do it when we walk in the spirit we walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh how will i walk in the spirit jesus says the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life this spoken word in this end time has brought the spirit the life of god the life of the word the life of christ you call it whatever name you want it's the same thing it has brought that full life not partial it was partial luther's day it was partial in wesley's day this is not a partial day that's why wesley could believe false things luther could believe false things they could do wrong things it was partial that day they were still being tripped up by scriptures they were still being tripped up by mislocations misinterpretations dislocations of the word but not today today is a different day the word has come to defeat the devil in all of that so he can bring the final victory when the the christ was restored amen by by standing the test the bride has to come in contact again by the same thing to stand a test by the word and when the groom is restored and the bride is restored then the eden will be restored the devil is fighting like crazy to keep this bride from completely overcoming he's holding on as long as he can if he can get you to take a promise before it's time he'll let you have it i'll give you my whole kingdom if you'll just take it out of order i'll give you powers amen i'll make you the best preacher on the planet if you'll just preach this land i'll make you write songs like nobody will believe if you just take this little slam on the word don't think that the devil can't he can't take god's gifts and twist them and manifest them say no devil i want this message and it's the only thing i want and i want god to help me see it right amen with the right interpretation with the right spirit with the right nature amen amen god is so good to us he didn't drop a book out of heaven amen the seventh seal the seven church age and 1400 messages amen to say okay here's it is i hope you get it right but no he gave us the word there was a vessel that word came through that would reflect the very word that he was speaking so we could see the reflection of the word and the wave sheep that was waved over the people so that we wouldn't just have word to fight over and argue over but we would see the nature of the word on display so when anything comes amen no matter with what scriptures no matter what manifestations if it doesn't have the same nature that was displayed in that wave sheet i'm not accepting it as the message listen we are the most privileged people that have ever walked on this planet god has so made sure that we would have the word but not just the rhema word but he would express it in a life amen the first part of the field to come to harvest maturity that word matured in that prophet and god lifted that and waited for the people so you could say the same word that fraud produced that maturity if i will lay in the presence of this son which is this manifested word and bake all the greenness out of me i can live that life and if the word i believe brings a different life i would check the word something's misinterpreted something's mislocated something's dislocated but i want i want to have the correct word because the correct word brings the correct life and i want to live the life of jesus christ because that's what this message came to produce the scriptures can sound so good we've got this scripture in this scripture and it gives you 10 scriptures to support my idea but you're nasty and you're hateful you're divisive something you you can be preaching like a house on fire and bringing tons of scrotching quotes and scriptures but you're divisive and nasty and hateful and condemning and something in me is standing like martin looking at jesus christ going something's not right like the scriptures are true and the quotes i believe but but what's wrong with you why won't you respond what's wrong with you why won't you shout amen and you're sitting like martin going um i the scriptures yeah those are good scriptures yeah that's a true quote but something's not right have you ever experienced that but i say god make us right from the top to the bottom inside and out amen you've brought a word with the spirit to bring the right manifestation so that we can be whatever he was we are in this earth make it manifest in me let me see this message the right way take the scales off of my eyes give me the right revelation amen let me take this message in this scripture the word that you've given to us and give us the right interpretation the right placement the right location so that we can manifest the right life i don't want anything other than that it can be deep it can be simple i don't care give me the life it can take hours it can be 30 minutes i don't care give me the life give me a word that produces the life of jesus christ that will reproduce his very life and nature in me and i will say that's more than scripture that's the it's word than quotes that's the word it's more than scriptures that's the word because it has that ring to it amen brother bram says in christ the mystery god revealed he says in there there would be a time come forth when he would express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down what did eve turn down the word what do you accept the word what word did eve have the full word for her day what word do you accept the full word for your day by accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my spirit my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down listen to this what eve turned down he comes back and we accept he didn't say it comes back this wasn't just scriptures coming back it was the person of the word who came back what did eve leave eve left christ because christ is the word when she left the word she left christ and that's why brother branham says it this way what eve turned down christ the word he comes back has he come back he comes back friends he's here accept him don't turn him down don't do what eve did he's come back now accept him in the full measure of his word with the full light he comes back and we accept see how that hybrid condition again just exactly what he'd done eve he told eve don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and that and satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the eve in this last day is not going to do it because she's smarter stronger can read faster has better churches and even this last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to oh it was never dependent on you when god looked down through the stream of time and he knew that you would come at this end time to finish the work he was never leaving at all to you to manufacture in your flesh he was saying i know what to do amen there's a seed of me laying in there and that seed will only respond to the word so what i will do is i will bring a word that will bring this seed to life and the more word that i push in the more life will come out so when i bring the full word i will push out the full life amen he was not depending on you doing better working harder trying again he was he was totally satisfied that at the end of this age when i bring this word down that life that's inside of that soul will reflect this light that's coming here but even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it yes sir god's going to do it how's he going to do it in you but it's not you it's him him and you what do i do brother chad walk in the spirit it's here it's available it's coming with the message feed on the message feed on the word of god devour the bible listen to the taste fellowship on the word listen to the preaching of the word receive the spirit walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh he's brought the fullness of the spirit to give us a full measure of overcoming power even the last day's not going to do it because she's predestinated not to yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said his church will be without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest how many are glad he said he's going to do it it's by predestination you could never try hard enough to make it happen what's he asking you to do he's asking you to surrender to believe and give yourself over give him preeminence and if you can give preeminence to this word the life of this word can come in and live its own life out of you walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen let's all stand musicians if you'll come i just want to say this as we close the correct interpretation of the word if i i'm just i i've made statements today this is just my understanding the way i can express it and they may not be 100 accurate and i may express it a different way in the future but but just hear me the correct interpretation of the word to me is expressed in the nature of the word why can i believe this message so much i see it tied through the scripture all the way front and back forward sideways up and down i see that but but i see what that revelation did to that man and that man was born in sin that man had complexes that man fell he made mistakes he even told us listen you want to see how deceptive uh deception is the deception of the devil brother banham was struggling with rejection a rejection complex and being rejected after preaching the seals and he was struggling under all that and feeling depressed and he had himself convinced by a little voice in his head telling him that prophets don't act this way the old prophets of old in the old testament they lived out in the wilderness they got a message from god and they stomped out and delivered their message now listen that was the devil tempting him that was the devil tempting and how was he tempting him by the scriptures listen the devil's not going to come and bring you a pack of cigarettes and say i want you to stumble today we're too far down the road for that that was how we stumble when we first believed but then he brings those things away and breaks that away from him and now the devil his tactics are getting more deceptive and more deceptive and more deceptive but he comes to brother branham and says you're not even acting like the old testament prophet you're a prophet that's true the old testament prophets lived separated they would just march in and give their messenger that's true too so were the scriptures correct was he was he calling a a man a true prophet was he correct in that designation yeah the devil had truth but he didn't have all the truth and brother branham brother brahm is so honest he comes in standing in the gap and he's telling us that sounded pretty good to me and was willing to bring a deception to his wife to pull the plan out because he was seeing the wisdom in the scriptures and he was a prophet and this is prophets in the bible i'm going to do what the prophets do in the bible and here's what he told us he said really i was doing that for myself because i wanted to hunt and fish lust of the flesh how's brother man being tripped up lust of the fl he had desires he wanted to get away from the pain and go to what brought him pleasure how do you and i get tripped up the same exact way and the devil uses scriptures and he points to well you know brother so-and-so did this and remember that story in the bible and remember you know martin luther thought it was okay to do this it sounds silly but that's exactly what happens to us but brother man was honest enough when god spoke to him and called him out he was honest and i'm saying really that was my own desire i he was giving over to that voice because it matched the desire he had in his heart and and god come to him and corrected him and gave him the correct word for his season and placed the word in him he says you've got more gifts than that and these other gifts can't be expressed that way he brought him more of the word i say god keep me right you've promised that i'll not fail by predestination now god help me help me to see right help me to believe right help me lord god help me to lose my desire for all these other carnal things that take my time and attention and drive me back to this word lord help me god fill me with your spirit and let me walk in your spirit that i won't fulfill the lust of the flesh god i can't do it without you help me god help me god let's bow our heads and pray oh heavenly father we thank you lord that you have so opened your word to us in this end time lord that these are not bible stories this is life these are not things we learned in sunday school these are deep truths that you've laid in the word to give us victory in this day the temptation in the wilderness was an expose you exposed the tactics of the devil you laid him bare you opened up all the falsehood and the lies and the deception that is so close but brings us so far away but god we need that combination of your true word and your spirit in this day god fill us with your spirit i pray that you give us a fresh outpouring of your spirit and help us to walk in the spirit lord lord keep driving us to that true interpretation of the word and keep opening it to us open this message to us more and more lord so that we can see in reality what we're looking at so we can see the full word and we can live the full word for that is the season we live in that is the right application of the word for our day lord

your blood and wash that out of me sanctify me lord i don't want those things anymore i'm craving your word i want to walk in your spirit i want to be the manifestation of your word in this day let me oh god live my part of the manifestation ah we're yielding ourselves to you we're surrendering afresh take us lord take all of us let us surrender our own once lord i'm surrendering my wants my desires my pleasures lord i'm laying them at your feet they let my greatest pleasure be to please you let my greatest pleasure be to see your word manifest in me oh i love you i thank you god that you've given us such a word in this hour our confidence is so high lord because you brought us the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication no man can do that you did it lord and you did it to give us overcoming power we thank you for that lord let us stay here and always remain here god exposed the devil and all of his tricks to us let us see by discernment lord what he's trying to do give us that little warning bell like martin of tours had when that vision was standing before him there was a little something inside that just wouldn't register lord let us be sensitive to that lord let us hear that no when it's you and not you help us to stay with the word for our age and stay in the spirit bless your people lord as we go from here keep us safe on the roads lord watch over each one lord and help us god and our manifestation in our daily lives we surrender refresh to you in jesus christ's name amen brother john the trials of this world we're getting stronger [Music]
