Father Lord we thank you at this time for one more week that you allow us to be here Lord we're asking that you bless the service is [Music] we have something that is beneficial for your people in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen Brothers first of all I want to give thanks for the opportunity that I've been given ESS hoping to say something that is beneficial for every one of you no it means for me it's not my intention to say something that isn't right [Music] this evening I want to bring the subject saved by grace how many know that were saved by grace in our Lord speaking along about justification of how God's great love how he was able to come is and justify us of our sins like it says here in diverse we just read for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God it says being justified freely by his grace as you can remember as you can remember in the beginning the entire human race was condemned salvation and Humanity did not have any salvation for their own sins something that seemed that we were all condemned to death there was nothing that a human being can do to save himself by the grace of the Lord that we can come back by faith in his blood by faith in his son this is God in the beginning made a plan he tried to find a way of Escape for himself he tried to make a covering made out of fig leaves that didn't work for him but God made a way for him with him again yes and I was under the shed blood of an innocent substitute yes and that's the only way that God ever did mean it's under the shed blood of an innocent substitute if we go back to the old testamento that was the way man had in in times past to be able to be reconciled with God once again that was the way back then but in today we without having the need of making an animal sacrifice because we have now received our new way for the Forgiveness of sins and the justification of our mistakes it seemed that we had no way to receive salvation is provided that way back to be able to use that way you don't have to pay anything the price was already paid the only thing that God requires from you is your face for you to believe that sacrifice was provided for you I would like to keep reading in Romano cinco in Romans 5 8-9 carida para comosotros says commended his love towards us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us foreign says much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him or if we when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life for when God died in tregando suvida surrendering his life he covered us with that blood is by which we were Justified of our mistakes the blood that saves us of the rap that could have come upon us because as I said we didn't deserve anything but death he provided his son so that we can be saved there was nothing there was no one that could ever do it for us because one man cannot justify another man it's only God can do that a sinner cannot justify the mistake of another sinner because we can find here an example on earth like in the times of the judges in a court setting [Music] an attorney can defend someone that is guilty trying to find a way for him to be found innocent trying to cover up his mistake but that doesn't work with God because one sinner cannot cover up the mistake of another sinner but only the Lord Jesus Christ can save us only the Lord Jesus Christ can justify us before God only under his blood can we be found righteous or just and it's by our faith in him I'll keep reading and the message that's called living dying buried rising and coming you can see why that the Lord to such a degree he must calm down himself and surrender his life for uh some sinners why is it that way I deserves is the only thing that we were we were faulty before the Lord it was because of his love he said he was the greatest the first representation of love that ever hit the Earth yes and was the spies of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved no man could ever love like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him and despised him and rejected him but it did not stop his love is this is the last one he was hanging on the cross after that life that he had lived had been done nothing but good things forgiving the guilty Healing The Sick yes and just things that were good this is when he had his chest hanging there on the cross when he with his last press on the cross with that vulgar mocking spit of them who stood by either hanging from his sacred face he cried with the Heart full of love father forgive them for they know not what they do is that's something sad at the same time it's something that is already Grand is three things it's so sad in the sense that house is possible that person that is so full of love a person that never did anything wrong against mankind even even still he was despised and the only reason that was in his heart was love for us at that time mankind could have received death because of that he could have said you know what just destroy them look what they did to me that there was a portion which did have faith in him which did accept him and loved him and because of that portion he surrendered his life to save us yes along with all the rest that were able to come the sacrifice for whosoever believeth in him that there was no uh God was not a respecter of persons because the Lord surrendered his life for the sinner for whom it seemed that there was no salvation for their life foreign he surrendered his life to be able to save you and I it's uh incredible to think how he came aciano to us and to think that every one of us is here by his grace thankfully it hasn't happened to me is where it seemed that they didn't deserve anything where it seemed that no one loved us when it seemed that our life was completely gone he then came to us in a different way someone approached you and showed you that the Lord was able to save you he showed God's love towards mankind that even we while we were yet sinners he loved us regardless of what we have ever done he can forgive you forget your past but the Lord only wants you to accept his blood is and your sins will be covered and wiped away from his remembrance and to be justified by that Divine blood as the song says it's the blood that gives me peace is the blood that justifies me Jesus it's the precious blood of Jesus there's nothing in this mankind that is able to justify man to justify the mistake of our paste on the world can remind us of the things of the wrong things that we have done but God can't remember it anymore at the moment that you come before the Judgment the trial but you accepted the sacrifice you believed in that blood and you let that blood to cleanse and justify you and to cleanse every part of your being at the moment that you come before that trial Diablo and the devil wants to accuse you the Lord will say I can't see anything I just see one of my sons I just see a person that's cleansed and just but he might say well look he did this and that he says I can't remember it I don't know if you were mistaken by what person did it but he's one of my children and I don't remember him doing that is what you're saying about him is no longer in my remembrance you you can come in then I would like to keep reading in a very perfect in the message of perfect Faith remembering that great love of Our Lord of how he loved us when it appeared that we were nothing why why is it that he was able to love us while we were yet nothing I would like to read in the message perfect faith in uh page 21. a paragraph 433 brother Branham says he says he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing he says but I am in his hand see he called me and he loved me when I was unlovable she said I'm not what I ought to be in peril ous area said I'm not what I ought to be no solo he says and I'm not what I want to be but then I'm not what I used to be when it seemed that no one loved us when it seemed that we were nothing he loved us and how many here wants to be in his hands I believe that should be the desire Jesus to be in the hand of Jesus of our God and allow for him to change us like I mentioned before how many of the Christians that were here now in church were at times past in the world just imagine that love being going from a person that was lost and now you're sitting here and you have now a testimony that you can tell others and to be able to say the Lord love me and by his blood I am now saved maybe we're not the perfect Christian a Christian will always have its mistakes the human aspect in our being is this flesh is not taken away always be prone to make mistakes but we have a way that we can go back to Edition I'm not saying that I'm going to deliberately make a mistake then go back to him so he can forgive me no I'm not saying that it's the Lord forgives you and he cleanses you continue but it's a constant struggle you say and you have to continue fighting to press forward until you reach that last day when we're finally meeting our Lord and being now Justified we have peace now knowing that the Lord is in us and that blood covers Us and there's nothing that can accuse us and we now have the best Advocate upon this Earth I want to go back to that message of living and dying buried Rising in the Bank page nine program 37. this is when something is buried it's then hidden it's out of sight because they're out of his memory our sins are erased from his remembrance I can only remember the story I think it was an elder minister every time he would read the Bible he would just simply rejoice and run all over his house but his uh his daughter was embarrassed was ashamed or embarrassed of him and one time there were some friends from the church that were up from that City that were coming over and she convinced him by making him think that he wouldn't want to be in that Gathering she said Dad if you want you can go up there to the Attic So she plants or her Dad wouldn't be as scandalous she took away his Bible and gave him a book of geography at the time of them Gathering so look they can only hear in the upper part of the house a bunch of amens and Hallelujah and praise God and they were just realized they were just noticing how that sound from up there will come down to the bottom part and the daughter in such a hurry ran to the attic where her father was at possible she said how is it that you're rejoicing if I just only gave you a book of geography and she said sweetie in this book of geography that you gave me this thing is there's it says that there's certain parts of the sea that they haven't able to hit the bottom of the of it yet and me yesterday I read a scripture that says that he sent my sins to the sea of forgetfulness and I'm rejoicing and knowing that no one is able to find my sins that should be such a joy for us Christians maybe because the world can remember our mistake but the Lord cannot remember it he does not remember your flaws he does not remember your mistakes he only knows what you are currently now but we have to continue struggling and fighting to press forward following our Lord because this battle this struggle it has no end this is just merely the beginning and we're not also now reaching the end asking the Lord is each day we can be closer to him we can reach his presence even more and what are even more Blessed Assurance knowing that we have the path laid out that we must repent from our hearts first of all someone has to repent from all their heart this will wrote of their mistake or wherever you are until you know that you entirely from your inner self has been cast out yes and now you have the insurance and you say Lord I don't want to come up from this place until I know that I'm in your presence until I know that you have me in your hand until I know that you are in me until I feel that I won't get up Lord the time goes too quickly and now it's over for me I can only say s that we have received God's grace that when apparently we didn't deserve anything but death it was just he stretched out his hand to us and he brought us out from where we were someone else uh no no one else would have gone for you and I were rewarded where no one else would have paid a penny for us he gave his own life for us and what is more valuable than that and I want to tell the use and especially this salvation is individual or my grandfather they serve here in the church you're Justified and saved not because of that is but it has to be a personal experience for you a personal longing to seek out the Lord so may God help us may we continue to press forward God bless our brother Abraham I knew it was going to be something special [Music] when I saw the announcement that I was going to minister along with him hearing him right now speaking in Spanish hearing him now um in the back before we came I opened up a bit with him and I asked permission to talk about this and he was talking how he was so discouraged of uh how it is here in the U.S companies that the fellowship in love and Revival is not the same here as it is in his country of El Salvador and he's almost in tears telling me this is how is it that the church that he attended when they came here right away they put on the preach and he didn't want to uh instrumentals to play an instrument and he didn't want to uh and he didn't want him it seemed that the devil was attacking and oppressing or weighing down on our brother Abraham [Music] and because of that I grew very fond of him and in my heart I was praying for him more than that I know that he was praying now from these months afterwards when we came back from El Salvador located for me it's so incredible what God can do in a human being the love that he has when he sings to the Lord the joy that he has to learn new instruments and now to be ministering God's words to God's people to continue in the footsteps of his ground and for me and he set the setting tonight and we're just gonna right now just finish it offering as the brother said the title is saved by grace and I want to my my part is I want to go back to the foundation using the same scripture that our brother used in romanoes and Romans 323 English and my notes are in English so I'll switch over to English Romans 3 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God is that you this evening all fallen short of the glory of God and when we were getting ready for this service the brother told me he was going to speak on justification but I think he's preached justification sanctification in the New Birth just now you know brother oh brother ordonius is a very serious man but if you could see from back here the big smile that's on his face as he was listening to her brother Abraham Minister I know that he can tell there's a gift in that young man and I told the brother I'll speak a little bit more towards justification sanctification and the the new birth because he had told me brother I'm only going to speak on justification tonight and I found a quote before he told me that or I found a quote and it says like this and the message once more Lord an old minister went and preached justification at a Revival this is the second night third night fourth night fifth night and then the deacons they called him out and they said to him Reverend don't you know any more than just a sermon on justification he said oh sure I do but let them all get Justified first Jose and then we'll preach on something else that's right and then brother Branham adds on to that oh if you could only get back to that foundation so when I had this cruel and then brother Abraham said I'm just going to speak on justification I said praise God because we ain't got to preach on anything else and this is a youth service so if we can preach on justification if we could preach on sanctification and preach on that new birth maybe we can get a young person somewhere tonight you know and I'm trusting that the young people here this evening know what the what the ABCs are yes but you know it's funny to me because uh I I every time I see brother brothers you know he's so connected into the messages you know he can even finish your sentences as you're preaching what an amazing thing if one day we see our youth come into service so connected they'll be finishing the preacher's sentence so young people I trust you know what your ABCs are this evening always believe Christ when you're in trouble always believe Christ when you're sick always believe Christ when you're in school always believe Christ always believe Christ when everything's going good in your life just always believe Christ in the good and the bad times in the hard times and in the easy times always believe Christ you know I know you've heard it and you've been taught and there's nothing new to you so we're just here to remind you tonight of those ABCs again and we want to just put a little emphasis like our brother just did on justification sanctification and receiving the new birth and why do we want to put a little emphasis on that if you can be honest with yourself tonight and I know we don't have too many youth tonight so maybe God wanted to send this message to the older folks this evening if you're honest with yourself tonight some of us are in justification some of us are in sanctification some of us have received the Holy Ghost so nobody should be embarrassed nobody should be ashamed of the state that you're in this evening it don't matter what state you're in this evening because if everybody had the new birth tonight and we're just waiting on one single Persona well then we're not going anywhere till that one person comes in Jesus Christ is coming for a complete young person might be here tonight yes that's why we're preaching these Friday night services foreign when Samson Was Defeated and blinded and Shackled upon that's exactly where God wanted him because that's where God wanted them to bring them up a little higher he wanted to take them to the next step get them a little closer to God so if you're here justification sanctification or you're born again after today God wants to take you to the next step you're already in the best place that you can be yes you know my ring up almost every day I get messages 35th and Baseline someone was murdered 27th in Dobby and someone was kidding but you know what we have here we're in the best place that we can be physically speaking right here listening to the word of God and spiritually speaking the best place that we can be is be in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be is in in the Book of John 14 17. it says even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him every one of you young people knows him how do you know him whether you want to believe it or not you are a child of God you are predestinated I believe it you need to believe it your mama and daddy believes it you were born you might be wandering in the chicken coop but when that ego hears that mother Eagle it can't help but identify with that sounds they can't identify it can't help but identify with that word identification because it knows him and the verse continues foreign just like when we're baptized that beautiful word that he shall is he shall give you the Holy Ghost it's not now it's in the future but it's a promise that he'll be in you it's great that he's with me it's a great thing he watches over me but I want that seal I want that token I want him to be inside of me it's not enough for the rain to fall on me but I wanted to penetrate deep inside of it I want Christ to live in me that is the Salvation and that is the eternal life in the message confirmation of the commission but Brandon says and and if y'all don't know me by now I don't like to get too deep on things so when brother Brandon says something that don't take much Revelation for me I feel like he's talking just to me but I mean so young people listening I believe the gospel is simple the Bible said it's so simple that a fool shouldn't air is so just all you have to do is remember a b c is you know what it stands for is always believe Christ that's all you have to do since that settles it is ABC and you're fully educated and you're fully educated as far as I'm concerned so young people we all know what the Holy Ghost is very simple the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God that when we receive the spirit of God it's simply the spirit of God living in you it's implemented it's a seal it's a sign it's a covenant and we all have the opportunity to receive that field to be a part of God and that's through a three-step process Believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all the elements of the world and all the desires of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives the new birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel so we want to make it as simple as possible tonight justification is believing sanctification is cleaning and baptism of the Holy Ghost is receiving so justification is believing believe in the good news Gospel of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ died on the cross for me believing and understanding I am a sinner and get it to that point of getting rid of that self-pride that we have where we believe and know that I deserve death but Jesus Christ came on the scene and he died just personally for me you know there was some point in our lives like our brother was saying it was bringing me to tears we heard a message we heard a preaching there was a word of God that spoke to you and it spoke directly to you and that's where that Faith was starting to be born it started to grow inside of you and sometimes we underestimate just how simple faith is the word says faith comes by hearing the word of God you push play Just Hear It You Stream a service just hear it you come to service like tonight just hear it you know your Consciousness might be distracted you're tired you're hungry you're you're bored but your subconscious is catching every bit of word that's being spoken it's like when you're in a classroom or in a seminario and you're bored and tired and you're not even paying attention and then I don't know where the speaker ends and he might say all right now the first 10 people to come to the front I'm going to give them a hundred dollars Something Told me even though I wasn't paying attention oh they're giving out a hundred dollars and I run to the front this is because subconscious was list was hearing that word it wasn't listening it wasn't understanding that's just like it says faith cometh just by hearing the words Peter's like Peterson you know Silver and Gold Have I None he said tonight I don't have a hundred dollars to give you but he said but what I do have I will give that to you and he gave that man his healing how did he give him that healing because they are the light of the world we are the light of the world we are God's Representatives we carry God's power and his authorities because we've got the Holy Ghost Inside of us when the minister says if you want your healing you want salvation come forward you want the New Birth come in this prayer line because it's not the man giving you that if I could give you that I can't give you that I'm better off giving you a hundred dollars but the Holy Ghost in that minister is the one that gives that power it's the one that has that Authority so let's remember how simple it is Faith Comes just by hearing word of God let it build up inside of you it's already built up inside and it'll create an experience it'll take you to the Waters of baptism where you understand I need Jesus Christ in my life and you'll make that public display amongst everyone where you recognize the only path I can be on is the path of Salvation and eternal life because I recognize he's the way the truth in the life but then we enter into sanctification and that is that cleaning yes we've accepted Christ already we've gotten baptized we went into the water with the pitch black heart you know I guess if we couldn't categorize it by numbers [Music] maybe the whole older you are the more sins you carry in that black heart of yours maybe millions or billions of sins that you have he says mental sins physical sins little sins big sins whatever it is when we come out of those Waters we're wiped clean you know that's why you hear so many testimonies that people say I just felt so light when I came out the water I felt so clean I felt so free you know I look at my sister right here I forget your name sister but you know when she got baptized I didn't see mud on her face I didn't see a weighted vest but those shackles that filth that way is the weight of sin that was on our lives when you come out of those Waters you come out like a fresh start white and clean with the heart that no longer has any more sins what then Begins the sanctification process and during this process Satan's going to try and keep you down make you doubt your experience but I want to make it very clear for the young people it don't matter what you've done in your past what you thought what she said what you watched when it says all your sins are forgiven every single sin has been forgiven so when the devil wants to remind you know why don't you try using this just tell them all right devil thank you for reminding me of what I used to do like our brother said I'm not what I want to be but I ain't what I used to be so thank you for reminding me but God already forgave me you don't see me like that no more so therefore you can't make me be there no more your sins are forgiveness it's a great feeling to come out of those Waters with that weight of sin lifted up off of you but the the that that serpent nature is still in that heart it's why it's clean but the producer of sin is still in there no maybe those millions of sins are gone he says but the next day with the fresh start you got one new sin yes and at the end of the week you've got ten new sins a month you've got a hundred new sins but they were wiped clean but I've been baptized yeah but now you're responsible for every new sin you commence but the amazing thing young people is that now that you're a part of this family you have access to the father Lord had a horrible week school was so difficult no I was trying not to use those drugs I was trying not to watch those things I was trying not to fall into those mental places that I get into yeah so but forgive me Lord like our brother said forgive you from what I didn't see anything I didn't see you smoke I didn't see when you thought of those things you're forgivenado and if we can confess our sins but in that momento remember the nature of sin is still in that heart and I'm trying to close forgive me you know like our brother Luis and her brother Victor said last week in that sanctification process it's time to keep on walking it's not about fighting keep on trusting and a little tip for you young people you know all those worldly things that your flesh likes doing you're still gonna like doing them because the nature is still in that heart but we need to fight foreign keep on pushing place keep on coming to church keep putting your sacrifice at the altarification and one day maybe today it's your day with that nature of sin will die but you don't have to struggle with that no more and that serpent nature will be eliminated the nature of God still isn't inside of you the Serpent's gone you're clean it is Blanco but the Dove's not there yet sanctification is cleansing and cleaning of the spirit getting ready for the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what God does through sanctification he takes all the desires of sin out of your heart and then he makes you a candidate for being filled with the Holy ghosts positions could come forward you are now a candidate for being filled with the Holy Ghost and being that you're a candidate means you still don't have it I've been Justified I've been Sanctified I believed but you're in a danger zone foreign you seem like a Christian now but you're still not born again you don't have that Dove nature yet and the devil's going to get back on the job again and again trying for us not to make it to that promised land to receive that Holy Ghost for ourselves but he knows he can't come with those old things I used to like but those fleshly desires they've been taken away from me already so it's a very delicate stage if we're not careful if we're not careful you can be filled with a religious spirit foreign Jesus said that in that day okay will come to me and they'll say Lord have I not done this and that in your name but I didn't even know you know we can be in that state this evening we're not careful we can get caught up in that state but young people do you remember Brandon being asked how long does it take to receive the new birth his response however long it takes for you to fully surrender to the Lord it was a Israelites about 11 days to make it to the promised land but because they couldn't surrender it took him 40 years maybe that's why it's taken you this long foreign you should have had it last week you should have had it a month ago a year ago but remember God has you right where he wants you tonight if you want the new birth tonight you can have it right where you're at if you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight you can have it right where you're at tonight brother says and then Jesus said blessed are ye every one of you say this that when you hunger and users for righteousness you shall be filled the Holy Ghost came for the Sanctified for the Real and True Sanctified Believers so that the signs and wonders could manifest in you is Sanctified vessels so that the Holy Ghost could get into that bow your hands for prayer don't settle for nothing less than an old-fashioned experience of the new birth experience so be born again of the spirit of the Eternal God when your soul and God they unite to but it's when you're ready to die
