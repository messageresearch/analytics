Romans verse 28 to 30. three nine Romanos Romans 8 28 to verse 30. and as you're looking for it I want to thank our pastor for the chance and his confidence he's pleased to me to be able to bring this small thought you should pray for them so everything can go fine for them the scripture says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose hijo para Queens for whom he did for now he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of a son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren yeah moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified now First John 3 9. whosoever is born of God does not come in sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his wording you may be seated Brothers this evening I want to share a little thought or better yet a small testimony about my life and how the Lord has progressively been working I also want to compliment that with a little thought Cristiano which I want to title it the battle of the Christian how many knows that were all in a battle constantly we're battling on a daily basis ever since we get up in the morning throughout the day and in the evening constantly we're in a battle spiritual a spiritual battle a carnal battle [Music] and it's an endless battles spoke to us about the greatest battle ever fought but that great battle it happens Within that war has already ended the second world war has already ended but the the war of the battle of the Christian is one that is Without End until the Christian dies so it's a constant a constant battles so here's a description that I read it speaks about predestination of the children of God and I believe we all are children of God that's why this evening we find ourselves here foreign towns are labeled as a hard place to live but naturally more in the Border towns it's harder to be able to Blossom as a Christian because it's a very hard place that's where I by God's grace that's where I was born and that's where I grew up I come from a family of five siblings five brothers and two sisters he was foreign [Music] so my siblings in average grew up in that environment on the other side of my mom's family my mother was a message believer it was so we would uh be fed by both atmospheres it's just like the children here that learn English and Spanish and they don't know what language lean towards sometimes they speak English sometimes they speak Spanish and that's how we were growing up in two different atmospheres by God's grace and mercy my mother would take us to church and there was a tabernacle there in Nogales that was there and at the age around seven or eight uh we were there attending the church I remember the first time that I saw brother Bernie I was around the age of seven or eight and I believe it was during the time of special services well there was a lot of people there gathered um and I remember that they said all the children up here in the front and I was there and I remember that brother Bernie was preaching and I would see him he you know he was a big man with a very deep voice I didn't see him again until the next time that I came here to the U.S I remember then they played the 20th century Prophet film and I as a child I saw that movie and then I completely forgot as a child but when I came here to the U.S I saw that film again yes so that made me go back to the memory of my childhood and I said I remember seeing that film before and does this uh um the impression that it caused on me now as an adult is that I noticed that children really do catch things and they do learn and they do whole things maybe in that moment they might forget it but when a certain scenario comes up that comes back to your memory is so there we were attending in the Tabernacle that was in Nogales and because a fader I don't know how you might call it the church split it there was a pastor there is brother Bernie was attending to go help the church during that time he said brother Alex burundor the Father the patriarch the the father of the burundas so he can help the the people there so what happened is that the sisters and the majority of the people there they fell in love with brother burunda yeah so I believe that a jealousy came in and because of that I think the church so my mother and I we were the ones that came out of the church and the church lasted a while but after some time it vanished that work there it vanished that building that church building they started using it afterwards as a place where they you can rent movies so I started to think that when things are not from God it's something that just vanishes so we stayed at the church we were left without a church without a pastor yeah and then I started growing and growing up yeah we reach adolescence and then that's when the the struggle as a Christian began [Music] as normally when you get into that age when you reach you know middle school high school that's when you meet the challenges in your life but God's grace the seed was already planted yes and in every step of the way even though I was doing things according to the flesh there was always that inward voice that would tell you not to do those things and but nevertheless the the influence of the world was more stronger in position I started trying new things but I was never a really bad person perverted person trying all these bad things but I was in Dances With Friends and I wasn't really happy doing those things but I just wanted to fit in with the rest of the group just identifying with what they were doing too I remember just because being with my friends I never really liked beer yeah and I could see how they just enjoyed that beer and they would drink it and I wanted to do the same thing is but The Taste was awful and for this I could never manage to get to like it is doesn't matter how much I tried even though I tried really hard I would drink it and drink it again and then my face will get source and I would think how can they light this if the The Taste is just awful okay I just would drink some soda or something and I would still hang out with them and they were just speaking just wild things dirty jokes but I was still there with them by God's grace I never did manage for that to become a liking that I like that smoking the same thing I remember that we would go to high school after we were done with our classes you know there's always someone that has uh there's the sugar it's sneaked in their pocket and I remember that we would go to the back part of the building of the school and we would all get there at like around six or seven of us and supposedly we would start smoking let's start imitating started experimenting and uh and so uh like the word they used here I was a bit bullied even though I was short and my friends were really tall and big it was oh I would bully them and you know I would crack jokes about them and so we would also speak very a lot of curse words I didn't we just all wanted to finish like that we were show-offs big big shots and I remember that I would tell my friends uh some would really smoke and others just like really quickly would take a puff and like uh like they really didn't want to yeah and so I would say like a bunch of stuff and for them to smoke everywhere struggling with that inward Battle of smoking with cigarettes one time when we were done and it was just me and my friend we were heading home and so I was talking to him because his mother had like a little uh Corner place and in that store she would sell cigarettes and my my friend would steal the cigarettes from his mom's foreign have those cigarettes they have the taste of mint is he said yeah I'll go check and I'll bring them tomorrow and I said okay that's fine so that happened he went to his house I went to mine Casa or rather when I was heading home and me something in me happened I asked myself the question why is it that I'm doing this why is it that I'm smoking why am I behaving like this so I promised God that I wouldn't smoke anymore so with that determination I made that decision so the next day when my friend brought those cigarettes and he said look I have the cigarettes here I said um not anymore and he said why I said because he just looked at me he didn't say anything but you know we just kept going with our own thing so that's where I think God began to work in my life like I said Nogales is a tough place to live in there's a lot of crime a lot of drug addiction there's a lot of violence [Music] the area of the colony where I lived in there was around five families that would dedicate themselves to smuggling drugs or trafficking there was around amount of five different gangs there so I grew up in in that environment and by God's grace he took care of me and he delivered me from all that danger that was around me by God's grace we were able to get to know the message my mother was a Believer and my mother has already passed to be with the Lord and she instilled many things in us she would take us to church so there as a child I can remember all the songs that we would sing there yeah now coming here to the U.S I got to Phoenix I was there for 25 years attending Phoenix Tavern that's where I grew up spiritually videos and so the church had a split in Nogales so like I said we were left without a church but the sea was already planted at the age of 19 I came to the U.S my older brother was the one that invited me he asked me he said would you like to come I said I said okay that would be fine but I still had a year left to finish high school first let me finish my school and then I'll get prepared and then we'll do it he said that's fine so that entire year passed I finished with school I got ready either and the first three months were you know they were good because it's something new for me it's a novelty uh but then afterwards I really can't tell something happened in me uh and I truly felt really bad because I was asking myself what am I doing here I can't do anything so I opted to go back again to Nogales when I was going to Nogales I was very happy and glad because truly to be detached from the place where you grew up it's it's Amigos leave behind your family leave behind your friends and to leave behind the neighborhood where you grew up it's something that's very tough so when I made the choice to go back to Nogales I was very happy [Music] and on the other side of my mind I was also saying well I'll take a break I'll get uh reorganized and then I'll try again and come back you see if uh and I did come back he was and I did the same thing I was with my friends hanging out here and there because I knew that I needed God in my heart and I would never be able to prosper doing that uh uh must must spread this puesta and so at this time I came with more determination with the more uh with more predisposition towards something and so I made the choice to permanently come here it wasn't too tough for me because I had a local passport I could come and go by God's grace pero foreign and so the the situation got better got better was my parents above all my mother she was a very special woman foreign spiritual she was concerned with our spiritual well-being my father on the other hand even though he wasn't uh you know he didn't serve God he was very strict with us he wasn't bad he was strict personas he wouldn't let us hang out with certain people to be in a bad company when it was night out like around 10 o'clock he would have to go pick us up to get us to go in home if no if not we would have a bad time so he in his own way his own lighter understanding he also protected us a lot my father still is not a Believer he's 81 and I would like to ask if you can please keep him in your prayers [Music] may you please pray for him so God can perform I believe he's seed that comes from God but that still is not manifested in him yet I believe that the children of God are predestinated I believe that God it doesn't matter where they are sooner or later that seed has to come to Germany sometimes you can see a bad person a person that you might say at that moment that person's a Christian because their life doesn't match up but we truly don't know if they're a child of God the Bible gives us an example of the woman that was at the well yeah she was an ill-fame woman a harlot she was a prostitute and because of her deed she was labeled as an ill-fained woman but what the people didn't know that within her lied that predestinated so when the son of righteousness the Lord Jesus Christ came had contact with her then that seed sprouted so then she started running and you know the rest of the story foreign on the other side we can see the Pharisees the Sadducees and the religious people of that time we can see how on the outside they were very clean and modest [Music] you can appoint anything against them but nevertheless God Christo Christ uh on the inside they were just dry bones just filled with death because we're in a constant battle and struggle I would like to read it on the scripture and galatas it's in the book of Galatians yes he says chapter 5 verse 16 to 25. this is Galatians 5 16 to 25. it says this is this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh is for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would yeah but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under law imanifiest now the works of the flesh are manifests which are these adultery fornication and cleanliness and lasciviousness idology witchcraft hatred variants and relations wrath strife seditions heresies foreign I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God that's the former life is amor but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith [Music] meekness Temperance against such there is no law crucified and they that are Inc that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust foreign something that's why it's it's a constant fight uh but since we have a body is and the Bible speaks of the Gathering that was demon possessed those demons actually do out and lived inside that man you know the story as Jesus came by where he was they used and then when Jesus was going to cast them out they asked they requested that they he cast them into those swines and because the demons have to have a vessel where they can dwell uh that's why by God's grace we've been able to know this message it's a real message a message that was bought that was brought by God's very own presence with signs and wonders a Vindicated message and by God's grace we've embraced it and we're living it now [Music] currently right now and the planet is around six to eight billion of humans living here billions with the B and consists due to so many people that there is in the world and we're just being a handful of the brothers uh we had the privilege to be able to embrace this message there's many that won't be able to get to know it or neither will they accept it by God's grace you see how there's Wars [Music] our heads that way we can also thank God for everything that he has done for us if the musicians can come forward let's bar our heads our heavenly father once again we thank you because you've been good to us Lord you died at the cross you gave yourself for US foreign and I'm praying for our brothers that are in El Salvador may you be with them may they do whatever they have to do may you bring them back safe and sound we put all this in
