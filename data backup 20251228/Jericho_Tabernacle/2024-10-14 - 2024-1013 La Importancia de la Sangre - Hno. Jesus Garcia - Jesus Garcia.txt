sister L as you can see just how fragile we are and as you Brethren she was doing something at her home perhaps it was cleaning and she felt a pain in her left side of the next to her shoulder it wouldn't allow her to breathe her properly that the Lord May touch her praise be the name of Lord Jesus Christ and a brother said yesterday and brother asked for three and he said three and he asked for three because with that he will be a great soup we're asking of squirrels you all know them right small animals creatures with three he can probably make a a and I wanted one there it appeared and he shot it and I want another one there and it appeared and he shot it and I wanted the last one there and he shot it because there was a squirrel and he touched them and it was bleeding and there was

hospital for the surgical operation yes he had everything ready and already been there before you already know where the tumor was they were just about to per surgery to remove that tumor but brother Brenham said that before the doctor touched her that you may heal my wife and regardless he still went to the hospital and the woman sister met ready and they brought her into just as the uh surgeons were about to perform the surgy there were no there were no signs of the tumor because brother said that it grew to the size of an apple and it wasn't there anymore and so what day are we living in

can make that light disappear from my truck whatever what happened to that engine now you can do it and just head home there was no more lights and it has no longer turned on the faith that I have in the Lord that is the faith that I have in the Lord in 70 years I have only been to the hospital once I arrived from Mexico with a infection in my stomach but since then I have not stepped into a

this morning may the sick be healed and may the demons run away and may we feel free this morning to announce the gospel in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen let's go to the word of God uh Hebrews 10 chapter4 when you have it you can say Amen says for the law having a shadow it's not just a shadow for there to be a shadow there has to be light so that it can reflect the shadow am amen it's not going to reflect another Shadow it will reflect only at the moment that I Lay My Hand it's reflecting my hand is not reflecting the hand of a CH but my own hand amen amen and the Apostle Paul he writes for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make perfect make the comers there unto perfect for then would they not have [Music] ceased to be offered because uh those that offer this being purged once because that the worshippers once per but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should not take away sin now Hebrews 9 verse [Music] 11 but Christ being present and how many believe Christ's presence being becoming a high priest good things to come by a greater more perfect Tac not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and Cales or calves but by his own blood hallelujah amen he entered one wants into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of inher sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh hallelujah how much more amen we're in a in a safe place how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead works for what to serve the Living God may God add his blessing may the Lord bless us this morning and may he be glorified we may be seated we know that all the promises are in the promised land the promised land for us is the Holy Ghost a moment ago Brother Juan was speaking about the spoken word God's Prophet said the spoken word is the Original Seed when Jesus came to the half part of the Bible Jesus did not come outside of the Bible Jesus never came outside of the word the religious people began to tell Jesus you being a man make yourself God Jesus only answered one thing he said search ye the scriptures because from Genesis to Malachi they spoke of me amen Brothers all the prophets spoke of me all the Patriarchs all types and shadows spoke of me amen Brothers I am the Tabernacle I am the Lamb of God I am the one that purges all sin amen Brothers the Lord Jesus said I am the Tabernacle amen Brothers they knew what a tabernacle was they knew the Tabernacle that Moses built amen they knew about the courts they knew the holy place and the holy of holies amen but you know [Music] what the true Tabernacle was now before [Music] that was only a shadow back then amen but the true Tabernacle was in front of those men Jesus Christ amen I am the prophet said that's where they clashed now he was out of the word when he said this Tabernacle is I he he was not lying he was the true Tabernacle now look Brothers my subject for this morning is the importance of the blood the prophet of God God said without the blood we're lost without the blood there's no Rapture without the blood there's no salvation without the blood there's no reconciliation only the blood can appease God's Wrath amen Brothers we see that when Cain brought he made an altar amen and he brought forth the best of this [Music] Earth and he put it before that offering amen he was thinking by Nature that it would be pleasing to God but now we can see that there was no blood there there was no rec ilation that was done he was lost amen and brothers only it it only looked beautiful amen it looked like a denomination just a bunch of yelling but there was no redemption in it there was no forgiveness of sins but when it came from amen he brought something perfect to God he brought something true he brought a lamb abble put it on the Altar and the prophet of God says that he took that a sharp Stone and he began to strike the lamb the scene was very ugly for for Mankind's eyes amen it looked something degraded but for God it was something beautiful amen and we see that there was Redemption done there there was forgiveness there there was Revelation on Abel's behalf amen now notice when those wise men we're being led by the star how many are being led by a star we're being led by a star amen but many times we we start to be we start to follow the star and that that star will always lead to Jesus that star that appeared to the wise men were was leading them to the right thing to the very image it was no longer now Shadow but now it was to a birth and this star is leading us to a birth amen we're in that now we're in that now we're being led by a star and a prophet of God said that a star it represents a messenger a prophet we're being led by God's Prophet but many times he says that those men that that star it appeared because God was on the earth amen God was already here on the earth for that reason that's why the star appeared but once they came into Jerusalem amen when you get wrapped up in your thoughts and then you turn your back to God's word you turn your back on the message what I think is better than what the prophet thinks then that star disappeared when they their feet touched Jerusalem a type of denomination where there were so many churches there that star was no longer when you dive into your own thinking then the star will disappear from you you'll be led by your own intellect but brother God's Prophet says that those wise men they thought when they reached Jerusalem they would at Jerusalem would be feasting and rejoicing because the king of King was not born on the Earth but we find out they were they were not aware what happened they arrived asking where is he King of the Jews where is he that is Born the one that we waited for so long amen Brothers uh but they didn't know Herod didn't know everything was confused amen but we see once they got out of Jerusalem the SAR reappeared hallelujah amen praise God Brothers now notice and in the [Music] message in the message God does not change his way of thinking when word the prophet of God say if that's how it was in the beginning that's how it has to be today am amen we were with God since before the foundation of the world how many believe that you have to see yourself in every scripture once one time the Lord told job he says he said job G yourself about in your loins because I will ask you something I will ask you something where were you Jo when I was shaping the the heavens and the Earth amen the prophet says that means that job was found in some place even when job was not born here in this flesh so then if God is asking him where were you that means that he once was somewhere else amen amen we were once in the mind of God the prophet of God says the prophet says that Moses wrote Genesis exus Deuteronomy and numbers but he did not live in that time but he was the prophet of God Amen he had a wider Vision than the people he could see things that he didn't see in his lifetime he saw but God would show it to him nevertheless in Genesis chapter 1 he began to say God created the heavens and the Earth amen but we now we see another prophet of God John the Baptist with a wider Vision amen and John began to say that in the beginning was the word amen and the Word was God amen amen and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen but today currently we have a prophet that had a wider Vision amen and he said that we were in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world everyone everyone saw from the foundation up to here but this Prophet an Vision could take us Way Beyond time when there was no time in eternity Brothers praise the Lord now notice I I want to focus more on the subject the prophet of God says he says now the most important chapter for us for the Bride of the Lord for the end time the most important or outstanding chapter could be John 3:16 amen God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life but did you know there's even a more important Revelations chapter 5 did you know if he would not have come to claim and take the book and break the seals then you and I would be lost it would it would do us no good to be here everything would be in vain amen now notice we see that Revelation 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 speak of the seven Church ages amen but we see that chapter four speaks of a Rapture amen it speaks of a voice that John raptured and he said come up amen and the prophet of God said that's the bride's chapter that chapter four is for the bride but in chapter five it speaks of a it speaks of an atonement or a it speaks of a claim being made we see that in chapter five a voice is heard who is worthy Amen to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof amen now no the prophet of God says if that book was never taken by the King of Kings the Lord of lords everything would have been lost amen amen Brothers it says that no one was worthy not in heaven or in Earth neither Gabriel neither Michael Nor the cherubin nor the archangels nor seraphim none was worthy it says in Earth NE neither Adam neither Enoch nor Noah neither Jeremiah neither Moses not even John the Baptist because if there was none Worthy on the earth is because these were mere mortals amen nor beneath the Earth not even sat or his demons nor his spirits were worthy and it says that John began to weep but why was John weeping in the message the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven paragraph 166 now look what the prophet of God says he says but John wept the prophet of God says here's what I think he wept for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption that's something tremendous if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost amen now I ask you would John be lost he would have been amen amen if God would not have come who would then claim the book who would open it and and break the seal John and all of us in this morning we would be lost but thank God that God stood in the breach put one foot on the earth one foot on the sea and he said time shall be more one moment then thank God for that he sent us a prophet that stood in the prach and could say he said just one moment I still have some of your [Music] children that have not yet come just wait a moment Lord and here we are this morning to give him all glory all praise all honor praise the Lord amen now John knew his his name was there that's the best thing that could have happened to John amen that's the best that could have happened to John that his name that he knew his name was written in the L's Book of Life Brothers when you realize that your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life there is no there's no trial sickness sorrow there's nothing [Music] that can discourage you you'll just keep looking at your name you see your name now hallelujah praise God let's go to the P Vision paragraph 184 Hallelujah the P Vision paragraph 184 the prophet of God says he says what did he do he he's asking a question says the wrath of God was upon us for being Sinners he says is that right no one could save himself there's nothing we could do we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and what did he do he came to the Earth Hallelujah and he tread the wine press all the WRA of almighty [Music] God was poured out upon Him Thou Art Worthy oh Lamb of God for you were slain taking the sins of the world upon him and he bore our sin that God poured out the fierceness of of his wrath upon Him brother just one moment look when Adam and Eve committed the sin back there in the beginning amen they were lost but God knew that they were his people they were his children amen and the Bible said the word says that he killed a lamb say before the foundation of the world Amen and we see that that lamb he took off his skin hallelujah amen he took off the bloody skin that was on that lamb before his children left the Garden of Eden amen and brothers so that they can have an assurance that that they one day would come back into Eden he was not he was not going to leave them without leaving without the Royal garment he took away the Garment ments and he put it on Adam and Eve amen and then Adam and Eve began to get out of Eternity [Music] amen and maybe Adam the prophet said he had the vision the prophet of God did he knew what happened back then praise God amen that's the value that we have of a true prophet and he could say to his beloved wife he says uh sweetie don't worry don't worry sweetie one of these days we will come back we'll come back into eternity again now you the Beloved of the Lord you the Beloved of the Lord don't worry we're now coming back we're now coming back this word is bringing us back this word is reminding us where we come from and where we're going one of these days we'll find ourselves at those tables that have already been set of 1500 miles that they've already rehearsed the Vans everything is now set to receive his beloved amen don't worry just keep groaning keep praying keep consecrating yourself to the Lord it doesn't matter if they turn their back on your own there's a God that is dressing you of all the armor and righteousness now we know at any moment this drama can come to an end and we will go into that theophany praise God we'll go into that theop the prophet said that theophany is not so far it's here hallelujah praise God that's why the prophet of God said he speaks of a woman that was in a service like we are this morning and as the prophet was speaking of the great promises for our life that woman was so rejoicing amen she was burning up inside and that woman began to feel something inside her it was the Holy Ghost it was her own theop amen and as the prophet of God was coming out she followed him and she said brother brandham I was feeling such a strong Joy when you were [Music] preaching that the joy was so strong that I wanted to go out running and go through the [Music] wallu amen and the prophet of God said you should have done it you should have done it Brothers whenever you feel something just speak the word when you speak the word then Satan the enemy is left paralyzed and the word begins to create an atmosphere when he when God said in the beginning let there be lights the prophet said it began to wh until that word made contact hallelujah how precious is the Lord hallelujah let's continue paragraph 185 he says someday those brass feet of Justice glor Glory when he comes as judge he'll tread the Antichrist and all his enemies Hallelujah the prophet says he'll walk through Earth with a rod of iron in his hand amen amen oh repent sinner friend while you got a chance to repent try put it off and thinks it's just a little story that won't happen it will happen he [Music] says it just couldn't happen to me it will happen to you feet of brass tread down his enemies because he suffered and tread out the wine press of the fierceness of God to pay for our sins then we are guilty poor miserable worms as we are stick out our little nose up and read some kind of athetic book and try to think there's no God and say there's nothing like this and judgment can't come he'll take those brass feet and Crush out his enemy he'll wait over the Antichrist he'll take those apostate churches and sling them into eternity Yonder Yonder somewhere into a consuming fire where she'll be consumed and done away with and he will reign on Earth him and his church forever he says how precious is our God that's the God we're trusting in this morning let's remain in God's love it's not yet late for the unbeliever but for us we're in the evening time we're in when the Lord Jesus Christ with the dead in Christ shall rise first did you know that we're now in that time that's why the prophet wish to live in this time amen we're in the resurrection time we're in the time of the transformation of our bodies we're in the Rapture time then get ready Let's uh let's get prepared and not miss the step for the Lord is near did you know Brothers the Apostle Paul [Music] only in chapter 15 in the book of First Corinthians the prophet of God says that he emphasized even more on the resurrection of Jesus than on the death of Jesus Christ and now why we see that if he died amen and he suffered and carried all our sin as it says in Isaiah 53 all of our suffering he took upon him all our sorrow amen but did you [Music] know that if there was not a resurrection then all of that would have been pointless amen if there would not have been a resurrection then all that would have been pointless that is why those two walking to a were sad and uh inconsolable amen speaking of the things that had happened amen but we see Mary Magdalene praise God that she knew am amen that he had risen do you know who Mary Magdalene was a woman that had seven demons amen brothers that's how we were in the world that's how we were lost without hope and uh uh peace the prophet of God say she had the worst of demons once she was set free she could see the resurrection of Jesus we have been set free of all those Spirits we're waiting to see the resurrection let's go to First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 15 I'm about to close uh uh 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 12 to verse 19 can we read it it says like this the entire chapter 15 all that the Apostle Paul could speak and say was of the resurrection of Jesus now look at what he says he says now if Christ now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among [Music] you that there is no resurrection of the Dead for if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen tremendous how tremendous amen and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain it's in vain to be here and your faith is also vain amen amen yay and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God [Music] that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable how tremendous if Christ be not risen from among the Dead then our beloved ones that are in the grave are lost along with us amen Brothers but we thank God that one day like today in the morning amen two women went to the grave and they could only find the Linens and an angel was only there was waiting there to give them the message the angel was waiting for those two women and said whom seek ye whom seek ye for he has risen he has risen and in this morning he is here present Among Us that's why any disease any problem is resolved when we're under the blood everything is made perfect that's why brother Bram said to his sister speak the [Music] word ask ask he said because she was in the right place he was speaking about the squirrels amen and the prophet said those uh squirrels were not a vision he says I ate them amen he said you cannot eat a vision amen and what was it the resurrection of those two young boys a spiritual Resurrection because they were mocking him in the message mother days I'll close with this if we can please stand preached on May the 10th of 1959 paragraph 52 the prophet says the prophet of God said the musicians can come I felt like I was at home at the very beginning I was very nervous but the Lord he he gave me liberty the lord loves us so much he still loves it will love us for all [Music] eternity someone told the prophet You Preach too much on the resurrection You Preach too much on the resurrection most every message has got something about the resurrection why sure it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not rise again from the dead then all of it was in vain it to me proves that he was [Music] God proves every claim he made the resurrection and it also is the place of resting of the [Music] Soul it's the starting point is the crowning of our consolation and when we see that he rose from the dead it places us with the gospel armor at the Battlefront to take take the place to fight for we know he said he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it again and I think it's the great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection and its Divine promises and the consolation that it gives to those who are trusting in [Music] it for it promises the great Union of our uniting together [Music] again it promises and the fading away of all [Music] sin it promises the fading away of all deformity all the sufferings that we have did in this had to go through with in this life it [Music] promises and the vanishing of its all it promises that even death will lose its hold and will rise in the likeness of Jesus so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises in the things of the scripture there is where it sealed it and the last [Music] Easter when I was preaching on the five things of living he loved me dying he saved me [Music] buried he carried my sins far away but Rising he justified freely forever that's the day for me Isn't that the day for you that's the day for me that great day of days and to see what it what it'll mean to all of us in the resurrection as we labor and wait for that blessed day day of days how many are waiting for that day every tear will be wiped away every tear will no longer be of Sorrow of loneliness of persecution of pain but rather will be tears of [Music] joy as we see each other in that table of Eternity as we see each other hugging each other stretching our hands of Fellowship once again we'll go back to Eden once again we'll come back to True Fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ we wait for that great day of days we wait can someone raise their hands beloved God Eternal Father what great day shall that day be when our gray hair shall Fade Away we will longer feel tired in our bodies our wrinkles will no longer be there and father old age will vanish there will no longer be death in that place there will no longer be diseases there won't be hospitals there won't be funerals being held there only be Joy there will only be peace there only be Harmony eternal life will only go into there perfect love perfect love that's what we're lining up to to go in there beloved God
