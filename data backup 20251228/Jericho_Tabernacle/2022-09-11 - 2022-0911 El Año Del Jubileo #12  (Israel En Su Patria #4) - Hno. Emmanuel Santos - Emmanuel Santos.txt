[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen amen it's like we're standing we can go to the book of joshua el capitolo says the sixth chapter starting from the first verse i'm going to read all the way to the ninth mendica [Music] the word of god says now jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in the lord joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho in the king thereof and the mighty men of valor city and yeah men of war go around about the city once thou shall thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram horns on the seventh day you should come past the city seven times and the prey shall blow with the trumpets it should come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him jose is [Music] the priest and said unto him take up the ark of covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram horns before the ark of the lord and let him let his arm pass before the ark of the lord it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bring the seven trepid rammed horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the and the reward came after the ark and the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets that's opening up more and more a quote a message of paradox joshua here is a book actually it's a book of redemption because redemption has two parts it takes two parts to make a redemption out of in 2. moses represented the law which brought them out of egypt and whereas joshua represented grace that took him into the promised land aspects diferentes otherwise the law and grace were two different aspects of god's command now with through moses took them out and joshua brought him in as we read the gates of this city las puertas but god gave them a way to opposition to open them up see the message is in the bible many people fail in tomorrow and taking what brother branham says and applying it through the whole bible what happened with joshua it also happened to us there were six days that they had to go out around the city but on the seventh day seven times they went around the city now those gates of those cities were sealed for work if you read the book of joshua it's uh it's a massacre it's a massacre what he did with everybody there why is joshua that tough for that rood you have to see the type and what joshua's doing jesus is a type of cro of jesus because first of all first she heard the trumpet not of the seven and she said unto them i know the lord hath given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites of jordan they were on the other side of jordan and og who we utterly destroyed entonces the ones who lived in jericho just like rehab they heard lo quedios of what god has done that's why it's necessary to preach the gospel rahab's attitude and verse 11 says and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt in now therefore i pray i swear it unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you should also show kindness onto my father's house and and it shall be when the lord has given us the land that it will deal kindly and truly with thee entonces so rahab heard the trumpet of the gospel and the reason for that regardless if she was a sinner she made a or open jehovah's savior so does jesus mean jehovah's savior when joshua was before the walls of jericho jesus it is a type of jesus josue joshua was true to the token sign that his messengers had preached so will jesus be true to the token sign that his messengers preach when he comes all under it was saved in egypt all under it was saved in jericho we found out the lamb's blood was the type of jesus christ movie in all right in hebrews 13. we find this and it's called their el pacto eterno the everlasting covenant so when rahab asked mercy to be shown upon her el sombras the man gave her a sign and that token is a type of the blood it's a covenant that she made with these men that's why the blood of jesus christ is it is but the blood now is an everlasting covenant the blood of jesus christ is a type of us in our contaminated condition we hear that message gives us life and the seven priests shall bear before they are there are seven trumpets of ram horns and the seventh day you should compass the city seven times this has a lot to do with what happened with brother branham we see the message is throughout the whole bible one key that the prophet has given us the revelation of god what happened with i used to think that brother ramos raptured on the 28th of february the brown was not even in arizona when that happened in fact he preached the message the absolute in tejas in texas had legal problems with his son now there's also a controversy or the majority but there's a doubt that exists whether it was the 7th or the 8th of march and i asked myself what is it why can't we have a exact date of jesus in matthew 17 1. jesus after six days jesus takes peter james and john his brother and bringing them up into a high mountain apart in marcos and mark 9 2 it speaks after six days jesus said to him peter james and john and lead them up into a high mountain part by themselves so matthew and mark speak that it was six days yes after the six days but luke 9 28. diaz it says it came to pass about eight days after these things he took peter james and john's into a mountain to pray went to the mount transfiguration about six eight days after representation so what does those men represent in the six days now there is another book of redemption in apocalypse in revelations 5 6. remember that john saw a book with seven seals but no one was ready to take up the book neither but to use the horn as a trumpet primero tienes que matar al animal first you have to kill that animal jesus and so then jesus was killed el cordero so here the the lamb in molado it seems to be sent forth onto all the earth you see the parallel between joshua and jesus josue joshua hombres seven men seven horns jesus jesus the lamb seven is because your name is on that book jesus is cordero now jesus is this lamb el es el carnero it is the realm [Music] and he was born under the ram aries jesus that's why jesus had been born in march in april like brother branham because it's zodiac signs and seven eyes joshua headstone and in this stone alone it is before joshua is not the same joshua before to restore the faith now this joshua is a high priest jesus just like the high priest jesus took the book for they who have despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zuribel the bridge between the seven church ages and the seven seals the prophet says seven horns with the seven church agencies because that was the lamb's protection while he protected his rights here on earth what he protected see los cuernos en el cordero [Music] i differentiate there are different ranks there are different levels of prophets says a preacher the testament of the new testament is categorized as a prophet but they're not on the same level that's why it says here prophets we say este cordero tiene si te cuernos here this lamb has seven horns and every horn has had an eye ojos seven eyes what is this christo is christ and his bride la sita so the last one he took the book of the right hand of him that set upon the throne who was it if you don't tie it with the whole bible then it's not right and it was on the seventh day pandora and they could pass a city in the same manner seven times only on that day they can pass the city seven times and i came to the past the seventh time when the priest blew the trumpets joshua unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city they went around seven it says the lord hath given them the city application remember the constellation of the vision of the angels when i left here to go to arizona remember what time it is sirs notice there was only one great burst of thunder yeah they went around one time on the seventh day they went around seven times six church ages there was only one messenger pablo paul arenas martin martin colombo columbus luther just like joshua do you see the parallel you that was according to the purpose of him who would work with all things after the council of his own will that we should be in the praise of his glory nosotros [Music] now we are that [Music] jesus christ taking possession of the book now when he's in his meditorial work back there album redeeming but some days come come forth to get his book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book will be him for that's the believer you are that book because your name is there you know literally now it's not a literal book it's a book it's a word that's incarnated there's like a lot of things that were said as jesus and the reign of jesus when he got there to the land it was the word incarnated just like you have to be the word incarnated is whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb you to surrender what he has he obtained illegally so he has no right for this possession but regardless it's in his hands is going to do a massacre what legally belongs to him this whole world belongs to him but [Music] and showed them all the kingdoms of the world the devil wanted to give it to him because jesus had to pay legally a price to obtain them he rejected the free offer diablo of the devil i will pay a price for it just like jesus paid a price for you but you're in the devil's hands but the day will come all the names of that book even though they're illegally in the possession of the devil's hands [Music] you belong to jesus wants worldwide is your life the day will come jesus will take legal possession of you you belong to him our kinsmen back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land um let me know what that is someone that comes land with adam and eve he did it illegally but god is not an illegal god he has a law yes is that's why even in the resurrection the 16 elements are required for you to go into the resurrection redeemed attribute de la tierra of the land this is this land belongs to god but he is a poacher um i could say something right here right now but i better not it is the title of our redemption it's the title it all he gives it back to the people don't want to give it right he doesn't want to give it up real quick we find out later in the scriptures i'm taking over here on another chapter he himself in his ministry he went around the world seven times in the message standing in the gap there will be a lot of things that will be misconstrued six ages every messenger has luther never organized it it was after luther wesley and then wesley came forth it is placed at wesley and after wesley iglesia wesleyan then they got the west wesleyan church logo juan smith and then after came john smith bautista the baptist alejandro campbell then alexander campbell et cetera and so forth but the man formed the reformers they didn't live long enough to get it all together and so a lot of loose ends are left so when when it took possession of all the kingdoms that were in the moon there was hell that came from him from the heavens so when jesus comes there's a sword that comes forward from his mouth and he's going to use that sword talked about guards of armies they were around those seven men in joshua six nine it says and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the reward came after the ark so there was an army that was before i talk about the different armies that israel had verse 14 it says in the first place when the standard of the camp of the children of judah according to their armies the first one that always marched marching and then the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forward is to understand this let's notice what brother brandon says now if we find in the studying of the revelation of the churches that one of them uh one of those creatures was a lion and the other one was a lion one would one the other was an ox and the other one was an ego ayamos de la in the wilderness i won't have time to go into it how would you jot it out here and they just showed just exactly they were watching over this el a tribal emblem which was a 4-12 tribe set cuatro catalado a catalan four on each side or three tribes on each side and the four beasts said and watch these tribes from all four ways and we see went to the gospels and we show it exactly on earth which was the holy spirit the blood had sent back to us the holy ghost and the four beasts represented the twelve tribes of israel there's 12 tribes [Music] on a watch what are four guards but if you see those guards the first one that goes is judah esta represented that represents the banner in the east because it's like it's like a time time piece a watch the key but yeah it goes from to the east to the south pores that's why it's like a timepiece because three tribes are appointed on the east threshes [Music] when israel was returned back to their homeland says the message of the beast and the soul of god if you want to see what day of the month it is see in the season that's the coming of the lord is prophet believers who want for you to reveal themselves you reveal yourself to them we ask you lord as eaglets may they eat the message of the bible lord preparation to prepare one day to have the strength so we are delighted to go up to to the air confederator with rapturing faith to go with you and then we should go to our homeland and through millennium to our millennium the pediments the name of jesus christ amen [Music] [Music] you [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]

potluck after the service everyone is currently invited rodriguez gracias adios [Applause] rodriguez family are thanking the lord because the interview brother aurelio leyva was a success pedro rodriguez jesus rivas rosario baja pedro rodriguez is asking for prayer for brother jesus from rosarito baja california mexico his son has been struggling has been said that uh if i can share with you espionage it's a little bit quick first corinthians 13 1 to 10 is like this though i speak with tongues of men and angels i have no charity i am become a sounding brass or a timbling symbol and though i have a gift of prophecy and understanding and the mysteries and all knowledge and and thought i have the faith so that i could remove mountains and have no charity i'm nothing and though i bestow on my good feet and excuse me and though i bestowed on my good and feet and poor and feed the pores and i thought i'd give my body to be burned i have no charity it profited me nothing sherry suffered long and it's kind surely envy not surely bounded not itself is not puff up does not behave on itself unseemly seek it not her own is not easily provoked thinking no evil rejoices not in iniquity by rejoicing in the truth bear all things believing all things hope all things enjoy all things sharing never fail but wherever they will be prophecy they shall fail whether they be tongue they shall cease wherever their knowledge it shall banish away for we know in part and we profit in part but when they but when the which is perfect is come they will impart shall be done away is i give unto you that uh that ye love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another but this shall all men know that you are my disciples and yeah yeah have love one to another you'll be so kind to stem [Music] we all know that you use a basil para podernos to be able to speak to us a [Music] we all know that without this element we won't be able to make it anyway glory all know [Music] and
