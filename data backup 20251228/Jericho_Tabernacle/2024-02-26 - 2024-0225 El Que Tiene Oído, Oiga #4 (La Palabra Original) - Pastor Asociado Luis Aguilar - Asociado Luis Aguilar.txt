let you rest Matthew 11 come unto me said the Lord and to learn that I am weak and humble and that is where we're supposed to a Meek and humble so that the Lord May descend and touch us he wants to

out there so let us keep them in prayer likewise for our pastor that God could give them his complete healing Amen in Genesis 13 Genesis 1:3 and God said let there be light and there was light now let's go to verse [Music] 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after His Kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was [Music] s and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good amen let us bow our heads Brothers Lord heavely father we're so happy with you Lord the life that you've given us for opening those doors once again to hear your word [Music] Lord now Lord open our spiritual understanding open our hearts Lord to be able to receive your word Lord give us what we need Lord Lord may it be you that's passing through this church we subject every contrary Spirit to your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen before you be seated brother I why don't you greet your brothers next to you God bless you give him a smile bless your brother feel free to greet your brother and your sister once you do so you may be seated amen it's so good to give a smile to your brother or your sister that gives him a message that you've got God in your heart and that you love God am amen Brothers love many times we want to pray for the person for them to be healed those evil spirits to come out of them so they be not troubled but then when you greet your brother you give them a smile you give them a hug that's how you get the demons out with love with love amen this morning we're going to continue the theme that we've been carrying about this will be message number four and as a subtitle it will be the original word Amen brother brandom it's so tremendous what the prophet has brought us and everything that I'm speaking on I'm getting it out of the message the spoken word is the Original Seed and when I start to hear that message many times it really shook me up and I said that's so important what the prophet brought because the spoken word is the Original Seed so then we see that in Genesis and we see there that every seed bring forth of its own kind the tree the Tomato the avocado those are seeds but the Original Seed is the spoken word so when God formed the heavens and the Earth he didn't grab from another planet a portion to form the the Earth here he didn't take a certain Ray or a certain star to form the light he said let there be light the spoken word is the Original Seed he took it from nothing he didn't take this part to form just like us like this wood it came from a sea a tree someone cut it down went to the store they purchased it and created this Pulpit now men human beings created this by from something that was already created but God he didn't have anything to grab and form something he simply just spoke The Original Seed amen the prophet says do you know everything you see tonight is God's word materialized do you know that your word that your body is God's word materialized do you know them being there is God's word materialized do you know that concrete is God's spoken word materialized you know this whole earth is God spoke and said that it be materialized he spoke and said let there be and he believed his own word and the word and the Earth came into existence if it didn't where did it come from will you say it come off the sun well and who spoke the sun into existence see everything is God's word the worlds were framed by the word of God the Bible said so God spoke it and he believed in his own word and there it was now God has spoken of his word just believe him and Watch What Happens no now when he speaks something this is his word initially first any other word that's contrary to this is not God's word it has come from the Bible so then the spoken word of God it's original all that God created he spoke it and it's original what's the original has life and it comes again because the original has life now when you see a horse and you see a donke these are original seeds uh the if the horse dies there's more horses but when a horse and a donkey they mix that produces a mule when that meal dies it doesn't reproduce because it's not an original seed the prophet tells us like this so then with the birth that we've got the birth that you've got when you came from your mother and your father that's death amen Brothers how many have heard that that your birth through sex it's death so then when Jesus came and the angel came to the Virgin Mary she heard what the the angel spoke to the Virgin Mary forgive me the the Virgin Mary heard what the angel told the angel is a messenger brought her the message she heard the message said the holy spirit will make a Shadow upon you so she heard she accepted and now the Holy Spirit was in her the prophet tells us it was without a sensation no sensation between man and woman so when the birth came he just heard the he accepted but there was no sexual sensation in her that's why that Doctrine moves that you've got to cry but we'll get to that the prophet also says I don't believe in a in a dry-eyed repentance when you accept the Lord you recognize it's a sin you can't take it shout and cry Supernatural is touching your being the prophet tells us I don't have this quote on the screen now when a man is born he's born with the spirit of this world the prophet says so and the message questions and answers on Hebrews chapter when a man is born he's born with the spirit of this world that's why he has to be born again this Spirit comes from the mother and father's conception which was sexual conception and the absolute could live forever so he has to be born again now that's a birth now the prophet tells us we have to because all of these have been reproduced this seed of God's spoken word has not been reproduced until the Lord Jesus Christ came by the spoken word Prophet says we read this the last time in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed all the sons of God should be the same yes sir born of the word and the spirit this brings us again to to the spoken word when you're born of the water and the spirit like John chapter 3 to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do it brings you right back into the place where you should have been at the beginning that's the reason of Christ's death brings us right back where sons of God by the word and the spirit of God now we're born of the spoken word the prophet also says this brings us back to the spoken word so we this the word of God made manifest and that's what we want for us to be sons of God the way to be sons of God is how you're born in your family you're the son of your father and of your mother the only way to be a Son of God is when you're born again by the word and of the spirit but many the prophet tells us inor you say in Spanish uh incub you stay in an incubator was glad to know that you're awake I didn't expect to many answers and they just stay there there's no life but I hope you're following me because we're getting to something the prophet says every seed must come after its kind in English uses the word kind every seed according to its kind Mankind and there's the word mankind which is the human race the prophet says God made Man In His Image after his kind to be his word on Earth that's God's original purp when he created Adam to be the God not of heaven but of the earth that was his purpose but it all got out of order death came in and it wasn't until the Lord Jesus Christ came to restore with the first Adam to bring us in fellowship with God now we can be sons of God gods of this Earth he expressed it in Jesus Christ what was it God was in Christ that's a man after his kind when God which is the word how many knows he was the word when the word was in Christ a man a human man expressing itself through him that was God in word in Christ expressing itself and God in the beginning made man in his own image and that's the kind of man that God makes today Seminary and the schools and incubators hat turns out a bunch of hybrids but when God calls a man makes him in his own image the word Made Alive in him that's right there he is that's God's man in his own image and very likeness Jesus he'll do the works that I do so God made man in his own image after his kind his kind what is his kind the word is the word then if a man denies God's word how can he be in God's image just ask the question ask yourself how can you be in God's image and deny God's word when the word is expressed image of himself amen amen are you awake brothers let's go to Matthew chapter 11 we want to go a little quickly because I want to get to a certain point Matthew 11 verse one here's where the Lord's talking about John the Baptist Matthew 111 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end commandment commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou the he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind will receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them now verse 11 verely I say unto you among them that are born of women hath no one risen greater than John the Baptist so the Lord's telling us amongst women none has risen greater than John the Baptist that was a clean man a man that God chose before the foundation of the world but it says but notwithstanding he that is the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he I'll say it again that's the Lord Jesus Christ speaking none greater than John the Baptist has risen but he is that the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he that's why the Apostle Paul would say I'm the least because I persecuted the church and that should be our mentality that I'm the least of the Kingdom of Heaven I I don't want to be seated at the table if I could just be a rug the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he verse 13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John now the Lord Jesus Christ is telling the people and if he will receive it this is Elias which was for to come he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear the Lord is telling the people the disciples there this is that Elias that is to come now he was not literal but he was anointed by the spirit of el the prophet says that John the B he just preached the word but he didn't have Miracles but when the Lord Jesus Christ came now the Miracles did come Billy Graham that's why brother Bram says Billy Graham he was anointed by the spirit of John the Baptist Billy Graham didn't have miracles in his ministry he just preached the word he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear this day if there's been an Elias and if you want to receive he is that Elias that is to come there's a purpose why Elias com a purpose there's seven Church ages Church ages the first church it started in the year 33 but as the church started to go along and run it started to fall The Original Seed it started to burst the leaves started to come out the stump and the the branches but with time it started fall amen Brothers the prophet says when we see the Holy Spirit come to the church and it starts to discern the heart the thoughts of the heart doing these Great Signs and it comes back into the evening time when the light is shining we see him and the same thing he did there in Sodom before it was burned we see that angel with his back turned saying why did Sarah laugh so we see Abraham he saw these three men he didn't say Lords he said Lord he said give me a Big C give me milk I want to have Fellowship that's why Jesus told the pH you cry and I believe you're sons of but if you were sons of have done the same works as Abraham he had fellowship with but you want to kill there's no place for my word in you Abraham said bring a fat Cal bring me milk I want to have Fellowship so we see when Sarah was back there in the tent Prophet says she didn't laugh in with her mouth but in her heart in her heart and God said why did your wife Sarah laugh Jesus said like it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming of man what is it it's the reason the coming of the Lord Jesus and that's many times what the world's doing today they're reasoning if Jesus is coming or not but the prophet says behold I send the prophet Elias before that great and terrible day that will destroy the world he'll return the hearts of the sons back to the original go back to the gospel go back to the power of God go back to the true Holy Ghost to Christ again before that great day come so we see this Prophet came to take us back to the original Faith because as time passed the word became hybrid doctrines rose up many things rose up but when this Prophet came and put things in their order said the spoken word is the original SE and put things in its place now we're getting to what I want to get to but the original Church began in Jerusalem in the year 33 after the death of Christ at the day of Pentecost that's where we've got to go back to I'm trying to go back there the day of Pentecost I don't know what's your motive or your objective but the day of Pentecost everyone got in one Accord their thoughts they put it aside their differences they put him aside I don't know what's your your thought or your motive this morning but the prophet is telling us I'm trying to get back to a point when we get to church you're healed that the Holy Ghost can come down in such a way that this literal building can be shaken how many testimonies have we heard from Sister L un fill more when the building would Shake I I believe our brother marus has also told me about that how much we desire for that to come back that depends on you it depends on you there's many things we've got to throw in the trash there's only one seed and that's the spoken word but you see that Antichrist move trying to make that Antichrist when the real spirit of God trying to move them back to the original Faith again look here what the polymer worm left the caterpillar and what the caterpillar left the canker and it got down until it it down to a stump Joel saw it and he said I will restore sayth the Lord all the years that they have eaten that seed was planted the messenger preaches a message the restoration of the brid tree because the spirits came the demons came and they started to eat that that bride tree until I was nothing it seemed as though the tree was dead the prophet says the life went to the roots it went to the roots but it's very important that the roots should be holding on to the word of God not holding on to your effect and your friends your family but the word of God when winter time comes the roots they're holding to the word of God now let's see what these worms they ate now we can speak about this individually a family Wise by as a church or as a universal bride but these worms they ate I want you to pay much attention to what the prophet is saying here I don't have this quote here in the message presuming then here come these four termites in one the same insect just in different stages Along come the Palmer worm what did it do first thing that it do it took the fruit brotherly love have you not noticed that Brothers now we must take this individually take it as a family a husband wife and children we can take it as a church depend how you want to take it but take it individually because when you take it individually you don't worry about your neighbor Amen to my neighbor this word is for me when this worm came it started to eat the fruit your brotherly love hope I don't get in trouble how many of you when you greet your brother you greet him well you look into his eyes you give him a hug and just be be honest with yourself but those demons they're real those demons many times these demons they don't just want to kill your influence just make you stay home these demons they want to see take in Hell these demons they're going somewhere they go to hell but they want to take people with them but we've got this message this great weapon to hit the nail it's not the person it's the spirit but many want to hit the person it's not the person it's the spirit the first thing it ate is Brotherly Love wow wow are we the same as how we started here in Jericho with love and ask yourself well this brother and this sister no brothers that's you you're here in that path for yourself worm wants to eat that tree you're a tree your family is a tree this church is a tree and then the worm comes to eat that brotherly love he wants to eat it there's no no love but this messenger came to restore restore that was already taken I'd like to just stay right there if you're lacking love say Lord give me more love give me brotherly love to love my brother my sister the devil wants to see everyone separated of chaos grou and group and group and group but here but here we are elected by God the holy spirit is not divided no sir no sir the worm wants to eat the brotherly love next thing that come around was the canker worm another worm and it eat off the joy what a joy we had when we started here what a joy when the musicians started the ministry started to come what a joy and this wor and it starts to eat the joy the fellowship how people would gather but the worm came and it started to eat that Joy I'm not scared Brothers don't think I'm scared it started to eat the joy start to eat the love and then the joy that's why brother Marcos preach return the joy of my salvation the leaves the fellowship wow wow can anybody say Amen right now amen okay that's good it started to eat the love and the joy and it started to eat the fellowship and no one wants to have Fellowship amen amen the next came what what did it do it it it it the bark the bark and then what came the canker worm the caterpillar suck the life right out that's what happens sometimes we feel like we don't have life in us we're like a person on the benches and what brother Marcos preach was directly from God you might feel like you're at the point of end and that worm is just sucking the life out of you but a trunk was left Joel said I will restore that predestinated roote there's a promise if God's people canite can take out their differences love one another I will restore all the years that those demons ate because the demons they want to see us individually I'll defeat it separated and families defeated the church divided but we have this message the message of Malachi 4 it came and sucked all the life out of the Church of that tree of God and then Luther came and then the Reformation started Luther was a a priest he wasn't a prophet he was a priest and he came with the message that just live by faith he started to see the mon the nuns serving their whole life for God it was by works not by Grace it's how much you could do for God then Luther came it's not by work it's by Grace it's by Grace the Reformation began the tree was almost useless and then Wesley came as something greater Wesley started to see they they went with that doctrine that Doctrine got organized we can keep sinning because by Grace We're saved Wesley said without Holiness no one will see God so you've got to live a holy life a clean life worthy of the Gospel something higher that's why Romans says shall we continue in so the grace would abound Paul responds let it not be don't we live not live just by Grace but something greater without Holiness no one will see God there's the restoration then Pentecost comes the restoration of the gifts but it started to get organized Wesley Wesley was they were very holy they could say Amen they were so holy but then Pentecost came and it was all shouts and they spoke in tongues and if you spoke in tongues if you didn't you didn't have the Holy Ghost they got organized then the messenger came and the message came he said if those gifts are here he said go into the gifts room and he put everything in its place Luther came Wesley came Pentecost came and then the messenger came The Original Seed the message now let's go to First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse verse 10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away Luther came one part John Wesley one part Pentecost one part but then the perfect has come the spoken word word the messenger came and brought us this message to bring us back to Genesis bring us back to I was with Adam manmade in the likeness and image of God amen amen first John 32 beloved now are we sons of God and it does not appear yet what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is Romans 8:29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to to the to the image of his son this message came to bring us back to the image of the son bring us back to what we should have been in the beginning but since we're in this flesh a hybrid flesh it brings death but when you're born of the word and the spirit you're now sons of God now you're Eternal and God brings his eternal life in you the Holy Ghost you cannot die God cannot die now you've got a part of God in you that's why the quote brother Manuel read many weeks ago when a man surrenders completely to God he is omnipotent how many can accept that God is omnipotent but when a man surrenders completely to God not just 50% but surrenders all he has he is omnipotent and all that you ask shall be God's in you amen amen so then we see that we're a tree we're God's SE and if you feel like those worms started to eat the joy that love Fellowship that's for you brother s individually God want wants to see you to see you there he wants to see the church defeated how many want to see their Church defeated no no sir we've got the message of the hour we've got the greatest weapon the word of God we're going back to the beginning now the spoken word is the Original Seed when God was forming everything he said let it be let it be let it be amen that's how it was the spoken word is the Original Seed we're going to go back to the beginning but we're right now we're just practicing we've got to First dominate this flesh dominate this tongue These Eyes these hands these ears dominate yourself we're going to go back to that Earth to dominate this Earth First dominate this Earth Faceook your your your Facebook your social media dominates your mouth we want to dominate this Earth amen amen amen but what about this Earth only the sons of God born of the word of the spirit will come back the works that I do shall you do also and greater shall you do greater he promised it he wondered how could it be but did you notice when he performed his first miracle he took water and turned it into wine that's right he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first and when he fed 5,000 what did he do he took something that had been like water he took a fish that one swam and was born from an AG he broke it and another fish grew onto creation that was the original creation he took the bread that was once wheat it was a seed and become bread and he broke from this bread and the creation only multiplied what is the prophet saying here when he took a fish and literally in the hands this fish in one day it was an egg it came out of fish it started to grow someone fished it out and it fell in the hands of the Lord with that creation he multiplied it now with bread one day it was a seed became wheat someone harvested it went to the to the baker Made bread and then came in the hands of the Lord with that creation already created he multiplied tremendous and special but the spoken word is the Original Seed okay can you put the next quote but in the woods the prophet's speaking when he was in the woods and he was hunting he as asked for a squirrel the spoken word is the Original Seed said let there be light and there was light his own word created he didn't doubt his word and then The Light Came he didn't take something to make creation look what the prophet says but in the woods there was nothing there to make a squirrel there was nothing he didn't take a squirrel in his hands that one day was born grew and then was in his hand and then multiplied said there was nothing no squir there the prophet said let there be let there be the spoken word is the Original Seed and there was there with nothing to break it what is it it's the same Jesus Christ greater things than this will you do for I go to my father to not take something that has been created break something from it and multiply a creation but absolutely create showing that he's the same Jehovah that stood back there and said let there be and there was his word was made manifest when he was made Flesh on Earth he took his original creation broke it back and multiplied but now in the last days when he comes down among us again the same light they moved down said let there be lights he just speak creation into existence greater than this will you do I go to my father remember we're at these times we're at these times the messenger came to restore all things rest restore the sons of God back to the original stat when a man speaks that's how it'll be speak it and it'll be and it was lost for years years but when the prophet came the first pull came the second pull came and the third pull came said but don't say it don't explain it we're in these days when he was in the the I didn't see a little squirrel to multiply like the multiply the fish and the bread he just said let there be where do you want it where do you want that and he spoke it created accepted his own word the spoken word is the Original Seed please stand we're going to be ending the prophet says I don't know if I have that quote up there and in the message question and answers number one the prophet says this is the third pull and is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored and ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection the son of man the prophet is saying that's the third pole when the word will be spoken brother Manuel just touched it a little when the arms will be formed the arms and the legs the third pole when one will be completely restored ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection the son of man that is what we're waiting for the spoken word is the original and we've got the spoken word what the messenger brought we've got it recorded you just have to accept that word listen to the message of the prophets and stay with that word let's ask the Lord the Lord to restore us back to the original St restore that brid tree if the Lord is speaking to you this morning speaking to me to you tell the Lord help us Lord help us help us to unite with that help us with that joy that Fellowship help us to stay together because he cannot come if we're not together the work the job of those demons is to destroy us in to destroy your family to destroy the churches to destroy the bride but this morning we've got the message of the hour say Lord I stand for your word I stand Lord I surrender all my rights surrender everything I've got Lord help me give me a baptism of love give me joy Fellowship take me back to
