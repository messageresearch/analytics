can turn with me to Job [Music] 1 and I'll be reading the new international version it reads like this in the land of us there lived a man whose name was job this man was blameless and upright he feared God and shunned evil amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord you know all things this evening and Lord I'm just a servant of yours lord lord your interpreter is a servant Lord Lord every musician is a servant Lord every person participating in the service Lord we are just your servants Lord but Lord maybe there's a need this evening that can be filled Lord and if we can give the glory to anyone we just want it to go to you Lord we just want to be in our posts trusting that you'll have your perfect will this evening Lord thank you for your word we commit ourselves into your

these things all the praise in that precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen amen thank you to our musicians God bless you amen you may be seated amen I certainly like that uh uh announcement that was made earlier that brother Emanuel would be preaching I told him may the Lord knew something brother you needed to give us a part two how many appreciate our your brother Emanuel amen God bless amen I was here for Wednesday I appreciate him amen amen we're going to go right into the scripture uh for a title this evening I I felt led to to speak on the subject of job and some very wonderful things about job that there are amen and my title is the seasons of tension and now if you notice in this scripture here notice the dialogue between God and Satan as we go to to job6 he says one day the Angels Came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came with them and the Lord said to Satan where have you come from Satan answered the Lord from roaming throughout the earth going back and forth on it then the Lord said to Sayan have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears God and shuns evil does job fear God for nothing Satan replied have you not put your hedge around him and his household and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land and Satan challenges him he says but now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face what a bold thing to tell God to his face the Lord said to Satan very well well then everything he has is in your power but on the man himself do not lay a finger and how interesting this story is that God allows this God allows this to happen to job and his life and I thought to myself how wonderful that God does not wait for Satan to ask about job in fact it was God that told him hey have you considered my servant job God was putting his servant on the line he was testing Ying about him in fact God does some bragging on him now imagine being a a person of of such a report that God himself shows you off to the devil tells the devil to his face have you considered my servant Jacob hob Josh Josh brother have you considered my servant there's none in the land that's like him he is a one of a kind and God already knew the heart of job God knows the heart of his people and God starts to allow the devil to deconstruct job's physical life just so that God can turn around and prove to Satan that I still have a faithful servant and that type is still right now that God has a bride who is still faithful who loves him and serves him in the good and in the bad and how amazing it is that the devil as he starts to pick off things in in job's life first he starts with The Oxen some thieves come by and steal the o and the servants that were with them they're slayed By The Sword and one escapes to come and run and tell job as that servant's finishing up telling job the tragedy another comes along oh your sheep they've been burned by fire Sent From Heaven and your servants all burned up and as that servant's done telling him another one comes Running Oh master your your camel they've been taken and the servants watching over them slayed By The Sword and if that wasn't enough the devil goes after his children the Bible says a strong wind came and broke all the corners of the house that they were in now can you imagine the type of Crisis this creates in his life you know job could have at this time he he could have started to testify about the devil if I can put it that way he could have testified about the devil and what he was doing in his life but watch the first thing that he says in the scriptures job 120 he says then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon on the ground and worship and you're telling me in such a time of of testing in such a time of stress heartache despair suffering I can't even begin to imagine the things that job was feeling not just losing your possessions but your family all of them your children you know I I I I know people in my life who have lost children and the way that they've expressed how they felt I can't even begin to identify that kind of a suffering imagine the the the mental stress that that puts a person through not just a loved one but a child and job he worships job gets down and worships God now I don't know about you but I would have really enjoyed seeing the look on Satan's face and I took all his possessions I took all his camel I took all his Ox I took his sheep I killed all his servants and left him one just to come back and tell him what had happened to the others and I even took his children and yet here he is still giving God the praise what a testimony for me as an individual to look at the life of Job who suffers what he suffered and still gives God the praise he automatically gives God the praise he left no no opinion to the devil to say oh the devil's doing this to me verse 21 he says and naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord had taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and all this job sin not nor charged God foolishly it can be too easy sometimes that when we're faced with a trial and hard times come our way we automatically say oh it must be that devil trying to torment me oh I can never catch a break with that devil on my back no give God the praise don't testify about the devil bad times come Hard Times come stop and worship God you know that'll throw the devil for a loop trying to mess with you trying to get into your mind when he sees you stop and give God glory he's really going to stop and question himself he might even stop and say I don't know what to do with them no matter what I throw with them no matter how hard I make their life they just keep giving God praise and the devil will start to say that I can never catch a break why can't I anger that brother can't I anger that sister why can't I cause confusion disorder in Jero Tabernacle man they're all just so close with God I can't even get in between that's what that devil ought to be saying now we can imagine the amount of tension being put on job's life brother brandham says here in the uniting time and sign it says that some people tries to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry the prophet says no you're not no you're not Christianity me professing that I'm a [Music] Christian it does not free me from the Troubles of this world it isn't an automatic Shield that comes up oh Satan I profess Christianity can't touch me I'm a Christian you know what the devil don't care about titles anybody body can profess Christianity but it'll take a true Christian to live it true Christian to live it now we're not free from troubles and trials does not mean that Christians are miserable Nei should we be miserable I don't know about you me personally I do not know any miserable Christians those two words do not belong in the same sentence when I'm describing a Christian you cannot be a true Christian and be miserable no there will be hard times but we have God to get us through hard times and not trying to discourage anybody from being a Christian don't walk out of here today and say man brother Nick said it's it's tough being a Christian I don't know if I want to be a Christian now I don't if I want to serve God now life is just way too hard you know what comes with being a Christian there's this deep sweet peace there's joy unspeakable there's so much satisfaction found in Christ Jesus that you cannot find anywhere else only in Christ Jesus the prophet here says you're free from tension oh no he says you add tension when you become a Christian who here saying sign me up give me some of that tension he says because you was kind of a slop Go Happy gol lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did he says but when you've become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord every day every moment a Christian wakes up a true Christian I will say Lord how can I please you today how can I serve you Lord what can I do to be pleasing before you God am a real a real Christian asks that am I pleasing the Lord he doesn't say oh am I pleasing the pastor or I've got to please the deacons oh no I've got to please the musicians I've got to please the ministry oh I've got to please my mom and dad no but am I first pleasing God I was given a a piece of advice one time by a loved one she told me when I wake up in the morning I look in the mirror and I ask the Lord Lord is what I'm wearing pleasing not to the eye of man but to you Lord and these are the questions that we should ask ourselves Lord is my life pleasing before you Lord are you are you pleased with the direction my life is going in are you pleased with who I associate myself with the kind of friends I choose to hang out with at work typ crowds I choose to be around Lord are you are you pleased with the way I talk do I do I talk real nice in front of the church people and then when I get home I talk like a devil do we always ask God in or around people Lord is my speech pleasing to you you know or do we do we still carry the habits of the one little cuss word that we can't get rid of a little tiny one that seems real inconspicuous it's it's it's just you know I throw it in every little joke because it's kind of funny do we stop and ask God God was that pleasing to you and I ask myself the question as we should ask ourselves the question if we profess Christianity Lord is there enough tension on me to get me in the position that you need me to be in is there enough pressure on me is life too easy and I'm just breezing by not caring about anything of the Lord show The church here and there or is there real pressure on my life causing me to always want to be in the house of the Lord at our posts of Duty in and outside of church continuing here the prophet says if I could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on guard that's what makes you what you are so after all and praise God for this right here he said tension is a blessing I need that tension it's a blessing in my life you know that might sound crazy to the world do you think the denominations preach that do you think they say Hey you better if you're going to serve God there's going to be tension no they preach the Prosperity Gospel Brothers God's love oh God's just love God isn't just love God is not just love put tension on the true Christian it molds people it makes car that's what comes from it I need tension in my life God that's what helps me to get into my position it helps us to get into our position who knew that tension the one thing that pulls on you stretches on you could be one one thing that God uses to draw you in amen continuing here he says it's just the way you're looking at it see if you just look the other side no matter how thin you slice anything you still got two sides to it see so you want to see both sides so tension I think he says oh my what's this tension if I could have been born without this tension well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps wow thank God for tension it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing thing to me you know I have a completely different outlook on tension now I don't see tension the same way anymore see tension the same way anymore when hard times come Trials come when I think that I can't make it through I can't help but just look at God turn my head up to God and say Lord it must be you producing this tension in my life because maybe you see something that I can't and sometimes that's how it is we can't see what God's doing in our Liv sometimes I want to take the RS and oh Lord let me I want to do this Lord I'm GNA go this way I'm going to take this turn have that path set for me but that's that's not for me and God puts attention and God sets you straight and God puts you on the right path but we need that tension it's a blessing and often times it's a blessing in disguise and it's in Disguise because sometimes we can't even see it and God's trying to tell us something right in front of my face I'm trying to direct you quit pushing quit pulling quit trying to lead your way just let me be the center let me mold you and form you I need the attention there so then as Paul said as though when he had tension or something or another and he had consulted the Lord consulted the Lord to take away from him three times and the Lord said Paul my grace is sufficient oh my grace is sufficient he said then I'll glory in my infirmities then when I'm weak I'm strong see as long as it's in the will of God right and you know some may question why would God allow a man like job to go through something like that he went through I believe that it was necessary to it was needed and we as the Believers we need tension on us no I I don't I don't want it easy let me explain that you know we can complain to God oh Lord make my life easy that molding conforming it comes from tensions and pressures on the life and that's how God molds us and forms our character and God often reveals himself in trials and in hard times but look at job here look how he response right in the middle of his turmoil he Praises God by saying the Lord gives and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord God puts on tensions in our lives for a reason the word of God here says in Hebrews 125 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scth every son who he receiveth if he endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not praise God for that that's the tension that's on the believer especially in this end time you know the devil the devil never fights you when you're not reading praying but when we do want to read and pray and get alone with God find some peace or when we want to start coming to church we find all of a sudden every circumstance that could ever have happened everything that was ever wrong that could have ever happened happens and it tries to pull us away from God remember the next time time that's that tension I'm trying to get close to God and here comes this trial Here Comes This whatever it may be that tries to pull me from God no I'm not going to give the the devil any Glory I'm G to give God all the praise keep on moving forward amen amen and we get busy we make excuses we'll dig for reasons not to come to church and boid does the devil just give us the reasons he give us the reasons to not read or pray oh you're tired oh just lay down just take a nap you've had a very long day work was stressful today you are dealing with so and so and this was happening and that was happening just rest your eyes for 30 minutes 30 minutes turns into an hour that turns into two hours that turns into three hours before we know it wow I'll just read my Bible pray later you know faith is a really simple thing if we just stop and look at it and you know if we would read and pray more just reading and praying just those two things alone they open up doors for God to start to do things in our lives and you know what you don't have to sit down and tell yourself well man I well I I can't just read for 10 minutes you know I got to read for an hour to feel like I'm a good Christian know if there's a hungering and a desire in your life to read or to pray if you tell God you know what Lord today I'm going to give you five minutes I'm going to open up that bible and I'm going to read and the more hungrier and hungrier you get the more longer you'll stay in that Bible the longer you stay on your knees you care about the time you'll start to have a relationship with God that the devil can't even put a razor blade in between I can't I can't touch that Christian they're so in love with God I don't know what to do with them but there's going to be some tensions and that's okay breathe easy tell yourself it's okay if there are tensions in my life God must be trying to tell me something or direct me from the path that I'm going in I better start listening more closely I better start getting closer to God this might be God talking to me you know before I I came here this weekend you know I was I was so busy with work and I was trying to get on the road and and get over here and and I was I was over here in Chandler with my company they had me doing some training brother Eli I started telling you this brother I was driving on the road just rushing I got to I got to hurry up now I got to get out of here I I got everything I I got my bags I I got my work laptop I'm going through my checklist and then the thought hits me I forgot my Bible and I'm halfway out of town I'm thinking to myself you know what I'll I'll get it next time would have been too easy I'll get it next time surely brother oron isn't going to kick me out if I don't come with my Bible he'll forgive me I'll remember at the next trip and before the brother had asked me to speak tonight I didn't know that that was gonna happen at the time and something pulled on me Nick turn around you're going to kill 45 minutes having to turn around and get your Bible that's okay so get your Bible and while you're at it get your notes because you never know what's going to happen this weekend and I did not show up with the expectation to preach tonight I would never invite myself to speak at this Pulpit brother I do not believe in that I feel that that should be something from the church that pulls on somebody not meting myself oh brother hey put me to preach brother brother I'm a good Preacher Brother come on put me to preach brother have a good time no and for whatever reason before this had even happened something else told me Nick Nick usually when you leave on your work trips you don't take a suit and a tie with you but pack one anyways you know something was pulling on me all along to line things up and when all this had happened and brother Eli told me asked me if I would speak I could not say no because I already felt the pool there was already a tension on me and I believe that that was God and you might look at that and say well Nick that's that's not really a big great story have faith that that was God talking to me and I want to give all that glory to God God has some wonderful ways of dealing with people you know I was thinking about tension forgive me I was thinking about tension and I was thinking about something that compared to it and one of my favorite things came to mind um music more uh particularly the piano particular and I started thinking about tension that every one of those strings on that piano it has to have a certain amount of tension on it it has to have enough to produce not just a sound but the correct sound it has to be tuned in in the right way and those strings if they have a loose tension to them they can have a loose tension to them but that does not mean that it's the right tension or the right tuning and that piano if it's All Out Of Tune I don't care how how good of a Pianist you are it'll never sound like it was meant to it has to have the right tuning to it those strings have to be pulled on in such a way produce the correct sound and I started to think well that's a tension right there that made me think about the true Christian there's a certain tension that comes with being a true Christian or a son and daughter of God and if we hold that tension and keeping that key stay in tune with God's word we'll find that God he has people all over a multi-member bride many different bodies many different tensions and we as the body of Christ we represent the tension we represent the strings on that piano and if everybody's in tune and all the right tension is in the right places we find that God on his great piano the chief musician when he strikes those keys it brings forth the correct sound but it has to be the correct sound it has to be the right tuning be the correct tension the right pressures and I'm not asking you to say Lord Oh Lord start giving me trials Lord Oh Lord you know I need trials in my life I don't know what kind of a Christian asks for that we don't ask for the trials but when we tell God lord Draw Me Close Lord I just want to be close to you you better be careful when you tell God that because that means that there may be some tension that's coming there might mean that there's some hard times that are coming the road is going to come and you're going to need to have the right tension in your life you're need to be on the right foundation if we watch that it's just God molding our character to be more like him and praise God for that because if there's anything ever in my life that I ever want to do or ever want to achieve it's not owning a millions of dollars or becoming the wealthiest having a big mansion here on Earth it isn't all this in that dream job oh Lord or let me travel the world and see this and that materialist things it's just God I want you to live in me that when the world sees me they see you that Nick his old nature is dead he's gone no more of him I don't want to see him I don't want to catch a glimpse of that guy the Mir I don't want to see none of him Lord I just want to see your reflection if there's ever anything that I can accomplish it's just to be your reflection that's it Lord I don't want all the Treasures of the world cuz we're not taking them with us when we go none of them you know I found out I found out that a a concert grand piano very it's a very big and expensive piano I found out that the these pianos have somewhere near 30 tons of pressure on it frame 30 tons of pressure that is a lot of tension that's pulling on that frame and that made me think of the body of Christ we are God's Great piano and he has us tuned to such a certain way he wants to play us in such a certain way for his honor and His glory not to the tune that I want not to what I think sounds good but Lord to what you want it it's God bringing out Beauty from the tensions and pressures in our lives to give him the glory you know God didn't have to God didn't have to tell the story of job I'm certainly glad he did but God being God he could have just looked into the heart of job known that that's my fa ful servant and there's none like him and that could have been enough for God pleas seeing the heart of job but God wanted to bring out of job that tension oh that beauty so that you and me one day I can open up this Bible and when I don't know why there's trials hard times on me I can be encouraged and lift it up by reading the story of job that Lord that's me too Lord though you slay me I will love you no matter what we just want to give God the glory am amen if you'll stand to your feet with me let's just Commit This to the Lord to Bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord I Want to Thank You Lord for allowing us God to be in your house of worship Lord Lord we don't want to give any glory to ourselves Lord we want to be magnified or glorified we want you to have all the praise Lord in the good days Lord and in the bad days we want to give you the glory and in all of our ways we want to acknowledge you God lord we're just so humble here before you Lord I pray that my words this evening as broken as they were
