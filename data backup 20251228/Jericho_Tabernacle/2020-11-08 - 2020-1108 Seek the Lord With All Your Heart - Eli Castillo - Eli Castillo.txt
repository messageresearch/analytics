in the precious name of jesus christ of jesus christ amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated my title this this morning is uh seek the lord with all your heart to seek him with all your heart you know that word seek it's it's an action it's an action it's a verb it's a work but but within these scriptures grace is wrapped in this whole scripture la gracias but but it's grace that causes us to seek him this is an invitation this morning seek the lord seek the lord while he may be found you know what the bible says the bible says in romans 3 10. as it is written there is none righteous no not one no no there is none that understands there is none that seeketh after god man does not seek after god we are not capable of seeking after him so it's a strange invitation that god has given us to seek after him even though our very nature is against seeking the lord it should have been adam running up and down in the garden crying father father we're out now but it was god going through the garden crying adam adam where art and adam was hiding and that's his nature today behind something and they're still doing it that's that's an amazing thing right there that has grace all over it where are they as soon as we sin sinners and and no good people nosotros como pecadores buenos paranada god's reaction isn't to cast us away la raxion de god's immediate action was to seek his fallen son that's grace of god today that he would come and he would look for us even though we had no desire we had no desire to look for him to serve him but but the message of the hour tells us that god put a thirst in every single man and woman and i believe that he put a thirst in every single thing on this earth that the earth is thirsting for god and god put a thirst in each and every person we know that this invitation is included to all people on earth seek after god yet it's only for a certain group and the world is deceived by those things but the question is my brother's sister tonight what makes them crave to what makes them uh makes the american people smoke cigarettes when readers digest said that a hundred and thirty thousand is doomed um this year of smoking cigarettes elections but they do it anyhow embargo a cancer cancer a bottle of turbul turbo lurker if you see the cancer arrasando if the devil can't get you um all twisted up with something like that then he'll try to hide yourself under some church or some creed or some denomination but what makes man to do it in the first place there's a little place in his heart that nothing will fill it but god i exist and men are thirsting for something and that real thirst is for god so so when you see man out in the bar rooms when you see people uh cussing and sinning and doing all those things it's a thirst for god they're trying to quench a thirst [Music] why because their whole nature is against god they're thirsting for something and they're running here and there is looking for something to except the father which has sent me draw him i believe that's a separate calling to the thirst that god given people questions all men have a thirst for god but no man can come to him unless the father draws oh man look and and fight to find something to satisfy their souls their their ambition is so great so ambition that they create businesses and become billionaires and they try to be the greatest in the world and it'll never quench the thirst in sight but they will never turn but you your whole nature your whole nature is the other way us and your nature begins to seek after god is before anything can happen out here to make you a christian something has to happen in your heart to turn you to christianity and this side of if you're not seeking for the almighty god if there's something that called you if there was something that that pulled you and draw to you then you can find god in church or you can find god in your car you can find god in the wilderness you'll be able to find god us i remember a few weeks back but brother johnny was speaking about grace and and he said if we have grace this is gracia it's because or if we have faith i'm sorry it's because god bestowed grace upon us gracias if there's anything in me to have faith in the lord god is the one that starts your faith no man can come to me unless the father which has sent me draws him and that that scripture is just full of grace it's got four verbs in it it's got four actions in that tenet it has [Music] it's all by grace no man can come to me unless the father which has sent me almost draws unless the father which has sent me has drawn do you have a desire for the lord ask yourself today does anyone desire you in you cannot have a desire for the lord possible it's impossible it's impossible to love the lord it's impossible so the very means that god has already called you signification that god has already drawn you in question and you have to remember that it is and god not want you idiots if you desire him if you want more of the lord it's because god has already called you god has already dragged you in amen amen now now brother branham says this is god speaks to your nature or god speaks sorry and your nature begins to seek after god uh david says in in psalm 27. and your nature begins to seek after the lord god begins to speak to your heart maybe you've never you never read these scriptures before but these scriptures are being manifested in your life they're being made alive in your lives you begin to thirst after god amen amen it's god speaking to you it's god saying adam out of her heart it's god trying to pull his children back to his bosom when god calls men and women therefore when man realized he was separated from his god he become a wanderer they wept they cried they toiled he becomes a wanderer if i could get into the presence of god i could talk it all over with him that we become wonders thirsting for him now now my question is if god is the one seeking man paraque because because god doesn't want somebody that is half-hearted god doesn't want somebody to walk into his presence one day and walk out that he gets the wholehearted christians and that's why this invitation is not for the whole world yes he spoke to the whole world you know whenever you seek with all your heart that takes all of you not just 50 50. no no no not just 99 percent of you no because when you seek after him with your whole heart that is when you find him esc and tomorrow they're finished he's hiding himself from me i guess he doesn't want anything to do with me and ye shall it takes a death and life but you until you stop uh wanting to listen to those things that you listen to one day it'll be too late [Music] it's not for the one that looks good in church you're the one that will put his whole heart and soul after seeking god it's for those that will look and seek is you'll it's lord and you will find him amen amen the bible says hebrews 11 6. it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is is necessary and that he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek him yes when you seek him believe that you'll find him when you look for him believe that whenever we get to that place you will see god manifested us you won't see god just in the scriptures you won't see him just in church when somebody is singing a beautiful melody or someone's preaching he will be manifested in your life desperation brings god in the scene yes knock and it shall be opened as can you it shall be received seek and ye shall fight then he begins to say that means it's a continuation significant continuation it means just don't sink for one day continually looking for the lord amen amen brother branham says this is then i got to thinking on perseverance and i thought yes many men is perseverance you and then we go into our busy life the devil loves to make our lives busy el diablo busy busy doing this and now and forgetting until until you get your blessings received the holy ghost you receive your healing have you shot for the lord violently crying out let us turn to romans nine romanos nueve 9 10 2 9 verses 10 to 13. capitol but when rebecca had also conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having um having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger celebijo and it is written jacob i have loved but esau you know god gave mercy to both children did you know that god gave an opportunity to both allo but but god gave grace gracia by election poor election to jacob even before they were born he said the elders shall serve the younger this but whenever they the most amazing thing in the old testament which was the birthright brother branham says he said amanda branham um he said now what is the birthright that's what i'm trying to tell you now this holy spirit is your birthright es espiritu santo es su primo that's your birthright is a supreme genitura it's your god-given right so here today our birthright is the holy spirit but what was the significance of the natural birthright significance now this is amazing as the firstborn asicomo el primogenito esau was in the direct line director of the unconditional covenant that god had with abraham in the sea he saw everything pertained to esau our and blessed is everyone to to everyone else that blesses you that blood that that promise was to abraham and his seed everything god gave to abraham c era imagine the the beauty of it knowing that one day someone threw through my lineage a every shadow and every type of christ he should have been the father of nate or he should have been uh israel israel he should have had the 12 tribes right he was the firstborn he but how beautiful is that that the birthright you were linked to jesus christ through you jesus christ and save all mankind through him the promise should have came out of traffic now let me ask you a question when you're born again what what promises when jesus christ comes a change of body pertains to you yeah jesus a thousand years and kingdom pertains to you milan if you have the birthright you can look back to when jesus died and when he rose up again it's linked you'll you'll sacrifice that to to hang out with friends and to listen to certain music we sell our birthright for for little things that will satisfy the flesh just for a moment when that birthright is linked to eternity but having the grace of god the bible says that the older shall serve the younger the is so he lived off of the revelation of the world even though i'm the younger one you cannot compare it with anything else you will never find the holy ghost when i serve the lord better yeah stop comparing the birth right with a bowl of soup his natural hunger natural was greater than his spiritual thirst spiritual what are you hungering for what are you desiring in life to be great say grande do i have a lot of money do you have a legacy are you comparing that to your birthright think about it think about what you're doing today this is what i realized how is that possible it comes you could sell it but you can't buy it for a million dollars you can't buy it for the whole world you cannot go back and say lord lord i'll do all this for you i'll do this i'll work so that i can receive my salvation it'll never work i'll give all my money i'll give all everything everything i have to receive your salvation and it'll never work because it's by grace seek the lord or isaiah 55 6 and he says seek the lord while he may be found see every single thing in this earth has the potential to be found did you know that maybe you'll never find it okay but if a man gets a treasure chest with billions maybe they'll never find it but it has the potential to be found because it's there it's there waiting there's only one thing that that can when god hides himself from the people it doesn't matter how much they seek no importa and how much they look hey he will never be found that's why we've got a space of grace today god gives us the potential to find him potential if we seek with all of our hearts began to search for it there was one time avionics that that isaac he said i'm getting old my eyes are dimming he said before i die he saw go and and go catch venison on the field and come and and serve it to me and i will bless you so he saw ghost i said [Music] he was a no good person brother brown says but this invitation isn't for the good bro it's for those who will desire him with all their hearts it's for those who and he goes and he says lord or father here here am i regressive and the bible says that isaac began to tremble he said because he gave the birth or the blessing to to jacob and he began to tell the son he said i'm sorry but i already gave the blessing to your younger brother and the bible says that esau begin to to seek the lord he sought for the birthright you have a little bit of blessing left for me but the door was shut the time of seeking of the lord was done with el tiempo and he was shut off the bible says that he found no repentance if you have in question and answers he asked brother branham this question i have lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother branham i have sinned again i'm not worthy to come before you this in this holy place please tell me if i can be restored whole again brother branham says yes you have not sinned so far in god that you could be restored you you uh if you had sinned far you could not be restored ghost you desire god shows that god dropped the lifeline down to pick you up you have a desire for the lord it means god already dropped his lifeline significa it means god is still calling significa it means that the scripture for god's or no man can come to me significantly [Music] heavenly father father
