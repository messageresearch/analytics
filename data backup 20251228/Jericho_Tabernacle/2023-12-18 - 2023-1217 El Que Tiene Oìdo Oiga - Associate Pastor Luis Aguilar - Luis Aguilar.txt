[Music] amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord It's good to see our brothers the brothers that are visiting us the brothers that we have here [Music] locally we're in the same battle we're in the same fight be so kind open your Bibles in the Book of Luke 8 verse [Music] eight this morning we want to start some messages and we want to call it he that have an ear let him hear a few weeks ago like a month ago I was studying and the word hear came to mind and I began to study to put the pieces of the puzzle together and I just you know put it away and I seemed to forgot it and as time went on on that thought began to bother me again uh and then one day I I played the tape the spoken word is the Original Seed not because of the title itself but because of the length of the message I played it so it just can keep on playing uh I left and I started to do some things that I had to do and once I came back I sat down and the prophet was reading this scripture and he said how I would love to preach about this and I said Lord you're truly tremendous you're so perfect I play the tape I leave and I come at the exact time when your Prophet says [Music] this before we read the Bible we're going to pray our Lord Heavenly Father this morning we're completely trusting on you trusting that you are the same yesterday today and forever and your people's here [Music] Lord wanting to hear your word word now father I ask that you cleanse our hearts when the word is spoken May the seed go into the heart of the individual we ask that Lord you help us to bring out this message in the way that you gave it to us open our eyes open our ears we ask for all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Luke [Music] 88 and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruits and hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear am you may be [Music] seated we thank the song Lead and the musicians he that have an ear let him hear for those that study their [Applause] Bible maybe you've uh come across that phrase but if you uh read your Bible about 15 times you'll come across that certain phrase in the Bible and it's always the same uh person that says the same phrase It's the Lord Jesus Christ and he always says that phrase he that have an ear let him hear now here the messenger says in the message perfect faith he says he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches he says you know in the Bible it's always constantly saying that to him that has Faith to him that has an ear let him to hear Let Him hear see he that have wisdom let him count the numbers of the Beast all these different things he that has let him tell it to the rest of them that they might have so if you just look at the words it says he that have in the Book of Revelation it says to he that overcometh now brother vom says it's he doesn't say that it's the church that overcomes but he say it's the individual that overcomes so he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so in other words the Holy Ghost is speaking to the church but within the church there's only few that have that ear uh if you notice it's the individual every age has had its own elect and that group of elect always listened to the word and received the word showing that they have God's seed within them there's not one Church age where this verse isn't mentioned each age has the same warning for the people of all the ages now the messenger says this and it's very tremendous when he says this he says but it's absolutely impossible that all men hear to what the spirit says not everyone has that ear I'll say it again it's absolutely impossible that all men can hear what the spirit says now Jesus says my sheep hear my voice how many can say Amen to that Jesus also says this in John 105 but a stranger they shall not follow but on the contrary they will flee from him because they know not the voice of strangers only my sheep hear the voice of God but when a stranger comes and that stranger begins to speak they will run away from him because they don't know the voice of strangers he that has an an ear let him hear what the spirit says amen may God help us because sometimes you you feel like running now if you go to Luke 8 verse4 here is the beginning of when Jesus is giving the parable of the SE verse four it says and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable now I just want you to look at these groups that the Lord Jesus is going to separate says a swer went out to sew his seed and as he SED some fell by the wayside and was trotten down and the fouls of the air devoured it now that's one group that is by the wayside now verse six and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture that's the second group now this is the third group and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it now this is the fourth group and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit H hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear now here the Lord is speaking a parable and here the disciples they asked the Lord Jesus they asked what what is the meaning of this Parable and now here the Lord gives them the answer of what this Parable means in verse 10 and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so a seed is a word now the Lord here is saying when the swer came to sew his seed he says that's the word of God now when a minister stands behind a Pulpit wanting and trusting that he is a child of God that he has the word inside him I don't want to say he's tossing but he's you know casting the seat of God he's speaking the word of God to the church so the the seed is being scattered when the The Prophet's tape is playing the seed is being uh scattered on the earth and there's always those four groups some by the wayside upon on the Rocks upon the thorns and the other ones are good ground it's the seed but the seed comes out of the mouth of God's mouth when it comes out of the mouth of God it has to come in through the ear that's why it says he that have an ear let him hear now everyone here is hearing what I'm saying but there's only few that are understanding what the prophet truly truly brought because when you hear the prophet's message you can say well the prophet said this others others say well the prophet meant and another group says no the prophet said this it's the am amen I hope you're not getting getting scared now in verse 11 it says the seed is the word of God now the Lord here begins to break down this Parable he says those by the wayside are they that hear says and and then he says then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believed and be saved so that's the first group that's by the wayside he says they are the ones that hear they are hearing the word of God and and then he says and then cometh the devil and takes the word out of their hearts just like in Genesis the serpent came to the woman and he said uh the uh God didn't really mean this you shall surely not die trying to take the word that she had and if you bring it out to our day the devil can come and the devil says well the prophet didn't mean that you can live any kind of life you want you can do whatever you want you're saved by grace is that true the devil also preaches the word if there is a good preacher it's the devil I'll say it again if there is a good preacher it's the devil he knows Genesis to Revelation he can quote you the prophet of the message of the hour he can quote any verse of the Bible and try to get you out of the word of God that's why when you hear the word the devil then always comes the devil is always present now if you go to Hebrews this morning we're going to be reading several scriptures of the Bible I hope you have your swords with you we're going to train ourselves on how to wield a sword when a soldier in back back then they had swords they had to train on how to use the sword Hebrews 2:1 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things that which we have heard lest any time we should let them slip so the Apostle Paul says we have to more earnestly heed the things that we have heard that way we don't slip or stumble or fall whenever you hear the message of the hour we have to earnestly hear it closely listening to what the prophet is saying that way we don't slip now Hebrews 4:2 for for onto US was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so the uh Apostle Paul is saying that we also receive the the good news which is the gospel it says but it did not profit them hearing the word because when they heard the word it was not mixed with faith with them that heard it so when you are hearing the word it has to be mixed with faith what is faith faith is believing it though you don't understand but you believe it faith is something that you cannot see something you can't touch that you can't taste you can't smell but in your hearts you believe it you don't understand what the prophet just said but there's something in you that says that's the truth because your heart is a deep calling to a deep how is it then possible that we are here and we hear the messenger and we say that's the truth but others they receive the seed and they say that's a devil the prophet himself that we say Amen to others say that's a curse how is it possible it's by election or predestination that the sea fell on good ground amen Brothers we're just getting started so when you hear the word it has to be mixed and going along with faith because if Faith does not go along with it then the word uh escapes us because that faith faith is Like Glue it's the glue that makes the word stick amen brothers so when you're here you must have faith believe that this word is nothing more but the truth we believe that what the messenger brought is the truth I don't remember what Minister said this but one of those Ministers of back then he says speaking about brother bham he says this is the most tremendous man on Earth or he says or he's the greatest impostor but when you in your heart every one of you that's sitting here and you can hear every word some are saying well that's too strong or that's not strong enough or I don't believe that or I I accept that it's the seed it that's the word of God and every one of us are hearing the word you just have to believe the word now let's go to uh first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye reive the word of God which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of man but as it is in the truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe now the Apostle VA in very simple terms is saying here it says but we cannot but cease from thanking God because he received the word that was not of men though it came out of the man but you understood that it came straight from God's throne even though it came out of the mouth of man but it's not the word of man I'll say it again the Apostle Paul is thanking God because this people this people understood that even though the word came out of the mouth of a man they understood that it was not the message of a man but it came from God's Throne they understood that it's nothing more but the truth it's God's word now let's go back to the Book of Luke now we left off on verse 12 it says those that hear and then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved so the Devil Comes and wants to take away that word from your heart but when you have faith it's now yours you own it when you hear the promise that God will heal you that God will deliver you you with faith believe it but when the Devil comes and you don't have faith the devil will take it away from you but you must have faith amen now verse 13 they on the Rock now this is the second group now as we're reading I want you to identify which group you're in you are of the ones that are of good ground but sometimes we go through certain sages but don't doubt that you're children of God says they on the Rock are they which when they hear so the first group and the second group they heard the word they receive the word with joy when the brother's preaching they're receiving it with joy oh the brother preaches so tremendously they're receiving it with joy it says however these have no roots which for a while believe and in time of Temptation fall away is that you brother is that you sister you hear it and with you're joyfully enjoying it but then the Temptation comes I don't want to go to church anymore I don't want anything to do with God anymore my my wife my my family doesn't act up I'm going to speak very simply my old man he won't act up my old woman won't behave my children won't uh behave it's the time of Temptation and then they fall away they heard the word he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayith unto the church we're barely starting but he says and these have no root when the uh the seed Falls there has to be the right temperature and water the the seed is covered by the earth and the prophet and even science itself it says that there you need moisture so that the those roots can come out now you that have your swords let's go back to verse six because it's speaking how it fell upon the rock verse six and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture that's the second group verse six it says it lacked moisture now when Jesus explains the parable it says that it has no roots the word does not make mistakes because the roots needs uh moisture and you in a certain way you understand what moisture is but but since I'm a bit clumsy I went to the dictionary to see what moisture is moisture is steamed up water in the air and how is it possible that the seed that is placed in the ground and then you have the moisture that's in the air how how how is it possible it's not logic it's more logical for you to have water in the in the ground so then the Holy Ghost came he says that's why when you play The Prophet's tape you press play the tape is in the air that's why when the messenger came and poured out his vial it was poured out upon the air that moisture is in the air that's why it's very important that every one of us we hear the prophet's tapes at your house in your car just play it though you're not really listening but that moisture that Steam is in the air it's touching the seed of the hearts that belongs to you so the roots can go deeper so by the reason for some reason we don't hear the prophet but the devil attacks us it's I fall asleep it's too boring play the tape play the tape and those spirits will will go away even science proves that the word is the [Music] truth now the second group it Withers up because it its roots are not very deep in the time of Trials and they fall away it says now the prophet says it says every time you shake a tree it says it loosens up the root and it causes it to grow deeper and deeper sometimes we don't like ourselves to be shaken we don't like the trials but sometimes you need yourself to be shaken that way you can wake up oh the church you're in the church and you're you're you're praying right you're praying but you need the Deacon to shake you okay okay oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I got to pay attention now you need a shaking brother the ROM says every time you shake a tree it loosens up the roots and cause it to grow deeper and deeper he says every time the Holy Ghost falls on the [Music] church in an oldfashioned Revival it shakes up the roots like this so it can get rooted and grounded the prophet says forgive me that I don't have it up there's a bit of an issue but he says he says ready for the storms and trials when the Holy Ghost comes and he shakes you and you hear something that the prophet says that shakes and it hurts you oh that hurt me this hurt me that's the Holy Ghost shaking you because you are a tree and your roots they go deeper into the word of God and you should say Lord even though it hurts I want to line up with your word if I'm wrong tell me Lord correct me I want to be put to shame here that way I'm not put to shame up there so correct me Lord that should be our attitude the attitude and when you hear the prophet you hear the pastor or the ministry sometimes we bring a message that's a bit strong instead of running away you should say that's the word it's the word you should accept it and say Lord I'm wrong help me and those roots begin to deepen they begin to grow the prophet says in that way they'll get rooted and grounded so when a storm comes and it blows with the strong wind you're not found on the Wayside you're still standing you're still there and the prophet says ready for the storms and the trials what's the meaning of the trials of the storms what are the meaning for trials to remove all the little trees that don't belong there I'll say it again what's the point of the storms what's the point of the trials to remove all those little trees that should not be there amen the prophet says he says every time a man gets rooted and grounded in God's word he says a man he doesn't say a church he doesn't say a group he says every time a man that's an individual it's individually gets rooted and grounded in God's word what does it say in the God's word or in the church he says in God's word um um I apologize again I'm usually always ready but maybe this time it was the devil's fault he says and every time a man gets rooted and grounded in God's word he says it roots and grounds him in Calvary Yonder where the anchor the tist of God was brought there so the man has to be red Ed and grounded in God work at Calvary in the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made but many times we have it backwards Chariot how you say Chariot wagon a wagon sometimes we have the Chariot in front of the the horse but we need the horse in front of the Chariot we want it to go but we have the Chariot in front of the horse how is it going to go but if we place but if you notice if we place the Christian the individual if we bring the individual to Christ and not to church we bring them to Christ so when a a trial comes a storm comes that individual is grounded in Calvary not in the church if we bring the Christian the individual to Christ then that Christian will come to church you have to be rooted in God's word grounded in calary on what Jesus Christ did he died for us for our sins and trespasses and your roots should be grounded there and be more rooted in that cross imagine a root just entangled in the cross now verse 14 it says those that fell on Thorns are they which that have heard so this group also heard God's word but now notice says it says go [Music] forth and says and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit for those that are bilingual and have their Bible in Spanish if you notice it says these are the ones that hear and then it has a comma but it says go forth and then comma in my own uh chopped up Spanish the way I understand in my own way of of understanding they left they heard the word but then they left and it says and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection they left they didn't stay so that fruit can mature it says it didn't bring any fruit to Perfection they heard heard the word but they didn't produce fruit and I said that's so tremendous because that's the last group that's the the fourth group now if you go to the Book of James James 1:22 the scripture says it says but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves this is very tremendous it says but be doers not only hearers of the word because everyone here is hearing the word but not everyone not everyone lives the word we have to live this word that we're hearing one part is hearing the word the other part is that we live the word he says but be ye doers of the word it says deceiving your own selves a sad thing is when someone else deceives you when someone deceives you and they lie to you but the saddest thing is when you yourself you deceive yourself is you say I'm fine just keep trying just go to church on Sundays hear the word you'll be saved by grace you keep going just keep doing it just read the verses that suit you those uh messages when the prophet is just patting you on the back the saddest thing is when you're lying to yourself that's the saddest thing a sad thing is when someone deceives you but the saddest thing is when you look in the mirror and you're deceiving your own self because in verse 23 it says for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straight way forgeted what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so here it tells us if someone is a hearer of the word but not a doer of the word is like a person that looks in the mirror after he looks he leaves and he forgets how he looks so you look in the mirror you know what you're missing I'm missing this I'm missing this what is the mirror it's the word that's the mirror you have to be reflected in the mirror of God's word so you look in the mirror and you and the mirror tells you that you're missing this and this and this and you see yourself you see what you're [Music] missing you leave and then you forget what you're missing and then it [Music] says ISS not being a forgetful hearer don't forget what you heard what the prophet said what the pastor said don't forget it it should be engraved in your heart he says but a doer of the work this man the individual shall be blessed in his deed because God will always be with you because you'll always carry the word in your heart oh to the Book of John uh St John 8:43 here the Lord Jesus is speaking he says why do ye not understand my speech so the Lord has his own speech he's speaking and these men are not understanding his speech it says why can't because you cannot hear my word even because you cannot hear my word so the the Lord Jesus be begins to speak to them in a very straight way he says ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth and he says and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and father of it and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not and once again and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convince me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me we're just starting here but he starts off by saying you don't understand my speech he also says that the devil speaks he speaks a word is a seed God has his own seed and the devil also has his own seed he says when I speak the truth you believe me not verse 47 it says he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God he that is of god heareth God's words he he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit of God says unto the churches but these can't hear it because they're not of God now um I feel like we're understanding more and more the word now the brother R speaks about about the pleasures of life in the message the church and its condition for those that have heard this uh tape from the Prophet this uh portion of the tape the prophet in this portion of the tape he's crying he's a he's in tears so I really recommend that you listen to this tape he says when I have to stand there by myself my brother's gone my pastor's gone my mother's gone my Daddy's Gone my wife's gone my kitties are gone oh God what am I going to do then Lord Lord what am I going to do that and that may be before the sun goes down tonight but what am I going to do what can I do oh [Music] Christ I'll stand for you now I'll take my choice today I'll forfeit all my talking about other people in other words gossip he says I'll forfeit all all my talking about other people I'll forfeit all my temper I'll forfeit all my differences I'll forfeit everything Shear me off Lord take all I got you just take me Lord I want to stand in your place I want to be sheared I want all selfishness all Pride all indifference just all taken off of me I believe that's our prayer that all of our gos our bad our selfish our pride and indifferences Lord take them from me Shear me off Lord and also I want to stand for you as a sheared lamb willing to give up all the pleasures of what they call pleasures of life because this group they left because they began to go astr because of the pleasures of life this life has many pleasures and you as a human you have your flesh you have your eyes and there's many Pleasures not only for the young people but for the adults you begin to go astray because of the pleasure of Life speaking bad about other people your temper and differences that's why the prophet says Lord Shear me off but now listen to the words that the prophet will say willing to give up all the pleasures of what they call pleasures of life all the dances all the parties all the old vulgar clothes makeup lipstick fingernail poish all this indifference that looks like the world the pleasures of life dances parties old vulgar clothes makeup lipsticks even the Polish for your fingernails says all those indifferences that look like the world you you said don't even act like the world don't even associate with the world come out of from among them the prophet says he says help me Lord Shear me today take me like a lamb and let me be dumb don't open my mouth say nothing about it oh the messenger he's speaking about about makeup and The Temper but Lord the prophet said he say let me be dumb quiet and not open my mouth not say anything about it Lord if it's your word help me to fit with your word I want to be corrected here and not over there so that everyone else can see because the word the bride the children of God are being judged now being cheered is something that's strong listen to this message you can hear how the prophet is crying and crying you said Lord you have sheared me off when you took away my wife when you took away my brother you took away my daughter you really sheared me off Lord every one of us we have gone through those shearings and it's the Lord Jesus Christ not the devil it's the Lord Jesus Christ shearing us not because he hates us he loves us and a sheep stays quiet doesn't say anything and says Lord Cheer Me Lord I want to be right with your word in Luke 8:15 this is now the last group everyone heard the word some left because the devil came others left because they have no roots in them the third group left because of the pleasures of life makeup partying money but now here comes that fourth group he says but that on the good ground are they which in in honest and good hearts and honest having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience they heard the word but they also keep it in their heart even though it hurt them but they keep it in their hearts and they bring forth fruits now the prophet says in closing now do you love me you love God you love his word amen now the prophet says in uh the message Jehovah Gyra number two he says and we know that a seed now remember the devil has his own seed and God has his own seed but later on will go into that now we're speaking about the seed of God he says and we know that a seed when it falls on the right ground not on rocks without roots neither on Thorns or thistles that will be quick to choke it but with a good rich and fertile Faith you must have faith believe the word believe in and accept the word every seed will bring forth according to its kind and we know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth according to its kind what he promised now the prophet says he says the Earth Earth will be struck in other words the heart he says the Earth will be prepared and made ready that's why in Psalms it says it says oh God cleanse my heart so I can have a clean and upright heart before you all the stones have been Cast Away when you're at your house and you're going to uh plant uh plants or or flowers first you have to prepare the ground all the stones that are there you have to throw them out you also have to dig up the ground to find the stones that are buried underneath that's why the prophet is saying these words that the Earth will be struck the Earth Earth is being prepared all the stones have been thrown out the roots and the bitterness and the selfish indifferences jealousy everything has been plucked up that root of bitterness that Springs that so many times it ruins what God is trying to do God wants to speak to your heart God wants to work in your lives but that root of bitterness that you carry is getting in the way of what God wants to do uh preparing the ground is something that's hard you have to pluck up all the roots and say Lord help me to bring out this root of bitterness this root of selfishness this root of Pride there's a lot of roots not only a bitterness but there's many roots like there's a root of God there's also a root of selfishness a pride of all those kinds of roots but brother God wants to bless you sister God wants to bless you but that roots of Pride selfishness a bitterness is getting in the way of what God is trying to do the prophet says he says Lord we pray that that be not so in us but the good word can find good ground in US please stand I apologize I didn't have the quotes on the screen you love the Lord am I hope God can help us that God's word had May reach your ear and come into your heart and touch our hearts he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches but it's the individual it's not the entire church it's the individual we're reaching the the highest point where the bride and the word will be one do you believe that that's something that's biblical I'll say it again it's biblical and everything that's in the Bible That's thus sayth the Lord in Revelations 2217 by this chapter in the Bible everything is closing now we're in Revelation chapter 22 everything is [Music] finishing but Revelations 22:17 says and the spirit and the bride [Music] say doesn't say that the spirit says it says the spirit and the bride both say come and he that hears he that Hearth say come and let him that th come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely it doesn't say only the spirit in other words the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ because by this time the spirit and the bride are now one but here the bride and the word are joining together right now they're joining together so when this time is fulfilled the spirit and the bride are joined together because now the bride has become the word the bride has dressed herself with the word she stayed quiet and she was sheered she heard what the spirit said she had fell in her heart she accepted it she dressed herself with the word and now the spirit and the bride both [Music] say he that Hearth they're going to say come he that Hearth say come and he that a thirst let him come are you thirsting are you thirsting sister then come and drink of this Water of Life it won't cost you anything it's free it you won't be charged anything it's free but when you drink this water it's impossible for you to go back to the world and go back to the garbage you tasted that rich water and this water it's not like the water from the the Colorado Springs or from here in PAC this water is Rich it's blessed it never ends brother and sister come before it's too late drink this water and when you drink that water it will take everything that's in your heart everything that's in your mind and that water will give water and will water the word of God that seed that's in your heart he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit say onto the church Lord Heavenly [Music] Father oh Lord you are great and omnipotent Eternal you have no beginning and no end your word does not contradict itself we go verse by verse chapter by chapter and not one scripture contradicts itself it's perfect and oh Lord may your word become flesh in your people this people loves you and [Music] Lord may your word fall on the hearts of each individual and may they keep it with faith maybe they did not understand everything that was said but let them believe it either way oh Lord Heavenly Father here is your people here we have these brothers and sisters young people cleanse us
