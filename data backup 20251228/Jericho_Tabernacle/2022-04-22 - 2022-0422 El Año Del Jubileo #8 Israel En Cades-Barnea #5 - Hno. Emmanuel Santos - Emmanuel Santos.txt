first lord but finally we'll see you face to face [Music] in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and just as we're standing if you can open your bibles to the book of deuteronomy chapter 1 [Music] the 19th verse [Music] and we departed from arab and we went through all the great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to cadence bernie sanders and i said unto you or come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us behold the lord thy god hath set the lamb before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers has said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged and it says like this is the church of the philippians these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name let's jump to verse 12. yes him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name you may be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word of the the series that we have uh and hopefully shortly we can finish the series i feel like one as brother ram felt one time encino liver of the home he says for a whole year he thought of the of the book of jokes it's about six or eight weeks there and they're on the ash sheets and said that a sister wrote him a letter he didn't want to she didn't want to be rude with him well when are you going to change the subject and that's how i feel with the lord or when can i change subjects and the reason why this has gotten a bit lengthy there's so much that's being found there on the open door that it takes too much time to explain it takes you to the baptism of the holy ghost takes you to the revelations of jesus christ takes you to the rapture it takes you there to the city of the new jerusalem it takes you first to the baptism of the holy ghost there's no way that we can get to the second portion without the baptism of the holy ghost what the ram says there's no way that a person can go to the rapture cintener el bautismo del espirito santo without having the baptism of the holy ghost so then having the holy ghost it's the most important thing someone can have foreign manifestation to advance to the second manifestation de la puerta of the open door so first it takes you to the baptism of the holy ghost the open door and brother venom says philadelphia it manifests in the midst of the age of philadelphia which is and there's things that the open door does during the sixth church age and there's things that the open door does during the seventh church because you have to understand that the open door is crystal it's christ other things that christ would do in life 6 like that in the sixth age como la puerta vietnam alike in the open door there's things that he would do on the seventh day but there are things that christ would do la puerta verta like in the open door even after the church ages that's why this age is very important because it begins with you usted because you receive jesus christ just as jesus christ you also have to do the same connell with him you have to open up your doors to him the same that jesus christ does what he wants to do with you you have to do reflect the same towards him and towards the others because your job since the days of luther they lived under justification the days of wesley they come a little higher leglesses sanctification the church became in the minority under sanctification which is the baptism of the holy ghost entonces so then in the fifth age with luther it was justification in the sixth age on wesley with wesley it has sanctification it was sanctification now in the seventh ages it's open door is a baptism of the holy ghost that's why he put it specifically between those two churches about the capstone now the open door it manifests in those stages which as i just mentioned the open door also manifests also in the capstone one of the manifestations of the open door is federated it's uh rapturing faith and the capstone the sienna by one spur we are all baptized in one body el cuales chris which is christ el puso he sent that message before the methodist church and they turn it aside from it they come up to satisfication and refuse the holy ghost do you remember that that's the open door how do you get into christ by one spirit el espiritu santo the holy spirit el cual es el espirito but by one holy ghost baptism we're all baptized into one body and made partakers of that body santo para entrar en now there's another another manifestation of the open door let's go to exodus the 21st chapter from the first verse now remember it's the year of jubilee la puerta vietnam the open door now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them if thou by hero servant six years shall he serve and in the seventh shall he go out free for nothing now brother branham says right there where it says hebrew servants eso represents if he came by himself he should go by himself if he were married then he should then his wife shall go out with him if his master has given him a wife and she gave born him sons and daughters the wife and the children shall be the masters and he shall go out by himself entonces then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall say i'll also bring him to the door or onto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with and all and he shall serve him forever if you notice it says door a they're on verse 5. that the servant shall say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free este this is the response to brother branham ammo al diablo says i love the devil that's making me do these things that's all right i don't think think that you're just too narrow-minded up there yo i just think you're too narrow muy bienjo las cosas all right i love these things i think we ought to have these big things like this yes it is and do this world and we have dances and they're just as good as any other bunch that you go up there adelante all right now when i go out of this freedom of the spirit that you talk about entonces shall bring him to the judges and shall also bring you him to the door and notice what brother ram says [Music] and neglect and you can decide if you want to accept or if you want to reject the what who's the door the congregation says it's jesus christ if you reject your attitude towards the door your attitude towards christ shall determine if you're going to receive a mark or you're going to receive the seal of god if you want to accept or you want to reject we say is what do you mean brother branham if you hear the gospel truth and you refuse to walk in it then god marks your ear where you'll never hear it no more us you've crossed that the line between life and death just like they're in a natural they had a mark in the air the people today that reject christ for the last time they will receive a mark in their ear even though they might hear the gospel they will never have the opportunity to accept it because god himself has marked her here being that you hearing and faith is revelation and the open door is one of those manifestations it's the revelations of jesus christ it all depends that's how the open door manifests himself he continues you've crossed the line between life and death organization can you go on with your organization the nomination denomination the domination the rest of your days forever walk in the light children that's right i denominations he who the son has made free is free indeed if you want to go free and be free in the sun who's the son jesus christ to cut loose from all things and serve him of life you also or to the antichrist illa de christo and of christ it's the heaven it's the paradise it's what waits for you if you accept the mark of christ the seal of god like we said it's the revelations of jesus christ and i just mentioned it's between two ages now let's read this quote from brother branham philadelphia and the philadelphia church age this grand revelation now we found out that in this great revelation that god gave here to the church in these last days it got neither was in this other age of philadelphia philadelphia now the revelation of himself he built his church how do you know that's true he built his church upon the revelation of himself that's why it's the open door with the revelations of jesus christ it's his revelations the revelation of the supreme deity of jesus christ specific revelations of himself of his character specifically specifically it's revelations of his own heart anoint branham have you heard brother branham he said that he thought that christ is god's own heart yes christo and it's christ revealing himself just like christ has used that power of the sermon christ is also revealing his very own heart austere to you to you who accepted him revelation the revelations of your heart to christ you have to confess your sins that is what you must reveal there is you must reveal it to christ just like he's revealing his own self revelant revealing his heart and revealing it on to you now you must do the same revelant reveal your own self and the most marvelous thing after you have confessed all your secrets after you confessed all of your uh sins today he can't remember those no us human beings we forget something but then we'll remember it later on it's not like that with christ or with god the bible says enzo contra and the conch in your country and your contrary and against you but it will be against the devil you and he will remember never remember what you've done also the open door it's also a city la puerta vieta in fact the open door is it's the main set again la puerta principal that's the main door to enter that city the aegis mirna ephesus smyrna here paul is writing to the colossians and when this epistle is read among you senses read also in the church of the laodiceans and the likewise read the epistle from laura sayah blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein juan a la siete iglesias john to the seven church ages which are in asia grace beyond to you and peace from the which from him which is which was and which will come from the seven spiritual spirits which are before his throne iglesias you see there in verse four it says the seven church ages which are in asia it's a small parcel of land about the size of indiana iglesias the seven churches were specifically picked from all churches iglesias characteristics from all other churches for their characteristics which same characteristic characteristics will be found in the successive ages centuries later entonces then these ages were first cities and then those cities or those churches and the seventh church ages but there's another age the age of the open door now that age it's also a city la nueva jerusalem the new jerusalem open doors manifesting itself as the revelations of jesus christ the second manifestation that we're waiting on is la federato it's the faith of the rapturing faith now let's return back to the beginning there in revelations 12. 3 12. him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go out no more and i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from god and i will write upon him my new name so then these ages these cities have uh spirits in particular el mondo brother also teaches it's humor joking you can imagine certain things that happen in that city also with now there's not just one spirit i various but there's several spirits in that city but all of the spirits of that city are under the leadership of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost now there's several spirits in that city they got sense to help you because you're a citizen of that city under the leadership of the open doors chris which is christ himself diablos just like the devils the demons or the leadership of satan today it's the main spirit that you're going to find in that city this is the baptist of the holy ghost just with the baptism of the holy ghost like a father that did weddings for his son and they called the ones who were invited to the wedding and the ones who were invited had to come he goes around and sees those who are invited and he finds someone keno they cast them out from the wedding i would really would like to explain this that this this is we like unto the king or this shall be like onto the kingdom of heaven that's going to be taking place there in the heavens that would take you to the next stage of the open door which is rapturing faith and it will take you to the next stage living or abiding in that city where of that city in this moment not there in the future now in this moment takes you to the revelations of jesus christ takes you to the rapture and it takes you to the new jerusalem we already read the scriptures speaking how the open door would take you to the new jerusalem now he's not only giving out crowns but he says that these that in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of god but what is the temple of god jesus jesus spoke of his body as being the temple temple it was it was the temple of god a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up to the superstructure just like the columns that we have here in the church they sustain the building god himself tells shall i make a pillar in the temple of my god he's going to place you in the monobram disease with joshua when they entered in the promised land joshua placed every tribe in sierta party and certain places it also says in the parallel what joshua did in the naturals is being shown it's paul placing each one in the body of christ and it's in the same book that paul explains to us what is the foundation of the city of god what is the foundation that you should have are you understanding me now therefore you're no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints apostles and the household the household of god and and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone coordinator um in whom all the buildings fitly framed together growth onto the holy temple of the lord in whom ye also are building together for inhabitation of god through the spirit this is fundamental this is your edified through the foundation of the apostles and prophets and that is this message you're edified through that foundation specifically you believing this message especially and especially having the life of the message within you there's many people that's in the message there's very few where the message is inside of them the message has to be inside through the baptism of the holy ghost now and only in that way no no no not just reading and hearing it necesita is an experience that you must have the revelations of jesus christ rapturing faith rapturing faith that's what says we're already in heavenly places and the new jerusalem now in these moments philadelphia on that same quote in the philadelphia age explicando lo que a cerca de la puerta he continues saying about the the open door he just finished reading the scriptures everything went through the door jesus yes and it is part of that body or tempo now when god puts a man in the temple come on column as a pillar because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had las misma revelations the same revelations you have el mismo fundamento it's the same foundation pablo just as paul usted pedro you and peter los apostolis the apostles and the prophets are going to live in the same city let's read it again he's given the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophet had illoaki including then he includes the scripture matthew 16 17. jesus i will build my church what rock regress return to ephesians it was the cornerstone the revelations the revelation of jesus christ what they called they cause spiritual strength vamos a apocalypse ocho now let's go to uh revelations 3 8. i know that works behold i set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for that has little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name due to time i can't read the quotes though you have the tapes last year uh ami yami yami papa now for me my my mother my father no no kobe uh coved uh we got coveted truly my symptoms weren't really anything but i had it obligatory so i was under the obligation of quarantine but to my parents it struck them a bit more harder i know here there's some that that got struck by kovitz you can only imagine the effects that they had especially revelation it took about three or four days now i didn't really know what i was looking for but i knew there was something that i was searching for but since i couldn't go to work so i could have i stayed up late to one o'clock in the morning i would study and study and the symptoms were very harsh then i went and i shared it with my parents and my parents told me las gracias truly they gave me the thanks gracias emmanuel thank you because that gives me strength revelation wanted to know what was going to happen with his people it is for 21 days they didn't have an answer but but there was a battle entre los espiritus within the spirit and the prince of persia diaz for 21 days daniel no tenia daniel did not have an answer and he was praying searching for the lord and for 21 days he did not have an answer but finally that finished and gabriel came to daniel it takes you to the new jerusalem [Music] now john speaks about certain tribes foreign a different group after this i beheld and law a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands blancas those were cesar white robes verse 10. and they cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god would sit upon the throne on on to the lamb los angeles now the angels stood around about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne of their faces and worshiped god amen amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be on to our god forever and ever amen and one of the elders answers on to me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and once came they led me answered said to me these are they which came out of the great tribulation have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in this temple and he sat and sitteth on the throne shall do all among them he said they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat now that city would be as hot as phoenix for the lamb which sit which in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them on the living on the living towns of waters and shall god shall wipe away their tears from their eyes here explains what this people is jesus these are the bride taken amongst the gentiles they are
