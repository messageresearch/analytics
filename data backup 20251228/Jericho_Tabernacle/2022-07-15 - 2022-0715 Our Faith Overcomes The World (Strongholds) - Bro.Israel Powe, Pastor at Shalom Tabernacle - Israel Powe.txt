subject strongholds strongholds let's pray Lord Jesus we ask you bless your word and bless your people we ask in Jesus names now how many is happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening I believe the Lord is going to share some very good things with us how many believe that is you come here to look for something good to happen is that right God's got something good for each and every one of us and there again I'd like to thank brother Ordonez for having us the last time I spoke at the Tabernacle here our dear brother Johnny Alvarado was with us my good friend and he challenged me to a race he said I want to challenge you brother Israel to a race he said when we get to the other side I want to race you this is because he didn't want to race me on this side until we get to the other side but I'm so glad that brother Johnny he has finished his race here on Earth and we long to see him again I'd like to greet his family his their wife and his family wherever they may be family as I Was preparing for the service tonight this uh thought on strongholds had God was dealing with me and in the scriptures in Revelations chapter 2. the Bible is talking about the Overcomers that overcome and he talked about how the Believers knew where Satan's seat was and so the prophet takes and he goes in great length talking about what Satan's seat was of course we know those are spiritual things Satan doesn't have a seat that he sits in is talking about how it was Satan's dwelling place and how he had a foothold in this particular place here in pergamas scriptures called it Satan's seat and going further into the message the prophet of God talks about Kentucky his home state is he referred to it as Satan's seat for whiskey and alcohol you talked about how 90 something percent of all the whiskey come through Kentucky that little State it's not that other states didn't have whiskey but this it was more pronounced and more profound in Kentucky and he called it say conceited then he goes further and he talks about Paris France and he chooses Paris France out of all of the other countries on the globe yes identifies Paris France Francia they call it the Rat Hole of the world because from this little place here it would influence the rest of the world is set in the pace for other nations to follow calls it Satan's seat and then he goes further and says that this seed of Satan moved into Hollywood Hollywood and it moved into Hollywood and Hollywood is now Hollywood is and it's influencing the entire world through their movies it influences other nations now this these sins go on every place but it's more pronounced in Hollywood foreign also refers to it as the stronghold of satanos this is a place where it's hard to it would be harder to preach the gospel yes he said that about Kentucky it was the birthplace of whiskey and it was a stronghold for and to preach the gospel in that place was very very difficult and as we look and we think of other cities when you think of San Francisco what do you think of San Francisco San Francisco what do you think of in San Francisco they're known for it homosexuality sexual immorality it's all over the globe but it's more pronounced there is Las Vegas what do you think of Las Vegas think of gambling a prostitution you think of the city life These are these are these are strongholds of satanas now the way the prophet brought to us the spirit world he takes the scripture in Matthew chapter 12 in Luke Chapter 11. any in and these are the words of our Lord Jesus talking about an unclean Spirit when it leaves and brother Brandon gave this instruction in Divine Healing yeah I'm not going to preach long all right you all work with me okay and and if we can refrain from going to the bathroom can you hold it just for a little bit it's almost like some people come to church to hydrate you don't have water at home you get to church that's when I'm gonna drink my water come on you could just take and I won't preach long all right but brother random takes these scriptures of our Lord Jesus and he makes it very Vivid to us Jesus says when an unclean Spirit leaves from a man this isn't a physical thing These Are Spiritual things that take place when an unclean Spirit leaves from a man how many Believers here tonight you used to have one unclean Spirit the spirit that kept you from repenting Spirit every minute had an unclean Spirit on them they had to be delivered and so Jesus Jesus tells us in Matthew chapter 12.00 and in Luke chapter 11 in Lucas what an unclean Spirit leaves from a man he goes into dry places seeking Wrath buscando reposo and when he can't find rest comes back to the house that he left from so it's taken out he can't find another place to go so he goes back to what's familiar with him and when he comes back to this house if it's found cleaned is but it's not filled he brings other Spirits with us seven other Spirits how many understand that in one place brother Branham says he's eight times worse this happens in Divine Healing it also happens when man is making his a step towards God he hears the gospel truth and then the gospel truth takes the unbelief off of him he's delivered and set free for time to go on and receive the holy ghosts the spirit that used to have him bound is coming back Jesus said it will come back and if we come back to the house and call it his house and then the individual is actually worse if they were not filled please don't gloss this over por favor this can't happen to you because you in the message please don't think this doesn't happen to our young people at our campus foreign the prophet of God takes in the message y'all read a quote in the message expectations he says this here is talking about Moses how they started to march with Moses they didn't go very far until they got into some troublemas every time when you start to make a March for God look out you're headed for trouble the devil's going to lay right along the path there to get every foot in he can get he will trip you upsets do everything mean oh I just love to pour the scriptures on him don't you know yes sir say it's written the word of the Lord that's right says the devil hates me they say and I know he hates you too he's my enemy it is but as long as God's my friend I don't have no fear I just drive him right on back take the word of God and move him right on back out is out of the place that he thinks he's holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all absolutely he's just the devil Diablo and a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ yes sir he's whipped in sickness whipped in disappointment he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he's a big old Shadow is how many thank God for that Satan has no legal rights that's God's word to you this is God's word to the Believers Satan hasn't got no legal rights now he has his stronghold and the message expectations brother random says this year amen the prophet of God continues just a couple quotations I want to read for you he says he's talking about the how the nations came together to fight against communism and against uh Hitler yeah and he's talking about this big four conference he says uh uh they wanted to put their armies in a certain place like the Fifth Army in the fourth Army in the tenth Army how they could work together where the enemy had a strongholds and if you notice they always try to hit the spinal cords that's the lifeline yes it's always if you don't you don't kill it and so therefore just one thing to be done it talks about fighting the enemies you want to strike it where it hurts the most and our real weaknesses the real problem for many of our youth today and many of our fathers and mothers today what's the real problem and that real problem has to be hit right at the right at the central part of it you don't you don't want to do this just to look like you're doing okay you don't go up to the altar just to show other people look I'm going to go into church pray just so everybody can know that you're really a spiritual one you this ain't about that but it's finding the spinal cord of the enemy is a general enemy I'm talking about your enemies finding the spinal cord of your enemies to kill the enemy in your life because Jesus paid for delivery and that's for a Believer Jesus so we strike the spots that really hit the hardest yes sir I see us I was listening to a testimony of brother Billy Pauly Paul and and he gives his testimony different times and different ways they talked about how he got away from the Lord and he did all kind of things out there in the world finally he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus on his on his deathbed he was dying he had a major surgery he was up foreign they're just about to operate operate on him he had a rupture in his side and the doctors can do nothing to help him he saw his dad coming to the hospital he says that will you pray for me and brother I didn't do any sinning I'm not going to pray for you you did you do the praying times we think we're going to get out of this without us fighting ourselves sister know how to handle the swords that don't know how to turn their backs and there's a whole population of our youths 15 to 20 years old they're like missing in action okay we got to do a youth meeting for you want to want the youth do your youth meeting for you pray for you when are the young people going to come and pray for me factors foreign [Applause] so brother Billy says his dad told him I didn't do the sinning so you need to do the praying because they're in the hospital bed he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus and was serving the lord he said there was one last thing that he couldn't overcome and that was the cigarettes he said he would smoke ask God to deliver him he would throw him out throw him away and then you find himself back smoking again and this went on for some time yes the cigarettes were a stronghold to him but he said that one day they were on on the road traveling together and he had a pack of cigarettes in his pocket there on the side this is and he said he thought he would try to slide him down just a little bit and he thought he could hide him from his dad but he said you couldn't hide nothing from my dad he said brother he's like he said yeah because see he said right at that moment he took those cigarettes out and he threw him out of the car they're driving down the road like this here what did you just throw out the window yeah I threw those cigarettes I threw those cigarettes and the cigarette lighter out the windows have you ever done that before yes many times this is where you sincere when you did it he turned the car around and went back to where the cigarette pack was and he says Billy you you committed this to Lord many times let's set let's set a memorial here and he never took another one I thought that was beautiful how to deal with strongholds you know the scriptures in Hebrews chapter 12 it calls them sins that so easily beset us is Hebrews chapter 12. it says this here Lisa seeing we are compassionate about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in every sin which does so easily be said brother random called these sins he talks of Moses he says Moses is besetting sin this is and that was that was the thing that constantly came up it constantly bothered him brother random talks about the woman at the well he says he says go get your husband he found her trouble foreign he says maybe you got an Affliction maybe you got a habit maybe somebody said in sin that you can't lay down something has blocked your road he calls that a besetting sin is something that you can't lay down in one place it said it's something you can't overcome it's it's something that keeps coming up it's it's the thing that easily upsets you is Gusta he prays a prayer and he says this here in his prayer God I pray that you'll answer every one of their requests they're standing here now their heads are bowed their hearts bowed you're their God they're confessing they're wrong they're wanting to be right Lord they want all belief taken from them let their little be said in sin that does so easily upset them let it be taken from them tonight and never to return again I love those prayers because there's a finality to them we don't want to learn how to live with our sins we want to be able to divorce from ourselves some of us sitting here tonight no doubt have some strongholds in our lives they're spirits that get on you they hang on they block you from going further into the law is but we need to serve notice on the devil tonight that you want to make the Rapture no matter what it takes no matter what it calls Lord whatever it takes to get me ready for the rapture us to pray a prayer like that desire a prayer with the Lord our time is really winding up we only got a few more of these Services left but there ardonians and if we can see the judgments that are coming to the Nations because we don't have another generation this is not the time to play Church this is not the time to live with a devil Diablo amen we need to drive down the stake not next week not in the special meeting not when the choir say not when everybody else gets up you need the purpose in yourself to get off of me tonight amen that's where we're at takes is can I take a few more moments I'm just about done I just want to lay a few things in here the prophet of God makes this statement here he makes a statement in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief it says when God speaks to a man hombre he has Faith he has ambition he has purpose when God speaks to a man he gives them a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him ambition when God speaks to a man he gives him Faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose is in life but God called him to do has called us to be in the Church of God Amen I love that he gives them ambition what's this word ambition mean strong desire to achieve something this is typically require find determination and hard work it's a determination to achieve success when God speaks to A man gives them it gives them an ambition it gives them something that he's fighting for fighting too he's not in the days he's not a zombie he's not in a trance like many of our people out here in this nation they all look like they're high okay foreign foreign [Music] Christo I'm just a little guy here just trying to witness to you again I can't pray on my knees I've been want to get into some ball games and wake up and want to get into some politics or something I can't hear the prophet's message the gospel to us foreign God bless you so much my hourglass of my life has been flipped up like this whether ordonias my time is wine and yes I know that is I got to leave from here and what do I want to leave back what am I going to leave at what you know I want to preach a flowery sermon everybody that like me how do I want to be able to stand before the son of man okay time to pick up your Bibles read it until it makes you cry until it gets down in your bones you to an Old-Fashioned repentance [Music] come on our faith overcomes the world God bless you young people so much let me read this quote here the prophet God says a man one time was trying to seek God and every time he'd say I'm saved the devil would say no you're not one day he drove down the stake he says from this time on I'll point to this state this is the place what does god require of you what does god require of you this requires Lord I'm sorry you know the Lord Jesus Christ died so that you can be and all you got to do is help me help me are you the man I know I'm doing wrong but help me I shouldn't go this way but help me do that you drive down the stakes and you point right back to it amen amen Ma I have so many quotes so many places but I was reading this um one of the doctors from the Stanford University Robert I think is how he says his name and Dr Roberts yeah he was talking about the The Wiles of the internet and the social media yeah now everybody rolled their eyes yeah I'm gonna get on it the social media the Facebook Twitter Instagram the Snapchat the Snapchat they listed 13 of the the most popular ones the engineers that create these devices they have the attention Engineers that are that that created these devices to keep your attention focused on them and he uses this phrase he called it the the magic of maybe yes it calls it a fragmented attention that you constantly like maybe somebody sent me a text or maybe but somebody sent me an email maybe so they got to continually in this fragment it that your your attention is on your phone but yeah we're eating having lunch together but you keep looking at your phone um none of y'all have this problem here but the the magic of maybe maybe is maybe some and once yes you look and nobody snapped you or nobody sent you a message and then you go back and you look again and nobody snapped you or said you know it gives you a little reward there maybe they did what got me now these are not preachers these are these are scientists these are Educators what got me was was this right here the one doctor said that that this fragmented attention where you're you're in it but then you're out of it then you're back in it and out of it it says this can permanently reduce capacity to concentrate and he said permanently and I thought wow that's that's pretty strong and they talked about the depression that goes along with it and how people can't focus I steady on one thing or advertising and all the things that are trying to sell us all the time and then your attention is all fragmented you got to fidget you got to get up you got to walk around you gotta do something and this constant fragmentation that we can't keep your attention you want this service to be like a TV program you can fast forward television acceleration fast forward to the song special to see who's in the crowd definitely fast forward the preaching if definitely let's get right to the let's all stand and be ready to be dismissed everybody the preaching is going on it's just white noise but his coming is nearer than it than it ever was and this really this really shocked me yes that the doctors are saying this is and then we wonder why I'm going to say this here and it might be a little irresponsible but I'm going to say it because I feel too irresponsible and if it's wrong it's wrong but I really I really feel this there's some of us here that will never go further with god with the social media you're not you're not going to get no further with God whatever is between you and the Lord that is your god it seems hard that you think you need it and your parents think you need it too Israel what am I going to do if I don't have an email what am I going to do if I don't have a Facebook account maybe read okay what did you do before you had tenerless what all the humans is going to stop existing yeah but holy spirit what you need to do in your life yes that is the problem with so many of our youths you can't live without it but that's a problem right there I say that humbly no they're gonna meet them and say that responsibly of being in prayer over it some of you do not go any further unless some of the garbage social media stardom you me yes and constantly connected with the new movie all right now now nobody's paying me to say that all right and I'll take it to my Graves you'll not go further God is the only thing that's the most important thing to you in your account he's got to be the most important day temperature it's a stronghold for many of us I'm a local little Pastor I pray and I see things on me and you got to hit it at the nerves you're addicted oh you're addicted you're addicted to it if you're not addicted to it then let it goes God bless you brother don't you say that okay he's my partner and the soldier in the Faith Lord is my boss that's my boss this is and I only have two or three more opportunities maybe some of you are going to listen to what I just told you come if you will not that's your choice option foreign I think my hour is about yeah let me read something to you from the prophets you can find it here quickly mm-hmm yes here here is an answer to your stronghold to your besetting sins it's found in the Old Testament Psalms chapter 16. this is David says I've put the lord always before me I have set the lord always before me that I would not stand against him here's brother Brandon's prayer he's part of the prayer he says this here he knows all things he knows your heart and you know what and you know what you're thinking he does too he says if they're if there's a little sin hanging on you tonight and you wouldn't want to go in the presence of God with that on you you said would you once more raise up your hand and say brother Brandon pray for me excuse me says I want to be in the presence in his presence at that day guiltlessension God bless you many hands God sees it is now I'll tell you what you do just listen closely do like David did put the Lord before you right now put the Lord between you and that sinan whatever that little besetting Center it might be lying it might be stealing it might be evil thinking it might be temper it might be drinking it might be smoking it might be gambling I don't know what it might be less it might be anything I don't know what it is whatever it is put the Lord before then your heart will rejoice and your flesh shall rest in hope is for you know that Christ promised he raised up again in the last days when he comes forth we'll come in his likenessa amen amen we'll take one more scripture in second Corinthians chapter 10. yes number three two five [Music] thank you for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christo how many thank God for that these what's up accounts Facebook either Facebook Instagram Instagram Snapchat Snapchat tick tock tick tock Twitter you know Twitter Pinterest Pinterest the list goes on and on and and they're not going to tell you what the word of God is going to tell you our faith overcomes the world our faith in the world overcomes the world God bless you so much my prayer for you today is this is that God will speak to you because when God speaks to a man he gives him faith he gives him ambition ambition he gives them something to do when God speaks to a man he gives them a purpose when God speaks
