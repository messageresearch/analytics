may the lord bless the reading of his word we like to thank the lord and also thank our pastor for allowing us to to speak to speak god's word this evening man this evening i have a real odd uh title to her message this evening i like to put it as are you certain or amen i'm in i'd like to ask every single one of you that question i want to ask it first to the young people and then listening to a message from our prophet yes titled be certain of god and then i was hearing a message of or my apostle brother bernie garcia mensah it says mankind is having a nervous breakdown and i felt that the lord spoke to me there is antique and i want to share with you what the lord gave me here in the scripture in saint john 14. lord jesus christ says peace i live with you el senor jesus there's people that can't sleep at night they go to work and they have no peace they try to go to sleep and they they have no peace so they go to drugs or alcohol or or some outlet and a recurrent and to come to a point where they just end up killing themselves because they can't have peace and the world today they try or they they they try to fake that piece and how do you say that brother louise what makes you think that the world gives peace i hope your heart is not troubled today your heart might be troubled about your son maybe your heart is troubled because of your family your grandchildren your husband you're always constantly thinking about it jesus says but rather neither let it be afraid amen that's very it's easier said than done but that's why i asked this question to you are you certain or are you nervous amen i hope you're not as nervous as i am yes but if you are that's fine it makes me feel okay the the the definition of the word certain uh definition [Music] those questions to maybe you can answer that question question to yourself more assured are you certain or are you nervous the world is very nervous today and the people are getting nervous the people don't know what to do there's people that that have a understanding of what's going on what's going many on think that russia is the antichrist but russia is not the antichrist russia russia was was raised up not by an angel no puruna not by the the third best angel of god not by michael or by gabriel miguel gabriel russia was raised up by god himself raised the owner himself comes to you and talks to you it's the same thing with russia he went straight to russia and russia accepted that challenge what is that what is that challenge to destroy the united states but are you certain or are you nervous what are you what are you nervous about the question are you nervous about russia are you nervous about the rapture or are you certain are you sure it says rejoice in the lord alway he didn't say that rejoice in the lord sometimes the things are good rejoice in the lord he says rejoice [Applause] don't one thing is and supplication thing is thanksgiving so here he says don't be scared about anything but if you have need of something pray about it and when i surrender i surrender this need on to you lord necessity it seems impossible what i'm asking to you it seems what it's what i'm asking for you lord it's it's it's it's impossible to for man to give but let your request be known unto god don't just pray about it don't just do it with supplications but say god thank you lord but sermon the peace of god is la paz and so then who has peace only god has peace with passage all understanding but remember it's the peace of god james 1 james chapter 1 verse 2. in santiago capitol university my brethren count it all you know we're always joyful when things are always going good when when we get a good paycheck and our family is it's fine innus but in james verse chapter

the appearing of christ of jesus christ with fire yes appear amen so again an ounce of gold today until i'm gonna speak a little bit i'm gonna go a little bit of a sharp turn i'm gonna speak a little bit of elijah now here where i'm going to take off is where eliza elijah just finished with the widow woman and she had no food yeah there was a wicked woman by the name of jezebel this woman killed the prophets of god and elijah was there and he was quiet down for a couple for a while and ahab and obadiah e akabi abdi abbadaya was a governor he saw how jezebel cut the heads off of these prophets there was a famine in the land and he said okay you go this way and i'm going to go that way we're going to make sure we can get everything ready because we can have food for our our livestock is looking for you and made those nations swear to know that you to tell the truth and here on the 17th verse ahab saw elijah alias they have said on to him what are you doing here who troubleth israel so here is ahab uh accusing elijah to be troubling israel israel art that trouble with israel and he said i have not troubled israel but you in your father's house have trouble israel you have forsaken the commandments of the lord you have followed balaam now he said gather all the all the all of israel onto mount carmo the prophets of baal and the 450. and all those prophets that sit in jezebel's table and elijah came to the people here what elijah's doing he's making a challenge are you certain or are you nervous and it says if the lord be god follow him my question is for the young people follow him and it says you pick yourself but don't set it on fire but for god has to answer bullock that was given to them and they dressed it up you know how you dress yourself come on you put your little tie on it put your dress on what these prophets were doing they were dressing up the altar and they call the name of belle from morning until noon that's a long time when does the morning actually start cuando coming in maybe about six in the morning so they were calling the name of bell for about four or five hours six hours and this is and they were saying oh so is is the scripture says nothing happened nothing happened elijah told the people come here and then elijah started to repair the altar of the lord around the altar imagine this is the altar right here elijah grabbed the shovel and he made a trench around it he cut the bollock up to pieces and he says go bring me four barrels of water four barrels of water [Applause] in israel and that i am thy servant and i've done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me respond to me then the scripture says then the fire of the lord fell upon without messing up any of the nerves sin disoriented and when the people saw it do we still deny the presence of the lord when we see something like that the people they fell on their faces you're hey when they saw that elijah said go give me all those prophets none of them run away and elijah killed all those prophets it is i'm going to fast forward but ahab went to jezebel aka told them everything because she was the boss so jezebel said does he think he is a cricket i have a big denomination i have a big church who does he think he is in secret he doesn't even have a bank account and she sent down the messenger yeah she even jezebel has messengers she has profits jezebel sent the messenger go tell elijah do queso you ran he felt nervous so scared he felt nervous he was he was right there in the presence of god then finally after he done proved that god was god god came down and vindicated that he was god then he had a nervous breakdown entonces nervosa there might be some of you have nervous breakdown you're maybe nervous but it's something that you you have to let god control have you ever felt suicidal content great prophet elijah felt suicidal and he prayed god to take his life 40 days and nights he was out there in the wilderness wandering around and god found him and pulled them back in the cave somewhere you might not seem like you're perfect i seem you are still god's children you don't lose value just like you grab a hundred dollar bill i can wrinkle that hundred dollar bill still has value the young man went to the furnace speaking of speaking about fire hablando notice just a minute now give me your close attention and pray i
