everything to him [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] my this is [Music] just as you are standing if we can open our bibles to luke 18 verse 9. lucas diciocho and the bible says and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others [Music] is that it two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other republicans [Music] the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as are the men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as a republican come on and the publicans standing far off would not lift up so much as his eyes into heaven but smote upon his breasts saying god be merciful to me a sinner you know those vessels [Music] [Music] [Music] i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalts himself shall be a base and the humbleth himself shall be exalted [Music] our precious lord heavenly father salvador even though there might be good things that we can do on our own that's not the attitude that we want to take yes we want to come humbly before you get i pray that you bless the service and may you give a portion to every one of your children for we ask for these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen uh this evening i'm going to continue with that the series of the tabernacle this is uh i'm going to speak about the altar that's in the tabernacle now the one thing that i want you to notice about the these two men it was two men that went to the temple temple a man that was humbling himself he represents a sinner el represented and the pharisee he represents the religious center he also represents the hypocrite now the republican our public it says that he he wouldn't even dare to look up to heaven now i want to read this quote from brother branham brother branham says in the message hidden life with christ he says now the outer courts represented justification the which was there water baptism the lever sit out there yes where they washed before they ministered now if you study the tabernacle you can find that the tabernacle is in three uh in three phases and then you have the holy place and then you have the holy of holies now so this republican when he was praying he was praying outside [Music] because the bible says that he would he was so so repentant that he would not even dare to look up to heaven here if we look up we can only see the ceiling in the temple in the temple when they would go into the holy place to the holy place you can only see curtains around you cortinas but you cannot see the sky but so this man the place that he was at he was in the outer courts he was in justification in justification because the bible says that when he humbled himself before the lord and he asked god he has god for uh for mercy jesus said that he was justified jesus so this man was in the outer courts and he was praying and he repented now in the outer courts you have two pieces of furniture and [Music] fuente now brother branham says in the message dedication of building to the lord he says and even the furniture that was inside the walls everything spoke of christ all the furniture in the building typed christ such as the laverne como la fuente where the sacrifice was washed the brass altar where it was slain and burned and the brass even in the altar speaks of judgment divine judgment now the two men that were in the temple they were in the outer courts and both were praying and one man judged himself he judged himself worthy before god but the other man judged himself and he found that he was a sinner and he was asking for mercy in control that's why those two pieces of furniture that are on the outside yourself before god tennis so when you come to the altar you must come with a humble attitude not an arrogant attitude now brother branham says in the exposition of the seven church ages the patmos vision exposition de patmos he says the foundation of the altar of sacrifice was solid brass el fundamento del altar de sacrificio era de bronte solido typifying the lamb's slain from before the foundation of the world typically judgment had already passed upon him when he was yet when as yet there was no sinners decreed now the reason why that that altar was made of brass that's why there's a scripture in the bible that says that jesus christ was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world lord and it's represented in those two pieces of furniture where it's judgment first you need to judge yourself that's why it says peter says he says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ it represents the altar represented and the word baptized represents the lever representative so what peter is saying he's giving you the process he's giving you the process to enter into the temple of the lord because once you understand the furnitures that are in the temple then you can understand different parts of the bible now the altar uh brother branham says in the message he swore by himself he says now brass represents divine judgment representative not earthly judgment or mental judgment or juicio mental but divine judgment divino sees the brass altar the altar where the sacrifices was burnt was made of brass and it means that it was divine insignifica that is where the divine price was paid for now brother branham says in another message he says all things he says that was the lane the lamb for god that was the lamb of god for all of adam's race that takes away the sin of the world soon that lamb was nailed to his altar cross that's why if you ever want to go into the temple of the lord you have for you first have to repent at the altar and you have to accept accept what jesus did for you at the crosstalk so that's why it's the first furniture that's there because for the first thing that any christians should ever do is accept jesus as their savior if they don't do that first part correctly you when you come to the altar and you repent from your heart it doesn't mean that you have the holy ghost yeah it's simply just starting the process for you to get the holy ghost that's why peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and he shall receive the gift of the holy spirit it's something that's up ahead in the future now the burning it's uh depending on the person some a person when they repent they can receive the holy ghost immediately one example that i know of unexploded is sister lisa santana santana have you ever heard her testimony testimonial because when you come to the altar you have to repent and you have to confess your sin you have to let go of everything in the world and if and if anyone has ever done anything against you you're even willing to forgive that person because just as christ forgave you so you forgive everyone else and sister lisa is a really good example of someone who receives it immediately if you if you ever get the chance you should hear her testimony because she received it what i believe she received it immediately okay just in one service she got it it took me around 14 15 days uh i had my experience at the altar experience in my room on august 21st and that day i repented of my sins i confess everything that i did wrong yo confessed and i was willing to leave everything behind yo i wasn't going to try to change my own self no intent i knew that god was going to be the one that was going to change me jose they decide to become a christian they see them cristiano because they're either born in the message or maybe they have friends that are part of the message and so they come to church and don't say hello because afterwards they'll hang out with each other but if you really want to be a true christian you have to make a decision for yourself and it's going to be a painful decision when you come to the cross when you come to the altar it's going to be so painful so painful tan doloroso just as it was so painful for jesus when he died and it was it was really it was a really painful decision that he made before he ever went to the cross antes la cruz before he went to the altar he made a decision a decision and because he made that decision many people decide many people say they they're they're christians and they they decide that they will become christians a few issues come up with a with a sister or a brother or sometimes they have issues in their own life and and they say oh god doesn't love me oh yeah because he's letting all these things happen to me you want to know why those things are happening god is testing your decision dios because they're telling god i'll become a christian christian i'll follow you yota and then god begins to test their decision and then they leave him the decision is is the most important thing that you have to make the decision is important it has to be a sincere decision from the heart it doesn't mean that you're born again no significa it just means that you're starting the process and you're willing to go through the process it doesn't matter how much it hurts you have decided that you're going to follow jesus but it's the most important part is that you have to be determined no matter what happens you're going to follow him even though this happens or this happens and this happens if god loved you he wouldn't let you go through all these things but really what god is doing he's testing your decision we have to be people of our word and if it's not easy all the times we're still going to follow him that's why the altar is the first furniture in the temple temple now for me in my experience and the i received my uh my altar experience august 21st that day i was i was alone in my house and i i i got so i had so much conviction because i i felt that i left god and so that day and i started confessing everything and i was even determined to do things that god wanted me to do that i for many years was was so against it one example is that i i never wanted to be a preacher [Music] and you can ask my parents you can ask my friends that's different from the people that are sitting in the piece and i've seen i've seen a lot of that so i in my heart for many years john and i would always say to myself there is no way god can force me to become a preacher because i'm the one that has to decide to come up here and speak before the people but that day on august 21st when i was at the altar remember it's something that is ugly it's something that's painful yes but it's absolutely necessary necessary for a christian cristiano they first have to come to the altar primero and die there emory now you you die on the decision that you make in the decision you're not born again yeah no it is you could be born again in the next few minutes but the way that you die is that you make a decision that you're going to die to the world es primeramente acer una decision that's the most important part for a christian yes and i was confessing and i was willing to do thing i was livi i was willing to leave things that i knew were not for a christian christian and lord i i remember i i said to the lord i said lord i'll i'll serve you ladies and then i said i'll even preach if you want me too that was a really hard decision for me this is difficult for me because i was so against it i never liked the worship that a minister receives just because you're a minister the people treat you even more special than a normal person that's sitting in the pews person and i i never really liked that i mean and so i never want and i don't like receiving attention you but i said lord if you want me to i'll i'll even preach if you want perro because in that year and even in the years before that i i would have an anointing that would come upon me i mean i knew i wasn't living right and i didn't want to become a preacher so i said i'm not going to do it and there was a lot of people that would ask me emmanuel why don't you preach even brother johnny would ask me and i would say no brother johnny it's not for me brother johnny one time uh we were in the office he would uh saturday nights he would stay up really late studying for his messages sometimes i would receive his notes like at three or four in the morning and so one day he walks in and i'm already in the office and he's he sits down and he and he says oh i don't want to preach today he says and then he looks at me hilo memira and he says emmanuel what would you do if me and you we go up to the to the pulpit and then i would say you know what brothers i'm not going to preach today emanuel is going to preach for you today what would you do emmanuel because after i say that i'll walk down so that was a really hard decision for me to make santos so my experience at the altar experience was on august 21st because remember you have to be sincere when you make your decision so that day was a friday so i said so i had that that experience in the morning at noon so this is and he was revealing a lot of the things that i said in my prayers and i was right next to him i was thinking how do you know all that just happened you weren't there i was just by myself how do you know that yo so i knew it was god talking because he wasn't there so he began to say a lot of the things that i said in my prayer entonces so that caught my attention and then luis said something that that i knew was my answer and that answer was yes sincere sincero you have to be sincere and it's going to hurt a lot it's really going to be painful the more you go into the world when god calls you it's gonna it's really gonna hurt to leave everything that you liked in the world but it's something that's absolutely necessary god looks at your decision he doesn't look at the sin that you made he sees the decision that you make el mirola that's why with the two men foreign [Music] you remember brother branham before he started his new ministry he he had that experience with that with the angel at the cave and one thing that the angel told him is that you have to be sincere when you pray i've never said this before but i'll say it today and brother branham talks about when that angel when was talking with him in the cave the angel was telling him the different signs that he was going to have in his ministry the first one was going to be the sign in the hand and and then he says the next one is that he was going to be able to discern the hearts and brother branham says so in my experience told me yet with sister lisa it happened like this but with me it took me around two weeks september the 5th of september there's a park near my house it has a it has a tall wall and what i would do for years i would go to that park and hear tapes i would i would i would do it for hours just to study english and spanish just to become a better interpreter and then to be able to do some exercises so that day on the fifth yard cinco uh that day was a saturday yes that day um me and joshua alvarado were going to go to a service with brother bob willard hermano bob willard he was having special services but before before we went to the services uh i went to that park yofia and in that park i was listening to tapes and as i was listening to the tapes the the second tape that i listened to is called the sign of the messiah and if you study the message he says the sign of the messiah is revealing the secrets of the heart and so when i was there i stopped playing yo deje de jugar and i sat under a tree ima center back and i just started listening to brother branham he commented that desire was that i i wanted to be discerned i wanted brother banham to talk to me so what i did is i sat down right under that tree entonces and then brother branham he just said when when someone is discerned personally and god simply would use brother branham he did implement to talk to them very quickly and they would finally get their answer after many years of waiting so i had been waiting for a lot of years entonces for five years actually for cinco anos so that day brother bannon he's he's discerning people entonces elementary he's almost towards the end of the tape yes and he says he says i see a man praying sincerely he says standing there he's a preacher so i knew that was my answer because that was the decision i made just a few weeks before this is really important the decision that you make important to assess if your decision isn't right [Music] if your decision is not made on the basis that you want to follow christ and then it's not a right decision correct if you just say i'm going to become a christian christian just because you felt the presence of the lord no masculinity whether you feel the presence of the lord or whether you feel the presence of the devil in your life because when you make a decision the devil makes a decision he's going to start attacking your mind so that day brother branham said i see a man praying sincerely [Music] but as soon as you said the word sincerely i didn't have time to think you know my body just reacted reaction i started crying come and see i've never cried like that in all my life i was the tape was already over la cinta terminado and i was still crying for like 10 more minutes it was so ugly estaba but that is the most beautiful experience i've ever had so don't be ashamed to let god touch you okay because when he touches you you might cry ugly is that unfair but you need that experience so that day when he said when he said i see a man praying sincerely my body just simply reacted my cuerpos implemented i started crying and crying and crying i had mucus coming out of my nose i had to go around the tree and blow out the bloated mucus and then i i had no more tears i said oh thank god i'm not gonna cry anymore and then the tears will come back again that that experience lasted about 20 25 minutes yes and i had nothing to do with it so i had my experience in the holy of holies but it's all based on your decision you have to make a decision a decision not on emotions that's where a lot of people make that mistake there's so many people just because they felt the presence of the lord at church or the the song that was sung was so beautiful or the preacher he what he said was so awesome people people decide to become christians based on the wrong decision embarrassed you have to decide that you're going to follow him in the good times buenos and more importantly in the bad times because as soon as as soon as a little problem comes up it's god testing your decision to decision we have to be like ruth the name of ruth ruth she made a decision one day una decision that she was going to leave her entire world behind her and she told her mother-in-law he says wherever you go i'll go boy wherever you die i will die says your god will be my god said that she was justified in when she made that decision she didn't receive what we could say the baptism of the holy ghost until later on because it was only a type in the natural porque typical but brother adam says when she made her decision she was justified she wasn't born again so when you're when you make your decisions sincerely from your heart conotus because he knows that you're committing sin elsa to if you make the right decision then god will guide you to the next stage and then because you made the right decision then god will guide you to to the baptism of the holy ghost that's where a lot of people make their mistake they come to the altar based on emotions not a decision remember there was two women it was ruth and orfa both of them were crying both of them were were having emotions because they just lost all the men in their family junta avian peridot and then orf and then uh naomi logo naomi started to test their decision they said we'll go with you we'll go we'll go with you that's what they said but then naomi said no no that's fine you can go back to your land and so orpha decided okay that's fine i'll go back to my land only had emotions ruth had more than just emotions ruth made a clear decision he says wherever you go i'll go hey yo whatever you eat i'll eat lo que tu comas it's going to be a painful process it's going to be really painful for you but in your heart you have a determination of determination to keep going forward if that decision is the right one that you're willing to be a christian christian and you're willing to follow christ and even though there's problems along the way he's going to take you from justification to sanctification and then he's going to take you from sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost that's that's really what i to what i want to emphasize the decision cause i had i had a lot of notes and i haven't even touched them because that altar is a is a painful altar it's an ugly altar that altered the brass altar it speaks of the cross and where jesus when he died at the cross it was the most horrible thing that you could see it was absolutely necessary it absolutely necessary because he shed his and then he's going to start using you to help judgment you judge yourself by the word and then you you find that you're a sinner you humble yourself before the lord and remember god can see the future record and god knows your decision is true so god can see that in the future when the problems begin to come con problems you can in your mind you can go back to that day that you have that experience and you say no i decided that i was going to be with him i decided that i'm gonna follow him but it's all based on that decision if you don't make the right decision then you yourself you're gonna want to go to sanctification but you're going to be like that pharisee you're going to be arrogant a few weeks ago we played a tape brother talks about how uh he he would always have these thoughts am i serving the lord correctly i don't know have any of you had those thoughts before ever since i had my experience there's a question i've been able to see things in the message and in the bible that years before i was never able to see okay but yet the devil attacks me every [Music] haven't received the baptism of the holy spirit that's what he tells me you're not born again that's why you can see all these things in the message is because i can see the world that i was living in i could see all the different things that were happening to me i said you know what he's probably right so for a few months i was doubting myself i was thinking did god make me go through all that stuff why am i struggling in my mind like this is foreign and i tell the devil diablo [Music] okay he did take me to sanctification but i promised him that i would serve him even though i'm in sanctification i'm still gonna serve him and one day he's gonna take me to the baptism of the holy ghost it's all based on your decision even though the devil can lie to you and he can make you believe that you're not in the stage where you really are yeah you can go back to the decision that you made one day i so even though i'm not where i should be i'm gonna keep going that's why that decision is so important because the devil will come and he will play with your mind he's going to come bring he's going to bring message quotes he's going to he's going to tell you scriptures of the bible and he's going to tell you see the bible says this the message says [Music] even though the devil every day he comes and attacks you that's why that altar is the first furniture in the temple because you have to accept what jesus did for you and you have to be so determined that you're gonna keep going forward it's all based on your decision estate brother branham had a lot of difficulties in his life he disobeyed god and god took away his his wife and his daughter and he even wanted to take his own life but god wouldn't let him but he made a decision one day that he was going to follow jesus you have to keep moving forward because it's it's a really painful process it's going to hurt you so bad just like i heard jesus christ before he got to the cross they were spitting on him they were torturing him they put a crown of thorns on his head the spinas but he made a decision he says lord if it's possible let this cup pass from me okay but let your will be done jesus made a decision one day jesus and even though he suffered so much and it was so painful for him yesterday he was able to save us because of it you you can only see what's going around you right now you can't see the future but god is bringing you right now to the altar he's he's trying to force you to make a decision and sometimes he'll even let you be so close to death that's why it's gonna hurt you so bad it's going to be so painful but just keep going forward don't make your decision just because you felt the anointing don't make your decision no decision just because you had an emotion because you spoke in tongues because you were crying make a decision because you simply want to follow him and you love him just keep moving forward many of you can please stand in the piano brother branham he talks about how people come to the altar at the church he says he doesn't like to make an altar call it he himself said that most likely in the future he would make an altar because when a minister is trying to force you to the altar he's trying to base it on emotions he's trying to base it well all an altar of decision now if you listen to brother bannon's messages when he's praying for people and discerning them sometimes he has the people right there he has them right there in the altar but then sometimes he can see that he says that light yeah that light of that angel is is going towards the audience so it doesn't really matter if you come here or you're over there it's your faith and it's your decision i know i know of sisters here yo conosco de hermanas aqui that were praying for a baby and they received they received an experience right in the pews it was right it was based on their decision they said they felt the fire of god one sister one of them was on this side and the other one was on this side and one felt it she was praying for a baby and the baby is not born and now the other one pray for and she's over there and now she's pregnant but it's it's based on a painful decision it's going to hurt you so bad but it's absolutely necessary but it is necessary let's bar hats including lord jesus christ we want to confess our sins amen we don't deserve your grace to gracias so lord let us make a decision tonight [Music] lord allow us to make a genuine sincere decision we have to make the decision [Music] [Music] but we have a decision that we have to make a decision that we're going to follow even when we feel the presence of the devil and the devil's tempting us [Music] and then god you took you took care of the rest of us help us lord to make a decision every day even though everything is against us even though the devil comes in our mind and he tells us that he doesn't love you why is he letting you go through this we and i'ma keep serving [Music] it's going to hurt them so much because they're living everything that they loved in the world but there's so much that you want to give us help them make the decision for the right reason [Music] and allow them to be faithful to their decision even though [Music] in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen
