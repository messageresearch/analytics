if you'd be so kind [Music] it's nice to see all of your smiling faces it's nice that we don't some there's still a mask it's nice that the ones who don't have masks amen joshua 1 chapter 1 verse 6. amen let's read the scripture and it says be strong enough good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance to the of the land which i swear on to their fathers to give them a only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not it from the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper with sever thou goest yes this book of the law shall now the part of the out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night and thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success father lord this evening we come close on to your throne of grace and mercy lord we come with confidence lord because of the sacrifice your son made on the cross lord may you help us as we're gathered here in this place you relax as lord you help the young people and everyone that's here today with this message lord be prosperous for our lives may be a benefit to us lord this evening we're going to continue on the message and [Music] thank the lord that he has allowed us to speak on a friday to bring this to the young people this is something of key importance to young people's lives and i think that's a very interesting word um we as we read the scripture here in joshua and if we read it verse by verse once again but let's just read it just let's break it down and let's see what the scripture says and verse says excuse me verse verse six and then says it says be strong of good courage right off the bat you tell us to be strong and have good courage so when something presents to us in our life now i know there's young people here that are in school and there's some that are not in school but the scripture is telling us in spanish i like what it says it says make the effort the first that's the first word in spanish be strong make make an effort now like i said take what i'm saying in the natural but also take the spiritual and thou mayest observe to do according to all the law so he's telling us make sure that you you fulfill the scriptures the law that what moses wrote down and tons now you have the word right there what moses wrote but now he's telling you don't turn to the right hand it is or to the left mia you see there's a balance a unequilibro so so people you believe that people should go to school now we're going to see where brother branham says he look at this no i'm not the ones who were here last week we we spoke on and we're going to review and we're going to speak on other things now you have the word you got the bible right here placed before you arrested god is telling you fulfill everything that's in that book but don't go to the right hand and don't go to the left don't go too much to over here too much over here but stay centered now people might say well brother i see that young man do this i see that minister do that let them do what they do but don't do what they do remember what jesus told his disciples said should we listen to them that are speaking the word listen to them and say what they do but don't do what so if you see someone do something that's outside of the word [Music] is [Music] he might justify his excuses don't follow that minister because he did something that's outside of the word and he tries to justify his excuse do now verse 8 but this book is what book que libro the bible but this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth nunca we're talking here about the the keys of success right here right here just these three script these three verses right here you don't have to go to seminars and listen to these successful speakers all you got to do is just read that scripture this book is depart out of your mouth now we should never stop speaking about it now now it also says but thou shalt meditate observe to do according to all that is written therein guards speak of the word hable de la palabra think on the word so you can try to do everything that's in that word for then says thou shall make thy way prosperous prosper and thou shalt make thy way prosperous is i'm speaking in english because it's a youth service and i want the youth to listen first in english it says and thou shall have good success last week the prophet t talked to us and told us there's two types of success those definitely there's the success of the world el cito del mundo there's a right success a success that comes from god and here yes the scripture is telling us now i wrote some little things here by coincidence that's seven points that just came to my mind success is if anyone wants to look to the future and go to school there's absolutely nothing wrong with that absolutely going to get a college degree universitarian masters and doctorates just that education doesn't get in the way of god's word amen but you should go look first look for success in school miniatures back in the 70s in the 80s and the 90s los ministros there's some people that go to school for three to four five six eight years and then they don't even use their degrees right i've known people that are barbers personas and they went to school to become whatever they wanted to be foreign and they didn't make enough money with that degree in and study something you're not going to work on convience is to look for something that you will be financially stable is make sure that you get a degree and you that degree is successful now success and finances finances that's a really interesting subject he knows how this works he knows how that works he knows finances if anyone has any struggle with that [Music] we have a pastor by god's grace that god has given him the capacity to learn those stuff to know how to manage our finances finances last week i said i believe with all of my heart there should be enough funds in our account and how does all of that come into play you put god first put god's word first where now mommy and daddy can't pay for your bills anymore now you have to find a job and you have but i believe that we should have success in our finances now success in choosing a spouse now that is a success [Music] and you meditate on god's word and choosing a spouse when you have you when you choose the right spouse you will prosper us a success in raising a family in a famiglia man come to a point where a young man is becomes independent you're independent you have to now your mom doesn't have to take you to the to the shower to shower you alright you're independent we're going to come to a time where now it's going to come to a stage of dependence where some are going to depend on you personally your wife is going to depend on you and then the kids are going to depend on you is dependent on this oh you got to have a good and you have to lead him to the feet of the lord you can't lead someone to the feet of the lord if you're not surrendered to the future um something you heard about for so many years something that you've heard about that you've heard about but truly that's a success in receiving the holy ghost when you pray on something and god answers contestants and it makes you feel good your faith just goes up and you you say man i'm doing something right you know this is i hope you love the lord okay um let's read a quote we read this quote last week i believe all of us have a thirst for something but the ram says this element of branham these thirsts are just natural esta solamente is natural they're natural for the christians cristiano they're natural for the human being they're normal for the people and for even us christians christians there's also a thirst for success for alexito there's a thirst for that ayuna so many people today how we school for this thirst we just noticed they started the university up no centenary and we go down there and people spend thousands of dollars to send their children to school and to universities and colleges and so forth to get an education notice what happens to be successful what i call it in la vida but now i have nothing against that contradiction has nothing against schools in education education says that's all right this is i want you to notice i want you to listen very closely what brother brown says but to me who's that you're paula branham you can get all the schooling in the world and you still haven't found the right success okay because that will just temporarily make things a little easier for you here porque esto solamente because that's going to make your life a little easier here on earth that's not the right success to me but you leave all the diploma is the diploma and they've all that a-s-u and u of a they call the a-s-u e-u of a leave all that community college behind you damien de cal de la universidad communitaria doctorate that master degree and this entire economy that we have because that's not the right type of success correct there's a right success and there's a success of the world that's not the right success yes they think they've done it all once they have a degree today last week we spoke about a young man i like this right here that jesus christ he didn't point to himself he says i'm not good el dico no bueno he is good el es bueno so us we should never point to ourselves young man said the scriptures tell us that jesus loved him he was he rejected jesus christ he rejected and a lot of people think well maybe that young man after rejecting the word pretty sure he lost all of his business i'm pretty sure him rejecting jesus christ he went bankrupt he increased el almento if he had two businesses now he had but he made his investment where there was the old rich ruler he was very happy he said i prospered i rejected that man christ and look at my business that young man that old man said all right so alright rejoice he went to bed else then the angel said all right it's time and the scripture tells us success the success of receiving god the success of receiving his word because he thought that that was a bad business plan speaks to us about a hell that exists and the young man said abraham yelhoven dico abram he said father abraham and abraham says and he says can you please come over here and send lazarus and dip his finger on my tongue with water abyss that we can't cross over there he said well can you send someone from here and and preach to my brothers that i have back home because i'm um they're going to [Music] listen to the prophets [Music] people still who have not seen quinoa and yet they believe you're making an investment [Music] something you have not seen but it's rock solid foundation the word of god that's not going to break it's the word of god there's someone here sitting today it doesn't believe there's accept the lord jesus christ and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tequila believe in the lord your god believe in the lord your god so ye shall be established yes now in spanish and english is a different word spanish is talking about being safe for sure in english but in english but in english it says to be established his name is william miriam branham el hombre del provetas william branham believe your profit cred a professor brother branham has given us everything you want to know how to have success in your finances finances go to what brother madam says and if you can't understand that i i understand it's english and it might not break it down so easily creed and you shall prosper israel where prophetess who is our prophet william mary and branham is william branham should it be a shame who your prophet is now again it's the accomplishment of an aim or a purpose this is now what's your name what's your purpose what do you want to do now there has to be a motive there has to be an objective if you want to go to school there has to be a motive and there has to be an objective in order for you when you get those two down and you must test your motive and objectives first prime first then find the will of god and then find your objective and then test your motive and see if your motive is right then as jesus said in mark 11 24. if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but as long as you've got doubt in the heart whether it's the will of god excuse me whether it's the will of god or your motive or objective is wrong how was it going to move but when you got uh wait but when you when you know that your motive is right and it's the will of god and your objective is right it's got to move [Music] just with his father and his friends coming down from babylon they no doubt he prayed through to the until he struck the hand of god you heard that key a little key right there of prayer stay praying until you you touch the hand of god how did he do it by faith perhaps he thought like this quesas el somewhere in the land of heathens where he was start journeying he touched the henna and in there god gave him a revelation that there was a city whose builder maker was god to take up space i'm not just another person here on earth i got a purpose here in life you have a purpose here in life and as i said last night go beyond the sound barriers then you have a purpose in line you have a purpose and belonging to the church another person that sits on the pew person no when you find yourself with god face to face you're not a member of jericho tabernacles amen we know that god is honest now the definition of purpose definition of proposition is the reason for which something is done created or the reason why something exists [Music] there's a reason why you exist exist you're just not another body here on earth i made you with a purpose if he made you he made some with you with the gift of singing for that purpose you said he made you some to learn an instrument why you exist beautiful out of you ellison there's something there you're there for a purpose oh brother i don't know well you know how you can find it just keep saying amen to god's word raise your hand worship the lord because all of us regardless of our gifts or talents independence play an instrument to the people to hear us to help the people or get in the spirit especially out of a million excuses out of all that mud they thought when god speaks to a man he gives him ambition when he god speaks to a man he gives them faith to do it to accomplish it achieve what his purpose in life is what god called them to do he's called us to be the church of god says amen amen says let's just make our purpose in life to see that we are the church of god it is i had a brother i'm going to pause right there years ago he said brother assange hermano he said i'm not an ambitious person so i want to tell my wife you know what we've been living in this old house and i we should buy a new house it's my fault because i was i'm not an ambitious person now we're talking in the natural we're talking in the spiritual establishment there's a balance says let's have ambition d celebration not sit around because the jones want it or the free takers want it oh it's the fulani uh familia location what do we care about the free takers if they don't do it let us do it anyhow but the rest if the rest of the nation wants to think we stand for god in phoenix we we we want god we want to achieve we want to have faith we want to have ambition let's believe on the lord jesus christ he said all things are possible to them to you not if but [Music] no si [Music] for in the natural life in la vida natural have ambition but in balance with god's word make sure that that study is you got to make sure that that school that education those finances take you out of god's word your center god's word the word of god center and everything else will revolve around god's word it shouldn't be school of money finance is the center certainly finances [Music] you take the dust off of them when they get dusty but brother ram says but when you die you can't go up there and say look let me take my diploma [Music] let me take you my doctor degree from hey yes the angel is going to be there and says well what do you got well i got my doctor degree from asu tengo i completed my barber college he says that's not going to make it don't use that over here we

diploma and use it a man a man or brother i'm i'm not a school type of person amen there's people who are very ambitious they got barber and they got their contractor and so forth because you never
