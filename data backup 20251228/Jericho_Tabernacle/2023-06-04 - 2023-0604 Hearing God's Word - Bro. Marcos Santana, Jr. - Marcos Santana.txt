the cross what a beautiful song God bless you all this morning it's an honor privilege to see you all once again it's more nerve-wracking when you see everyone from behind here I want to thank the pastor for the opportunity to speak here to you all once again you know I I almost got out of speaking this morning like a good pastor he was ready to take the lead if it was needed foreign and you can have a seat for just a few moments last weekend we were in the city of San Jose California San Jose California and I wanted to thank brothers and our brother Michael Rodriguez for trusting us with the youth that we have here at Jericho Tabernacles and also thank our brother Johnny and his wife for accompanying us and also our brother Boaz for accompanying us just a few of the parents and roles that had that responsibility to watch after our youth Padres and brother art if you don't mind the police play that slideshow for me thank you brother presentation I just want to share a few words from the trip that we had I'm going to try and steal some minutes before we get into the preaching and distract you a bit with these photos as we said we went to the city of San Jose California where the pastor there's a brother and we're blessed to go myself and my family brother Johnny Alvarado and his family brother Boaz sister Destiny Destiny sister Emily and Betsy mancia brother Emmanuel Santos our brother Josh Alvarado and also sister Daniela Santana there where we had Services Friday through Sunday beautiful Services you know one point million brother boys were really tired and you know we kind of had a joke between us you know this is taking us back to the 90s when it was church food church and you know maybe we got a little out of shape but it felt good to get back into that routine you know as soon as you're about to get tired it's time to go worship once again and the brothers did a good job of giving us some long-winded preachers like our brother Gerald Hughes when he came to visit us thank God our brother Emanuel had the blessing of interpreting that brother and then just when we're falling asleep at the end of the conventions God sent us a press if you want to hear about brother Fred you can ask our brother Victor Chavez Jr from last year he fell in love with how that brother ministers this is a Congolese brother from Africa who who who brother Johnny got to see how sweet and humble he is but the moment he steps behind that Pulpit you would think it's a completely different person just a firecracker on fire for the worse just when we started getting tired this brother woke us right up I'm looking here brother Boaz song you know we didn't go with any a commission to minister to interpret to sing nothing but we did prepare our youth and everyone to just always be ready so we took our instruments we took our song books we took our notes and we were just ready at God's disposition yes the brothers felt in their heart to use our brother Johnny and her brother boys forgive me I forgot to mention another brother that I just saw in the picture or if he's watching or he watches this stream in the future our brother Gerson Ponce also accompanied us on this trip and since there's no divisions here there's no my circle in your circle here is the circle of the body of Jesus Christ that brother came in to be a part of the Jericho Tabernacle youth is and all in one the Youth of the Bride of Jesus Christ so I don't want to exclude my brother Gerson but it fell on my lot to minister Saturday morning which also caught me by surprise brother Emmanuel interpreted myself interpreted all together we're saying representing Jericho Tabernacle two specials out there and if you see this video right here there were a total of three baptisms at the end of campism and honestly every service every Camp every every uh meetings that's the purpose and somebody might hear a word that they might hear a word from God they would touch their hearts they've never surrendered their lives to the almighties there is a God that can change their lives so the Waters of baptism were open for anyone during those meetings and and we had the victory there were three baptisms you know the brothers there are so sweet they made it known to me they didn't want us to leave without giving us a like a goodbye lunch is so they brought all the visiting ministers and the youth from the church and it was one of the hardest things ever just to say goodbye on Monday morning honestly I look back and it was like a glimpse of Eternity you know I would go to this group where Emmanuel was and then I'd get them ready to go and then I'd go find Boaz and Johnny with this little group here to get them ready to go and then I find our precious young sisters get ready to go and it seemed as soon as I spoke to one the other one was back into it again and back into it again you know one day we'll have that opportunity this opportunity but we don't have to say goodbye we don't have to say I'll see you next year I'll see you at the next campaign no if brother Emanuel wants to have Fellowship for all of eternities he can go and have fellowships if the sisters want to laugh and dance and rejoice they have an eternity to spend that time with each other it was just a beautiful feeling foreign [Music] he must have given us some Supernatural strength for the two drivers that drove Sovereign but truly it was a blessing like I said I don't want to Rob too much of the time but you know the people are so humble in San Jose and and everyone that went they expressed a little bit of that humility that they saw and they felt from these people my wife was telling me about a moment that she had with sister Rachel Alone um and our sister Rachel was just so broken down love that these brothers are projecting the humility that they're projecting and that how I believe the words were it's like no one is greater than the other yeah and you know if you would have seen the youth how they were in action is in every single service serving the people it was just something beautiful and I'm sure every single one adult and young they took something back with them and I hope at least for the group of us that went yes and a little bit of this testimony I'm sharing might we be able to apply some of that same love and energy and humility in this church camp that we're getting prepared foreign time where we're going to put ourselves aside where we're going to invite the guests for them to come and have a good time for them to see a smile on our face for them to see the love of God that we have to give them so they can see that God is truly there at Jericho Tabernacles there's a group of humble Believers there that love the Lord with all their hearts and that there are no barriers there are no divisions that we are all in that body of Christ forgive me I think I'm preaching now if I'd like to go ahead and get started now if we would all please stand for the reading of the words you'd all turn to the Book of John chapter eight and we're going to give this a message or this sermon this morning hearing God's voice plain and simple right to the point but so easy to miss you know sometimes it's not even complicated to miss this is but hearing God's voice if we jump down to verse 43 it reads the same why do ye not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word jump down to verse 47. he that is of God heareth God's words he therefore heareth him not because ye are not of God once again hearing God's voice this morning Father we're so grateful to be in your house Lord thankfully I've been able to return back from this trip we're also thankful father for the brothers that travel to the other meetings on Memorial weekend and now that we are all here gathered safe and sound we're here to hear of your word once again this morning Father I said you put me and my interpreter aside just take these small simple words and touch the heart of the listener says that if they can hear the voice of God this morning and it was something that they needed this morning they have the faith and courage to take actions and we place the service in your hands in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers once again the title hearing God's voice we can just put it on the screen if they have it Revelations 3 20. just to add on to that importance of hearing God's voice a very deep scripture behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him it's so simple if we can just hear that voice we can open the door to him great things will begin to happen Hebrews 3 15. wow it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the Rebellion so this morning if I could ask of anything from you it's just to Simply open up your spiritual ears a little bit and just hear the voice of God the voice of God is in me the voice of God is not my brother but the voice of God comes from God alone you know there's human studies about how many thoughts the brain has and it's it's debated it's around six thousand to seventy thousand thoughts a day and you know that's that's a lot of thoughts I probably couldn't tell you maybe a hundred thoughts that I have myself in a date so now whether 70 000 or 6 000. let's go to the Book of Genesis because let us remember what day and age we're living in today we know that in the last days it'll be like the days so in Genesis 6 5 it says that God saw the wickedness of men and women on the earth and it was great it was great not great as in good as a number was a lot it says that every imagination of their thoughts was on evil continually so 70 000 thoughts in a day and every single one of those were evil no I I don't I don't want to make anyone feel bad but I know everyone in here is born in sins and we still battle this flesh and when we're not a hundred percent consecrated and anointed a lot of those 70 000 thoughts are evil because we're in the same days whether you want to believe it or not evil thoughts are going through your mind all the time thank God some of us are born again God some of us have received the Holy ghosts we have a weapon to combat those thoughts but we're still in the flesh and all thoughts have only two places to come from you know I really enjoyed the message on Friday the brother Eli preached you know if a young person wasn't paying attention I feel sorry for them I'll tell you go listen to that message over and over again because it almost seemed like brother Eli had it out for this specific demon from hell is this little thing right here you know and and I love that he was talking about Satan's devices I personally think it's it's probably the strongest device that he's perverted and used to attack us you know I was just thinking and kind of being funny to myself I'll say you know what Satan don't even got to work that hard anymore you know he don't have to be try to be everywhere at once trying to attack us all at the same time the Legion of demons that is within this device some of us we sleep with it next to our pillows some of us tuck it inside of our clothing all day long other of us can't wait to our kids to get of age so we can get them that Legion of demons Satan don't even need to work on us no more because the access to hell is on us every single day and going back to thoughts I think I could say the majority of our thoughts because of how dependent we are on this thing right here the things we like and dislike come from here the way we tend to reason comes from right there the the the actions that we take are from right there because of what we see what we're here those demons have a heavy effect on our lives I'm so sorry I forgot to give the brothers in the back my quotes this morning [Music] in the message in 1955 brother Brandon says never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it I got 70 000 that I can get but it's my job just to not entertain it is we can't help the pop-ups we can't help the advertisements but we can help if we click that button to go watch whatever's behind that foreign and you know sometimes it is hard to catch when God is trying to talk to us that happens to me so he was studying a topic and when he was so into his word and into that prayer and he didn't even know he was preaching to me he said brother I don't know when I was so into my word and it might be a snippet for what he's going to bring us at some point he said there's a a circle of protection that's around you when you're in connection with God and he said and the moment that I stopped is do you know how hard it was for me to get back into that Circle so so it's a state that we need to be in constant connection with God so therefore there are moments where we don't hear him we we don't follow what he's trying to tell us so since we all know in the beginning was the word the word had power to create to transform the hill then since the beginning Satan's main goal with every one of us was just to get us to not listen to the words and like my brother said to destroy us because when we don't listen to that word we don't obey that word and apply that word in our lives we're going to get into problems we were not within connection or are in tune with that word you know plain and simple if he's trying to speak to us and we're not hearing that voice that word then exactly what my brother said we're destroyed you're going to be defeated we know we're more than conquerors with the words we know we have eternal life with the words we know we have weapons against the enemy with the words but take away that word and now you are defeated now on top of that not only just being defeated if Satan he can replace the words if he can substitute the words and then we find ourselves in our daily walk and we're taking heed to that word that we heard and we're listening and following that word that we heard now we're deceived and we're defeated because we've been wrongfully convinced of the wrong word now it sounds very drastic for the Christians I feel like this message is it is for the Christian this morning the person out there there's many voices they could listen to there's plenty of word they can listen to I'm going to say like this good word that they can listen educational word motivational words businessman's words political words but for us there's only one word that we're trying to listen to and that's the word of God yes the one that saved us the one that transformed us and the one that's going to take us to that Eternal destination but for us as the Christians say it might be a little different how he tends to get to it if you're now a Christian you're now born again you now have been baptized he's not going to come to you with with with uh with lust and those things we've already come out of that we've come up higher than that if he's got to get a Son of God you always got to get a daughter of God he's got to be a little more slick and use the word of God he's got to find a way to twist it just a little because if you take uh those that believe in uh those that believe that the new name of Jesus Christ is William Branham William Branham and they baptized in the name of William Brown William Branham if you talk to them they have a deep conviction and you know where they got that from right here you know where else they got that from the message so if Satan's gonna do anything to stumble us or give us a voice to hear that we think is he's gonna have to use a little bit of that word to mix it up have you ever found yourself where you want to listen to a message you just want to read your Bible you want to pray a little bit more you want to have a family altar with your children but it seems like something always the young people they had this this pole that was pulling them to get into prayer and then the thought came they forgot they have a big assignment they need to turn in tomorrow yeah so these are just reasons these are just reasons that they are valid they're not evil reasons you didn't stop reading to go do something bad you didn't stop praying because there was a chat on the youth chat or the women's chat and something bad came about from that no it was good things positive things but it was just a split second to change the course of what God had for you that in that exact moment God wanted you to get into prayer at that exact moment God wanted you to turn on The Voice Radio because there was a voice and he was trying to talk to you get you to hear him but Satan just happened to get in the way just to get us a little attitude get us a little out of sync and Miss what God a little bit of Revelation you were seeking for in your life but for a split second Satan turned you away you know if you're if you're walking down the road and then it's let's just say it's 10 miles down the road if you change that course by one degree you might walk maybe two three miles and feel like you're on course but you get down to seven eight nine ten miles down the road you're going to be so far from the road wondering where did I go wrong what was I listening to what was I doing I got off the way he says what if the sick people here tonight would begin to think God is God God is yours if he isn't then why serve him if God is in God we might as well leave you know the NBA finals are going on right now foreign because this church is in tune with God he says something's going to take place and there's nothing that's going to stop you know being in tune with God I don't know if anybody's familiar with the artist James Brown artista James Brown you know if you are you don't got to be too religious this morning he's a singer from the 40s 50s 60s 70s he was a great singer he was so in sync with his music Elizabeth with the instruments the songs the backup singers everything and he was revered for being ahead of his time in the mute speaking about music and he was so in tune with his music that as the concert was going on if a single person got one note off or was delayed by half a second or a quarter of a second in the middle of dancing and singing he'll look over at the saxophone player and give them that little look and they knew that they were going to get a hundred dollars taken off of their checks that's how in tune he was so since nobody raised their hand is anybody familiar with Michael Jackson Michael Jackson amen God bless you if you listen Michael Jackson Michael Jackson also another revered man in in the music industry I believe in pop music I think it is also who was so obsessed and so in tune with music with every aspect of Melody the time in everything just like James Brown who happened to be his Idol when when there was one occasion we're a music director and the singers they didn't end the song exactly where it was supposed to end and in the middle of him singing without anyone even noticing and no one noticed and the performance kept going on now those are just examples to see when you're so in tune with something now brother Johnny forgive me I think we entered a new level of love and Brotherhood my brother I feel the same way like my brother Victor and Josh on our last trip so I might pick on you a little bit right now alien how many know brother Johnny is an amazing song leader man I've heard him in Camp he's God has used him tremendously I used to watch him years ago when he was songly he was tremendous and even here God has used him in a tremendous way because he's yielded the gift that came from God that God might use it through him as just a vessel surrender to him for the benefit of his people you know brother Johnny can be up here and and can look at Sister Sarah and within that brotherly connection they have yes give her this some kind of sign to get her to play a certain way and for our younger musicians down here you give a little bit of a Stern looks in this direction to these young sisters playing here but they catch on and they start playing the way he needs it and then here I am tucked away trying to hide from everybody right brother Josh that's how we do it we're we're we're shy individuals but he's feeling and as that spirit is going up and down those eyes and by his administration by his in tune guys the Lord can operate on his people the same thing with James Brown James Brown the same thing with Michael Jackson Michael Jackson they want Perfection for worship for self-worship and the worship of satanas because Satan also has his song leaders many times there's so much better than us but God also wants Perfection we we strive to be perfect for God though we know we will never be perfect but there's a perfect one that died on the cross for us and because that perfect one lives in us we can be perfect in his eyes so I'm not saying we need to sing perfect foreign [Music] and all the young ones that are in training right now we're all just working together for the honor and glory of God just trying to give him the best of our praise and the best of our worship that synchronization that's talking about the praise and worship Department in the church and in your personal life but what about in The Prayer Department of your life some people are probably really strong but some people are probably really weak you might find yourself somewhere in the middle I don't know the life of prayer you have behind closed doors but if I had to guess like they say I'm gonna take a wild guess that group they personas they make it here on Wednesdays they make it here on that Friday make it here on Sunday okay and they make it here on Mondays I'm gonna guess that they have a pretty strong life of prayer and thank God for them we have examples in those those that are Prayer Warriors of this church they're probably there Monday praying for the Wednesday service praying for a Friday in our Sunday service you know and and say and he hates that is he says one thing he doesn't want is for us to have a life of prayer maybe we're not all prayed up personally no but maybe the brother sister next to you has been praying all week long and that's the beauty because we are a family within the bride family within the family of Christ where somebody praying for the pastors somebody's praying for the preacher somebody's praying for that petition that you came up here to be prayed for so you're not alone the goal is to get a stronger prayer life for God but if it helps you this morning you're not alone this morning as much as he's been studying us together you know I love when preachers say that he's scared of you because he can never equal up to you he's inferior to you and he knows what we're capable of he knows what power we have he knows that when we are in tune with this word oh it's game over for Satan yes so his goal is to achieve that we don't hear the word of God where we're hearing this voice where we're hearing his words because he knows it's forming a stronger bond with God a bigger connection with God where we now have access to the spoken word powers where we can speak our healing into existence where we can speak our husband and wife's salvation into existence well you can speak anything into existence that's why Satan is trying at all costs to try and destroy your prayer life because that's where you can get into connection with God that's where you start to hear God's voice and you recognize God's voice you talk to somebody on the street you meet them at the grocery store I don't know the conversation leads you your person and then a few months down the road you run into that person again and they're trying to talk to you yes you don't remember me this is [Music] you tell me how your wife loves to make it what they said cilantro and all these things oh I'm so sorry I I don't recognize you I don't know who you are [Music] if we're not in constant prayer with God if we're not in constant fellowship with God a person who we claim is our friend who is our lover who is our everything when we don't talk to him for months and months and months how are you going to know the voice of God when he speaks to you Diabla it you can't no puedes it's been so long you forgot what it looks like you forgot what it sounds like you forgot what it feels like to get some loves because we don't have a strong life of prayer says these simple words in the message testimony let everything else be secondary but your prayer life everything is in second place and in first place is my life of prayer he says stay right there with him all the time not some of the times portion of the time but all the time let us strive to pray with him all the time our business let's put a second our job our career let's put a second [Music] and we all as message Believers we know this already you know it's not flesh and blood that we fight with if it was Flesh and Blood I can just get rid of my brother Emmanuel and I solved my problems if it was that easy I can get rid of this Deacon that I don't like in problem solve foreign to think why I can't stand brother Emanuel why did he have to do what he did to me why did they make this decision in that decision because it's invisible its powers in The Invisible Realms you know one of the things I love about Arizona are the gun laws here in Arizona and and you know the freedom to carry you don't get that in California the freedom to go to the store and walk out five minutes later with a gun you don't get that in California the freedom to go out shooting into the field you don't get that in California you know if brother o ever got to the point where where he needed individuals to start caring in church I might just be one of the first ones to sign up you know thank God that we don't need that but I'ma tell you even in the United States there are places that they do need that and if you talk to our Elder brothers that have traveled the world there are churches of the message that their deacons are are carrying those firearms and I might know one or two brothers they'll probably sign up right along with me but you know if the devil was just walking around and he just hit the corner on Rozier and this was a flesh and blood Affair yes and I see them all red like the world paints with the long old nasty tail that he's got and that spear looking thing that he carries you know we know that's not safe but if that devil were to walk by Foreign I would shoot him so fast I would drop him dead in his footsteps but we know that's not how it operates we can't shoot the devil much more than we can shoot our brothers because there can be just momentary anointings upon each and every one of us just like Peter momentarily anointed to say something that was contrary to the word of God for Jesus to say get behind me get out of here we don't want you here and he left because it's it's it's an invisible realm it's a battle in the mind and that's how he speaks to us in the minds he's in the church he wants to be worshiped like God in the church we hear it all the time the wolf in sheep's clothing he's so similar to the truth [Music] you know you just gotta have that connection with God if you're not in tune if you don't have the ability to recognize God's voice not with some crazy Street terminology but with the same word and we'll hear what we think is God's voice because it sounds like his voice looks like his voice it acts like his voice therefore we need to be in our word daily and we can identify that voice because God speaks to us all in many different ways like two or three times already [Music] some of us God speaks to dreams oh there's God literally has an audible voice that he speaks to us though I've noticed the way God speaks to our brothers he'll pull over on the middle of the road and start crying and praying the moments where I find him talking to me habla it's usually in the barbershop and I like to cut hair with the hat yeah and I pull my head nice and low and I have something planned in my ears and it just starts talking to me and talking to me and a sermon a preaching music whatever the case may be and Tears start flowing from my face and I put it down low so the client doesn't see me the one I'm cutting this here or the ones waiting so that discreetly I can just wipe myself off and keep on working however he speaks to you stay in tune with God don't ever lose that recognition of that voice that wants to speak to you brother Brandon says in the message amazing title of a message thirsting for life is anybody thirsty for life this morning he says when he cuts your prayer life he says that's right when he cuts that thirst off of you and he perverts it into things of the world we're talking to us outside he might not pervert you back to drugs he's not perverting you into adultery from your husband or wife but he's taken you one degree off the road he perverts you one degree into the things of the world and he's got you right where he he will let you gobble along here until you get to a certain place and then you crash your life right without God we're going to crash our life into misery without God that's why prayer is so important I'm not preaching you because I'm some great prayer warriors you know there's two types of glass there's the glass in the window yeah I could stand here and be looking at every one of you all this morning point the finger to everyone this morning and there's the glass in the mirror that that one when I look at it I'm looking at myself I'm preaching I need to learn to hear his voice every second of my life because I've got to put him first in everything else seconds we pray for our burdens foreign so in tune that you recognize his response you know sometimes we just have to pray ourselves through the trials how many times have we heard brother Branham cry out in his messages what happened to those all night prayer services what happened to those prayer revivals what happened to that brother or sister that would be here and pray till after everyone's gone out the building that's somebody trying to pray their way through the trials they're trying to fight to get through that burden you know if you were stuck in a car falling into the ocean you wouldn't just grab the handle and quit you grab something to break the window on your side to obtain your Liberty your deliverance so why when we pray we can't fight our way through the Deliverance fight our way out of the escape from the hold of satanas pray to the point where we can get that response from God and I think of the older sisters that come out here and shed their tears you know when they're here for 20 30 40 minutes praying if God wanted to and it's his will when they pray for their husband or their children they could come running through that door surrendering their lives because we have living testimonies of that but when you understand you can identify the voice of God when that older sister when that mother gets up she has heard from God himself and she knows that it's already done the job is finished my children are going to be okay my husband's gonna be okay my wife's gonna be okay because they heard the voice of God they don't gotta see it they don't gotta feel it they're just having faith in that voice and when they leave here they profess it over and over again now many people wonder what happens when they're healed we say uh and the message letting off the pressure after a while that they don't feel that way because but it's because when the prayer is being made when you're up here and they're praying for you and the presence of the Lord is with you faith and when the faith then leaves when you live here you go home you battle the rest of the week when the faith leaves something has to happen to you you must remain with that phase don't never let that Faith leave you just always remember that God has answered your prayers you heard from God he gave you his word he gave you his promise so God has already answered he says it's his words he cannot go back on that he must keep his word we're gonna now be closing if the musicians would like to come forward you know the devil's watching and he's watching right now he's going to be watching in the morning and in the evening and we're taught to always profess our healing profess your Victory that's your deliverance he's in control he's taking his load and put it on his back God's word said it's a finished work my word is saying that it's a Finnish word then the supernatural word is gonna make it a finished work the blind man in the barber chairs over and over and over again and what happened to him the time came where he had so much faith there's power in the words that we speak don't don't speak your sufferings and all the struggles that you're going through and find yourself complaining and complaining and complaining because Satan is going to capitalize on that oh he wants to complain about what's going on in his life I'm gonna go ahead and give him a little bit more to complain about and I'm gonna put him deeper in that hole let us instead use our words and if we're going to speak about our burdens and our problems let us profess it with the name of Jesus Christ attack that's tacked on to what I'm asking foreign Jesus he's looking at your giant big brother standing behind you because there's a life behind the name that's the name of Jesus Christ [Music] brother Branham says decent amount of Branham our Eternal destination eterno is not altogether determined by what we see and by what we're here do you understand that your Eternal destination is not determined by what you can see with these eyes so what you hear with these years but it's determined on what discernment we have what we see and of what we hear if you discern that those voices that come to you are not of God then strive to get them out of your head but if you can discern that this is a sound word it's a certain word it's a promise word then you can discern um this is the voice of God this is him speaking to me [Music] [Music] a powerful service that morning but when that service was over everybody had to go home and Jesus told his disciples don't meet me on the other side of that of water service is going to end here today and you're going to have to leave here on your boat Jesus went to pray Jesus and the disciples out on that water there were strong wins they came those heavy storms they were [Music] we are in Saiyan's Prime right now friend [Music] but the Winds of Doubt come the waves of discouragement things that you've been going through they start coming back and thoughts over and over and over in your mind but the words that Peter says anyone can say those words anybody can say those words this morning help me save me he shouted it over and over again and he extends don't doubt me my son here come I'll take you in my arms just call on the name of Jesus Christ this morning but his voice and if it's calling you you can answer to that girl he's here when they made it to shore the people at that land they recognize Jesus did you know that the woman with the bloody shoes was not the only one that had that touched his garments the Bible says that everyone that was sick on that land they touched the Hem of His Garden they rushed to the altar of Jesus Christ they were all healed that night you can grab the Hem of His Garment this morning it wasn't just one woman it wasn't just one sister but it was a multitude like the multitude here this morning [Music] [Music] you are here today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] FedEx oh [Music] to his own a stranger [Music] oh man
