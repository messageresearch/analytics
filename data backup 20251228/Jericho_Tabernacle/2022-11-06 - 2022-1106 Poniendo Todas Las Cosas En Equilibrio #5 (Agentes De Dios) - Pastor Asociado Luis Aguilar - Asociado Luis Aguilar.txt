brother Boaz Alvarado let's pray for the brothers be singing this hymn while the brother passes [Music] yeah yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you this morning Brothers [Music] are you happy to be here in the house of the Lord [Music] you guys look beautiful with your smiles this morning amen Brothers do you love the Lord can you guys hear me better man yeah as you're standing we're going to open our scriptures [Music] Daniel chapter 5. 7 verse 27 president it's always a pleasure to be here in the house of the Lord to be here in Fellowship a pastor he finds himself in Bayer New Mexico there's a few Brothers accompanying him a few young young people keep in prayers so they can return safe [Music] you have found yourself in the balance and you have found yourself wanting amen please bow your heads you can close your eyes so we can approach the author of the word thank you this morning for all the things that you've given us Lord we're here ready for service Lord we'll be able to take preeminence this morning it was going to be spoken you bless your people they're going to receive your world we want to thank the musicians and everything could come out good and in order Lord Place all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hey man you guys may be seated hey man you guys love the Lord this morning amen and it's more like to continue in the message we've been following with and it's putting all things in Balance our subtitle our Focus this morning is the Agents of God Amen we're asking that the Lord could help us and bless us this morning sometimes we want to follow a certain road but God's not on that road amen yeah sometimes we take a certain quote from the prophet or a certain scripture of the Bible sometimes we stick or we grab hold tight of that that scripture and no one can Anton says and then at that point you're out of balance but if you could take their brothers and the other quote from the other brothers and put them on God's scale Anton says then we could be in balance in Proverbs it tells us that a a false balance it's an abomination in God's eyes but a correct balance it's pleasing to the Lord but when we find ourselves with a quote from the prophets everything that the prophet says about that amen Brothers says oh well I heard the prophet said this but seek out everything that the prophet said about that our elderly brothers were preaching a very beautiful message they were talking about dreams and visions and speaking in tongues and Prophets and how God speaks to us to those gifts but the main thing is the way that God speaks to us is through his word amen brothers let's go let's take a little example here a very simple example let's say we're going to have a voting but someone speaks in tongues and it says in speaking in tongues he says this is the person that will take that place what should we do are we going to go with the person that spoke in tongues when the word of God tells us to place it in voting animals amen Brothers what the word of God says amen amen is so this morning we're going to speak about God's agents amen Brothers the prophet says yes and that's the reason I believe those Visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word amen Brothers the prophet says why do you think I believe that Vision because it coincides with the world because it sounds beautiful because it benefits because it goes along with what the word says and if he says it is when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork is it's going to be and tonsamento because it's beyond the human things it's up in the Realms of the Lord's thinking but you're standing you're standing here just as a branch producing the fruit that's in the vine vein see now notice what the prophet says yes God USA uses God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use groups God doesn't use organizations he's always done it this way this is going to get nice and on the pool of beces the water chopped the trouble the waters were trouble and whoever stepped in there is look what a great water I am no no it was the Angels during the healing not the water it was the angels and when the angel went away it was just water a human flesh but sometimes we want a different roads and dreams speak to us amen Brothers that's God's way that's the way God does it God doesn't let us fall in denominations that doesn't let us fall on mechanical devices man is God's ages and the hardest thing is the God has ever had to do is for one mortal to believe another the most difficult thing for God is for this man I believe the other man OS amen Brothers is that the truth man they say greneso he said you believe that they couldn't believe Moses and God has given two signs to prove to the people that he was sent from God to for their Deliverance he's the same yesterday today the same way that he worked back then he's going to work today the way he's working today he'll work tomorrow I have some the definition and some synonyms an agent is a person who acts on behalf of another person or group it's a representative and place them in Balance yeah and that's the only thing that God needed foreign is nothing sometimes we believe we're something great because I have gifts but if you don't have God you're nothing man amen amen Peter said that mountain is Transfiguration he said no it's the holy spirit that made that mountain holy it's not the mountain I don't accept that okay what if I were to tell you that if God is a spirit and Juan Capitola I don't have it okay John 4 24. it says God is Spirit amen amen amen Brothers the first Christians 1 11 the Apostle Paul tells us he says follow me telling other men follow me just as I follow Christ amen amen that's God's way it's a it's a continuance follows Christ and we follow Paul amen amen followers imitators it's an imitator another thing is to be a follower [Music] how many have heard that you are the leader go to the sixth sale hey begins to talk about going beyond the curtain of time he says you are the leader and you shall first be judged it says here the patience of Paul Pakistan here they are and so the Glorious the glory to God because what Paul preach I have also preached it that want to run away foreign that I will be there too amen again Siegel stand who do you follow oh they see your alien you follow somebody God has its agents yes and they are men God is a spirit yes in his vessels that's fine but you're going to follow somebody at the head of his church and of his people Brothers we're gonna go to acts 8. I don't know if you guys have your Bibles it's really good to have your Bibles acts 8 26. we're going to take it step by step so we can take the time and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go towards the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is the desert is foreign Authority under Candace queen of Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship so here we see Phillips we see that the angel of the Lord Felipe had spoke to Phillip he said get up and go through this road we saw in verse 27 that the Ethiopian man what is it well eunuch is a man that has saved his virginity that has a lot of authority is a safeguarder amen Brothers in another message the prophet says that the ten virgins I'll just leave that there is and the eunuch was in charge of all the treasures of this queen yes and the smell went to Jerusalem to worship he went searching for something he went to Jerusalem the most religious place in the whole entire world to worship now we're seeing the unit returning back to his home Anton says verse 28 was returning and sitting in his Chariot read isaiis the prophet so the unit opened up the scriptures and he began to read as the Sheep took to the slaughterhouse in that in that manner pay then Philip approached him verse 29 is and join thyself to this charioto Felipe and Philip heard that he was reading tether to him so Philip made a question to this unites do you understand what you are reading that's a question to ask each and every one of you this morning do you understand what you are hearing when you open the secrets and when you open the message of the hour do you understand what you're reading what do you understand amen amen if I give you a quote brother I understand it this way I understand it this way I remember brother Johnny told him one time the best way that I know how I do it's a reality you don't stop you don't study the words it's the word that is when you open up the Bible the Bible is studying you foreign what do you under understand there hello right what do you understand when you are reading this the word is this man wants to be addicted I am studying that this man is wants to be a chief do you understand it [Music] should guide me hey look he's in English that's what it says in English I don't have a man to guide me so this unit the guy he understood how could I understand what I'm reading to guide me man is a guide they bend the case the man can have the spirit of God don't get scared yes Leading the People how can I understand they can't switch by themselves and the Spirit come out to The Original Seed amen Brothers Philip was an apostle no no Felipe now it was a deacon amen what is that Deacon doing over there is that is where it's declared the perfect will of God all right amen I don't want to follow that man he yells too much amen the prophet says here now here we're going to get into something like now we look at the Sea church [Music] this real church with the real true sperm not the eleno now notice the eunuch it had been with all the doctors of divinity now remember no this man went to Jerusalem the most religious place around the earth doctors of divinity and did not find himself and he left empty to an angel you want an angel to come down with beautiful Wings put the Halo on his head no it's yours they couldn't speak Spanish Brothers how many know that in Galatians who comes from heaven and preaches anything other than what he preached let him be cursed is he came below foreign amen Brothers he says he said descends below and gave him to men who were Sons now he never committed to the angels He had been in Pentacles Jerusalem to worship how many men say Amen to them maybe not the eunuch had been with all the doctors of divinity but why didn't he receive anything because he had went to Jerusalem why didn't he receive it receive anything he went back downstairs studying Isaiah although the angel directed to Philip but the germ of Life had to come to the body through the angel foreign just like each and every one of us all about this house we're baptized in the Water The Gift of the Holy ghosts inside the body of God we have got seed inside of us and that's where children can be produced the message he found himself fertile ground ready to receive the germs if nobody can guide me into the universe God has got seed okay now we see what a seed is when you see that there's a nut you see the cut the has like a shark or a shell and you open the Shelf the the nut comes out so there's stages for that seed amen this is the the prophet speaks the message the air shall not be seed with the shack we see that the shack has a purpose it's to protect the seed have anyone amen Brothers oh brother it's garbage it has a purpose to protect the seed foreign now we have our little groups there shouldn't be any groups let's say I have my little groups can hang out with the holies the moment of my group I identify myself identify yourself with the sugar that is a denomination and you go to the ground you are worth nothing you have turned yourself into a denomination [Music] if you don't believe it because we don't have anymore those doors are open to everybody foreign hold up come on how does the dragon speak that's my first question number two who is the dragon God says I understand there's more quotes how does the dragon speak you want to see how the dragon speaks we have to go to Genesis everything is found in Genesis everything that's why the devil hates Genesis and Revelations we see in Genesis chapter 3 what are the serpent approach he came close to the world he didn't approach the man he approached the woman and what did the woman tell him destruction no no no how did the serpent speak he says you look very pretty not this that's what God wants to say no no no no yes because they've dropped the bars [Music] that little calm it's fine they became a man by the name of John the Baptist Anointed with the spirit of Allah he had an ax of the tree I'm a saint uses the man yes of the tree we'll be closing though it's a propheta the prophet says he didn't give the message to an angel he gave it to the Man the scripture says follow me the way I follow Christ this morning the prophet tells us Prophet says never trust any man what do we do now brother you just told me that those are God's agents it sticks to that quote placed them on God's scale foreign never trust any man important I don't care who he is if he's a holy man she has Bueno if he's good there is no such thing someone knows the life of Luis Aguilar you would be scared I'm not going to use anybody else I'm going to use myself I don't want to offend anybody if you see my life is you'll see oh man this man is not a man of God William Branham you see the life of William um the one that wanted to kill you've been to everything here in this church I can't think their people recognize preach the word of God the word the holy spirit will be spread out yes adulterers God can use them yes you don't believe it amen equilibrium put it on the balance the prophet says Santo is God holy Santo not a holy man the Holy Spirit once offered it to the holy mountains it was the holy God that found him on that mountain not the holy church holy God in that church he will fail is a failure to begin with anyone the greatest of the men's will fall never put your trust but on yourself or on anybody else to make the man your example Mira look at you don't ever look at anybody it doesn't matter who it is look to God look at God Christo Christ yes to a templates your example he is your existence is your example because when you tell yourself it seems that we're trusted a lot in each other oh no no and one and the others we are trusting a certain men because they have the ability the Bible says how can you have faith I prefer one over the other you prefer someone over the other foreign if you're the solid feet blessed be the name of the Lord let me tell you one thing because even the demons under the plant of your feet man this man is this man is a great person when you do that you are displeasing God foreign foreign you love the Lord this morning [Applause] and he has the revelation of God to do that is that man cannot save him because he told me to do this but it says contrary to the word of God but see but that man can't save you Johnny Alvarado Johnny Alvarado cannot save you William Branham William Branham cannot save Garcia Bernie Garcia they cannot save you amen Brothers gracias we want to thank you for your word I want to thank you for visiting us this morning [Music] Lord guide us surrender ourselves to you Lord if somebody has a need place and may you be able to liberate [Music] may you bring them home safely we ask the Lord for our sister may you be with her Lord are you able to touch your body Lord an example Lord for us Lord we place the rest of the service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] foreign [Music] my profiles you are more than enough for me [Music] [Music] foreign
