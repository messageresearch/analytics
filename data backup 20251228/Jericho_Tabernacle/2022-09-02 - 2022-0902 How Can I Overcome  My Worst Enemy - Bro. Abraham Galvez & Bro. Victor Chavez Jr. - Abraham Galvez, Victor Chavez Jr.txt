[Music] the lord [Music] bless the lord for my soul and all god is [Music] [Music] just as you are standing if we can open our bibles to first john 5 4. and when you have it you can say it man for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith we thank you once again for the this service that you've allowed us to have in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen he may be this evening we want to speak on the subject how can i overcome my worst enemy realm if there's no faith in our hearts then we're unable of doing anything because if you ask it without faith you might not be able to get it [Music] stay here and and a part of paragraph 32. and i've often thought of floating driftwood now you take on a stream like the stream of life and plenty of driftwood hanging up in every trash pile yes and yet the boat comes along made out of wood too but if you notice the wood is made and shaped out by a master construct who has built the boat not only is it shaped out but it is guided by a master and is it is pushed by a power helmet and i think we can imagine that we are that driftwood and we're just simply floating in the stream which is called life we're drifting without knowing [Music] [Music] you'll be getting stuck in all kinds of trash of this world getting stuck in every kind of thing that you find along your way and since you're just floating drifting away you're just going to be tossed to the side and won't be able to find the way out but like the scripture says all that overcomes the world are them that are born of god but if you notice the it's also guided by a force that lets it go through all the different kinds of trash and that power is faithful and the master that is driving that boat is actually our lord controlling and when you let the lord to take control and turn you into a bow you say conceived and through the faith that you get through him you'll be able to go through all the different kinds of trash that there is in this world [Music] i would like to read another quote from brother branham in the message how can i overcome which is in paragraph 41 this is just an example that brother venom gives yo crusade he says i was crossing an old log the other day una cuenca and i jumped on this login on the outside it looked good looked like a big old beach log but when i jumped on it oh a great chunk of it fell off it was really it was real rotten and dottie cristianos and i said that's the way christians are becoming they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long question until they become dotty they can hold no weight at all [Music] [Music] he's speaking about a piece of log that he found in the water yes and that piece of log was dotty or was very soft on the inside because maybe it was already a lot of time that i had it had been in the water and then the water got into that log and caused it to become soft and what i liked and what seemed to couple together with the message of faith is a victory it's because brother venom uses a very same example and what seemed very similar to me is that a log was in the water and it had been there for quite a while until it was dead in that water since without a way out and it was getting to such a point that the water was actually coming inside of it and now it becomes us as christians when we're wandering through this world to the to the the different waters through the waters of sin and so forth that water if you do not have the faith to be able to overcome that water will begin to come inside you yes those waters of sin will begin to reach inside of you and when you least think about it you'll become very soft so soft that when a trial comes you won't be able to overcome it because on the inside you're now rotten because it has come to a point that it sucks and it doesn't know how to overcome control it doesn't know how to find a way out [Music] i would like to continue on this part but we know that there's something there's a master that can change us that he can use that would form this is in paragraph 34 material and it says and we are all made out of the same material it just depends on how your ambitions run estadis are you willing to let the master craft and make out of you that which he could use and that which he could control and that which he could power every one of us is made we're crafted out of the same wood that the very lord can use then why then should i come to church i'd just rather stay at home watching the videos that they upload but if you're willing to wear your ambition runs it's up to your decision if you decide to remain in those waters of sin por que se because we know that through these waters the only way that we can come out is that he be the one that guides us and him giving us that faith that can actually power us because as the scripture says faith can overcome right now there is nothing that faith cannot do if you have a problem in your life but if you do not have the faith then how do you hope to overcome ef it's easy to come no doubt pray and ask but if you don't come with faith then what are you expecting if you don't have the faith that the lord can help and supply your need then we're we're without nothing solos implemented we're just rotten on the inside then yeah and it's just simply a teaching that has been laid upon us [Music] but when you are asking and you see what you're asking for is not being fulfilled [Music] and you have not accepted him or you haven't believed that he can help you yes and brother says god wants to mold us and make us what he wants us to be but if we want to continue to float in these waters well that's our own choice and i want to keep reading i said but let me tell you something you uh tonight on the in and outside of this building you're going to wind up at a destination one of these days that's going to be in the valley of the shadows of day prepare i would advise you at this hour to repeat to prepare to meet the god that you will have to meet at that hour you'll either meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or a floating piece of driftwood to go into your final destination so don't you use this life just to drift around and float around and get a better job and to dress better but there's higher ambitions in the human life than those things and christians should set their affection on higher ambitions brother venom says that whoever's on the inside or out you're going to reach one day at destination if you have the life of jesus christ within you or not your life will reach a destination let's not just use our life to be wandering wherever flotars floating aimlessly or without any sense of direction just because we want to be able to manage to get better things sometimes you as a human you uh take priorities on other things that is not church-based for example they gave me an overtime at work and then the other day the next day when service comes and then it's the same thing over again and then it goes by and then the next week again it's the same thing to such a point that you find out you actually left the church that the direction of your life ended up in a different place you began to float in a different direction you had a starting point he drifted and then got stuck in the garbage aimlessly and without any sense of direction that's why brother branham says if you become a masterpiece that became a boat you were able to go through those waters you're going to reach a destination but if you were just a a simple piece of floating driftwood you're just stuck in the water you also reach your destination but it's a different one [Music] people what they think that they have to do is be up to date with the fashions of the world and with the temptations of the world he says daniel when he was taken to babylon despite that he was abandoning his home and that he had to become a slave of people of different nations but daniel it didn't matter to him what they did to him in his heart he was not going to defile himself with the babylonian sin um and i now want to apply this to us the young people including me including myself that sometimes we think that at school that regardless of whatever they would do to him he would not defile himself with the sin of babylon we should do the same for because at school they say oh you don't want to smoke you don't want to do this you don't want to do that we'll just not hang out with you you're really boring because you know that there will be a day when you will reach a destination yes [Music] because the mind is playing tricks on us instead of helping us it's actually taking us out from where we should be amigos maybe you're with your uh so-called friends from school and they get together in a group and they're going to go do something maybe something bad because in the world they don't do anything that's good yes and then in your mind you begin to have these thoughts that say hello just go it doesn't matter if you nothing happens if you just do it once and then you can come afterwards repent and everything will be just fine and then that one time becomes another time and then another time and then it becomes an endless cycle that when you come to find out you ended up being stuck in this trash of the stream of life letting that water come in inside you tampo so rotten on the inside and it can get to the point that you look so firm oh look the brother is dressed he looks like he's a really good christian but you don't know what's inside that person that when the moment comes when a trial comes that and then they found out that the the inside was so rotten of so much time that they were stuck in that water can control salida that they could not find their way out and brother branham says when you have that kind of determination in your heart god will open the the doors of heaven and something has to happen you've got to get to business with god and have some purpose and some gratitude for him for him saving you if we have enough confidence and faith in him but if you come and say no i don't believe the lord can save me i don't think he would want to because uh a while ago i used to go to church but then i got i went away don't get tired of being on your knees keep trying to read your message and draw closer to him [Music] and a man that ever comes to god and really down in his heart finds a set of faith it'll stand good in the mouth of death or in the mouth of sickness or in the mouth of sorrow it'll stand good for faith is the victory you have overcome by your faith when you have faith then you are able to overcome whatever [Music] there is no power or anything that once you have the faith in the one that has saved you then nothing can hold you back from overcoming uh with this i'll be closing if you can please stand when you have it [Music] you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world because his faith is in us towards him that faith is greater than whatever the world can do that faith is even greater from the world trying to hold you back let's uh let's put in our effort to not be floating through this life of the world and don't lose the faith sometimes it seems tough and i say it because sometimes you yourself you lose the desire to come to church and you even come to the point that you think what's the point of coming here i've had those thoughts but sometimes god works in an unexpected way yes because once the lord can show you that he can save you or there's a way they can he can show that he is with you that he can drive you forward out of where you are that's when your desire comes up again now sometimes you you feel like there's no point of just kneeling down and praying you're waging war against the you're trying to find a way to get out of that garbage where you're stuck in yeah yes and that's when he wants to attack you even more and more and more that way you don't keep going and that's why and do whatever he wants with us i'll be now giving the place to my brother and may the lord bless you [Applause] amen may the lord richly bless you uh just how you are i just want you to open your bibles you can open your bibles with me to um revelations chapter 3 verse 10. and uh once you have it just say amen or my bad uh verse 21. that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in thy in my throne even as i also overcame and i am sat down with my father in his throne i just want to go over that again to him that overcome it i will grant to sit with me says to sit with me not over asico mojo and i am sat down with my father in his throne amen may god bless the reading of his word just like to um go over what our what my brother abraham said uh he was talking about how brother branham i'm sorry if you can please you can take your seats may be seated just want to go over on how our brother abraham on the message how can i overcome represent he talked about paragraph uh 41. he talked about that old log hey and when brother branham stepped on it or jumped on it and just like our brother uh abraham said and we just put it as a title [Music] but i just want to ask you this question right now are you really a christian this evening right now if god came through those doors right there can you look to him in his eyes and say it just want to go over the message on how i can and then there you you take a christian christian that's supposed to be a christian christian and let the life of god go from him so brother brother branham talks about how we call ourselves christians how we're supposed to carry ourselves like christians but just take away that experience just let the life of god just go away from him and brother branham says he rhymes twice as fast we can just go to paragraph 43 real quick so we're trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ and you know these things that you're supposed to do and you the bible said he that knows to do good and does and thus it not to him it's sin in man brother branham talks um talks about how you can be in the church when you're separated from the life of god now listen to this so strive with all that it's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit-bearing man brother branham is saying try your best [Music] to to make the best effort to put your whole mind and body to to gotti man man just put it in the hands of god incoming so that you may be a light unto this world amen like our brother abraham said um that uh he gave the example of the youth and he said that uh um that they might invite you to do uh worldly things amen and uh in your head you say well well i'm a christian right i'm a christian and you tell them uh i can't go you know i got church today let's say you got church today cristiano no puede porque bueno de gamos que hoytengorto and like the you say it's just a one-time thing but like our brother abraham said that one time thing comes into two es three four five entrees that's why brother branham says that we gotta be fruit bearing because we live in a world of sin [Music] and the bible says that we're a light unto this world [Music] so we can so we find here that god has always had overcomers in every age he's had overcomers there's always um every time in that age that there's been on earth god has always had someone he could put his hands on uh amen uh i believe we have uh we have examples in the in the bible i heard a brother one time said that some people call this a history's book or it's just uh it's just a storybook but i feel like this is a this is like our foundation and we have good examples throughout the bible who we can look through los cuales podemos mirar and they they've gone over the same thing that we have amen uh he so continue on on 52 he that believeth in me has everlasting life and shall not come to condemnation or the judgment but yes passed from death unto life christ gave the promise christo that we would not even stand at the judge at the judgment so freely so freely that he take my place until i'm absolutely free amen when god i feel i believe that when god makes a promise you keep saying amen and i can and there's many brothers and sisters here that can say the same thing sometimes we may think that um you know god god is running late or god god's not hearing me but god god has this time it's not by my merits i can't do it by myself yes victor i praise god amen just keep reading so freely that he that he'd take my place until i'm absolutely free when i'm pardoned how can how can he take me out of the pawn shop if i got a clear receipt how can he be my redeemer and take me from the pawn shop and the broker says if you say that i still belong to him amen you see wrote by the blood of jesus christ now in that here where he uh we have come in so brother brandon i'm here at manom branham is is talking about uh the promise garmin established that we want to stand in at judgment and we're absolutely free under the blood absolutely amen and he's saying that that we have mercy that we have a clear receipt by the blood of jesus christ men how many believe we have that were seen this morning and uh paragraph 65. um we i want to go back on when we were saying that the bible has the greatest examples jesus referred to it jesus and said as it was in the time of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man in noah's time perhaps of millions of people there was about eight overcomers so in the time of noah there was only eight overcomers [Music] he's a he's a type of today and uh how just there was eight overcomers and he's talking about how they did it now if if you're laying around getting a doughy daddy hurry quick because the door might close at any time the is the pastor you know is he busy he says you get in quick me get in there yo before the door shut anthony and there's always been an ark in god's economy there was an ark in the days of noah for the saving of his people there is an ark in these days of the law the ark of testimony in these days now i want to look at another overcomer brother branham says this is in the days of daniel and daniel's time there was four overcomers so instead of eight we have four now that could stand at the test of the fire and the lion pudiero now we're expected to be tested amen uh it says he that cometh to god must be first tested and it says tested by what it is [Music] so don't just think that um you know you're a christian christian no you got baptized yeah but uh he's gonna be like oh everything is gonna be uh you because in order to overcome something there must be a test amen and in the scripture of peter it says that are that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold brother branham here says it's testing time okay and it says it's it's um it's one good evidence that god it's one good evidence to us that god is with us this is [Music] daniel was the prophet daniel prophet and that was the size of the church today or i mean the bride there's lots of church aviabastante about two million of them but there was um that that was the size of the overcomer you take back the uh the word says or you be thrown into the fiery furnace they refuse anything but the word and just just to paraphrase the paraphrase brother branham uh continues on that uh they threw uh meshech uh hamrick and ben to go to the fiery furnace but god always has our back if you have god's back and if you're an overcomer god will have your back the bible says that god was in the middle of the three hebrew children brother branham says that it doesn't matter if you're thrown into the fire e di cinema bronchi no importa series into that same fiery furnace uh a few years back or the lions then oh there isn't no lion no not even a flame yama that can harm you que puede a certe danyo man i'm gonna be closing shortly if you can please stand yeah um now continuing on uh uh we're gonna look at another overcomer we're going to look at a lot now we can see that is uh is referred uh to on that age there was only three overcomers this time and brother brown says that not even his wife overcame this and i'm gonna just read uh paragraph 82 really quick [Music] well lot's wife uh did the same thing he said you know she set out to go on with lot to follow her and her husband her children her loved ones but it wasn't in her heart but and even though she was uh well on the road finally overthrowed her domino she had to take that one big long last look there's where she got caught now listen don't even look back don't have no desires keep going put your mind on calvary lament and keep moving towards christ amen amen uh brother branham says hear that lot that um lot look that lots wife looked back and the reason she looked back it's because she was still uh holding on to the things of the world we can put it on on this day and age you know you're you're still caught up in uh in your friends in school and drugs yes or you don't want to come to church anymore you don't want to keep going on siga delante keep your eyes on the prize amen i just want to say one last thing on the book of the seven seals [Music] and brother and uh if you put it in bleach the ink is gone and brother branham explains uh uh how it works the ink is still there but it has transformed to a new nature amen and i believe that's how we are supposed to be right now that we're that black uh that black uh ink and that god transforms us he creates us into a new creature we're not how we used to be in the world amen amen it's a god god says it's it's it's not by a sword or by an army but it's by the holy ghost amen we need the holy ghost to overcome this very important is this david david when he went to go um defeat the uh goliath giant he didn't come with an army and he has this big giant in front of him and we're just just one just that one stone icon he kills a giant el mata and i believe we have giants this morning if you have any giants this evening amen we have we have a lot of sisters here right here she's standing right here brothers this evening you don't think you can take your knee this evening god can't transform you can just close your eyes quickly yes we can see that in uh first samuel but we can see uh david he was going to ziklag and the malachites they took they took um everything they took his wife their kids and the and the army the army that was with uh david and we can see the the stress that david has the army is trying to stone him but the bible says that that david uh found refuge in his in his lord [Music] and he didn't just find refuge but he consulted with god where once more lord we're here lord yeah lord we yours here's your children lord i don't i don't know what's wrong with them lord or what giants they have in their life but lord they want to be overcomers this evening or
