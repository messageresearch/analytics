San Martin correct and then the next Church age was tatara uh can anybody remember the saint in the messenger angel that age Colombia is right and that's 606-15 is the next was Sardis Church age which was last night and anybody of course you know what the angel that church age was remember Martin Luther and then his was 15 20 on to 1750. and tonight we're on the Philadelphia Church age which is John Wesley the messenger of that day from 1750 to 1906 18. it's the age of Brotherly Love Yes Philadelphia dese yes now we find out that each one of these churches Church ages expressed the characteristic of that church uh it told what the church was and the characters of the church the characteristic rather of the church Iglesias is now last night was Martin Luther I in these I am the reason I'm getting this and the boys are putting it on tape I'm studying all day long and you say all day long on just what little history you give here is no the historical points that go in the book see this year I'm reason to get here is to get these things pulled out by the inspiration from the for you people where we gather together to get the inspirational part of it is the history I can read that out of the book but this is where I'm looking for the inspiration that we pick it up from the tapes then we got that that we got in the book then we'll have both the historical data of it and also the inspiration of the holy spirit is give us while we're together here this heavenly places in Christ Jesus and I believe it or to make a striking little commentary um on these Church ages and the Lord grant His blessings to it is being the Sardis Church age was really in the Greek was called the escape-on but I believe in the English translation uh is dead now it was both a dead church and an escape one because it was a church that had died under the purple rain in the 1500 there 1520 of the of the great Purple Rain which we call the Dark Ages where uh Christianity was at the lowest ever ever has been or ever will be even in the lady ocean Church age now this one of the Striking things I'll keep wearing on your mind that these Church ages start and whatever is in that one Church it goes all the way down through every Church age and each one of the church ages lap over one another if you study the history post with the book you'll find out is like laughs like this laying over each other and one Church age is going out and the angel that comes in between there is to call back that church to the faith that it once lost perdio he hit the Revelation there Jude said uh I wrote on to wrote unto you that you might earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is laughing over between the apostles and the coming of the Revelation because most apostles were dead then thing was going on partido one living at that time that was Saint John the Divine which is the Revelator the writer it got the Revelation from the angel of the Lord to write the Book of Revelations now see the lap over one another so now you I guess you've noticed that and picked it up coming down as I've been mentioning how that even here in the the uh Sardis age that was the marriage age actually the church never really come into full existence until satara but it got married in Sardis and Sardis means um uh being a marriage what up Ben is now Mary Jordan had leftover into that age there and noticed Luther last night come out with a dead name a name of dead and then escape on the it had the dead Church from back here and the escaping all the little Remnant that was brought out in this age here is and tonight as we're ending up the Philadelphia agents bringing in the beginning of the lady ocean age yes then tomorrow night when it goes out of the just at the end in order the angel appears right at the end time and just at the end time to rebuke the church for losing its first love and how it's got away from God like they did down through there and at that time the Rapture comes to take the church home the church goes up man just at the time of the message and so we are we are nearing that age now did you get that all right all right see this but the time the the angel of the church the messenger of the age comes in to rebuke them for losing their first love frank Khan to bring him back we've been Ben we've been just same thing the messenger does tonight the angel messenger comes back to rebuke them each age like that for what they had done so that makes a lap over in each one of the church ages is lap right over one another like that like climbing up a step and playing in laps like that going up is biendo now I got just a sharp piece of History here on the messenger for tonight that the uh John Wesley John Wesley was the star of the age and [Music] um he was born on June the 17th 1703 an Epworth rectory England he was the 15th child of 19. John and Suzanne Wesley father and mother Lord Wesley Juan Wesley fueled Australia Juan is father a preacher mother a consecrated saint although with 19 children to take care of she found much time you were a busy day to teach our children Bible lessons and bible stories and pray for them that's what made the boys what they were el padre is the great songwriter Charles his brother who gave the Gates that we've ever had John George Whitefield John Wesleyan George George Whitefield was really the first founder of this Methodist or the sanctification Juan unless George Whitefield Juan Juan Wesley George George Whitefield foreign or LA scientification John Rose up early every morning or 60 years he got up every morning at four o'clock that's one thing the church is falling got up every morning at four o'clock and preached at 5 00 a.m for 50 years straight and sometimes he preached from two to four times a day it is said by people of England that he rode a horse 4 500 English miles every year to preach the gospel 4 500 miles on a that's English miles you know they're longer than ours to preach the gospel Legends many books of his was wrote of but they've long been forgotten now so as their authors you can't do it against the child of God Amen you just you're just fight in the air God's going to take him right on through anyhow yeah El manitas he was called a Methodist because of his methods of doing things it is said in his lifetime that he preached more than 40 000 sermons think of that 40 000 sermons o is going away in 17 and 91 the Methodist denomination took its roots in the world and started the Methodist Church then of course as Barry and many more were in at the time is now if we notice the salute to this church as we're going to start now on the 7th verse the messenger Philadelphia the true church and the true church in the professing church it was a true church in the professing Philadelphia do the angel of the Church of Philadelphia right I've called your attention to the laughing over each one now and you'll get here the angel if you watch the way he brought in the age of the Methodist age lapping on him run over into a little bit of the Philadelphian or to the lady of sin Pentecostal age is Pentecostal messenger comes back to rebuke these for fallen just as this age rebuked them from falling back here in Sardis and the Lutheran age The Leftovers it was a great age of missionaries and missions the world has never seen the time it even goes over into our time now that when the world ever seen such a time of missionaries everywhere in the last well I'd say the last 150 years it's been one of the most outstanding times of world history for missionaries getting into all parts of the world with the Gospel Mission is it has been as far as literally as literally just going sending a message of the Gospel on paper and tracks and books and so forth the gospel has long ago went to Every Nation Under the heavens long ago so you see that ghost to prove that that wasn't what Jesus is talking about he never said go into all the world and make Bible schools he didn't say go into all the world and uh pass out literature Jesus [Music] those things are fine but his commission to the church was going to all the warland preach the gospel and the gospel is not altogether the word but it's making the word come to life is [Music] 16 is last against last mission to the church was these signs shall follow them Ben foreign this first uh commission to the church and Matthew the 10th chapter was heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils as freely as you have received freely give us and his last message to the church was go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe is foreign this is strange that many cut off that part there and is a conjunction it ties your sentence together see now he said you have many uh ministers will say go preach the gospel he that believeth is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them shall follow them them that believe here foreign they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink a daily thing it'll not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover in my name is signs of the Living God moving among the people all how far out to all the world you get it amen amen all over the world [Music] so therefore when I say that the pentic Hostile message not the Pentecostal organization now the Pentecostal message is the only true message from God organizations there right there Jesus commission Church go into all the world preach the gospel these signs speaking in tongues healing sick performing Miracles man well last so how far all the world how many to Every Creature amen amen it's all the way down to the end here amen to the consummation all right these signs shall follow just this church damn that believe in all the world amen amen amen all the world to ever creatures these signs shall follow them not this damn that Phillies amen so it's a Pentecostal Church in this age right here where we're at tonight on the Philadelphian p-h-i-l a Philadelphian Church age and that age there evangelized and has missionaries all the complete world with literature Philadelphia [Music] full is preached to all the world for our witness unto me than the end shall thee Jesus amen well then if that was what he's talked about spreading out literature sending out missionaries with Reading Writing arithmetic and passing out tracks and making people shake hands and believe that there is a God if that's all it was and he's far past is coming forward so it shows that the gospel Paul said the gospel gospel only but through Power amen and manifestations Santo everybody gospel he said go in the going oh I like that demonstrate the power of the Gospel Jesus taking the word that what it says and show the people what it says then make it manifest to them oh that's the way that proves it is standing standing there in missions biggest in the world when he said brother Brown you being a Baptist you all know what's truth I said the Bible's the truth I said the Holy Ghost see and so he said oh I see a hair up the French and kick over the stuff I said yep the only thing it is is you guys hold yourself back and isolate yourself away from them they got plenty of steam they make the wheel roll and do something but they blow it all out the whistle you see this is but they don't know what to do with this got to go somewhere so they just just scream it out not have any steam to go out [Music] that's all I used to say I'd rather be free for a little while I'd rather have a little Wildfire than have no fire at all planted absolutely the trouble of today we try to paint a fire say you know way back in the days of Pentecost it did this now what good does it do to show a freezing man is freezing the death of painted fire and then you're going to help him a bit the problem is and if there's a power God that made the Pentecostals uh work for the Lord and do the works and signs that they did no not yet if you're not just paint the picture but bring the picture in reality to them they'll get the same experience the same salvation seal their own testimony the way they did but you got to get it to them you got to place it back in some other generation but bring it up here now we find out that this age of Brotherly Love was a great missionary age Jesus said into all the world into every creature and these signs shall follow Jesus now as we've come down to the history and Through the Bible I want to ask you hasn't each night we read in the Bible hear what Jesus told John would happen and right here we talk history to proved that it did happen just exactly yeah amen that's the reason I had such a Time searching out these these men to see where that God's servant was and carried this message right onto but he was there he was there just as the Bible said kept the message just like from the beginning never fool with it is now we see it was almost stand out and he called that same age a dead age dark so forth and then come out just a little light and a little more strength and then went into the Pentecostal real experience again right to enzyme and then the bride called away and away it went the tribulation set back in again all right a Great Tribulation which is coming up before all the world is the great missionary aged brotherly love the age of missions let me explain to you some of the great men and then I guess wrote their names on here John Wesley George with the uh Whitefield he was about 1739 Charles G Finney Dwight Moody William Carey The Great missionary went to Indian 1773 David Livingston to South Africa John Wesley George Whitfield Whitefield Charles G Finney Dwight Moody William Kerry David Livingstone in South Africa the although some of those great men just I got names of plenty of them here great man that lived in that brotherly love that the black man the white man the brown man the yellow man all the walls is broke down and these men went out into the mission Fields numbers Heros Brotherly Love stretching out a handle all nations everywhere and it's opened up to him if they could go Amor fraternal is another open door age cause they couldn't before that they couldn't have done it the papal and and papacy of Rome and so forth had also closed up to they couldn't go but at that age the doors is open because he said it was an Open Door age yerta they opened up many doors during that age a door to the gospel the door to the mission field the the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did their Brethren done a great job out of it is and from John Wesley the star actor the Sardis age after he'd come over wake him up from the Sorrows age uh for the past 150 years great missionaries lack of no other time or age before has covered the entire Earth it is the one Wesley Las Vegas is Tierra think of that every nation under the heavens has heard the word it completed many many many years ago see but not the gospel just the word the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
