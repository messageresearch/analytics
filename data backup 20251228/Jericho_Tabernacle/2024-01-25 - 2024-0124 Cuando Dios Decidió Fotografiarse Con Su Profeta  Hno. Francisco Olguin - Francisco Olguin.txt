also want to thank the local Pastor brother for the invitation that he gave me so I can be here tonight and receive greetings on behalf of the brothers they Ino as the Bible says they without knowing you they love you and they send their greetings to you now this I'm go straight to the word let's open our Bibles to the book of First John chapter 1 uh verse 5 first John 15 the Lord says in his word this then is a message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now let us pray our heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we approach your throne of grace I mainly Lord uh I'm asking for your help for what will be speaking or spoke on tonight I ask that you take control over myself and no word that is out of your word be spoken but only your word and Lord tonight a part of your bride is gathered here and as your word says you open your hand and give food in due season and I ask Lord that for the love of your name and for the love of your bride you speak to our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated uh now just as a preface or a pre-introduction I know I believe that the majority of us know or we can remember that today January the 24th is the uh 74th uh an anniversary of the appearing of the pillar of fire William Bram over William branham's Head it was uh taken by a a camera in Houston in the city of Houston I sent some pictures to the brother if they can show them I have that picture has been touched a little but that's the picture but tonight uh my intention isn't really to speak on a sermon but speak on some things on the word and in the message and my talk for tonight I've named it when God decided to be photographed with his Prophet because uh there are things that we must not forget though time goes on even though people attack them for me it's still a reality that God does not change man changes his way of thinking his own perspective but God Remains the Same and I'll start off by reading in the uh 70th week of Daniel the prophet of God says he says he has spoken through me and he has spoken to me and he's spoken to others and he has told me of others and I know that he is God correct he was gracious enough that he came down and allowed that I could take a picture with him where the scientific World cannot deny it so that's where that thought came from God was gracious enough that he allowed uh to be photographed with the prophet of God and I've seen many pictures of ministers where there are lights that appear I'm not going to say anything against that but for me the only thing that is certain and true is that I have the certainty that that was God now in the Bible there are uh six verses where the word Pillar of Fire is uh stated I'm going to read it in Exodus 1321 and 22 and said the L and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people Exodus 14:24 and it came to pass that in the morning watched the Lord look unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians I'm not really going to really explain the scriptures I'm just reading the references that are in the Bible in uh numbers 144 and they will tell it to the inhabitant of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of Fire by night now in these two scriptures that event that took place was recent maybe 40 years had not even passed from when the people of Israel were uh Witnesses of this but as you know as time goes by it's part of human nature to forget things or take away its importance now when you follow Israel's timeline and we know that at a critical stage in their life as a people they were taken tolon for 70 years they were in Babylon but to fulfill the prophecy God put in that King he inspired him so that he could release a zor and that first group of people to go restore the temple now doing that through the uh the priest Nehemiah he reminds them again not so much a recent event maybe hundreds of years had gone by and he says in nemiah 912 moreover thou letest them in in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go verse 19 of this very same chapter says yet thou in thy manifold mercies forer not them in the wilderness the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them the light in the way wherein they should go now for Nehemiah uh in spite of this event had taken place hundreds of of years before he still had the remembrance because this is a prayer that he's doing and he's REM remembering that for him an event because here he's not speaking in present T he's speaking of something that happened in the past so when Moses writes it in Exodus uh many witnesses could remember and say yes of course during the night there was the pillar of cloud that would protect us from the Sun or during the day and then during the night and during the night the pillar of fire would uh would give us life now during the time of nemiah there was no more witnesses however he he highlighted this because for him in spite that he was not a witness of of that it was still a reality there was a pillar of cloud and there was a pillar of fire brother bham said that the scarecrows are are where the best are that's why today they began to use this to attack the message trying to undermine and diminish the the confidence in the people in this that for us is a reality that's why we should never allow that this should simply fall to the ground because it is part of our identity now in each one of these biblical quotations yeah it refers to the people of Israel in their Exodus out of Egypt and God's presence in the form of a cloud to protect them from the scorching sun and the Wilderness by day and in the form of the pillar of fire to give them light in the darkness of the night now that fire was not something else but God himself because John just told us that this is the message that we have heard from the beginning for God is light now that very same light with time did not just remain in in history now in the New Testament it became present again because that was the same light that encountered with on his way to Damascus acts 9 it says and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven now look the Bible says that it was that at noon when this happened that testimony that PA had shows up three times in the book of act one of those times that Paul is testifying he says that that light was even stronger than even the sunlight and then he says and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him this voice where did it come from from the light and the light told him Saul saw why persecuted me now Saul was not an ignor he immediately related that to the pillar of fire that had led the people of is that's why his immediate question Lord Lord now look he said and the Lord said uh sa why persecuted th me now brother Bram says that Paul being a a scholar of the scriptures not just to anything was he going to call Lord for him to call him Lord because he knew that it was the Lord and therefore instead of identifying himself and saying I am Jehovah he said I am Jesus Jesus was the L that came out of God made it flesh and came back once again to be the logus but the story does not end there another time Peter was uh laid in prison because of his stance in preaching the name of Jesus now brother God never forgets anything God sends his angel in the form of a light Acts 12 and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shine in the prison now look you think a light is unable to be touched or inang you can only see it but you can't touch it but here the Bible is telling us that this light it it smoke or it struck him Peter it struck him on his side now we can see these lights here and then a light has no other effect but just to light up the place but how is it that we can understand what the Bible is saying it doesn't say that it merely touched him but it SM him the lights for what reason to wake him up on his side and raised him up arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands brother Bram tells us that this light was the very light appeared to Sol of Tarsus now that very same Pillar of Fire that the Bible is speaking of once again is manifested in a world to show that it's the same God that is ever present je of the Old Testament now becomes Jesus of the New Testament and God wanting to show his interest in mankind after ages in centuries of not showing himself in the form of the P fire he does it again in the place where people would least think it would be that he would do it in a humble cabin in the state of Kentucky to vindicate the birth Prophet to the Gentiles William Mar and BR if they can now show the second picture now notice what brother Ram says and the message early spiritual experiences and he says and there in this little laog cabin on that morning April the 6th when the Midwife opened the window so that the light could come in to let Mom see how I looked and Dad D when they looked inside there was a light there that was whirling around through the window roughly around the size of a pillow and it spun around where I was it fell on the bed and several mountain people there they were crying years later uh specifically on Sunday June of 1933 before a crowd of people as he was baptizing belie Believers in the Ohio river that very same Pillar of Fire once again appears in the form of a star now look uh one of these days we were speaking somewhere else yesterday those pictures that you can see is a series about five or six pictures they were taken by sister hope brother BR first wife she didn't live long enough to testify of the voice but there within that crowd there was a teenager there with the name meta branam she was there she was close the edge of the river in such a way that when the voice spoke she heard it and you know what she said you know one one time what she said to Le she said brother this she says that she speaking about that situation she told Brother BR she said Billy it was your voice so then God allowed if there was a witness now you might say what the social press didn't come it's like we wanted the social press to come here tonight and they dedicate to what they have but God did have a witness so then as years went by Reverend William Bram eventually went into a healing uh Ministry that took him almost to every corner that's in the United and to several nations in the world and he before the audience many times he mentioned the presence of that Pillar of Fire in his life and Ministry maybe in the minds of the people that were listening to him there there was a questions if those stories about the light were true or not that's what he was saying but God wanted to clear all doubts from the minds of the people so then he decided himself to make himself present in the form among a scientific world for there to be scientific Pro of what this Prophet was saying that what he was saying was true and now here we're starting tonight if they can put the fourth picture now that picture it was taken on August the 4th of 1946 wasn't in the fourth but it was in the month of August of 1946 Aransas in candom Arkansas now notice what the prophet of says and the message The Works that I do bear witness of a bear record of me he says I remember that one night in candom Arkansas I was speaking like this and the angel of the Lord came in and a minister called Adams the man that you can see on that side he's Adams that the one that brother bam is speaking about I'm read he says and the angel of the Lord came in and a minister by the name of Adams his father was the minister here in Phoenix a long time ago maybe some of you knew who was I believe it was an individual called Adams he used to be here a long time ago I don't know if he was a Pentecostal man or what his son as soon as that Whirlwind came in and it rested where I was the that the image of that is behind there in my book what book is brother Ron referring to the book of William Brandon a man sent by God if you have that book that picture is published there and you can say where's the Supernatural part in the picture now if you notice the two faces of both men now in the in the in the backdrop you can see there's lights in the auditorium but if you notice there is a difference between brother bram's face and the face of Reverend Adams the one of Reverend Adam you can see the light is behind his head but if you look brother Bron's profile his face does not seem darkened that light was there around him and the prophet of God said and he ran towards me to grab my hand and when he did he simply blinded his eyes and his his head back fell back and a journalist that was there took the picture H and now the picture Houston Texas today we're celebrating because I believe that we should celebrate the 74 anniversary when that picture was taken the prophet says in Jehovah Gyra and he says and look in that Pillar of Fire that's in the picture the night that it was photographed it was in Houston H in the Sam Houston Coliseum we were taking we were having about 8,000 people in there in the Music Hall we were there that night with about 32,000 now the prophet obviously in all of his message he always referred hundreds of times to that picture but tonight I don't want it to be him to come and speak to us about that picture I'll say it like this I'm going to invite someone else that was there and they knew of the event and his name is Gordon Lindsay and now of course I got this not from a book but from Brother bram's own sermons if now if you have the chance to hear the message at Thy word uh preached on uh uh July the 17th of 195 starting with uh paragraph 36 now you can see what Gordon Lindsay is saying now this picture was taken in January Gordon Lindsay now Gordon Lindsay here he's speaking this practically about 6 months afterwards what does that mean that that event was fresh still in the mind of the people now notice what Gordon Lindsay says he says as the prayer line is getting ready he says I want to show you this picture that it just so happens that we found today one that brother brandham was speaking about which shows the light that is Supernatural over his head do you think Gordon Lindsay was foolish enough to call something Supernatural that wasn't he was there he knew the place in the auditorium he knew what he was talking about Gord Gordon Lindsay was not obligated to recognize that that light was Supernatural unless that he himself was fully convinced that it was Supernatural as soon as that picture was taken I made the uh the arrangements for the negative to be taken to the uh examiner of dubious pictures La houon Mr George Lacy of Houston Texas and I asked him I said I said you have all the ways of uh to use science at your disposition can you tell me that if there is any possibility that that picture in particular was forged can you tell me if there was a a super imposer if you can tell me if it was a double exposure can you tell me if the the film was doctored in one sense he says I absolutely can so then he took it it took us a substantial amount of money being that he was a scientist that was hired for that job and he examined it for many hours in his laboratory and then he signed with his own name in the lower part he stated that the negative was absolutely absolutely truly genuine I can only add this the picture was taken by a hostile photographer someone that had spoken against the meeting the fact is that he the even was was published in the newspaper and he was just as shocked as everyone else they were Jews Orthodox Jews and so then I consider this is simply a verification and Confirmation and brother Ram considers it not that he is Supernatural in any way but a Vindication of his ministry and a message to bring Divine Healing to the people of the world what do you think now let's hear something that the prophet of God says about the purifier in the message the unconditional Covenant that God made with his people he's in the prayer line and he says a person how are you he say I can see that you have one of those pictures he says well that's fine he says I just want to talk to you for a moment I suppose we're strangers one to another so I don't know you but my Lord knows you and he knows me and I let's speak about the picture just only for a moment if you wish very well you have the little story of how that happen here yes ma'am that was confirmed by George J Lacy he's one of the best in research and fingerprints and things like that that I guess are in the world and that pillar fire that you can see there some time ago there was a miracle that was performed it was this a lady placed it in a picture frame many of them put them in a frame and they put something behind it and someone asked for that and she had it on her bedside in the hospital and she was seeing not me of course not but she was seeing that Pillar of Fire that was there and she states this is her testimony the doctor gave her up to die she said that that Pillar of Fire came out of the picture and held itself above her two days later she was released from the hospital and she went to her house healed you see God only she only like a it was only her contact with that you see she only she only looked at that and believed now we know that to look at that in any other way would be as idolatry we wouldn't want to do that you see it's not the picture it's what she represents so you understand that now the prophet of God having that picture he wanted to take it to Finland and that picture was taken on August 23rd 1950 where he himself he's showing the picture now we've had two so far the next one in uh laon Switzerland there's a series of four pictures that were taken during a ministerial breakfast which was held on uh Saturday August 27th of 1955 now even the the magazine of the businessman they they published that picture because of its Supernatural content now I'm just remembering right now that I have a copy of that in Mexico but he going back to Jeffersonville the prophet takes this very occasion and he explains what is happening now that's the seven picture I'm going to quote from the message the unwelcome Christ and now notice what he says and he says and here is a picture from the ministeri of breakfast now you can see how the pictures are how the lights are up here how they look how the room looks and there's around there about six after before that and at six after now there it is this has me standing there that's The Interpreter and that is Dr goab and that's brother Bosworth all of these are H stately pastors of churches and groups of them very well now when it appeared that is noticeable you see there's no light or anything there when it appeared the eighth picture the next one the prophet begins to explain it and he says it in this uh very message he says now when I got up and said please stand the angel of the Lord is here here here it is now that's where it's going down look here am I standing here it's coming down they got the image of it going up going down from the roof as it was going down you can see everyone looking in this image here is uh looking on the side of its eye the ninth picture now notice what the prophet explains now here it's where it now came down and you can't see anything else but my shoulders there that's when the vision is going on when the it is telling him the 10 picture and here is where it's leaving my face with the half of my face cut off with the vision the angel of Jehovah the the glory of Jehovah going off do you see it there and here it is after it was done in any place now when the prophet Ezekiel this is very important about what I'm going to say the prophet Ezekiel he saw God's glory in between the cherubims he described that light of fire that it was of an amber color in Ezekiel 1:4 and then verse 27 and he said and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a about it and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber uh verse 27 of and it says and I saw as the color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the and from the appearance of his going even down I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about in eel 82 it says then I beheld in low a likeness as the appearance of of fire from the appearance of his loin even downward from his loin even upward as the appearance of brightness as the color of Amber so in these scures the fire that Ezekiel sees he says it is of an Amber col now going back to the pictures the pictures that were taken up until now where that light appeared all of them were in black and white and so you could not appreciate the color of the light but brother Bram he could see the color of the light in the message God testifying of his gifts now he says here he is he's close if you can believe it the entire building is becoming in an amber light everywhere have faith in God believe him with all your heart now I'm going to uh interject something here uh when brother B speaks about the film of the of Moses and the Ten Commandments he says that was a masterpiece that the theil made but in the entire film there's something that that Drew his attention they can put the 11th picture you've seen that picture in the movie The Ten Commandments that's when God's fire it strikes The Rock and it writes The Ten Commandments and notice what the prophet of God says and the message questions and answers on the Holy Ghost M he said has any of you seen the movie of cisil De that is called the 10 Commandments did you notice that when the Ten Commandments were written how did he catch it I didn't know there was two or three things that I saw there that I really liked the first one was that Emerald light because that's exactly how it se you see another thing was when the Commandment was being written and after he wrote them did you notice that coming out of that huge Pillar of Fire there was little clothing tongues that were coming out did you notice that I'm placing this base because all the pictures that were taken were in black and white but he said that the pillar fire was the an amber but once again how can we have the certain the certainty that it was that now let's go to Lakewood California in the month of October of 1958 God wanted to make sure in every way that what his Prophet was saying was the truth in October of 1958 Lort during some services that that brother Benham held in Lakeport California that Pillar of Fire appeared but now in color if they can put the 12th picture that's how it looked that's how the picture originally looked but they took a second picture the 13th picture and now this appears now remember brother B already told us that Ezekiel said that that light was uh amber the prophet of God said that the light that he saw in his meetings was of an amber color and he makes reference to that movie of The Ten Commandments the Lord wanted to make sure because sometimes people want uh scientific proof for everything but I want to say one thing to the Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God now I I with those pictures and without those pictures I believe in William brandham statement but tonight we're presenting it so that the new generations could know that this is not a myth this is true now notice what he says about this picture uh in the message Watchman what of the night and he says and here some nights ago maybe the strangers have not seen it maybe they uh saw another I have it at home it's the profile of the Lord Jesus standing just behind where I was standing his hands stretched out and clothing tongues of fire flying out of his as I spoke on the topic speak to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but and we have it it's in Tech it's in the kod chrome color and now they have it at home and they're doing it's been now examined by science and so on in Laboratories it will soon come out another one what about six of them now that were in different places that have been taken in and photographed this is the most outstanding of all of them it had never been seen there is his beard his face his profile his outstretched arms and I was standing there like this where he has his arms you can't even see my part like my head and then my feet they're on the on the floor only the head and the feet it was all that was seen you see and he's standing there with his outstretched arms like that and I have my hand stretched down like this preaching saying speak to this mountain in that moment something happened and here the brother he snaps his finger and he says and that's how they photograph that and there was behind there with h full color and a great like God had as God deci said a great basket of Lies there close by and later on and it says and the great Lily basket is there in the front where I was speaking there on the platform the next one Dallas Texas in March of 1964 the 14th picture now I forgot because I just remember if you look at the picture you can see the the door is a jar and someone can say well it's the inside light that's striking him on the shoulder I have another picture Jack where brother ROM is with Gordon lizy and Jack Mo in the same position in the same place in that back door of the church and there's nothing that appears there just in this one up to the knowledge that I have brother Bram did not speak about this picture the fact that he did not speak about this picture does not mean he did not have any knowledge of it but brother peren in the book The Acts of the prophet he makes this remark he says behind the church souls harbard in Dallas Souls Harvard church in Dallas Tas Texas he says in February but it was in March March of 1964 another strange uh picture of brother Ram was taken which reveals a supernatural light that that light appeared on in this picture as a strange tongue of fire upon the right shoulder of the Prophet the people that knew brother Branham are acquainted with the fact that he always had his uh right shoulder lower than his left one I don't know how many of you have seen those home films that were Tak where the Prophet is walking and I've proven it Time After Time what brother green is saying here is true and I've seen that I can prove it to anyone brother green keeps saying he says the anointing was always on his right side where the angel of the Lord would stand when brother Billy Paul showed this picture to his father brother Bram told him to keep it he said they did not believe the one in Houston neither will they believe this one for this reason hardly anyone ever saw this picture unless until after the death of brother Bram then brother Billy Paul hung up that picture in his office but did not give out copies due to the instructions that brother BR had given him that's why the prophet of God always wanted that people that were going through the prayer line would stand on his right side because he would say that the angel of the Lord would stand on his right side now we can find a reference to this in the Bible in Luke 1:1 here the Bible speaks of Zechariah and it says and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the on the right side of the altar of incense now uh uh sunset Mountain Arizona May 19th of 1965 now the last three pictures that were taking of brother Bram where the pillar of fire appears upon a rock it also includes his son Joseph that Wednesday on the of the Year 1965 in the month of May of the May 19th his son Joseph was having a birthday and brother Bram wanted to take him to Sunset Mountain where that loud noise happened on Good Friday in 1964 many pictures were taken but from all that were taken there's three that stand out this is the first picture this is Brother BR The Rock The Rock being bathed with that Amber color light the next picture if you look on the left side you can see the light on the Rock the next one here is more evident at the bottom of the picture you can see that Amber color even on the the table and The Rock there to the knowledge that I have that was in May of 196 to what I know brother bam did not speak about this picture but the one that took those pictures I have a series about seven pictures among them are these the one that took these pictures Roy Robertson was Roy Robertson now notice what he says I brought this out of the only believe magazine volume uh three number two uh the eth Edition page 16 and now notice what he says he says on May the 19th of 1965 was uh the 10th anniversary of Joseph the son of brother Bram and brother Bram took him along with several other brothers and myself to Sunset Mountain to spend the day there I had taken with me a little camera Browning uh one of the Browning uh brand but when we got there I saw that some of the other brothers had newer cameras and even better ones I let them take the pictures and brother Bron began to relate some of the things that had taken place in that place telling Joseph where the different things had taken place and as he did it the brothers were taking pictures and then brother Bram addressed me and said brother Roy would you like to take the picture of me standing on this rock here I said of course brother BR I took out my little camera and I began to take pictures I took one of him standing alone on the Rock then he asked Joseph to uh get up on the rock with him and I took one of them together in total I took an amount of 12 pictures of that day and brother Bram told me as soon as you develop the film of those I want to see them many days later when when uh the people that developed the film returned the film to me I showed them to my wife and I uh very upset said there must have been something wrong with my camera because some of these pictures are complete scratched are completely scratched with the color our department or our apartment was just uh down the street where brother Bram lived and I went to his house to show him the pictures when I told him what I had in my hand he called sister Bram and began to show her the pictures and said you see here's what I told you this is the the angel of the Lord that you see on the Rock now I believe that my Exposition should end here it's already enough but now let's go to something last night I told the brothers that when a minister say I'm closing I really don't believe him but I just want to touch this uh at his grave site now the first picture of uh the first picture showing brother Ram's grave site that one now this is the grave site when they just bar uh were they barely buried brother R there's no h headstone or gravestone there it's just that's how it was back then and a little Eagle there laying now you can see there is a light of the same color in the in the form of an eye the next picture I'm going to tell you this one because this picture has a story now this story it was told by Brother Hickerson now this picture was taken after Brother bram's cast was had already dropped down to the ground was already buried in the ground Hickerson brother holl Hickerson that was a deacon at brandom tabernacle during brother bram's time he said that it was a day or several days later when that picture was taken after after the the casket was laid in that they took this picture now he remembers Robertson that the residents of brotherson rather he remembers that the relatives of brother Roy Robertson a truste of Bram tabernacle during William bram's time they saw the casket above the ground after the burial and so they made this comment he says what kind of religion leaves the casket on the ground after but the casket was already dropped into the ground now this picture shows that there was there something appearing to the human eye that the casket was already dropped down to the ground that's how brother Hickerson tells this story now he was one of the Paul Bears of the casket to that place so he fir hand he knew that the casket had already gone into the ground now those pictures now you remember the old uh pictures that were of of the rolls there wasn't Photoshop back there to edit them or um manipulate them but that's how it appears in the form of a casket the third picture now you can see this one is in black and white but you can see a circle of light that is around the picture the next one now you can see this this was a screenshot of a video in this video there's some brothers that are going I think it was during the 90s and they were with the camera recording brother bram's bra and then suddenly out of the out of the grve there com a lot van amber color as it was a dove that was uh flapping its wings there they just took the picture so that you can see that and then the last one maybe this one is not as known uh there appears that light in the form of the cloud so please stand in what better way to remember that a day like today God decided to be photographed with this Prophet there's too many evidences for this to be false no one uh tampered with this it's it's that God simply wanted to do it so that the Believers could believe it I say it again even in this pictures did not exist but if the prophet of God said I would have believed it because I'm a Believer God called me to be a believer there's things that the Bible says there's no evidence for it never we should not deny them because there's no evidence we believe them but in a scientific World God had to show through science to vindicate that this message and this messenger came sent from God let us pray father I would like to thank you this evening Lord that you allowed me speak on these things Lord Jesus I think we should never allow Lord that this is left in Oblivion that if this world were to exist for a 100 more years or 200 more years May those Generations just like Nehemiah can remember that Lord you cared enough in human Affairs that you decided to be photographed with your Prophet father I thank you tonight for this thought of your word leave it in our hearts Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] Grand
