this place but in our lives individually Hallelujah and we adore you and we worship you Jesus amen hallelujah God bless you this morning Hallelujah good to be in his presence amen welcome our visitors God bless you tremendously no let me just give you just so she fixes me here you know I wasn't supposed to be here today that's a mystery Junior was supposed to preach we were supposed to be in Burlington but God knows everything amen love you dearly and greet your pastor back home brother Chad he's my friend my buddy and and we love you there amen amen are we still good no that's all right we had technical difficulties last Sunday so it just means the devil's still alive amen First Timothy I don't know if we can get our 1 Timothy 3 16 amen without conscious rsy great is the m mystery of godliness where God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels and preached unto the Gentiles believed in on in the world and received up into Glory Hallelujah let's turn over to another scripture amen just got to find it here Matthew 5 and9 just one more scripture let's go along with our thought this morning amen Matthew 59 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God lord Jesus we ask you bless your word and and Lord we pray that your anointing and presence will be in this place to minister to the bride what you want to feed the sheep this morning we pray in your beautiful name amen you may have your seats amen hallelujah you know we want to look at our first scripture and maybe you can leave that up on the screen 1 Timothy 3 you know it says great with and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness and that word controversary means disagreement it typically means a prolonged and heeded argument it also means a long discussion an argument involving involving strong feelings of anger amen hallelujah a mystery let's just look at just to lay a foundation here let's look at a quote that a prophet said he said you know he said God Called Moses for his purpose and he thought surely the people of Israel would understand what he had sent him for but the people misunderstood Moses Jesus they couldn't believe he was God but they believed in God but they couldn't believe that he came from God he was God and it Disturbed them that when he said that he was equal with God they said how in the world could Jesus Jesus being illegitimate that was their testimony poor and born in a manger be connected to Elohim you see this mystery we're talking about he says listen this is our Prophet talking he said now listen here friends the more simpler you can be the more God can deal with you he said I'm not against education and education's all right we we need to be able to read and write he said but people get so highly educated till they think they know more about it than God does and when then you miss they miss the whole goal he said you got to forget everything you know in your own knowledge to know Christ he said well you just come like a childlike and accept him that's all he said that's the way you accept God and the more simply you can get and the more humbly you can get away from yourself and your own ey ideas and just let God's word take what it was meant for and believe it it's by faith those that come and watch what he says and he says not what not one of you can figure it out now now we're living in in a re in a day where the message came and revealed all the mysteries of the Bible and we're we're blessed before any more than any age ever and we have more understanding than that tremendously but how can your three-b brain op understand an omnipotent God Amen Hallelujah some things are just impossible he said you'll never this is our prophecy Moses he said you'll never be able to he said there's never been a man on Earth no saint nor no one has ever figure God out whoa you can't he said so don't think that you can do something that they cannot do cuz it can't be and that's right you just believe him and that's what he wants you to do to figure him out you know I I mentioned that this was a mystery and even us being here today we're going to go to Burlington Lord willing after service and and you know we went to a wedding yesterday for my niece and and uh we got a nice shower of rain yesterday evening and last night and through the night and so I had been talking with Junior through the week and you know I had a message prepared for today and which is going to be Father's Day message Lord willing next week and and Junior had told me he said if it rains he said I'll be here and so he sent me a message in the wedding and he said he said D I'm putting tomatoes I won't be there and me and Lan almost got soak drenched leaving the wedding I mean it was Noah's Ark I called Junior up and they said Junior it's not raining he said no it's not raining at all I said that's unbelievable and I said well okay see it was a mystery brother Dale had it in his head the brother Dale wouldn't be here see we're trying to figure God out we putting God in a box we say well our God's just exactly like this and that's his plan and so we were up early this morning Junior message me at 6:30 he said we got a teeny bit of rain but we're still planting tomatoes and so you know our girls sing that special and it's amazing how you can get so caught up and going home that it it just this world just it's it's like a foreign place you know and and and just the environment you know we've had a lot of quiet time because of the weather and I've been on my front porch and I've list listened to books of the Bible not just chapters books and this last week I'd go for Drive I I called my older brother that were friends with and I told my wife I said I sure wish I could go see that someday we will but you know if and many of you did if you had a dad like me he just had a way show up he wouldn't say nothing but it was just a calming atmosphere it was a stability it was an understanding that in the Mysteries that everything will be okay amen he couldn't fix it but our Heavenly father's like that amen and no matter what storm you're going through amen you just sit in The Presence of Jehovah I tell you is it's it's it's a it's just amazing so we had friends up Friday that we've never seen before they're actually friends of Brent they were connected with his concrete Florida and New York and they they said they would just stop in for a few minutes because they've never seen us before you know you are Christ today you you are com 100% Christ today today the only Christ the world will ever see is the bride of Christ you're no different than the actual Jesus Christ that's what our Prophet said I mean other than he was the fullness and we're Parts he said when God spoke the Elohim he spoke you out he said you're bone in his flesh you're everything man and the kids all went in the house and these two men were here I've never seen them before and by the way they they could hardly leave even when they left they sto at the mailbox and get out and took more pictures and and he said but was able to witness to said D there's something about you and your family and even in private his wife look like I've never seen these I've never seen a picture of these people told her husband he said you could learned something from Brother Dale the way he treats his family because he was surprised how mature different our our girls were she said you ever see how Dell treats his girls amen a mystery God has a purpose for us being here and so all all the rest of this message is just for me because you know you know a minister don't pick what he wants to preach so I I had a nice beautiful Father's Day message and and I did you know all day devotions or study or whatever you want to call it and and God just changed everything on Thursday and uh so here's what God wanted to say to me but I want to show you in this scripture that it says all it says all now this this we don't have this problem here we don't we honestly don't I don't believe we have it in this church but the Bible portrays it as all and so let's turn to James 1 19 and just show you where we God wants to go this morning this is this is I mean it's supernatural because our God is Supernatural James 1:19 then I'm going to drop to 22 and 24 and 26 and we're just going to lay a bit of a foundation here and you got to understand this is when we read this this is still a mystery therefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear remember what I said about my daddy and really slow to speak and even slower to wrath and 22 but be ye doers of the word now we just read the word so we're supposed to do that word that we just read but be doers of the word and not just hearers of the word deceiving uhoh I don't like that word your own self for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass looking in a mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forget forth what manner of man he was so you look in the mirror and you forget who you are verse 26 but if any man among you seem to be a message believer and bridleth not his tongue he deceiveth his heart and this man's message belief is in vain wow God help us you know I want to tell you something that and if you don't see this you know talking about a family and unit you know brother uh God in Genesis 1:28 and 27 I believe it was said let us make man in our image and God blessed both the masculine and The Feminine he blessed them both and they were together brother Bram said that if you have your wrong wife or husband in this world you will not have the wrong one in the Millennium that's a direct quote he said all the wrongs will be made right in the Millennium and so if you're married to your rib your rib is impossible for one to be lost now that's a mystery because see you were one so half of you can't die half can't go to hell and half go to heaven that's not possible not if you came from God because that you start out at Eternal Eternal don't never stop so see how the whole unit now now it becomes a group of people and you create a home atmosphere that's affected in these scriptures let me let me before we read a scripture let me let me show you some of the greatest deceits in the Bible I'm just rolling ahead here you know the people never believed Moses was called I'm I'm going to read some quotes they never believed David and David was worse off because his own family didn't believe him they mocked him that's unbelievable that little scrawny runt what can he do but you know the greatest hypocrisy in the Christian church was Mary let me read some things that brother Brown said he saidou know Mary came you know when the child would be young and and I don't know exactly the time but they would bring the child for circumcision and offer for purification in the Tabernacle he said Mary would line up there with hundreds of mothers now this was at the message Church well wait a minute well it had to be because it was Christ he didn't go to the denomination right I mean the anointed one he definitely went to the right church and he said you would hear some of them say sh did you hear the gossip have you heard haven't you heard the gossip that this little girl baby by Joseph not being married oh that's so terrible it's if you would have ever oh it's terrible to see oh that poor little girl and it it's it's such a disgrace that she says it was virgin born and she Mary didn't pay no attention to it and she had that little Treasure of Christ in her arms and she knew the truth who the baby belonged to and she knowed that it was God's son no matter how many laugh and didn't get it with her now our Prophet clearly said the spirits don't die I had some of those same similarities when God called us to start the ministry and there was one person besides Christ that was my strong backbone was my wife and my kids and you couldn't touch them without touching me that's not possible cuz see if we came from God we're going back to God so we're Eternal so we're not divided because we're one let me read another quote the brother Brown said he said those mothers stood there every day in a line for circumcision of the children and offering for purification he said now down along the line here he said outstands this little virgin a lot of the babies with fine needle work clothes and a little pink dress on and really pretty things you know and here stands this little fell down here with this little virgin girl and some would say hey say didn't you hear the Scandal did you get the gossip on Facebook there's a woman here that baby was born illegitimate her and Joseph they're not married yet and there she's got that baby oh that's so terrible I told you oh I know it and see that's the there there it s and so keep your way back and get back from her they're they're they're in the gossip they're saying no stay away from Mary she's the plague she's leprosy and that's the way they do it yet today just stay far away away from that person he's not really called of God and they say and see and so they get back and this is a prophet 62 paragraph 62 and he said there she was standing but little Mary with a little veil over her face she knew who the baby was and every man that's and every man that's born of the spirit of God knows where he's standing and I don't care what the world says amen wow how could they miss it how could the Believers of the day miss the word of God when he said exactly how he could come they had 700 years to read Isaiah's prophecy it came right to the letter and they complain completely blew it amen they blew it see because we put God I'm not going to be here today I'm not really here and I'm telling you something we do this in our let me rephrase that I do this in my family in the past maybe you do if you're a human but we have thoughts or plans or dreams or interpretations and when they don't fall out we take our renge out on our kids on our wife we always do it on the people we love the most because they know they can't get away from it see your friends they'll run away but your family can't it's too much blood ouch and that's exactly what we do in the family of God that's what the Bible says that's what our Prophet said we're going to read some of the On's quotes about Moses and David but we read them about Mary that was nothing but God's Divine will predestinated Eternal thoughts of God and the children of God not only didn't understand it but they spoke against it now let me show you something now we are Christ today we are Christ today and so that means we're directly connected there's no difference so let me show you what Christ did pilate marveled that he spoke not a word God help brother Dale marveled most of us don't have to Marvel like that cuz everybody's TGG and wide open amen James 3 if you wonder one of the books that I read when I was doing watching the rain on the front porch on most of the days of the week was James 3 I read a couple books in the Old Testament and then I dropped down to the middle of the New Testament and see God had a predestinated plan I wasn't even thinking of I just would randomly say oh that looks about a good spot to start James 3 2-12 now I want to show you something you know this is for me but the Bible kind of says it all is for in many things we all in many things we offend all and if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to Bridle his whole body three behold we put bits in horses mouths that they may May obey us and we turn about the whole body for him but behold also the ships which though they are great are driven by Fierce winds yet we turn them about by a very very very small Helm Hallelujah whether soever the governor the driver of the ship want us listen it verse five even so the tongue is a very little member and it boasts great things behold how great a matter a little tiny fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire in a world of iniquity now iniquity is to know to do right but it's impossible to do it it's not impossible to do it but you don't do it but there why I said impossible is we're going to see why the scripture says that a world of iniquity that's sin and you know what's wrong so is the tongue among our members now there it don't say brother Dale it says ours sorry sorry and that it defileth the whole church or the family or your household or the body and it Seth on fire that's that's fire is pretty destructive I've been at a few Barn fires they never put them out set on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell now before it said our and now it says hell I say this is a fairly serious accusation and for every kind of beast in the nature and is Set uh sorry and every kind of beast of the birds and of the serpents and of things of the sea is tamed and hasth been tamed of mankind but the tongue that can no man te now that's kind of like plural and it is an unruly evil and it's full of deadly poison we're talking serious stuff here therefore therewith bless we God even the father and and therewith curse we men that came from God like Mary and Christ Jesus can you imagine the people that mocked Mary I don't want to be standing next to them when they go through the whoa therein curse We Men which are made in the subd now this this word here means in the likeness and the ass the the resemblance or a shadow of God now we know that when we came from Genesis that we actually are God came from God he said oh the same most proceed His blessings and cursings and brothers these things ought not to be so doth a fountain send forth the same Sweet Water and bitter water and can a fig tree my brethren bear Olive berries neither or either of Vine figs so can no Fountain yield both salt water and fresh water now that scripture clearly identifies all and it clearly means it's drastic when it's talking talking about hell and it also says that you can't tame your tongue that's not possible and nobody else can tame it and you can't take counseling for it either but there's one beautiful person that can and that's a Sweet Holy Spirit and you know I was always I always enjoyed math and I hated school but I if if was picking something I was all right and everything in M can be double checked and so somebody that don't control this don't have the other you know when you times if you divide it you get the same answer back if you minus or add back together you get the same answer so if you got a loose tongue you don't have Christ I learned that in grade nth amen wow amen God never intended for his family to be in this state amen you know if if you know and in the bigger the family the bigger you know the the uh what's the word uh the environment but the uh you know the Dynamics become tremendous amen if you if you have a large family and you might have it all together but you wait till every one of your children get married now your family doubled but you don't know who those people are maybe your children do oh oh it's kind of like the family of God we get new people come in at the late hour God brings them up fast we don't understand and so we anytime in human nature anytime humanly you don't understand or you don't agree oh man do I ever have that t-shirt hanging in the closet 1 Peter 4:15 you know in our James scripture it mentioned hell and man it's in kingled of fire and even of hell but so you know I say let's investigate when God started bringing this all in I said oh man let's let's let's check this out and investigate so 1 Peter 4:15 says but let none of you suffer as a murderer now that's fairly bad I mean that's getting raped you know anybody agree or is a thief now not that's not near as bad you know or is an evil dur well you know we can almost put up them or is a oh oh or is a busy body in God's matters because see the man's matters if he's a man of God it's actually God's matters because I'm not doing what Dale wants to do I'm doing what God you know brother Braham said if you try to run he said you well actually in most said you might as well forget about running cuz God will he'll kill you till you do what he wants Moses wanted to do that Moses wanted to run he married a beuty Ethiopian woman and went and inhered a whole herd of sheep and his father-in-law was old he could have knocked him off and been a millionaire God said take that staff and get on a donkey and go for a long dry ride M said no not me God not me I got a bad speech so here Peter considers a busy body equal to murder most we don't we don't rate it the same you would avoid a murderer our country locks them up well some countries lock him up we probably let them go now but amen we would avoid a thief we would lock our door from a thief or an evil deer but a busy body in the things of God because you know even even the person that you know even even even Moses didn't know what God was doing David surely didn't know what God was doing he was just watching sheep they both were watching sheep you see nobody's got God figured out remember that quote not even the preachers got God figured out definitely not the fightful ministry that are called of God they don't really know God's direct plan I didn't know it yesterday because Junior was going to preach I'm not here wow amen see how we need to be as little children and just let God be God and you know however God desires to move in our in our life in our individual life in our household old family life and in the church and then in the family of God the world collectively just say woo and maybe something that you don't I wow 1 Peter 3:10 that'd be all right how God give me the scriptures is how how they're just loaded loaded here 1 Peter 3:10 for he that will love life now I think most of us would all be real happy with their family and I mean the only people that got a happy family is the children of God Amen it's just Supernatural I mean we uh are blessed tremendously and see good days let him refrain or stop his tongue now that's talking to Believers from Evil and his lips from speaking no G that's deceit and dishonesty amen cuz see you say well bless God that was exactly the truth do you understand God your Prophet said you don't you know we preached a message a few months ago understanding the sovereignty of God we thought we had things all God all figured out and God did things that was just because he was God like when he told Isaiah the prophet to go nude for three years I would never figure that out like he would have the people follow David after he raped a woman and murdered his her husband I would definitely wouldn't go to that church i' fly out wouldn't have but but that but God is God God is Sovereign amen hallelujah man ain't that amazing so see when you when you when you look at this scripture 1 Peter 3:10 and it and it says guile is deceit or dishonest it's because you don't understand God's plan he say but brother God I like God you know that wasn't in my agenda I wasn't you know I never seen them is going there cut said so but God I didn't see me with Wow let's read a quote and tasing Spirits among a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth and there become tattling and back bitings and all kinds of ungodly things now these ungodly things are not in the restaurant where the worldly people are brother it that's surc acid now the Bible when we started out called it uh totic he said that's suric acid in the church and he said it's demon power now see how I said you couldn't do one and say you got the whole Holy Spirit you can't have a demon and have the Holy Spirit at the same time he said that that's demon power and the spirit of men and women who are getting among one another and trying to push off and say well this is not right and this is not right I would say lots of things in the Bible isn't right in the prophets prophets that lied and you know Abraham lied taught his son I son how to but his wife and this ain't right and if you'll Chase it right down nine times out of 10 it's the very person that's making the steer stare isn't right with God Amen God hates Discord among his Brethren because be reverence and be holy and love God and stand by him and as long as you know your life is dovetailing up with the Bible with the purity of heart and purity of thought and love towards your brother and trying to do your best to build the kingdom of God and doing those things now your best won't be Perfection amen so don't don't think well oh that brother when we're perfect we go in a Rapture or God will take us home amen so when you look at brother Dale you're not going to see Perfection cuz you know he's still working on me you know he's actually the Potter and I'm actually the clay and he smashed the bowl a lot of times and had to go back to The Well of the Holy Spirit and pour some water in and say oh boys I wish you'd get it right this time amen hallelujah he's a love towards your brother and trying to do your best to build up the kingdom of God he said doing those things dressing right living right and uhoh and talking right going the right places and then you can have all the emotions you want to and everybody will watch this and everybody will believe that you're a Believer but if you got the emotions and you don't got the life ouch amen here he says and he said if you can't respect the the man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right see respect him and if the I'm not I'm not reading this quote because this is an issue here I don't feel disrespected I I just I'm saying brother Dale has a tongue that's untameable that's what the Bible said I mean that's prophecy but until we surrender to the Holy Ghost and then he's the head and his example is that people will Marvel not how good a minister you are they won't Marvel that you got a great Dynamic delivery of an evangelist they'll Marvel that you're quiet there you know there's not one time in the Bible that they said when Jesus preached that the people marvelled but when he was quiet they marveled wow amen that's exactly right see respect them if a minister comes up your pastor you always respect and hear the congregation talk and and I've heard of congregations this this does not look like I've heard of congregations and they talk about their pastor and how just to talk listen let's just incam this in the whole big circle of what some people call the message and you'll all know what I mean amen and I've heard people in the message talk about their Pastor I edit I changed that and how just talk about him and run him down and ridicule him and how is that Pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it I don't say this church but I mean churches that I've seen that if you if you got you've got to love your pastor you it's not just I I don't I don't like direct things you got to love our the family I'm not talking about us we got to love each other and we got to love the each other's where we're going I got to love the each other's I've never seen where I'm going to Burlington after cuz I want to be part of that family wherever the family of God is when I go this to old Salvador in December and Africa and January and wherever else in February amen you got to love each other and you got to know that he's a human being you got to know that each other are human beings we were all raised in different parts of the world with different Mommy and daddies in different locations we have different environment our mommy and daddy some live long some di short and and and and and and and and and and and some of us worked in the union some of us were Ultra paneers some of us were and we come together and but these things not ought to be amen for you know that he's a human there we're all human beings and yet God made us and God made him as your pastor and the Holy Ghost has made him the overseer and when you respect each other respect him in that manner then no matter what the pastor's done no matter what each other has done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant as the bride of Christ then God will respect you for doing it I ain't direct to just at the pastor if you'll respect your brother and sister in the family of God even though they did something wrong the prophet said wrong do you think David did something wrong imagine if you were the Man's family that he murdered imagine if you were the the the the the the the the the military man that took the note back said place somewh and then you this how it would be like I'm the military man I take the note from David murder this dude put him right in the line of the atomics and then I have to I have to filter that and go sit in David's Church oh wow I mean mean that's a filter it's called the Holy Ghost but we got to run that through and and because we're a human being we run that through we go oh that still don't look right we run it through again oh that definitely don't feel right but it was part of God's plan and he said but God why God might say to like you did to Paul he said and my grace is sufficient for you because I've given you such Advanced Revelation and you would become hotti and high- minded because you know more than all the other ages before you I've given you this little poke in the side to bring you down so I can still talk to you who see God knows how to let just the right enough err out of you know the prophet said this he said I hate tubless tires you know who ever heard tell of a tire just stuck on a rim with a bunch of bubble gum and then you get a nail in you pull the nail and then stick of rubber in it but God knew how just to let enough the right amount of air out and then stick the plug in so he could deal with brother Dale and so he could deal with each one of us because if we got too hard oh that's about right wow amen God's perfect God's perfect and and he sees you as perfect and he and he wants you to come up to this stage you know amen and we're all we're all getting there maybe at different times not but we're all kind of in this this cuz we're all still here amen wow God help us he said oh you can speak in tongues and jump and jump over seats and I believe in that kind of stuff matter of fact I don't just believe in it I want to see it actually I like nothing better than to God anoint somebody in this church and run the house I I said that I believe in that I believe in the power of God and I believe in shouting and beating tambourines and then you go out and talk about your neighbor out there now I just want to just break this down real slow because we got we we're doing just fine he didn't say about the bride he said your neighbor now now by the way this is a prophet that said this and this is a late 59 quote for anybody that's struggling with he said don't you expect God to ever answer your prayers you can dump a wheelar of oil on top of somebody you can have brother Bart bring a truck tanker truck in here well just bring the line in here and just drown them with oil but until you God just says now you you don't you don't think so he did it to the prophet when he laid those hands on the baby and God said you're not even worthy to be breathing let alone praying he said not praying and brother Bram laugh wow this is what God expects 1 Peter 3:7 and this is not the first part of the script but this is the character and you know and and you will only see this in the bride of Christ a gar guantee you listen the bride of Christ is not living in the L toan age okay because and the reason I say that is because the Len age threw God on the outside so you can't be his wife and have God on the outside okay you can't be cold and formal okay so yes the Le scene age is going on and we're in that environment but we're not from here we're from there so we're we're you know that atmosph spere is trying to get into us he says husband likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to the knowledge and give an honor unto your wife that's honor onto each other okay this is not about heav husbands and wives on as the weaker vessel but being HS together by the grace of life that your prayers now so you see somebody in the church or in the family of God and you say oh man are they ever going to get it right uhoh I hope they don't call you to pray because God just went with that prayer oh bless God I've been going to church with them for 20 years they still come late and they're not perfect hope the song leader is Anointed to call somebody else because God just goes like this when you come up that's why I I never have never will and by God's grace never will I don't believe in levels of Believers you either are or you aren't you either came from God or you didn't come from God your daddy is either Jehovah Gyra or or he's Lucifer I don't care if you've been in for one hour or 100 years I don't care if you went around the world a hundred times you can only be Christ the anointed one amen hallelujah God help us we're here's a prophet talking in and tasting Spirits this is our Prophet now he said ' this tongue of mine man he was an honest person this tongue of mine that's being easy to take sides with this bunch of Gossip Lord I'm laying it down here and I'll never pick it up again sanctify my tongue Lord and let me feel the Angels go through like they did with Isaiah did when they said I am woe with me for I have on clean lips this what's brother Brown talking amen let's read that scripture of Isaiah 6:5 and 7 and here here Isaiah you know the scripture King Uzziah was greatly blessed of God and and then he and and the King was like everything he touched was bless and then he tried to change positions and he tried to be a levite and offer sacrifices that wasn't lawful for the king to do and he refused correction and and and God struck him with Leprosy and the prophet Isaiah was a young man and he was so connected with the King cuz he knew that God moved through the King's life and see we we all have people that we get connected with and God uses them to help us through our weak points and and strong points and that's that's okay but in the whole picture and scheme of things you want to make sure that the last person you're looking at is Jehovah because he's the only one that'll never never never never never never never fail but the Isaiah did the right thing he ran to the Tabernacle he said woe is me for I undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord of the hosts in verse 7 he said and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hasth touched thy lips and thy sin thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged I say God do that to me do that to the bride of Christ do that to each one of us amen we got to lay down our kingdoms and just join God's kingdom I don't care what happens in God's kingdom because it's it never was my you know what I'm saying like I we we shouldn't have a plan or agenda it's except glorify him try in every conversation you know when you meet people you never seem me you know I I'm going tell you something God's real we gassed up our car on the way to church and I was rebuked when I got in the car because somebody was gassing up the boat and I could have dropped some seeds there but I talked about politics instead and I got here God said that was your chance right there right there and you blew it you blew amen would I would I want to get there and those men come up and say remember when we were gassing up before and you could have just said God's got everything in control just one little just I don't mean preach to them just say well you know they were saying about you know things but God's got it all but it's so easy to get in that anointing say well I agree with you but we're not from here so why do we even care about here amen because you see because we're a trium being and we're we're flipping between this flesh man and this spiritual man it's like and then everything will burn everything will burn even the gold and silver that you bury in your backyard it'll still burn you're just taking Christ with you the anointed one the character that he's given you oh God help us to to God help every one of you are preachers when you're gasing up the car you know and they say well I wish we could get just say but God's got it amen it's so easy you know you know God's teaching me these things everywhere there's a crack you know even a narate new home ain't sealed if it was you you would smother when you went to sleep and so it's just like you can't make so you can and don't give them too much because they're just a little bird they'll choke to death just say you know but God still loves you he's still got nobody's in power but God loves they'll only be there as long as God Amen and that might be all it takes you know when I PL you know my dad used to say this you know our Prophet said the natural tapes spiritual my daddy used to say I always hate getting rained out of a field planting you know what he meant I do because I'm a farmer because when you plant the seed it's hard and the last thing you want to do is drown it and if you just lay it in the environment just a little bit it'll just loosen up a bit and it and it kind of loosens that odor shell and then you get a rain but no matter how much you drown the seed when it's hardest Smet see that seed was sitting all winter waiting to come for Springtime and if you dump water on a hard seed it'll it'll it it just Smothers it it it it makes it it makes it like like a sterile or starchy so my daddy would say he said I never like getting rained out of a field that man that hasn't had time enough in them environment so it don't need a lot of rain so when you're gassing up the car and somebody brings up the Garment say well God's God's over them that's all you got to say you know maybe maybe you know what I'm saying oh God help us amen amen amen we're bringing this down here here he said you may have to get rid this is in faces of Victory he said you may try to get rid of that ill temper and that slandering tongue that gossip on the phone and you might have every and you might have tried every re remedy that you know how but if you'll just let Jesus if you'll just let Jesus Christ come in he'll take care of it just like that amen hallelujah thank you Lord God so the problem with the matter what's the matter with churches today is the great majority that's a gent the great majority that the gentleness of the Lamb of God we are supposed to be lambs and we have become everything else but Lambs that's the reason as soon as we get an attitude the Divine Holy Spirit takes her flight and leaves amen and if the Lamb of God would have made first a snort like a wolf or would have done anything contrary to what the gentle Dove would have permitted the dove would have took its flight and she would have left in that minute and that's the reason today that we're wondering what's the matter with the churches today can I change it to the message churches even God forbid what's the matter with the church it's because that we've taken a different nature I I did I did I planned I sacrificed I I I we've taken a different nature and we've taken on a nature that we want our rights and we're going to do what we know what's right to do and we become arrogant and we become hostile and we become indifferent and we let our temper come in and we let our selfishness come in and the lamb when he comes to the time and his own when it when a lamb comes to the time and his own wool that's his is right cuz it's his own wool it's his own hide but they'll take that lamb and throw him on his bodex and tie his feet and he never kicks or never fusses because he just takes away his rights says you can have everything because he's got the Holy Ghost he's a lamb and he can't do nothing else because that's his nature that's the nature of a lamb that's the nature of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that when Jesus would stand before pilot and they were amazed that he wouldn't fight he said you know you wonder why Christians fight Jesus told us why because that's their Kingdom because Jesus said if this was my kingdom I would fight for it but he said this ain't my kingdom so it don't matter to I'm talking about the Earth so it didn't matter to him what happened to the Earth this Badger skin but heaven but heaven when Lucifer was up there he went woohoo see you that was his kingdom amen he can't do nothing else about it CU that's his nature but the time but one time cross a CHR Christian's path this our Prophet I I just I just want to remind you this is a prophet but one time you cross the Christian's path and you'll find out whether he's a lamb or a goat and you'll find out what he is you just cross them up one time and that's the reason today that our churches is in the condition that they're in you know I would encourage you to go go back and listen in 56085 the church and its condition and brother brandham talked about the nature that we're supposed to have I listened to that message and I listened to it all last night twice amen he talked about the lamb and the Dove and how their Natures dovetail and how we are him how she is him oh it's beautiful thank you Lord Jesus oh yep 56085 56085 05 56085 the church and its conditions man here's we're just we're just we're just wrapping up here seriously amen here here's a quote uh we just got to get rid of Moses and David here and I mentioned this already you know in in in the family and a husband and wife are one in Christ and here the prophet mentioned he said I believe when God calls a man to service he calls his wife his housemate because they too in God's eyes are exactly one amen now you won't hear that outside of the revelation of this message amen it's great blessing that we have and now God had had a here we're going to close here with to Moses and and wind down here sorry and now God had a runaway prophet and when God calls the man to do something he might as well just come to it CU he'll be so miserable for the rest of his days Moses started out God called him ordained him to a job and when he started out the people didn't believe him so Moses left said no problem see you later God give him a beautiful Ethiopian girl and an inheritance of a whole bunch of sheep and Moses completely lost the vision of God's people and that's what most people do when they start putting this amen Because unless you've been really talking to God and even if you have he hasn't revealed Jesus said that you know I have many things to tell you you but you couldn't bear them amen hallelujah and he was out there and lost all the vision of the people in the Church of the Living God and God had ordained them to do and he raised them up he was born from his mother's womb a proper child amen hallelujah amen God help us to to if we don't understand something just just go to God in prayer and say God I don't see this amen I don't mean he's going to answer you like that you might take some of them I don't see you to over there because you know even with the revelation of this message and it is completely revealed we're not waiting for another something to happen to reveal more of the word of God Amen he will he will bring us into progressive revelation and and you know to see the fullness of who he is until we go amen but we're still looking through a glass Darkly but when we get there wow we will be him she will be him hallelujah amen now get this close friends the hardest thing that God ever did is get you to come to church with other people now just think about that for you think of where all youth were born I mean brother Jim like what's the would we we have never seen you if it hadn't been for God in the message or brother Carson or sister Sharon or or sister Ruth or brother Bernard or you see what I mean you you really think we would have been buddies hello no he said the hardest thing God ever did was to get one man to believe another man the god was speaking through that man hardest thing God ever did amen they couldn't even see it in God when he was here on flesh they said you are babosa the devil can you believe that I oh man you I need counseling on ones like that that's like unbelievable they see all the Miracles this you know like the you know this you know look at when God called the children of Israel out of Egypt and and God stripped Egypt of its wealth literally you talk about getting retirement pay he went back 400 years and took their money they left with the loot of Egypt hello they seen all the plagues they seen the plagues that went to the the Egypt people but never touched them like their cattle all the Egypt cattle died but all the Israel ones never died okay I see that today you just got to have eyes to see it I see that the crop we got in will be twice as good as the neighbors that ain't planning it's not because we're smart it's because you're Israel it's you're the bride of Christ he will partk he will take care of his family nobody's going to touch his wife not not going to happen God will drop the M someday and he might use Putin or Russia or somebody to to drop Dr the mids with our name on it but when that comes sailing through we're going to say see you cuz we're going to drop this flesh and put on a new body woo Hallelujah this world's not my home I'm not a Canadian citizen I'm actually embarrassed amen if I go to any country the world and meet the bride of Christ and never seen him before oh my goodness oh it's it's it's more than the body can take unbelievably Supernatural the greatest one of the next to Christ himself the greatest experience you will ever experience on Earth next to Christ himself is meeting Christ in another body travel spend all your money and travel go somewhere where you never seen a picture of the Believers they swag up and say God bless you Sister oh boys oh boys oh boys you will like lose your mind amen because see you were together before the foundation of the world and it's you talk about a family reunion I mean it's going to be a blow oh hallelujah amen God God help us to understand he said watch this and and I'm sorry I'm moving Hallelujah let quote he said he said God had a purpose for Moses and he thought surely the people would understand it and the people missed and didn't misunderstood Moses God had a purpose with Jesus and they couldn't believe that he was the son of God I read this one already I think I did and they they couldn't believe that he was God they just said wow you got this illim I think I read that at the beginning man God forgive me amen God help us not to continue on this Spirit where we have this agenda and we are a Triune being but help us God help us to have spiritual eyes that when God has a plan we say ah God I you would use Moses you would use you would use Wyoming you would use you would use Al Salvador you would use Ohio you would use Uganda you would use I mean the whole world's his throne and we oh no God no I I I I didn't have that in my plan God no no no no no it was just it was just God's like oh you how could you not see me amen look at when they came to Jesus they said we would see the father he said I've been with you all this time I've been with you all this time hello hello I've been with but we have the exact same thing going on in the churches today so I'd like to get close to Christ get close to your brother or sister you want to get close to Christ get close to your brother and sister have a ton of Fellowship be real sweet to your wife or your husband you want Christ in your midst go visit somebody you you you huh huh what what what did the prophet say he said we all have Christ and we bring it together and then we have a holy a bake huh do we believe in Fellowship huh you you want oh oh Christ will you come down in our midst and show us who you are and he's sitting everywhere and God's just like oh I can't believe it I can't believe I sent them myself in the form of brothers and sisters I sent I I divided it all over I I scattered Israel all over the world so the message could be spread and they said who are you Moses who are you David you mean that SC like you know his father borderline lied he insinuate an insinuation is a lie he said but don't you have any other kids well just well just just that David huh wow I wonder if we don't ever say well God just you're going to just you're going to just use brother you're going to just use brother Bart brother guard but you're just you're just going to use brother M when there's just God's like oh my I I wish you could see me who I am you know the prophet said this and I had one quote and we're g we're going to finish here he said see if you get in that mode your nature changes and the Holy Spirit which is the dove he said he'll go wait until he's welome come again go right over there he said there's some places the Holy Spirit won't go I'll tell you something and I tell you something and I was listening to a minister joh it was actually Pastor Abraham and and I it was a very old message and so we need to be Believers completely we need to be completely born again not just our Inside Man but our wallets to our clothes our hair our tongue needs to be born again it needs to be born again twice a day maybe four times a day every time you eat born again your tongue you know the the the the rhyme of sticks and stones will hurt my bones but my tongue will never hurt me that's a blatant lie the devil made that one up cuz that's not the truth I don't care who you are that's not the but we need to be you know I I I started to and I wow he's really here the dove will leave anytime he's not going to if you go in an improper place that's why Pastor Dale maybe I'm not your pastor that's why brother Dale believes if you're not homeschooling and they're not in a Christian School you're not sending your kids with a token to a public school I don't care if you like me or not that's thus sayith the word of God that's like saying I could go into a strip joint and say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that Holy Ghost is not going in there with me and if my body is subject to the Holy Ghost my body ain't going in there either and you all these people that are living alive and saying well bless God I put my kids under a token then I send them out to hell you're deceived you need to get the whole body converted because the Bible says for you to raise your children and and the perfect man not the government Hitler learned that one and the Catholic church just give me your kids till they're seven I'll have them the rest of my life no matter how much Holy Ghost you can put over because the Holy Ghost don't go into those Pagan places and if you don't think they're Pagan we need to talk later amen oh bless God he'll protect them you're deceived you're deceived if you're going down the road 500 miles an hour and the the speed limit is only 50 m hour and say bless God he'll protect me you're deceived your guardian angel even though he's Supernatural he can't keep up so you can't break the word and say but he'll protect me amen that's like saying I can have five wives but God will protect me no that breaks the word so anything that breaks the word we need to get the whole body converted but most of all brother Dale Stone amen let's stand you know the Bible clearly taught us and our Prophet clearly taught us that if we light out and it you know the Bible says this it says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but if you touch one of God's the Bible says vengeance is his and you want to look out for a person that's stepping on God's Property I'm telling you what God don't have no squatters and when we come into the full maturity we'll recognize with Lucifer also I was just studying reading quotes this week brother Brown you're you don't have to pray you just speak it it's it's already there it's sitting amen you know what when I go buy cattle and I know the bank accounts full I don't call Len and ask her how big of a check I can write hello but we come up oh God do you think you can spare an elbow do you think you can spare a you know what he told Moses speak why you crying to me just my wife wanted a new bathroom I said I don't care what you get just if it's a bathroom that's I could care less what is a bathroom's a bathroom bathroom to me if it's big small or little or different if it's still bathroom it's still bathroom we need to get rid of all the petty stuff and recognize who God's the authority and the power that God's entrusted in you and he don't expect that Authority and power to destroy the children or the little ones or the less desirable you know the body says the Bible says even the least desirable part are given special honor that means I'm just the I'm not even that I'm just the little toenail the nail of the little toe brother Brown you say I'm the spare tire in the ministry I'm not even the spare tire I'm the tubing the tire but because of that he got special honor because the least of the body get it's more amen God help us God help us amen I hope I hope there's something there for us man you know I that I just God help us to man The Prophet said you know you can tell you can tell just cross somebody's path you can feel you can just feel that and you're a Creator you just build your own world around you you're not even present in Canada you're just like like where where where am I I don't know I'm somewhere here I'm sure I'm talking about my dad you know my Dad could go anywhere in Canada and get home by looking at the stars oh well the sun's over there and we live over here and like where you at dad I don't have a map no GPS he never he never even heard he don't even what GPS would have been so oh we're over here and you know when I get close and I when I get in a couple hundred miles of home I'll recognize something but you know the sun's here and the stars are over there and it's just like that's exactly God spiritually speaking I'm headed to glory and I'm just following it you don't think so that's what the Wise Men followed and they followed it because they were looking for him they understood God in the heavens they understood God around they understood the environment that you build and God help us not to get too attached everything here is going to burn it's all going to burn don't get too attached to it now I I I I tell you I I'm going to close you know I preached on money how the government's lied to us I seen a a
