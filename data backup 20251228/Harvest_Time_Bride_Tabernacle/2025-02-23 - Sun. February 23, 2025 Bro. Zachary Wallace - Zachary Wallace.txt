Lord Jesus thank you for this great opportunity to be together remember the ones that are out Lord God be with them and touch them these prayer requests Lord God may your sweet Holy Spirit go with them Lord God do Your Divine will we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you bless you ever visit welcome very welcome maybe you can have your seat for a minute we're just thrilled to have our brother Zachary with us and he's going to share some testimonies it's actually the first time I got to meet him fellowshiping because he ministered when we were in Central America when I was done and and you know just in our fellowship was really beautiful about our brother Zachary he's going to share just some testimony is he will go places that you won't go and he's went places that I probably wouldn't go amen and you know we have our camp meeing a lot of people are start to send information in about our camp in August and you know we had a few Believers that that uh our camp meeting is a camping camp meeting it's a tent and shed camp meeting and you know some me people would mention about you know that was pretty tough sleeping on a tent for one night you know over 50% of the world lives like that our brothers actor went to places that's their standard equipment you know they they live that's their life and their world Amen and you know he was just sharing testimonies it was just amazing beautiful you know when he mentioned something last night and I I pray to God that this wouldn't be true but he said you know in our world we have Christ in our life but he said in their world Christ is their life it's a huge difference and if you're a minister and you go preach there and you preach here you'll know it just like that because Christ is their life but for us sadly because of riches Christ is just in our life and I pray that that will will you know God can change that change me and it's a huge difference amen but we just welcome our brother and just look forward to what God will share with us this morning amen amen God bless you brother with you this morning thank you musicians I appreciate you being a part of the service that way it's a blessing you know uh many places you go there there is no there is no music outside of what you can put together with your voice but that's still good and it's not the uh the instrument so much as the heart that God's Desiring to hear but uh uh when I was here last it was in December um in January I did get to go to India on a trip there um and uh so I I'll share with you a few things from the trip there and um we went to we went to the the northern part of India and we got to the city area and we met up with a brother there that I've I've been I've been over there for about 10 years visiting and so I said i' I'd like to go sometime to these outlying areas well you surprise me sorry some Hometown folk here um and it just really surprised me to uh to meet the uh or to go and and see that area and and I said you know I'd love to go and I I told him how I'd got the opportunity to travel to some areas where uh uh we'd been out in the bush really and you know you've got your backpack and a water filter and a hammock and you're just going back in there by horseback and Riverboat and things and so I'd said you know I'm I'm I'm okay I'm comfortable with going to these outlying areas where you've been doing this Outreach work for the last you know 5 six years and so he said well if you want to go you know let's let's plan a trip so we did and and we we got back in there and you know it's it's a very persecuted area um one of my indicators were when we were packing up he says don't bring your Bible I was like all right and uh that was one of the first indicators of how persecuted the area is and we get to the airport and he says when we get close cover your face and I'm like I don't know what close is I've never been to this area like when when do I know to do that you know and and it ended up not being U you know any problems but like we got there and and um you know one of the man men we were sitting there on the porch with drinking tea he just got out of jail the day before that for preaching the gospel and and you know they're they're very pressured they it's it's a very tight tribal community and so it's it's kind of like a really tight family and an outsider like you know a few years ago if you came in in a vehicle uh they were likely to throw rocks on the vehicle if they didn't recognize it because that's an outsider and if you're an outsider they really don't like you and so we kind of just you know keep a low profile the church is not what I would call an underground church but they just they just kind of keep a low profile and uh but we got to go to some areas there where you know they don't have running water uh they you know if you need to use a bathroom you have to go find a tree out there in the morning somewhere and it's so it's a little different but for me I enjoy camping I I I just literally enjoy it so it's not a a great sacrifice for me but uh it's definitely pretty remote but you you find there the one area we went the pastor he was illiterate many of the people are illiterate they they can't they can't read and even if they could read in many of those areas there's no Bible in their language and you know you're talking to him and I'm just thinking you've been a pastor for years and you can't read like doesn't that break the rules or something like like how's that working and so you start you know is what we call a bit of a paradigm shift you start looking at things from a different perspect you're like wait a minute Peter and John were ignorant and unlearned men they couldn't sign their own name but they'd been with Jesus and you began to think what does it mean to be a Christian what does this really mean and and I I I began to talk to this this pastor there about his his his experiences and and how he became a pastor and they came out of the Hindu religion there and and he found out about Jesus and he found out that there was a living God and he began to pray and he seen God answer prayer and so then he would pray for somebody in the village and they would be healed and they would be delivered and he says this is Jesus he's the Living God the Hindu gods are not real and they'd come to his church which was his house and so they he talked to them about the Lord and and that's how the church was established and the the the little they have a porch there and they built a little wooden uh uh shelter over top of it and the way that was done was because there was a man that was a raging Maniac just completely a manic person uh possessed and and his family dragged him over there to where the brother was and asked him for prayer and he prayed for him and he was completely set free wow and that man happened to be a carpenter and he was so thankful to be in his right mind again that he built him a shelter for his church and so that the whole church it was not built out of the the the intellectual Theology of man it was built off of the reality that there's a living God and uh when when the brother you know so you're thinking well how do you work with people like this how do you share the gospel with them how do you because there's you know with that kind of a a position there's a lot of things and an understanding that they don't have there's a lot of teaching that they really don't have because you can't even read you know can you imagine being a pastor and not being able to write any notes down for your service you know there's just a lot of challenges there and and so I was like well how do how are you sharing the message with them how is this you know being done when you can't even show them out of the Bible where it's true because they can't even read the Bible and he said well um I came to this area and he says years ago his wife the pastor's wife had had a vision or or dream that there would be a man come from Punjab and when he would come he would have the truth and they would have to listen to what he had to say and so one day when the missionary brother I was traveling with when he got there he walks up to the village and she says husband that's the man he has the truth hallelujah so the the foundation of that church is the Supernatural and I was thinking about you know how much how much greater of a position is it to as a as a missionary to work with somebody that knows God by theology or knows him by experience I'll take an illiterate man who knows that there's a living God anytime over somebody who's steeped in seminary Theology and he sits there and argues with you about the supernatural God because he doesn't know him amen and so that was uh just a real interesting experience and and a humbling one to to realize what we have we have a Bible in our language we have the ability to read it do you know how blessed you are to have that OPP opportunity and do you know how neglected that opportunity is Left Behind we've been given a message the revealed word of God in this hour in our language and you talk to many people and they don't even know what it's about right I met a man there and he was sitting on the porch there's just something about it you're sitting on this porch it's a house made out of just uh bricks that they make there in the the local area and there's no running water just a box of a house and and you're you're there and you can hear the jungle sounds out behind you and the and the The Jackal howling out in the the mountain there and and there's a man standing there and he's got he's just this old man he's he's got this kind of ragged clothes not ragged but just wore out you know and and he's talking to me says you know years ago when I accepted Christ he says my family my brothers they came and they beat me nearly to death they dropped me off at the hospital and and the doctors looked at me and said just leave him alone he'll die and they didn't care cuzz he wasn't a Hindu anymore right and he was sitting there and and he realized the doctors weren't going to help him nobody was going to help him and so he began to pray he said Lord Jesus you're my savior but I need a Healer he began to pray and he says Lord I ask that you would heal me and I asked that someday I would get to meet my family from around the world right because he found that his his local family they didn't like him anymore more they cast him out they wanted to destroy him and so he was asking Lord I want to meet my Christian family that's from around the world so he was laying there and he just began to pray and they just ignored him and after a couple days he stood up and he walked out of that hospital and they could not believe that it was possible for a man to do that who had been in that condition and he he unbuttoned his shirt and he's like you see here this shoulder was totally broken he says but look it's healed now and uh he was just he was so excited and he says and and I've all I've prayed for years I wanted to meet my Christian family from around the world he says and now you're here he says and I met you and he says I I I feel like I can depart in peace because my eyes have seen itow and you know there's such a you know you just just going there and standing there and and being with these people who they don't you know they they might not have a lot of worldly riches they might not have a lot of Earthly possessions but they just have such a sincere heart for God and it it's just I just love it I love being able to go there and and just to show the fellowship to let them know they're part of a body there's a bride of Jesus Christ from around the world and I I remember one time being back in the jungles of hondur Honduras one time and and I was drawing in the map and using my broken Spanish to explain to them that there's Believers of the message over here here in Ohio there's Believers of the message over here in India I was like you're over here but way over here I've been way back in there people just like you and I've been over here to Africa and down here and and there there's Believers just like you here and up here in Asia and over here in Europe and begin to draw that picture and they're isolated way back in this jungle but their eyes just begin to get so big they say you've seen it I'm like yes I've been there there is Believers just like you all around the world you're part of a body and it begins to break them out of this this isolation complex that I'm all alone and uh you know the the real cure for that is is getting to the other side when you find out that we're really part of a body from around the world but you know it's just I I enjoy going those places the people they have such needs and when you can't afford a doctor and that's not an option you go to the great physician and when you're not just holding in your back pocket well I'll I'll go get prayed for but you know if that doesn't work and then I'm going to go to the doctor you know which there's nothing wrong with doctors but when that's not an option your only option is getting in contact with almighty God you see a lot of the supernatural take place over there you see God move in in tremendous ways because that they're that's their only hope and they they come and they're under such expectation you know this you know this brother he came from across the world and all these different things so I think God's just going to meet me here and when they come with that expectation God just moves in such a tremendous way and uh you know and so it's really good to see the the Revival in the hearts of the people around the world and and you know but you know I it's not just in foreign countries where God moves you know just the other day we were in church and the pastor there was preaching about uh the atmosphere and how when the atmosphere is right the supernatural takes place when when that pool of Bethesda when it was getting stirred up when that water was stirred and the spirit of God was moving if you got into that atmosphere if you got into that place you could be touched by the healing power of God and there's a brother sitting right behind me in church and he's had back pain for three years and it's just been uh just just a constant burning pain there in his upper back and as uh brother Wayne was preaching all of a sudden his back just popped right in that atmosphere and that pain completely left his back right there and uh his wife had vertigo and so he said well sister let's go up for prayer and so they went up for prayer that that uh night and the next day she was completely free from that vertigo she'd had for months and uh a brother uh have you ever had brother Isaac Hatfield up here no okay great put him on the list but he's a he's a real good young he's a young Minister but uh just real good brother and he was just speaking about Balman Gilead there's a Balman Gilead and just preaching the word that there's a Balman Gilead and there's a sister there that's been struggling with postpartum depression and and my wife went through that and it's it's a real it's a real hard thing it's a just a real dark time and challenging you you don't know which way is up and which way's down you're so instable and you know brother brandom said that uh he said that nervousness a nervousness a nervous Spirit those things he says it's actually worse than cancer which if you've never dealt with something like that you don't understand that but he says it's worse than cancer and and this sister she came came up and she just ask asking for prayer and she was completely set free right there and I want to testify that there is a bomb in Gilead there is a living God and he's not just in India he's not just in Africa although I've seen him there but you know just recently I was up in a little place in Canada and the people came with expectation and I'll tell you how that went after the service but God is a living God and I'd like to just uh stand to our feet this morning and take a a portion of scripture here out of Romans the 8th chapter uh Romans 8 and 11 just good to be here uh with Believers thank you Jesus and uh I I want to ask you what do you believe is possible thank you Lord don't don't limit my God in Romans the 8th chapter in verse 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies Hallelujah by his spirit that dwelleth in you let's just pray this morning Heavenly Father we have need of that quickening power here this morning Lord Lord we're Desiring that our Earthly bodies Lord these flesh Tabernacles would be taken control of by the power of the Holy Spirit and we're asking that you would speak your word to the hearts of your children this morning Lord and and Lord any need that would be here father whether it would be spiritual Lord whether it would be physical whether it would be Financial whatever that need would be Lord you are the god that supplieth all our needs and so I ask this morning that you would have freedom and liberty to move Among Us just speak to our hearts may you open up your word and may it not just intellectual Lord but may it be divine revelation is my prayer Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen can be seated this morning I I I want to also read a portion of scripture from uh Ezekiel 37 just uh I want to speak about that quickening power and also uh tying that in with the bride's Revival but in Ezekiel 37:1 it says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest we're just going to move through that uh portion of scripture a little bit here through the service but I I want to just uh I'm kind of torn between uh you know as a minister you'll you'll you'll have a thought but then you'll you'll see something and I've been just looking at quickening Power and how many have have heard that sermon it is the rising of the sun yes tremendous sermon and you go into there and that sermon and Easter seal brother just really begins to bring out a lot of this about the quickening power which is the holy spirit but he begins to bring it out in a way because the word Quicken means to make alive it speaks of a seed that was planted and then it's derz It's Made Alive it speaks of something that was was was dead or or at the point of death and it's revived back to life it's it's a power that brings life and and the the devil he does not care how religious you are no you could be as religious as you could be you could have all of the knowledge you could quote all of the word which the devil can do but if you miss that life you're finished you you could you could have all the religion but if you miss the life you aren't coming out in any Resurrection you must have that quickening power you must be born again and and so if if you go into that sermon uh the rising of the sun brother brandom he he takes a lot of time explaining mechanics and Dynamics and he shows how if you could get a car and and you could uh what kind of car would you say we should pick this morning you have a car you like is there somebody here that's a car fanatic you know likes you know likes particular cars Camaro a Camaro all right so we get this Camaro and and we get it and it's a bright red color all right so we get this bright red Camaro and and we get it and we put you know nice leather seats in it it's just a beautiful beautiful vehicle we got all these things here all of the parts are in place the mechanics are just right you got the mechanics there you got the all the machineries in order and then you fill it up with a high power gasoline that's all wonderful that's all tremendous that is the mechanics and those things have to be there you get that there and it's all ready to go but brother R says if you miss that spark if you miss that quickening power he says all of that doesn't matter because no matter how much mechanics you have there how much teaching of the word how much theology how and it's good it's correct it's in its right position but if you miss the quickening power he says that gasoline might as well be water because there'll never be a release of the power to move that vehicle down the road to take that command arrow and lift the front tires off the ground just take off going if that power is never released what does it matter we might as well be Catholics true if there ain't going to be no life cuz they're dead anyway he says here we've the gasoline represents the word and it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move he says we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline we have received a message and it is gasoline there is incredible power in it but if you do not get that quickening power to strike that message word in your heart what good is it going to do you it might be in a gasoline can well it could still be water but the only proof of it is you know I could tell you this morning that I've got a container of gasoline here and and it's got a lot of power and I could tell you all about the power in this this this bottle right here Y and you might have some questions about it that's fine you know we could we could argue about it we could discuss it but you know there's a real easy way to settle it you can say oh well I believe this and I believe that and you know I don't believe God heals anymore and I you know you could have this whole disc discussion but I tell you what you take that quickening power you take a match and you put it to that water right there and you'll find out there ain't no power in it you'll find out it's water but if you get gasoline in this same container and you take and you put that match to it I don't care if it was the smallest child in here that did it there would still be a release of power it's not about the person it's not about the individual when you connect the Dynamics and the mechanics together the power of God is released in your life and I feel like many times uh I'm I'm studying this right now and I want to study a little bit more but I've seen that a many of the times when the quickening power comes it actually comes in Revelation and so you have the word of God and he says you know by my stripes you're healed that is the word of God we know it's the word of God now that's that's mechanics it's sitting there it's the truth we believe it it's right and it's in its right position he is my healer I believe it that's right but as long as that sits there as something that's just general knowledge it's for somebody somewhere doesn't do you no good it's not going to move down the road but when that thing that says by his stripes I am healed he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities by his stripes I am healed when that becomes to go from just a head knowledge of something that's been told you when the Holy Spirit comes down and quickens it it's revealed in your heart and now when you have a revelation what is faith faith is a revelation and when you've got a revelation about Divine Healing for you personally Jesus Christ is the Healer there is no other he says that bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who Health all thy diseases now who's that for well you know my grandma she was healed of cancer and I'm thaning for that and that was good for Grandma my grandpa he just had a he's 86 now he just had a a heart failure and a heart attack and and and and God raised him up they they didn't he was dead dead and and my my uncle he grabbed a hold of him started working on his heart and they were able to get him back to life and and he recovered ex he had a great recovery right and that was the the Lord there's only one Healer that was the Lord healing my grandpa I'm thankful for that but you know a few more years he's going to CR over it's just you know way the life works and and and and so I'm thankful for grandpa that God healed him I'm thankful for Grandma but I've got needs there's things in my life and I'm thankful for what he did for them I'm thankful for what he did over here I'm thankful for what he did for the brother with back pain in church I'm thankful what he did for the sister with depression I'm thankful for that but it's for them and that's good but I need a personal revelation about healing for me because I have needs and as long long as it's just mechanics you could quote every quote you could read every scripture about and I'm just referencing healing but there's there's plenty of promises there's plenty of things in the word of God you could come right down to to the Rapture you say well the Rapture is for the bride well hold on you're saying it's for this person you're saying it's for Grandpa you're saying it's for the pastor you need a revelation you need a revelation that your name's on the book and you're a part of that you got to have a personal understanding and when that personal revelation comes to you now there's a power there yes when it's when it's not just you know I believe that you know the the the prophet was a Son of God and and he had the power of God and he and he did that's wonderful but when you get a personal revelation that I'm a part of this now there's a power in your life not just the Revelation the prophet had but now it's a revelation in your life and there's a power there's something that backs that up with an authority and and and and just recently uh last year I've had I've had migraines for 30 years and and just I've always strugg that I think I might have shared this but you know I I've struggled with that for years and the Lord actually told me 10 years ago when I asked him I was like is this supposed to be here or not like did you put this in my life for a reason and he said no you can be healed I said wonderful Hallelujah and I saids I can be healed I can be healed and I kept leaving it at can and then the Lord just began to deal with me am in a service where the brother was preaching about fear yeah says why are you afraid to say this day this is when I'm going to accept it this is when I'm going to receive it and I realized I was afraid to step out and stand on a promise to God I knew it by the word and I knew it by direction of God to my heart that said it was for me and yet for 10 more years I had sat there with migraine headaches because I was afraid to say today and I realized I was actually waiting for me to be so good that God just rewarded me with healing right right I was waiting for for me to do something that was so wonderful he says I'm I just decided today I'm going to bless you you see Divine Healing isn't based off of how God's feeling about you it's off of a promise he said that he would heal you and if you will believe it if you will have faith you will receive it and so I realized that it's not based off of my works it's not based off of my Merit it's based off of his promise and I said all right then I'm going to stand on that promise I'm going to stand here and I'm going to confess that I'm Healed I'm going to believe that I'm Healed I'm going to testify that I'm Healed because it's something that I believe with all of my heart and I'm not going to push it off for another 50 years and so I I had prayer that night and and I said brother there was a brother actually that just been healed of migraines I said sit down here I said what's this verse say it says where any to agree on any one thing it shall be done for them I said so you agree with me and it's going to be done and we prayed together and and I said I told my wife wife on the way home I says I've I've accepted my healing from migraines this night I says now I might NE I might have my migrain for another 25 years like Abraham did waiting for the promise I says or I I never have another one in my life I says but that does not change the fact that I am healed so I took the next opportunity I had to go and and and uh run around a lot playing a game of basketball and get overheated which would which is what would trigger a migraine and so I went and did that because I said I want to find out you know I want to I don't want to just sit around say well I don't want to do that that might cause a migraine because I'm Healed and so I ran around and I played basketball and couple hours later I was bent over a trash can vomiting and saying thank you Lord for healing me because it's not based off of how I feel it's not based off of my condition it's based off of a promise of God that has nothing to do with these five senses and so I just kept confessing that I kept standing on that and and after a few months we'd went up to a a meeting up in Virginia and they were going to have a prayer line that night and they' asked me to help in the prayer line with the people and I was like well you know this could be a little bit rough cuz I've got this migraine today I I was that whole day that migraine and headache been building up and I was like well you know I'm going to be going up there to help somebody through the prayer line and maybe carry them out of the building and or tent in that case and and I was like and I'm going to be you know this pounding migr I was like well if I have to carry somebody out and then go over to the hill and vomit and come back in and help somebody else I'm going to do it because I believe that I'm Healed I've testified that I'm Healed I'm going to act like I'm Healed I am not going to give way to this attack of the devil and so I I walked up you know the brother was preaching on Jehovah Rafa Jehovah the Healer and I was I was back in the back saying amen and then you know just when you have a real migraine like that it just pounds into your you just wse from it but I was like I'm Amen to the word anyway I am not going to knck down to the devil I don't have to and so the brother was and and when they called that prayer line for all the brothers to come up I went up to the prayer line and I was standing there and all of a sudden I realized that migraine had left it had vanished migraines don't do that they don't just disappear like that and and and from that day to this my body has been healed but it it was something that had to be a personal revelation it had to be something not just God Is A Healer but he's my healer and he's the Healer of my migraines and I can stand here today and say I don't have that anymore now but if it just stays in the word of God the power is there oh the power is in the gasoline it's real and it's there and we've got the the message that has get got the mechanics and put them together properly we don't have the wheel attached to the to the to the ceiling we don't have the muffler attached to the steering wheel like we don't have all this chaos that they have in denominations God gave us a message to rightly put that mechanics together and then he showed us what the mechanics and the Dynamics together will do and it will bring manifested Sons and Daughters no matter how much the rising of the sun here no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there has got to be a Dynamics to make it work and that's what he proved that's Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word oh we we have you know we have the word and that is essential you can't if you don't have the mechanics you ain't got going to be able to to get anything to happen but when you've got the mechanics which we have received and if you have received it and receive the correct teaching of the mechanics you know cuz you know you could sit in a message church and you could still have the you know the hubcaps you know on your windshield you know it doesn't mean that you've accepted it but when you accept the correct you know teaching on how that vehicle goes together and how those mechanics run together when you've received that you're in position for the full power of the Dynamics to make that vehicle move down the road but without him which was the resurrected Lord Jesus it ain't going to do nothing right now brother brandom talks about this this bride's Revival and and how you know as a young person I I hear different people talk about it and be like oh well you know you know this person's got the bride's Revival or you know the bride's Revival is over here in the seven Thunders or the bride's Revival and I I'd hear these different things and I'm like well I'm not exactly sure what they're talking about and things but you know as time went on I had a little bit of opportunity to to read some different things and and here's something here in the third seal and don't you have to notice this is actually in the seals that he's saying this cuz it's so striking when you get the whole picture but he said uh he said they've got millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere now Revival is life right that's uh you take somebody that's on the point of death and they revive what happened well they came back to life he says but no Revival nowhere and he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there's no manifestation of God stir the bride yet he says we're looking for it and now a lot of people have taken that and they're like well you know someday off in the Millennium we're going to have a Revival but you're missing the picture he says he says we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up now if you know what the seven Thunders are it's kind of ironic that he says this in the Seven Seals now he says he will send it he promised it now watch now she was dead right now that that that right there that statement right there people have taken it and they've run off in a lot of directions that aren't actually in align with the word if you'll stop and realize it but one of the major problems is the people they look for the bride's Revival to be carnal right they look for the bride's Revival to be glorifying man right that's right it it won't be glorifying man it'll be glorifying God it won't be glorifying a church or an individual or a Ministry it will be glor in God and and so this bride's Revival if we could step back and we could look at you know how God has moved in the past and and we look at the Mary and how you know we we read that a virgin shall conceive and she'll bring forth the son and it's going to be the Messiah and Emanuel is going to be here and and so in our minds we would think well you know here's Mary and and the way we would interpret the story would that you know the the newspapers had front lines that you know Mary has been found she was the Virgin that God had predestinated and for ordained and and she has conceived and the Messiah is coming soon and and all the priests are excited to to meet the coming King and and there was angels that told the message and let everybody know what was happening and and Mary's friends they're just so happy to be identified like I'm a friend of Mary like she's the one you know and and uh they're just you know it's such an honor to be associate way with her and and and it's it's just you know incredible times are happening that that would make sense from our Earthly perspective of the greatest event that had happened on the face of the Earth since it had been created but what was the reality yeah no one knew about it no one Joseph the predestinated one who was supposed to be there with Mary to take care of Jesus in his his young childhood he didn't even catch it he he couldn't believe it he's like that he was a Believer Joseph was a believer and yet it was a little hard for him to accept until an angel came to him and said listen you know this is actually according to the scripture everything's all right don't get worked up and and and he and he accepted it and and Mary's friends they weren't honored to be associated with her no they were ashamed they said you heard what happened to Mary you know she's she's claiming that it's this great spiritual thing but I mean I mean we're not naive and you know when the angel came to Mary she didn't even understand it but she said be it unto me according to that word God does things so differently than the ways of man God's ways are not the ways of man his ways are so much different he hides himself in Simplicity he does things in such a way that it would stumble the educated and the intelligent and and and he does it in a way that it would seem ridiculous but it's God the prophet here in in uh the church ages he says there's a great shaking amongst the elect great powerful things going on but the world knows nothing of it and he says how they're they're thinking for like television programs and million-dollar buildings and this is what they think would be a great move of God no he says what man calls foolish God calls great and what man calls great God calls foolish amen and uh there was a man Matson Bose he came from New York to Chicago and he had a desire he says he says I came here God put it on my heart and I've desired to see Chicago get a great shaking and brother Braham says to him your great desire has been fulfilled only I don't believe you understand it this man's desire his whole purpose in life to see Chicago shaken and he doesn't even understand when it happens right and again another place he says Joseph you've seen Chicago get its last call that's right and God honored you done just exactly what he said getting the bride ready that's what it is you see it wasn't all of Chicago that was ordained to be a part of that bride but there was just a couple of them there in that entire city of Chicago that mats and Bose had gathered together and he called in God's Prophet to bring the message to them and that people receiving that message getting ready for that Rapture out of all of Chicago that was the great shaking of Chicago right one or two people but look at God's economy you know how many people did God bring out of Sodom yeah yeah and that was great Angelic move you know how many thousands were up there with Abraham no just Abraham sitting by himself and his wife back in the tent laughing what we would think would be the great you know Elohim has come down the son of man is being revealed all of these things and and it's it's the Great Mighty God meeting with Abraham no one understood it right amen like God does things in a way that human thinking misses it over here in uh in time evangelism he says uh he's talking about how uh he says according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back well he says now we're going to the end right here by saying this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture according to Malik for is to bring back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord that's real event in time evangelism the Turning of the hearts back to the Pentecostal foundation of the church not Aza street but back to the foundation of what happened on the day of Pentecost when the quickening power came down and people were transformed now that's the that's the restoration that's supposed to happen it's through the ministry of Malachi 4 and so that if you if you look at this this is that Revival this is the great thing that's supposed to happen getting a bride ready for a Rapture that's the great thing that's the great move that's the thing that's that's Shaking All heavens and earth but you know if if if if you're not a part of that bride come on it might not mean anything to you thank you Lord Ezekiel 37 and4 and he says again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord how can bones hear they ain't got no brain they ain't got no intellect those brain bones or those ear bones have fallen long ago but you see there was a prophecy going forth and if there's a prophecy going forth there's going to be something to respond to because prophecy is not a man speaking prophecy is not the words of a man prophecy is the word of God spoken through a human vessel and Hallelujah many people don't recognize this picture because they think it's a picture of brother brandham now this is no more a picture of brother brandham than it is a picture of a tie right now there's a tie in the picture certainly and there's a suit in the picture certainly but this is not a picture of William brandom this is a picture of the pillar of fire that led the children out of Egypt this is a picture of the pillar of fire that met Paul on the road to Damascus that is what this picture is about now he was pleased to be identified with that prophet he was pleased to have his picture taken with him but this picture is the picture of the pillar of fire and this message that we have received did not come from this man this message that we have received came from that man it came from the Lord Jesus Christ through this vessel and it was given to us but this message is not the thoughts of a man it's not the ideas of a man it is the word of God to a generation then we call that the message of the hour now the there's many people who they look at it and they say well you know this is Brother brandom's message no this is Christ's message and in fact he says in the token message he says the message is Christ because Christ is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was was with God now that word is logos that's the pillar of fire the pillar of fire was there in the beginning and that Pillar of Fire has come down and through that prophetic message through the revealing of the son of man that Pillar of Fire has now come into fleshly Tabernacles and we have the word made flesh in a body we've seen that displayed beautifully in the prophetic Ministry of William brandham but I challenge you this morning did God stay back there where is he at right now where is God tabernacled in flesh where is the logos that logos is in a body it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ it is the revealing of the word made flesh in a people Jesus is the groom the bride will be exactly the same as him he was the word and the spirit of God come down in a tabernacle the logos made flesh this bride has received the full pure word of God she has received that logos power of God that is what she is tabernac and Mr Jesus Christ and Mrs Jesus Christ are the [Applause] same so this prophecy is not well you know Ezekiel had this great idea to prophesy to these bones no it wasn't his idea he didn't even think it was possible but he said you know you God you know and he said now you prophesy upon these bones and say thus saith the Lord God upon unto these bones be behold now I want you to realize this speaks of the Christian church this speaks right here of the Bride of Jesus Christ and how that Through the Ages there was a death in and you see in in the beginning they came forth and they were in life but then in the Dark Ages that seed that church that bride she went down into the grave And Then There came forth there began to come a restoration of of a resurrection out of that out through Martin Luther John Wesley but this is speaking of the Bride he says prophesy upon these bones and and and be he says behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live now I want you to notice he starts at the end he doesn't say well I'm going to see what I can do with these these Dry Bones I don't know how far I can get he just goes straight to the end he says I'm going to make you live that's the beginning of the prophecy and God is not looking at this bride and saying well I'm going to see how far I can get her I'm going to see what I can do maybe I can get him to believe enough for healing maybe I can get him enough no he's got the end picture in VI he already knows exactly where he's taking you he's given us a message that tells us he's taking us to a wedding supper he's taking us to a millennial rain we know what the future home is for us we've received that we know it and we're not just hoping we're going to make it because it's not our ability it's that's good what does it take for a Rapture many times we say rapturing faith and that's certainly true but you know how many times brother brandom called it rapturing Grace forget your Works he says thus sayith the Lord unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and I will lay sinus upon you and I will bring up flesh upon you and cover your skin with and put breath in you and ye shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord now if you go to Restoration of the brid tree brother Braham talks about this he talks about how there was four messengers of death and there's going to be four messengers of life he shows how justification with Martin Luther John Wesley sanctification he says the rest restoration of joy and of the gifts with with the the the the Pentecostal movement he says but then that four messenger of life he says what's the four stages of Ezekiel dry bone so he ties those two together the brid tree and the restoration of the restoration of the Bride tree and ezekiel's Bones he links them together and he says now what's what's that fourth one he says that that that's that fourth message of life and he calls it right here he says what that fourth was the word itself the word word made flesh and so there's there's there's there's there's a justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that that move of the Pentecostal move all of those things what happened there that's good that's wonderful but you see there was still no true life in there the mechanics and the Dynamics had not come together in the power until we received the word message that established the church in its rightful place and so Ezekiel here 37-7 he says I prophesied as I came up with an idea no I prophesied my new idea no no no no no I prophesied my opinion no that's not what a prophet does so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking of the bones came together bone to his bone and then we see the sinus and the Flesh and the skin covered them up but then in the ninth verse but it says but there was no breath in them so we see the church came together and and that's where the Prophet came to that Pentecostal church it was so close he's like everything looks good like you you've got these things in order you've got gifts in the church you got all these things you know he says this is good this is really good but there's no life there's no spirit in there to make it live and stand up under the power of God and and so he was just he was he brother brandom he came to that church and he found it just in that condition where it was it was so close but like the rich younger just lacked one thing and he says then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet this is the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the the restoration of the Bride tree she stood and she came up on her feet and she was just a defeated little body of worn out Christians no that's that's not what the scripture says it says and she stood up on her feet an exceeding great Army Hall that's what this bride is this message has come we have received a Word of Life and this church has raised up as an exceeding great Army it's equipped for war it's ready for battle it's not a bride that's just defeated and cowed down the devil's lying to you the deity is not in heaven it's in you you need to recognize your position you need to recognize who you are and stand upon that word the Vindicated word in his body is his very R Victory and the reason of his death Christ The Mystery of God revealed this bride is the reason of his death he died for a purpose and that was that his body could be a Victorious Church amen he says here Quicken means Made Alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually begun to come to in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet hallelujah oh friends we have been we have received a word of Prophecy for this hour concerning this bride she is not a defeated Church she is a Victorious Army she is in fact an invincible Army now if you need an invincible Army that probably means you got a pretty rough battle so don't be surprised that there's a really great struggle and a really great Warfare you know God doesn't you don't send Invincible soldiers into a picnic cuz you really don't need him at a picnic but in this hour there is a bride who is an invincible Army and she's facing everything that hell got to offer against her and God standing there proving that his power is greater than the devil proving that he can come down and he can take control of mortal bodies and through those mortal bodies resist everything that the devil would try and do he's proving the victory of Jesus Christ that the Holy Ghost actually works thank you Lord now those bones those they could not do anything until they received that word of Prophecy but when that word of Prophecy came they began to manifest what was prophesied and in each generation there is a word that is given each generation has its own chance at the word its own chance at Revival but you you've got to recognize that there's only so much word that's allotted to each generation in in the days of Martin Luther there was a certain word for that hour and in the days of John Wesley there was a certain word for that hour and you got to recognize in each hour there's an allotted word there's a certain thing that's supposed to happen in that hour so I ask you what's allotted to be manifested in this generation oh myow what's the word for this generation are we supposed to you know come out of Catholicism it's not really the word for us I mean you shouldn't be in there but that's not the the driving point of this hour the driving point of this hour is to come out of this entire world system and be caught up in Rapture that's the goal that's where we're headed and we're called to be up in an astronaut age into a bride age we're coming out of all of this darkness of Lea and the confusion around us and we've been coming up into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we we we're still it's all around us but we're not a part of it Hallelujah in this hour we have the promise of the restoration of all things now I want you to notice in Ephesians chapter 1:14 he and I can't I can't uh I'm not going to take you on your word there brother Dale and take four hours but I can't teach it just all out but it says right here in Ephesians 1:14 speaking of the Holy Ghost That quickening Power which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession so Redemption of the purchased possession I could go and I could buy this water bottle and and so let's say I didn't bring my wallet but let's say you've got this all right and I'm like you know I'd really like that you know I'll I'll I'll give you a cough drop to buy that from you all right so I give you the cough drop I says now that's mine now we I paid for it I've I purchased it it belongs to me we the contract's done all right but I don't hold it in my hand right now I haven't taken it back to where it came from yet there's now the price is paid and at Calvary Jesus Christ paid the price it was a settled finished matter the price was paid and yet the Redemption or the restoration of the purchased possession to bring what was purchased now what was purchased at Calvary well we could go another 5 hours on that but you know uh to to every everything was settled at Calvary and right down to the very earth the earth that received the blood of Jesus Christ was Redeemed by that and yet it has not received the full benefits of its Redemption and so this Earth is still groaning and crying out waiting for the sons of God to come into their position and in this hour you see they could not come into their position in in Martin Luther's day that wasn't the word for that hour but there comes an hour there comes a message that brings a full restoration all the way back to where it was at the beginning and the price that was paid at Calvary what the Jesus Christ paid for at Calvary God sends a message in the last days to restore remember Jesus said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things and so what Jesus Christ paid for at the cross through this last day message we have the restoration of all things back to its rightful position you say well what does that mean well means that you as a son or a daughter of God could go all the way back to the position Adam was in the Garden of Eden you could speak and the winds and the waves would obey you you could speak and a squirrel would come into existence you say that sounds pretty crazy yeah maybe it does to you but we're in that hour of the restoration of all things we're in the hour when this has been restored back to the church it's been restored not just back to you know Paul's day not just back to Martin Luther's day we've had a restoration of all things which takes us all the way back to the Garden of Eden condition where a man can have fellowship with God and walk with him in the cool of the evening and where the power of of the the power of God is invested back into the individual full sunship you see the whole earth has been crying out groaning waiting for the hour when sons of God would come to their position am when's that going to be thank you Jesus it's right now right now the seventh Angel's message William brandom's Ministry brought the restoration of all things to the church now the question is are you going to let it sit on the shelf and let somebody else manifest that or is there something inside of you that says that's not just for brother Zachary that's not just for William brandom that's not just for brother Dale but I believe I'm a part of that I believe I'm a part of that restoration of all things that is for me I identify that that's my prophecy you see Mary could stand there and she could read a virgin shall conceive but one day it went from being a story about somebody to it she said I am the one that the prophecy spoke of it is in my life that this is going to be manifest I'm the one that has been chosen to bring forth the Messiah and I say to you you can read the scriptures you can read the prophecies you can hear the tapes but someday there's got to come a moment when suddenly your eyes come open and that quickening power of God reveals to your heart that you're a part of this prophecy you're the one that God sent a message to there was a people on the Earth that God took the time to send a message to who was it he was the Bride of Jesus Christ and until you can identify and say that's me yes you'll sit there and you'll sit there and there ain't going to be no power moving in your life but when that Revelation strikes when that quickening power comes down and it ignites the Dynamics and there's a power of God that releases you're going to go somewhere what we call well we call it a Rapture you're going to go somewhere Hallelujah you see in in uh Revelations chapter 1 and 14 he said that he seen him and his hairs were as white as wool and and he turned and he looked and and it was Jesus Christ standing there with that white wig of supreme authority on now now why is that important why am I bringing this out I'm trying to establish you to realize the confidence that we can have in the word that we have received you see that white wig speaks of supreme authority Satan does not like supreme authority because it goes over top of his head right and there on Sunset Mountain the prophet said that Jesus Christ came down and gave him a message gave him the word to open to the people and it was the wigged judge it was the supreme authority what does that mean what does it mean well it means that nobody can argue with supreme authority nobody can raise an objection say well you know I have a different idea forget it supreme authority has spoken this message did not come from the thoughts of a man it came from supreme authority and so you can have Supreme confidence to believe what's been given to you there is no other one that Jesus Christ is the supreme authority he is the Supreme deity of heavens and earth it's the fundamental revelation of the whole thing is to recognize the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and it is that same Jesus Christ that came down and gave us the message that we have and we have that picture taken there on Sunset mountain or throughout Arizona showing that it was Jesus Christ come down Revelations 10 the mighty angel coming down to give us a message to give us a word now I ask you what is that Revelation what is that word what was that book well we're going to read here in Revelations 10 for a moment and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now if you trace that book that's what Adam had and lost amen and he was set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now remember what the prophet said he says those seven Thunders is where the great Revival is for the church right now drop backing to acts 3:20 he said and he shall send Jesus Christ which was before preached unto you whom the heavens must receive until the times of the restitution of all things so there comes a time when Christ comes back in a Ministry to the church there comes a time when we have the the the the Christ the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a message with a shout that's what we see happening there on Sunset mountain and he says this happened on Sunset message at the at in the evening time the sunset time the sunset message there's a setting of A History A setting of Prophecy rather and and and he says here what happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1-7 now what happened on Sunset Mountain Revelations 10 1-7 being fulfilled it's what he Prophet just said right here and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10: 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed now why is this so important that we recognize the Vindication because when you recognize the Vindication the Vindication gives Authority and it takes away the doubt you see I could stand here and I could tell you you know there was a man named Yeshua and he said that you were healed but you're like well who's Yeshua well you know it's actually Jesus well you know who's Jesus well he was the son of God he was sent to the Earth and when you begin to give the Vindication or the Authority for what's being said then you can have a faith in it you know if I told you that you know if I walked up and I said you know the president's going to give you a million dollars you say well you know how much taxes am I going to have to pay on that no you say well like well how uh how do you like why should I believe you why why would you accept what I'm saying I'd have to show you some Vindication you see back in the days of England there was a man and he was just a brother Bram called him a cockney he was just a a regular old man there and he was standing there near the king's Palace and the King comes up to the gate and he's got he's got a message that he needs to send out there was this man standing there and he said I I need to send the message it needs to go over here we need to tell the the enemy is coming from this direction we need the troops to move up right here he says take this take my message here and run with it to a certain person and he says and take my scepter he says if anybody tries to stop you you show them that scepter and they'll recognize the Vindication they'll recognize you're carrying a message from the King and they'll move out of the way they might they wouldn't believe him if he didn't have the Vindication but with the Vindication if they tried to stop it they had all the power of the United Kingdom to come against them because when they tried to stand against against the Vindication they were standing against the supreme authority of that Nation yes that's right yes sir and in this day God sent us a message you know that little man he took off running he took off running with that message people would try to stop him he'd wave that scepter he said get out of the way I've got the king's message get out of my way I'm carrying the message of the king and and and when you realize that you're not just carrying the the thoughts of William brandom you're not just carrying the ideas of some preacher but you're carrying a Vindicated message you're carrying something that's been Vindicated by the pillar of Fire by the pillar of cloud by the supernatural by the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man when you realize you're carrying a Vindicated word when you could look the hell right in the face and you say get out of the way I've got the king's message I don't care how many people try to stop me it's Vindicated you look at the Vindication you see this this is from the King and that gives me a confidence because if I had to go on my own authority if I had to carry my own word I'd be like well I don't know I don't know but when I know it's the king's message I've got a word that comes from the King that I can tell the devil you get out of my way I can stand there and preach to 100 denominational preachers I don't have to back up I don't have to you know work around I can tell them the word of God and I don't care what their Seminary says I don't care what their theology says I don't care what all their commentary books say I've got the King's message and it's Vindicated now this this seven Thunders that came forth and and all these things that you know it sounds real mysterious and people have taken that and you know made a lot out of it and brother Braham said it would take those seven Thunders to bring the Revival and but here in questions and answers 1964 they asked the question about the Thunders he says have have they already been revealed or were were they revealed in the seals and and we just don't know about it and he says well he says no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about amen the seven Thunders now a thunder is a voice it's a voice of God the seven Thunders and the Seven Seals were the same thing now why does that matter why why is that the bride's Revival why does it take that you see because it's the opening of the word it's what Adam had it's what Adam lost now it's opened now it's restored the revelation of our identity in Christ Jesus has been restored to the church and if that don't give you a Revival I don't know what would and when John the Revelator you see John standing there and he's looking who is worthy to take that book because in that book was the redemp was the Redemption of the Earth the title deed to the Earth in that book was the the right to eternal life in that book was everything that we have need of and if you look at at it it's actually that book is revelation because when you get a revelation of your sunship now you've got a position of authority when you get a revelation of these things cuz you know if it was just it wasn't a paper book it wasn't you know a tree that they'd cut down and made up into pulp and they were carrying around it was a revelation of the word of God and of their position in it amen and he took the and and John he's looking there he says who can who can tear off the seals who can give this book to man because that Revelation was not meant to be held by God he he God didn't need that but that book was a book for man and God wanted that book to be in the hand of man and it was in Adam's hand but Adam fell by sin and when he fell by sin he lost possession of that book of the of the Redemption that that book of life and it went back to the hands of God but it was meant for man and so there had to be a Kinsman and John's weeping and wailing oh who's going to who's going to take the seals off that book who's worthy who could do it and finally there was found not an angel not a not a spirit being there was a man he was a bleeding bloody wounded lamb and he stepped forward and he said I'm worthy I'm worthy to take that book and he took that book and the prophet said he took the book and he tore off the seals he he took the book opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people that's what we see in Revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now keep reading now John the bride walks up and says now you give me that book I want to receive it it's for me and so we see here John when he seen that book come open in heaven and he realized that there was a one that was found worthy when those seven Thunders came forth when that book came open John began to scream and he began to shout and he began to yell all across Heaven he had such a screaming fit until everything in heaven heard him everything in Earth heard him and everything under the Earth heard him everything from Heaven to Hell heard John glorifying and praising God why because the Seven Seals came open why because when they came open he looked in there and he seen he was a part of it he looked in there and he says there's John I found my name I found my identification he caught a revelation that he was a part of this from the very beginning before the foundation of the world when the sons of God were shouting for Joy they were shouting because their names were being written down on that Lamb's Book of Life and John caught a revelation of who he was and that he was a part of this from before the foundation of the world and if you catch a revelation of predestination it'll put such a joy in your heart it takes away all the worries all the fears All the nervousness when you realize that you couldn't be lost any more than God could be lost because you're are a part of him from the foundation of the world and John looked in there and he seen that book come open and John got a part of the bride's Revival Glory Prophet says you know John must have saw his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy hallelu you know I feel there's a few people that they could they could stand to get a little bit of that you know get real happy you know they they they they seem to always be real sad and I'm just looking at that I'm like if you could see the word that I'm seeing if you could see the message I'm seeing you wouldn't be sitting there going oh well I don't know there doesn't seem to be no power there's no this there's no that if you could see what I'm seeing you'd get real happy all right and when John looked in there he he he'd seen says now I think he looked in there and he seen a past the curtain of time you see he broke through the time barrier and he could see into eternity he says he looked past the curtain of time and he says why there's John when you can catch a re ation of your Eternal predestination that you're a part of it and no you could no more be lost right now that like I back back actually when I first receiv received the Holy Spirit in my life I had I had quite a time of just a screaming and a hollering and a shouting and a dancing for quite a long time when I caught a revelation of justification amen I said I never did it in the first place my slate is cleared and when I you know maybe you didn't need forgiveness but I was a sinner and I had needed forgiveness and when I found out that my case was cleared I got such a joy in my heart I had such a Revival in me and I was dancing and I was praising God there at the building there and I actually caught a a vision I would assume it is I don't really know much about him since I hadn't haven't really had any but I seen myself in this place of beautiful Greenery and the mountains and the streams rolling by just beautiful and I was dancing up and down the hills of that place and I believe with all my heart that caught a picture of myself beyond the curtain of time rejoicing and shouting that I was justified and that the blood had cleansed me and I believe with all my heart I was standing there and I was shouting I said just as certain as I'm shouting and dancing here I'm going to shout and dance over there because his blood has cleared my case thank you Jesus when it becomes personal to you not just reading that you know Jesus died to save Sinners but when the quickening power comes and he quickens he takes that off the page and it becomes alive and you said that was for me personally and when he forgave them he forgave me it does something to you a whole lot different than head knowledge I better Hallelujah better move along here oh he says now that Holy Spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as he finds it he does just like he did on Jesus Christ the great superon of God who redeemed us all it comes down and it takes its place and Abode in the human life now notice brought the quickening power now what quickening now that quickening power That Came Upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day amen how could Jesus manifest all of the promises in the word for that hour quickening power how are you going to manifest a Rapture how are you going to manifest the promise how are you going to manifest healing how are you going to manifest that your family shall be saved how are you going to manifest peace that passes understand how are you going to quickening power when that quickening power comes on you and you recognize by Revelation that it's already finished that it's as established as the Throne of God well you can just forget all the worrying can forget all the unbelief and you can just sit there in faith he says down here he says in the Easter seal it's the Holy Spirit talk he was talking about how the move of God and how the spirit of God's been moving in these last days and he says it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken and make alive those people that's foreordained of God to be in the Rapture that's that is if he's a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true Eagle so we don't don't have to water down this message we don't have to try and make it more palatable to chickens we just preach the message because Eagles enjoy Eagle food and this message didn't come down to make denominational people feel comfortable this message came down to prepare a bride for a Rapture and when they hear that eagle scream if they're an eagle it does something inside of it thank you Jesus so where is the brides's Revival people are wondering like well when's it going to happen you know when's there going to be when are we going to empty the hospital out and when are we going to go and show the world how great we are brother Ram talks about this magazine where they'd print fast and pray fast and pray he says we're maybe God will do a great work maybe he'll be a great opening of the day and he says uh they print this fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day fast and pray pray pray pray we're not too late yet he says why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening now an Awakening is real Bible he says they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they missed they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride but being a Christian they feel the pole of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done right there you go they're looking looking way off oh someday God's going to have a Great Awakening and there's the prophet of God the messenger in their midst and the bride is coming the life a bride was coming forth and he says I don't just call you a church anymore I call you bride a bride in its infancy coming forth and all of these things happening the greatest things that could happen in the Christian church since Jesus Christ was here and they're saying pray pray pray someday they're looking off and not recognizing what was happening right then oh if you can recognize what's happened in your day there is so much available to you there was a man one time and and you know he was supposed to die supposed to be killed the next day his friend went and he got a pardon and he grabbed it he came back he said listen you know I know you're guilty I know you're a bad boy but listen there is a way that's been made you can be set free and he says I've got your pardon and and and he looked at it and he said don't make fun of me he said listen if I was going to get a pardoned it'd have nice fancy paperwork and it would have help Jesus but you know what if he' looked at the Vindication if he looked at the signature he would have recognize this document of my pardon has been signed by the greatest Authority in the land he wouldn't have been sitting there going oh I don't know maybe this maybe that you know what about the paper forget about the Kentucky hillbilly it came with look look at the signature look at the Vindication your pardon has been signed by the highest Authority that there is and let me read to you a portion of your pardon here he says you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect he say oh well not me not my I don't know about that you know he was just a Kentucky hillbilly forget all the paper forget the torn piece of paper it's on look at the signature recognize the Vindication you say oh I'm looking for a Revival over here someday I'm looking for no no no no no quit looking for it someday it's right here it's in your midst right now and yet it's the unrecognized presence of Jesus Christ because you're looking for him to show up over there you're looking for be over here friends he did not say that he's going to be over there over here he said he would be right here in your midst he says I will not leave you nor forsake you the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with this bride amen and yet it's so humble it's so simple you say me this church this place yeah yeah forget about all of that you just get yourself alone with that quickening power of God and you say God is this really for me Lord reveal it to my heart let that quickening power strike me I want a revelation of your word I don't just want mechanics friends we got the mechanics I mean I I haven't been here very long but you know you respond to the word I recognize that you've heard the word and that's good that's wonderful but what you need is the dynamic power of God to come down and to strike that Quicken it and make it a reality put it into action in your life you don't need more theology more more thoughts more ideas you know that's good I'm a preacher I preach it all the time but what you have need of in your life is Jesus Christ which is the quickening power to come and strike you and then you can stand there like those those great theologians that came from America to Ireland and and to Wales and they said you know we're here because we're looking for the great Revival we heard about this Welsh Revival it's supposed to be the greatest Revival on the earth and we want to come see it and they came up to the to the police officer there and and they said sir we'd like to know where the Welsh Revival is at can you direct us oh yeah I can tell you where it's at I know right where he at he says you have arrived I am am the Welsh Revival he had that Revival in him and so you say where is the bride's Revival where is this great move of God what's going on if you can get the quickening power of God to come and strike this message that's in your heart you can stand there you can look him in the eye and you say you can look in Africa for the brides Revival you can look in India for the brides Revival but you don't have to go that far because I am the brid's reviv I am that word for this hour made flesh I am the word manifested in this day not by my strength not by my might but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he shall Quicken your mortal bodies your mortal body will begin to manifest the message of this hour when that quickening power comes down into you let's stand to our feet this morning Hallelujah where is the Revival you find the quickening power you you find the Holy Ghost you find where that Holy Spirit is anointing the word of God and when he when you hear the word of God you just say Lord I receive it Lord I believe it when you find that you'll find the bride's Revival when you find the people who will receive this message of the hour not just intellectually you know that's a great starting place place because that's the wound of the soul but when you receive this message not just as an idea not just as a theory but when it becomes a revelation in your heart amen you know it'll it'll take you Plum out of this Earth it's what we call a Rapture oh it's been good to be here I've just been enjoying Hallelujah well I've been enjoying the quickening power the anointing of the spirit of God here amongst his people thank you Jesus I challenge you this morning do you believe this message is there something in this message that you have need of in your life yes amen is there promises in here in the word of God that you say you know I'd like to see that real what you don't have to go climb some you know temple in India somewhere to find the Living God you don't have to ascend up into heaven you don't have to ascend down into hell the word of God is NY it's in your mouth it's the word we preach but what you need is that quick power to come and take it off the paper take it out of the intellect and set it a fire in your heart where that promise that God spoke that you believe it with your mind you know it's the truth but you need quickening power to come reality manifestation in your life thank you Jesus I challenge you this morning amen yes Jesus what kind of expectation do you have right now Hallelujah do you Believe it or did you just come to church to check off another Sunday I believe it let's just bow our heads this morning Lord Jesus Lord I'm so thankful that I don't have to preach a God that's a dead Idol somewhere I've seen those idols on the the temples of India and they're just dead stone but God I have the opportunity to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that you didn't lay there dead in a grave but the quickening power came and raised you from the dead and that same power is here this morning you said so by a promise you've never lied you cannot lie and so Lord we believe it and we have confidence that your presence is here Lord not just because we feel you although we do but Lord because your word promised that you would be where two or three would gather together and so Lord there's needs here in this building I don't know the needs I don't hardly know any of the names Lord but you know the heart and father I'm asking this morning that as they come before you and they have a need in their life Lord and they know there's a promise of God they know there's a word you've given for them I ask that the quickening power of God would come to that individual and that word would become revealed in their heart and that promise wouldn't just be for some other day but they say God I'm accepting your promise right now for this hour for I need Lord I'm asking that your spirit would have Liberty to Quicken the word in our hearts Lord may we recognize the Vindication Lord may we just drop the doubts may we drop all of the fears and the nervousness and the worry Lord and just believe your word because we know it's the king's message Father I ask that you would vindicate to the individual Lord the power of this quickening holy spirit of God yes Lord may you grant it Lord Lord may they not just know you by books Lord but Lord if they're illiterate Lord in in their knowledge may they at least know you as the Living God father may you grant it Lord we love you
