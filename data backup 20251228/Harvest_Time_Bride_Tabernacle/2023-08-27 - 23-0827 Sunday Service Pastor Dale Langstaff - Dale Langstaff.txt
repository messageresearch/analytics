let me know just remember Jim and sister Linda like we said in the past there's ones that aren't here but they love us and are are praying for us and they'll be online brother Jim and mentioned last Sunday he said once in a while and I said I went back and listened to last Sunday once in a while it would skip a couple words they're just the video was and uh Amy checked my batteries this morning and they were dead so we say praise God that's an easy easy fix to the sound system new batteries amen amen also just as a a way of announcements just remember the Ottawa conventions International conventions in Ottawa many many ministers there from are literally around the world couple from Africa the Philippines uh and I'm forgetting a whole bunch of places Quebec different places me and Luanne plan to go uh Wednesday Thursday Friday or Thursday Friday come home Saturday so uh so we'll be here for church next week but we'll be in his presence during the week and we just thank God for that amen amen amen let's turn to Revelations 1 1 and we're just carrying on the thought that we were ministering last week and and uh you know I just pray that God will help us come up to to you know the prophet said that we're living below our privileges amen and God don't want to take uh God when God comes back in the Rapture you know he don't want to take a bride that's uh under depression like got low self-esteem now that don't mean that you'll be uh proud but low self-esteem means you don't know who you are and Christ has told us who we are and I I just excited about something you know I I studied this much through the week and I I actually had many of these notes down last Sunday when I said we'd go this way but but months and months ago I bought us a study Bible and just this week I picked it up I actually actually it was just early this morning I picked it up and I was wanting to to really dig deep really deep I want to really prove to you Who You Are so you don't have low self-esteem and I got some real good nuggets from my study Bible Amanda we praise God for that Revelations 1 1. amen the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which shortly must come to pass and he sent it and signified it by his Angel unto his servants John Lord Jesus we pray that you'll come and Minister this morning and may your divine presence be in this place and may you bless every individual especially our visitors Lord Jesus and those online and may you speak to each one of us in your name we pray amen you may have your seats this morning I want to preach on the revelation of Christ and you his bride and I know I want to clarify we have to be very careful when we dig into this and we might continue this next Sunday but the and many of many many many quotes I have in my drawer I never even I was planning on pulling them out and I had too much and I never did that but the prophet said that Christ was the anointed one the prophet said that Christ was the god in flesh Christ was the god tabernacled in Jesus amen hallelujah it's just beautiful I want to I want to read you a quote just right off the get-go and this just explains everything here in the 60 in the permanent Vision he said uh he's talking about John and he's reading the scriptures that we're going to read in 31 he said the greatest revelation of all is the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ and if you can get to that if you can get that and if you can't get that I'm sorry you won't get to first base until you believe that and walk out like Peter said repent and then see the deity baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the Revelation the remission for your sins and he said the first thing you have to know watch how he says it the Prophet this is not by perchance he said the first thing you have to know is the deity Christ see the word of God everything dovetails perfectly and if it doesn't there's a bump but the word of God said God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen and that's how it just comes together so beautifully that's why we know that Christ and he says here watch he said be careful John he said you're entering into the spirit and there's something going to be revealed to you you know the definition of revelation is something that's revealed and when it's revealed to you nobody can take it from you we mentioned that this way and and here's the prophet saying he said he said what is it he said the trumpet sound the first thing he said was here here God was talking to John revealing himself and in Revelations 1 13 He said I am Alpha and Omega and that being interpreted in the Greek Alpha means a and Omega means Zed he said I'm the beginning and the end from out and everything it's just amazing it's just it's just God how perfect God is I mean he just leaves no doubt at all no doubt there will be no excuses who he is Hallelujah he said I'm at the Alpha and Omega the first thing and that let them know who he was he said who was this approaching he said is it this King Jesus the king God or the king Holy Ghost he said I am from a to Zed Hallelujah praise God I want to show you something this morning that shows you who we are and and there was things that was amazing that that I you know I I heard a minister Minister and he gave me a nugget and I dug and I dug and I dug really deep amen but we we need to realize because it's going home time and we need to realize who we are now that's not Cockiness that's not arrogant that's not proud but it's also knowing who you are amen it's also not living below your privileges you know Junior preached up you pray for junior we he asks his boss to be to be held over before he goes home because we would like to have him as one of our ministers in our in our dedication anniversary meetings in November the 1st of November and I'm actually going to talk to his boss this week and his boss said he would get back to him amen but you know Junior preached a message a year ago on getting in the spirit and the and one of the problems that we have as Believers and and message Believers is we don't get in the spirit you know I want to give you an example and this is just up in Revelations John says he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and and you know God helped brother Dale because because that's where we need to be to be fed by God Amen God's a spirit you know he said when I when I see my girls and my wife and they have preparations to go shopping it's just like some of my girls went shopping yesterday I didn't have to wake them up they didn't have to set the alarm it was just I'm going amen you know and anybody that would go to a ball diamond or something or some sports or that and you know listen you pay you pay your which I'm not recommending I don't I don't do that but you know you pay like 200 and you got to take an oxygen tank because they put you in an elevator and you're up in the clouds and you got to take binoculars and that and somebody hits a home run everybody okay it's not because they hit the home run it's because you were in the spirit because it cost you money cost you 200 and you prepared and you took your oxygen tank and you climbed 75 million flights of stairs if they didn't have an elevator and they packed you in like sardines you're right beside a big fat guy that's okay and you're so happy because somebody that you have nothing it's no benefit to you at all it actually hurt and cost you uh-huh and God forgive us when you see them do the wave in the arena I've been in those in my past life thank you Jesus when I was a teenager I've been there when they did the wave I've never seen that in church the wave because see they were in the spirit and John was in the spirit and John do you think this you think it was easy for John he was in a prison he was an island of Patmos or with rattlesnakes they put them there no like knowing that nobody would Escape or live it wasn't a pretty situation and he didn't have no drive through McDonald's or Pizza Hut amen and he also never had any weapons to kill or eat and I would be really concerned at how often they were worried about how often he ate Rome no it's the same spirit Rome's not concerned how often you eat today either Same Spirit Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus so we've established that he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end but you know I had never seen this and I I got a nugget I'm going to give I got a nugget from Pastor Abraham and then I dug and dug and Doug and Doug amen let's read the scriptures Revelations 11. one Revelations I'm sorry Revelations 1 11-13 amen and you know uh well we'll read the scripture and then we'll we'll go into this saying here here's God revealing to John now now listen if God revealed this to John he certainly wants his wife to know who you are who he is he said I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches now that's us that's brother Dale which are in Asia and he goes in and maims all the churches let's go to the next verse amen some of those words are big words Church all the church ages including us and John turned this is a part this this is beautiful and John turned and he said I seen a voice and this voice is walking and you know many times you can look in the scriptures and the voice walked in the scriptures that spake unto me and being turned I saw seven candlesticks that these Kevin candle kicks are obviously the seven Church ages and they were dark and the candlesticks were topped into who Hallelujah they were tapped into Christ the anointed one amen because Christ is everything see it's not about brother Dale and it's not about you but it but but it is because we're in Christ oh that's beautiful amen and this is where I want and in the midst of the Candlestick now I'm going to tell you something until I seen this and I studied this greatly I've studied this since we heard him preach oh months ago amen I've never seen this he said in the candlesticks one like now he's talking about Christ he says one like unto the son of man this is God now John knew what Christ looked like but he didn't say it was Christ do you know in this scripture I'm going to prove to you by the Bible and our prophet that that was you I never seen that before you know because the Bible says this that when when God that the calvary happened in God's mind before the foundation of the world when he thought it it was finished man the the film hadn't happened but in his mind it had our Christ had already been crucified in his mind it was a finished work that's why he said I've already seen you in glory those that I predestinated called justify I've already glorified I think the whole it's Amen so this ain't being proud this ain't being cocky you know a a good relationship in marriage you won't see the husband or wife either way either way being cocky or or arrogant to each other but it's knowing that like it's just like it's just like peace unspeakable and beautiful it's perfection amen and so here John said I seen one like but it wasn't until the son of man clothed in the Garment down to his foot and girdled about with uh help me out hunt Pops Pops I'm sorry I know we tried that all week I would talk to Luanne all weekend forget my retardedness pops with the golden girl now you know what those pops are the bride I didn't know that I'm just being honest with you our Prophet told us that the Bible tells us that pops our breasts and so when John in Revelations before you were even born Christ was in his bride and when John looked he said I seen it look like Jesus but it was light it was it was almost like oh buddy you're never going to get anything better than this Hallelujah let's just go to um oh let me go I got a scripture here let's go to uh put it down here I got to find it Revelations um right there Revelation 15 6. now this here this was my study Bible it puts a letter right by the beginning of girded about by the pipes 15 6. and the seventh angel came out of the temple having seven plagues closed in pure white linen having their perhaps breast girded with a golden girdle you know what the prophet said the girdle was the Gospel of the word Hallelujah you know what the spirit of Crisis this morning the gospel it's the beautiful gospel the message it's not even a it's a message but it's the gospel of Christ you are the gospel and so Christ today is here in spirit form Tabernacle in his bride in the gospel Hallelujah now I I if we get there if we don't want to be next week I'll read the quotes where the Prophet said that I have a stack here and it's scary if I read them all because we've been here a long time amen that's amazing that John on the island of Patmos seen brother Dale in what looked to be it looked similar to Christ oh boy's old boys and you were afraid of asking for a baby and you were afraid of asking for your asset potatoes you're healed you know the prophets in the quotient said you can't preach salvation without preaching healing do you know when they put the brass serpent up like I'm disco I'm just shooting from there when they put the brass servant up that was because of snake bites and so when they would get a bit they would look to that and be safe say from what the snake bite it was about healing it was healing its salvation hey man you can't be saved if you're dead oh that's beautiful amen and so let's let's look at what the prophet says here and I for this quote I got to pull my my glasses on because it's just on my iPad and this is a spoken word the original co-62 he said paragraph 158 he said now notice the harmony that Jesus never did anything until he was seen by the father I'm going somewhere Harmony what what do you say about a relationship we said what'd we say we said Peace the prophet said Harmony I said it was beautiful Harmony is beautiful a beautiful relationship nobody's cocky nobody's arrogant but but each know who they are because they're actually one hello one okay natural types of spiritual he said why it's a beautiful Harmony that Jesus never did anything until the father seen him or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John and he gives the scripture John 5 19. and so we and so will the bride because he showed her the word of life and he showed her and she receives it and she never doubts it and nothing can harm her hello harmer you know I back to by scripture you know I was thinking I actually don't bring those all the scriptures where it said in Genesis which Genesis was a c chapter about having a family amen and I don't even have them right on my thing but amen hallelujah we're afraid we've been afraid of the past God's commandment is that you populate and replenish the Earth and you want me to tell you something else he said this is where it was this this is not I did not bring this amen and Seed in Genesis hello no no no I don't think that went from well wait a minute you need to get converted first and every seed hello will bring forth of and you say did God tell you that I was going to have a baby the word of God told me I was going to have a baby and every single breaks watches the double tapes the seed is your own kind yourself your flesh and the bride the spirit oh praise God Amen amen and you'll never doubt it and you'll never she'll never doubt it nothing can harm her not even death for the seed was planted and the water that raised up amen raised up and watered it he meant Hallelujah he said now here's the secret and I've read this part before he said here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word now the word is in the bride but the bride will know that every seed will bring forth of its kind that's God's will because that was a Commandment that was a commandment so it ain't God holding back your seed God commanded it amen we didn't bring the box yet but we're going to bring a box start bringing in baby yes amen it's it's finished it's history amen but it's brand new amen he said here's the secret the word is in the bride and they have the mind of Christ and they know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name and he didn't say she prayed for it although we do believe in praying he said she has thus saith it don't get no better than that so Brother Joseph and sister Myra and brother Tim and sister Vicki next year about this time you're going to be rocking now really hopefully too amen let's just says the Lord he said oh brother there you is this a saith the Lord every seed will bring forth of its kind to repopulate the Earth amen amen no remember she'll never doubt it amen and it is germanized so the Holy Spirit Waters that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and you just Waters it like Abraham said look Sarah how are you feeling oh no change okay well we'll still go by these whoa because some people don't have morning sickness do you know do you know Luann's sister-in-law they never had a baby and they were later in their lives remember Julie amen and she went to the hospital and she said I think I think I'll go to it and she was she was uh uh uh she was a larger statue woman this is a true story am I making this happen I can't make up the stuff and the doctor said well congratulations Julie you are six months pregnant she's like oh yep amen Hallelujah and it germatizes in the Holy Spirit Waters it amen that's why he says the Bible says that he's the high priest of your confession I will have a baby about this time not sure amen confessions amen and the spirit and it and it on that Spirit Waters it it until it grows and serves its purpose it'll take about a year until it grows oh praise God and they do only his Willy man and they believe that and no one can uh Percy persuade them differently for they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them it is now that's what our Prophet said and John looked in Romans he said it looks like it looks like Jesus but he's got Pops oh Christ and his bride and God is the spirit and those amen the prophet said if you have a spoonful of the ocean or you have the whole ocean we all got spoonfuls and we're going to pour it in a bucket this morning we're going to Splash it and we've got part of the ocean man that's why we come together so we can see the waves because we pour all our spoonfuls together and then we can get waves oh wow and it moves all the trash and dodo to the outside beautiful amen and we believe that no one can persuade them differently for them thus saith the Lord or they keep still and then they would do the watch this and then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill it as he didn't complete it in his day so Jesus left something for us to do oh buddy and all these things when he was here he did not you know he repeats us he didn't not complete all when he was here for it was not yet but it's time now because we're here we're here and it's time oh Church can you see that you could know oh that's beautiful and see if when you were in Christ when you were in Christ and John seen you and it and it looked familiar but he couldn't put his finger on it it was because brother John hadn't met the wife he hadn't met the group but he couldn't like put his finger oh my God Hallelujah you know I want to just step back from this for a second and and we're I'm in a there's multiple multiple quotes where the Prophet Vindicated what the Bible says multiple times but see every time Jesus comes to do something he always showed us before he can it's why there'll be no excuses so watch this in the Bible here we have the story of Joseph which was a perfect type of Jesus one of the most perfect now there was other people that were close types amen David was tight because he prayed over Jerusalem then Jesus came and he prayed over Jerusalem I I would have pulled you into myself but you would not so there's other types but Joseph did the most types and let me just show you and so watch this so Jesus knows there will be a need and so he sends a need somebody that can provide that need before the needs ever there Joseph God knew that there would be a famine and a need to survive life in Joseph's family which was Israel the beginning of Israel man Jacob and his family and so he sent Joseph there to create the need exactly like he did with Christ he knew there would be a need in brother Dale the brother Dale couldn't take care of it and so he sent Jesus oh thank you Lord and he took care of all those needs and now everything's on the table and you could no more doubt than Christ could could doubt man watch watch and so here when Moses came on the scene and and believe me I'm all over this the scriptures but let's pull up Exodus 3 and 13 and 15. and here here's Moses after Joseph's life and we're going to go back and show you all the comparisons of Joseph's life but here's Moses after they've been in Egypt you know do you know in studying this story and and listening to it and this week and and everything I was you know because we're a Triune being we got flesh and spirit our flesh gets us in trouble see you know every time there was a problem in the Bible it was because of Flesh you know when Abraham lied it was because Israel was in a famine because he went for more riches he went for food or riches you say whatever you meant when when when when when Joseph's brothers came to Egypt they didn't come because they they like money and then because they lacked money they got in slavery wow you gotta be careful with that money stuff because it could enslave you uh-huh and now Jesus will deliver you and he did he did in every case he delivered he delivered Abraham like when Sarah delivered Sarah and Kappa appear for the seed to come forth Isaac and all these things but see it was the flesh that got in the way watch this so here here so here here here's here's Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt for food for money that was all flesh they didn't like it in the spirit there was a famine uh-huh be careful where you move to get a job it might be in slavery might be might be multiple cases in the Bible like that ain't that amazing God shows them to us so we recognize be careful with this Badger skin it'll mislead you and so but but Amazing Grace an amazing Mercy stops out and he says here's my children of Israel and they came for food and they're so comfortable here in Egypt now watch this I know you're going to think they weren't they complained to Moses because they were more comfortable being slaves than being headed to the promised land they were headed to the promised land and they said but if we would have stayed back there at least they would have fed us and gave us water careful with that bad your skin it'll it'll pull you away amen and here's Moses and but but watch this Amazing Grace and amazing mercy God says I'll still deliver you eat that's exactly what he said to brother Dale and to every one of Youth here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said don't you get that that's what Christ was that's what Calvary was he says your your flesh misled you and now you're in Egypt in slavery and I'll send Moses I'll send Jesus and he will take you out by a mighty hand oh church this Bible is unbelievable it's amazing it's just that's why our Prophet said when he was preaching he said I could preach forever it wouldn't take nothing but I see One Vision I'm tired it's amazing and God put this all out there and God's opened our eyes and we can see him and now we're getting to the states that I want you to be ahead of John that when you look you say it was like unto the son of Matthew but that was like onto Christ and his bride I see him both in one both in one in perfect what did he say Harmony amen and let's read 13 to 15. and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and I shall say unto them that God of thy fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say on and they shall say unto me what is his name huh I love that what is what is God's name think of this the revelation of Jesus Christ the anointed one the Alpha and Omega he said what is his name what shall I say unto the Mrs Exodus 3 15 13-15 we're reading 14. what shall I say unto them this is Moses I said God Exodus 3 14 is where we're at this is Moses I said God who should I tell them you are I'm telling you this morning that the spirit is telling you that you are a part of Christ you were seen in Christ in Revelations it's actually in the Bible I mean I showed you what it was I'm going to show you more scriptures and here's God says unto Moses you say I am that I am what kind of a name is name it see you wanted to put Jesus in a box but we have Mrs Jesus Mrs Jesus Mrs Jesus Mrs Christ and even God said man wow there's a lot of names I am that I am and he said Thou shalt Thou shalt thou say unto the children of Israel that I am has sent me unto you powerful see we can't put God in a box amen because God is a spirit and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God and so when you're packing the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a teaspoon of God so what is God's name well we could say well God's name is brother day oh brother mine brother Joe's brother my sister Ruth brother all right the Lord Jesus Christ what are you going to do with the I am or Alpha and Omega like hey man oh that's that's pretty hard to put that God In The Box that's amazing amen 15. and God said moreover unto you Moses that's how they'll say unto the children of evil the Lord God of thy fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob has sent you and this is his name and this is a memorial on to brother Dale it says that you got to put your name in the Bible unto all all right up to Wyoming Generations so I am up till now am I making this up is it is this the Bible that's amazing and we were worried about pasta potatoes we were worried about speaking the word well God never spoke to me in a prophecy but God spoke through his word before he ever had amen amen look at the types see how Jesus sent Moses Jesus sent Joseph to make a way for Israel from the family Jesus raised up mode they went right into slavery walked right into it Jesus raised up Moses to take him out with a mighty hand just like them are all types of Christ raising us up redeeming us back amen going to the pawn shop and taking the rightful owner this was mine I got robbed I got robbed about 1968 on a cold day in January well you got proof yeah my initials are on it what are the initials I am en I am I got robbed back there when I came to the magic skin oh Hallelujah amen how many times he did that look at how God protected Abraham when he lied about Sarah because he was going for more money he was going for food amen look at how all these examples amen here we see Joseph and we're going to go back to our Texan and close with some of these types of who you are Joseph was hated of his own what's the Bible say Jesus came to his own and his own received him not Joseph was in his own family and they hated him you know why oh I I'm having a good time preaching this morning his father liked them my father likes me Jehovah the I am the world what's the Bible say if you were of the world they love you but because you're not of the world and you're of the father that it ain't love that hate you because God Almighty loves you Joseph's brothers hated him now did he do anything to deserve that hate him did you nope that's amazing I mean my little brain can only take so much Hallelujah he was also hated because he seen visions and dreams and was very spiritual was that did Joseph have anything to do with being predestinated no no see he wasn't trying to draw hatred onto himself amen it just it just happened because of who he was he was what's the Bible say after my name's sake they're in the new they can't think of the scripture there and it says he said you know they stoned the prophets and killed me what are you expecting hello amen here here a type of that he says here they hated him because he was spiritual and seeing visions watch what they told Jesus when he says before Abraham was I am and they picked up Stones brother Matt and he said oh Father Abraham we love him but but being just a child and say you were born before Abraham oh boy they were as blind as bats amen Joseph was left for dead Jesus was left for dead Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver Jesus was so for 30 pieces of silver still Seaver silver Joseph was wrongfully betrayed and accused falsely Jesus was wrongfully accused falsely man here's here's pilate says art thou the Son of God they're saying that you've cursed God because I'm the son of God that same spirit's alive and well very well you didn't mean to tell me that the spirit of God is tabernacled inside of the ones that go to the Wyoming church and other worldwide bride around the world that's a little bit extreme amen but Jesus say he never even he said you've spoken it he was in prison he was forgotten by his friends you know when Joseph was in prison and and the two people were threw into prison the the uh the cook and the janitor I think it was I'm maybe saying that wrong and Joseph interpreted their dreams and he said the cook was killed and the other one wasn't killed and Joseph said now when you get out don't forget about me and he did when Jesus died on the Crosser went to pray how many people went with them his friends forgot about him hey man and Joseph sat at the right hand of pharaoh with your right hand in the scriptures always power it's not you know in in Christ and in God it's never two people it was always power and Jesus went ascended up into heaven and in power sits his right hand of the father amen worshiping Joseph was worshiped when he was raised up he was raised up they would blow the trumpets and say he's coming he's coming he's coming and every knee would bow down because because watch this it wasn't just because of a king's commandment amen it was that but this is going to shock you Joseph had brought salvation he'd saved their lives and Jesus and that great day every Neo bow and every tongue will confessed but the king of kings seen brother Dale and saved my life and oh it's just beautiful amen and Joseph also made Provisions for others and Jesus many Provisions for others amazing the types in the Bible man let's turn to Luke 11 27 and we'll go a little faster and and close here soon but just I want to prove how you were in Christ that you were in Christ when John seen him on the island Patmos okay and it came to pass this is just proven I've already read Revelations there where it said it was and it came to pass that as he spake these things a certain woman complied and lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb the bear that bear thee and the pops which thou has sucked now see it called pops breast and John seeing the breast when he seen the son of man in Revelations it was Christ in his wife they were onseparable they were one body it it looked on almost like she like a man it almost looked like a man from the backside Hallelujah Luke 23 and 29 or yeah 23 and 29 and behold in the days are coming which also say blessed is the baron and the pipes which never gave suck so what was that that John seen in Christ in Revelations here's Christ saying he said you no man has seen the father and lived and so here's John in Revelations and and he said well in the candle section he said well I looked at the candlesticks see that that's you were with Christ in the church ages the prophet says it in this and we'll maybe get to this quote he said the church ages the church Ages were feeding on the Holy Ghost oil of Christ the word amen that's that's just amazing amen hallelujah Hallelujah just let me see here here if we look into this and I'm going to read some quotes for this Ephesians 5 and 23 and for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body singular amen Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and here I mentioned before I'm just laying a foundation we're going to close with some quotes of man and Genesis there was a voice walking and and here in Revelations John had heard a voice in Genesis 3 8 and they heard a voice of the Lord God walking in the garden and the cool of the day amen and here John in Revelations heard that same voice but the voice was a amen beginning ten just beautiful and God makes no mistakes God makes no mistakes and there will be no excuses there'll be no excuses amen amen let's just let's just say look at some things that the prophet said longness now what the holy spirit's trying to do is bring you up and to show you this is this is me it's not just that this is Christ but this is me I'm connected I'm not just connected at the hip I'm connected Amen in the mark of the beast he said we found the church standing here in its beauty and Christ just molded into it the church had the white garment on and you'll notice it was uh I wish I would have put these on the screen I apologize for this I these are free to see I'm not making this up and you'll notice it was a woman talking about Revelations around the breast it was a garment covered over her shame and it had the golden cords pulled around it and they'd held around their breasts that that's just amazing to me I've been in this message for a long time I would have said 100 that that was Jesus Christ before but that was his bride with them he says watch this the golden cord pulled around and that held around its breast white speaking of the righteousness of Christ and the golden cord represents the gospel the preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church and the righteousness of Christ he's right here in the Pulpit anybody wants to see them arch of the Beast amen don't that make you in harmony don't that make you at peace don't that give you confidence amen it doesn't mean I'm just thinking God how did you love brother Dale well see it wasn't because brother Dale see brother Dale went in that pawn shop in 1968 in January the 26th about the middle of the afternoon but see God loved me before that pawn shop because once I hit that pawn shop I had some faults I probably started telling lies right away I was about that big when I was born amen you see what I mean so Christ's love wasn't conditional it wasn't conditional to the pawn shop he said that's always been mine he says your initials are on it but what should I didn't know what my name was so I just put I am oh buddy in demonology or sorry I do have one of those here but this is a different one and let me start here he said there you have the seven Church ages and now if you'll notice in Revelation 1 do we find Jesus standing in the middle of The Seven Ages and the golden candlesticks and when he's turned he saw one like the son of man standing closed and how was it see if you see how you can misquote the message if you stopped right there you say oh well brother Dale Prophet said that that was Jesus Christ let me show you that again he said now if you'll notice in Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing in the middle of the seven Church ages and the golden candlesticks oh everything you just preached is false let's not stop in the middle of the paragraph and when he turned he seen one like unto the son of man standing there clothes how was it it was the bride I say let's keep reading it was the bride standing in the middle of the candlesticks drawn out do you see how denominations don't believe in predestination do you realize that the dominations think that they have to hire an expensive evangelist that treats you right over hell and and believe me they can make it really hot I've been in those services and you've got to run to the Altar and then that's where God showed mercy on you what's up that's that's not my chicken enough what about the Prodigal Son oh wow do you realize that the denominator the church world don't claim you're his until they feel like you make a decision to serve God now that is as far off the scriptures is the East is from the west and it's farther than that and you know the truth and that and you know the truth and if you were in the spirit of it like a ball Diamond you'd be going and there'd be rattlesnakes biting out your feet and you say well I can't because I'm scared of the rattlesnakes and John's like that's what the Bible says do you think it was easy for John to write Revelations and God give him this Divine interpretation of the Holy scriptures which is one of the greatest books of the Bible in torture and who knows when he had his last meal and we God help me God help me to be more radical I want to be radical if you love something you'll be radical don't you dare touch my baby I don't let nobody hold it just me and my husband hold it because because you know he's only three days old and brother Dale's just sitting there crumbling I I want to touch that baby it's called being in love and in harmony and at peace Revelations one this is he swore by himself another quote I I'm I'm laying a strong Foundation here for you you should go out here on a spiritual High Revelation 1 Jesus was seen or the church no rather the bride of Christ see watch how the anointings come into the prophet you know Amos 3 8 the word of the god comes to the prophet man he'll reveal the secrets of the word and watch how he's getting the word it's like it's like oh I'm not making this up and the Revelations 1 was jesusing or it's got three dots or or comma the church or or no or rather no the bride of Christ it's seen him standing in the seven candlesticks and the feet had brass which were the brass of divine Judgment of the church upon the world the Divine judgment you know that we will judge the world amen and Glory and here's I mentioned about the serpent and here's the bride's servant speaking of it now watch he said it was lifted up on a pole and it represented a cross and the three things that was lifted up for for what purpose they would be forgiven of their sins and healed of their snake bites and is that right and he said no you look look and live look and live who refused to look died now he said you can't deal with sin in no way can you deal with sin in any way without dealing with Divine Healing it's as much yours you can believe you know the message Believers and I preached this before but you can believe you're saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and been filled with Holy Ghost for years but but like but you know this shoulder's been bothering me for 10 years but you've had the Holy Ghost for 10 years hello whatever happened to that on the same table are all the Redemptive promises uh buddy the permanent Vision here in 60. and the Seven Church ages here he said now you'll notice of work he said you'll notice that they're drawing from this main barrel of oil Christ light life dipped into Christ and you are dead and your life that's talking about your flesh your your life is hidden through Christ or or hidden in God through Christ man you see how the anointed one see when we preach the revelation of Jesus Christ so everybody that ain't got the holy everybody will struggle with the badger skin that's the problem and next Sunday if we go down the same stream if God permits it you'll show that you know the prophet said things like this he said Jesus was the body and Christ was the god in the body now Jesus Christ was no less than Jehovah God but don't get hung up on the badger skin because I'm no less than baptized with Holy Ghost I'm no lesson than Christ but don't get hung up on this Badger skin I'm going to eat corn in a few minutes I don't have nothing to do with grass amen Triune beings you know oh Hallelujah amen and watch this he said your life's hid and through Christ it's hitting God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit so if you believe that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning who are you you were in Revelations it almost looked like oh that's just amazing there's no way that ever no way at all ever that you could you you no way ever to get you away from there how can you do it nobody can tamper with you the end of your life is burning with the Holy Ghost see you're burning on the Holy Ghost oil that the seven Church candlesticks were tapped the Wicks all went into one barrel I am mad Hallelujah and they're burning given light and there's the other there's the other end of your life dipped into Christ and your dad hidden in Christ the Holy Ghost and it's blocking it off there that you can't the devil can't even touch you Hallelujah he can squeeze and make noise even death itself can't touch you oh death where's your sting and Grave where's your victory for through the Christ Jesus we have the Victory and I'm dropping down to the next paragraph he talks he's reading the candle six and he said my did you notice that the Stars the candlesticks the lamps what do you mean what does it mean this is beautiful he says he said what does it mean he says it's it's that's the dispensation that we're living in in this nighttime now he's bringing it up to today he said nighttime has it ever been darker in the world than today they're going to see complete and Sanity out in the world watch what he says and the in the dispensation that we're living in is in the night time the candlesticks the lights and the Stars what do the lights and the stars mean at night he shows a beautiful type and I think we'll close with this he says what do the stars do it reflects the light of the Sun until the sun or three times so you are reflecting and you are tapped into the oil and you're feeding on and reflecting it ain't brother Dale it it's God Almighty it's Christ the I am the anointed one I could hallelujah amen until the sun returns blessed be the name of the Lord and he says watch us I'm still reading the prophet he says and any true minister of God don't reflect some flashlight some Matchstick or some stock burning but he reflects the golden rays of Christ to the church that he's the same and he's alive Hallelujah that's that's exactly what our Prophet said amen and he's shining on me and he said if that's a light that we're reflecting the star reflects the light of the Sun so see we're reflecting the light of the Son of God doing the same things that he did giving the light he said what's the kind of light it's the Gospel Life of these things oh wow wow wow wow wow amen Christ is in you and he's your great hope it's amazing this is not religion this is not about a church this is not about a pastor this is not about the Pope this is not about any big shot unless you want to call the big shot Christ he's the one and only good job and that I don't say that disrespect I say that With Thrill in my heart don't worship me don't worship the prophet don't worship some other worse any true Minister would say there he is and there you are not just there he is there you are in him whoa see how we're not bringing up holy priesthood you don't I mean I appreciate when you come to me and and you know say nice things I mean it just makes my health melt but we're not raising a holy priesthood we're reasonable amen God could take me out of the way tomorrow and any one of you Brothers could stand up here and they're servant exactly the same word because it wouldn't be one Speck of you in it there's not one spec of brother day on this this is all oh to think that he would let us lie shine is amazing great reflector Christ himself amen amen let's stand holiday Christ is head of everything amen it's so beautiful multiple multiple more scriptures if you is it all right if I keep them to next Sunday multiple beautiful beautiful things this is so beautiful you know and this is what God's seen in his mind oh it's It's Supernatural this is amazing word amen Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we are blessed beyond measure you know we're not going to sing that song but I I pray my girls are somebody somebody this church will sing he's the same God you know that song is powerful it's been on my heart for months now you know if it ain't the same God that it's always been it ain't no God at all it's a saying God right from the beginning of time before there was thought oh man Hallelujah and he's exactly exactly identical today brothers and sisters there's only one thing that changed in that environment or picture and that is the picture of the badger skin that's a picture of your Earthly Tabernacle but the god inside that Earthly Tabernacle is exactly identical as the God that was at the woman at the well talk to the woman at the well was the god in our prophet and down through Moses and all these amazing things why cry to me speak and go forward you know when I was studying this week I you know I I I'm gonna shut up we're gonna sing uh he's got it all in control man you know when I was studying this week I seen something else new I it's just the word of God is just amazing man you know I knew that Moses was God to pharaoh hello y'all with me Moses said I will make you God to pharaoh you did whatever you speak that's how God said it it didn't change I'm just letting you know he said whatever you speak Brother Joseph whatever you speak brother Tim whatever you speak that's I can show you the scripture so whatever you speak I will back up and confirm that was before the Holy Ghost was given by the way hey man you know when I was studying this week that Moses when he complained to God and God gave him a his who to give him Aaron thank you sorry I couldn't think of that I knew Moses was God to Joseph or to pharaoh but he was God do you know what the Bible says he was got there he said you are Aaron's God and you tell Aaron what to say and all I'm going to do is use his lips but you're the god that's going to tell them what to say and I looked at that that's just that's just right in this good old Bible did God trust Moses does God trust you let me just give you a hint of God trusts you did John see you in him in the island of Patmos should give you an idea whether God trusts you or not let's sing this song he's got it all he's got everything in control you know it'll when when we come to this you know my wife's helped me you know we have we all had different situations you know when you think of God in this standpoint you will actually pray less no selfishly you know I was here this week and I knelt down right here to pray I never did any talking when I get up I said the Lord's Prayer we get down and say oh God pay my bills it's in the rain don't send the rain dry the hay feed the cattle pay my plane ticket Bill oh by the way I have a testimony for that too you know do this do that do that do do do God's like you know somebody who was it said this to us somebody said this to us maybe I think it was Sister Myra

this is like this so when your adult kids come to my house they don't ask me oh Dale can I have a banana if there's a banana on the counter and you walk and get it hello can I have a glass of mouth can I have a bowl of ice cream that's like when we pray to God believe God's like I put it all on the table and you say please God can I eat it's like the little story of the girl that said she went over to the neighbors and she was eating a lot of food and the neighbor said they said well don't they feed you at home brother Matt and she said no no the eyes of the neighbor cut his face he said they don't feed you [Music] you said they just give me the food obviously this little girl was a good actor but she had the attention of the neighbors for a while they were ready to call 9-1-1 child's age well they just make me feed myself that's like we are with God that's how I am so I start to say something in our house alone says forget it it's already done forget it I say I hope oh forget it

American but it works out to 1350 Canadian I went because trying to be careful because he wanted to go some other places that's the truth my heart's oh and you know when I was on the couch she said well we're committed to this one and then and brother Jose said you know foot's up to the righteous our order of the Lord he said no you call up your lady and just see what you get and we'll flip a quarter and you know he didn't say flip recorder but you know what I'm saying so I called up my lady or Luanda of course my right hand and said what we need and she said no if you go on the dates you
