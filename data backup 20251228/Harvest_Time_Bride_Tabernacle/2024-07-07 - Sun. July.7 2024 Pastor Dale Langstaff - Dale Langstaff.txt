not going this morning I had to run out early to pick up something and as I was coming back a thought come to me and when I looked at it is in align with something that I've been looking at the last couple weeks or more and it was the purpose each one of us have a purpose here this morning and you wonder why I'm here or you're here but we're here for a purpose and it's God's purpose yes there you go I mean many times we talk about why do we have mosquitoes what is the purpose why do we have this insect why do we have that animal why do we have this pest but they're all for purpose but that's just in the natural purpose what about our lives we all ever purpose and I I uh I uh I was looking at it and I I looked up what the purpose a short general purpose for a Believer we are to be made alive in Christ yes sir to be transformed not conformed we don't come to a church or go to a group to be conformed to we be transformed in Jesus in Christ and and by God's grace through faith and to do good works God prepared in advance for them to do and there's some there's some scriptures there um we go to Ephesians e e Ephesians uh two and we go start at the verse two we're in time past ye walked according to the course of this world that's in the past we don't look back in the past as we see what Lot's wife did when she looked back she got caught up and that was was it we don't look back we got to keep looking ahead looking ahead to the prince of powers of the air the spirit and worketh in the children of obedience amongst those those also who we are at our conversation in times past that lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of our mind and we nature of the children and Wrath of others so in past we were doing whatever the world do but God put a new mind in us a new spirit he created a new heart in the Believers and put a new spirit in them and so this morning as I was looking and says wow how amazing is is that uh line up with a Christian Life a Christian Life many people as we all know most of us here worked out in the in the city in the town and you meet people and they say they're a Christian you look and you say wow a Christian I didn't think a Christian did those things I didn't think a Christian act that way but to the world that's what a Christian is to them if they could do good works and if better junor talked to somebody at his work and say like we had we heard the week about the tornado and and they said I'm going to give you some money to go towards it that's their good works i' done a good part but then they go off and drink and smoke and swear and live like the world but they did a good part that's a Christian in their eyes but that's not a Christian with God he change us he transform us and in Romans 12:4 and8 you could look when you look at when you look at all this as we got some ministers here brothers that study you start looking at one thing and something else comes and something and it all ties back everything goes back to to to the to the word and and and and we got first and whole first testament old testament and and brother B said that's binoculars and he take it and you look to two of them you don't look to one we don't go back to the law we don't go ahead we can look at two and right in the middle what is it cross ears there a cross and that's where we're hanging there on the cross amen we got we got to put that all together in perspective so in Romans 12:4 and8 it says for as we have members in one body and all members have not the same office so we've been many are one body in Christ and everyone members one another having them gifts differently according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy Let It Be prophecy according to the prision of your faith and faith I looked at it the faith look is the first one we have to build on faith if we skip faith and we go through knowledge we're missing we have to start on faith and go all the way up till we get to brotherly kindness and then we get the holy spirit in is love so as we're building all these up we are getting love in our in ourselves and teach and then the faith uh your ministry or let us wait on our ministry that's right or let that teach be teaching or exort give exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity not be big amongst us and say I know more than you and I'm better than you and I could preach better and I could remember everything better I don't care really if I don't remember but I know the author and I got him in here and what I need to know at the time I'm talking he will putting it out when I need it at the time Hallelujah so then we'll go in foot chair and then we got to it says there let him do simply and simply he that ruleth diligently he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness who we was just a thought come to me when we were singing a song and it's still here I think Mercy God's mercy and you imagine today if we were judged by a man we' be all lost and through aside man's ideas Al all man will see what's in front of him but God sees down here in here every part of our bodies and that's how he judges us he knows our heart he knows our mind so in the scripture he says show it show it Mercy with cheerfulness so we have to show Mercy to our brothers and sisters we don't know what's going on in our brother and sister's heart we don't know the brother and sisters p and we don't need to know their past we just need to look and say wow my brother and sisters come to church and I see a difference in them that's good enough that's all we need to see and Paul speaks in in Romans after he says a simple Christian Life based on how we treat each other around us within the body of Believers so we are a Believer now we don't we don't say just us four no more no we are believers there but there's Believers outside in our towns in the cities and other places that most of us have met that came we have to treat them the same and in return they will treat you you be you be salty and they will see within the body of Believers in the chapters proceeding chapter 8th in the Book of Romans he writes of justification righteousness and many other different things in chapter 8 he speaks of an indwelling Spirit of Christ after one being born again so that indwelling I looked at me dwelling is something come in Christ's life Christ life don't come in you you're not going to you're not going to live Christ life you're not going to have Christ attitude you're not going to have the Christ uh Behavior yes it it it it little little something when I was looking came up this if I had a a a glass with liquid into it and somebody bumped into me liquid came out why did that liquid come out not because someone bumped into me because I had liquid into it okay so we as brothers and sisters if I rub my brother Dale wrong way what's in him going to come out is he going to come after me with a rod and Har or he going to say that's okay my brother I'm sorry see our attitude toward each other are we rub each other how we talk to each other we whatever is inside of us will come out if we got that Spirit of Christ it would come out and we'll behave right way towards each other if not he's no good he's this he's that and tell everybody about that wrong brother Adam said in the word says you nothing good to say to anybody say nothing that's right better to say nothing so then in chapter 8 in dwelling spirit so that's what's inside must come out that's and this is a this is a purpose this is possible if we modify in Deeds of this flesh so this flesh we have to cut off this flesh the human flesh is enmity to Christ doing through the spirit so we got that spirit in us that nature flesh we are humans we can't forget that we will fail but God don't see us our failers what the devil do it'll work on you and he'll tell you you're no good tell you you're not a Christian it'll say everything to you negative but the word is positive and the through the spirit in the 12th chapter it begin to speak about important aspects of Christian Living wow Christian Living how do we live we don't go every day it's nothing there is some people I've heard say you got dos and don'ts I don't like your church our church we could do what we like well I don't think that's a Christian church and I don't have no dos and don'ts either I don't think anybody here if you do you bet you could come and talk to the pastor or ministers and see where the dos and don'ts it's not dos and don'ts it's God's purpose how he set things out God has a purpose for everything and he has set everything up and we have to follow that and oh I don't have to pay tithes yes you do have to pay ties because God said it yeah I don't have to wash my brother's feet Yes just not those things are not over the Millennium is not here we're not pass we're still in this in this life which Christ have us here for a purpose and are still things that we still have to do thank you Lord a Christian aspects of a Christian Living that ye knew should be particular focus on able to live a simple Christian Life yes within the Spirit now I'm not picking on nobody in particular but he also speaks with the ministers he said he talks ministers and members of the Bride so we got ministers and we got members of the Bride we're all together we're all together nothing is accepted from nobody this word didn't come just for brother brandom and do what he like or just for the ministers or just no it came for whosoever be he knew would be for everybody and and the bride who prly parts to play in the body of Christ so we are a body and we all parts to play one of the most important aspects of a human body using it example this is as example con consisted behavior and if you really don't believe me what I'm going to say we have a sister here that is a registered nurse and you got to ask her about it sister Ruth what I'm going to say the Earth should not be pumping o oxygen isn't that right heart pumps blood that's right so a heart should not be pumping oxygen but the lungs pump hair because it's focus on pumping that what the lungs get rest of the body simply putting everything in the body abides in its place so everything add to be in its place saying our human bodies we got a mind we got eyes ears we got a heart we got lungs and everything is to work same thing in the body Christ's body just as we are Christ we all have to be in our place and we must know our place the body functions smoothly you get somebody at a place uhoh we got a problem here but if we could discern and see and we'll go back to what I said if something is in you and somebody speaks to you about something if you got the Holy Spirit you will say Amen brother that's true we'll look into that we'll see that yeah he got a need this one got a need the little ones got a need the older ones got a need we got elderly that got needs I mean the town itself will say check on your neighbor it's so hot we don't need the town to tell us that should be automatically in our hearts we got sister Joanie sister Donna that's living by herself no disrespect to Sister Linda she lives by her G he should take care of her he should know she needs air condition but we got elderly sisters just a simple phone call and you would tell hey thank you you know what that leads to your brother's keeper and just because it says Brother's Keeper that don't mean we can't leave we got to leave his sisters sister Patricia same thing sister patty just a simple phone call well it say brother Brother's Keeper this way it said is I looked it up brother and sister and young ones if I go in that awe and I see a young one that's sad or you see a young one is s you go over and you talk to them and you encourage him you're the Brother's Keeper you'll say I'll be praying for you sister brother even our young ones we be praying for you yes so we have to we have to function together and the body is smoothly because every organ has a special part to play and continue in in the spirit and we have special talents gifts are given to each one to benefit God's kingdom sometimes it takes a little longer to find your specific gift or talent but if there's but it's there whever it may be let us do as the commands us to say that Paul has placed us within placed us without dismission dis and that word and I'm saying it right but it means without quirrel without fuss so we must not fuss with each other over this and that I mean brother a brother told me one time he seen a church but over the color of the carpet that's Colonel we don't need colonel colonel got a goal yes yes sir got to get behind us Satan get behind us but that's carel too much carel got to go in Corinthians 1 sorry Corinthians 7 and 20 1 Corinthians 7:20 if we do this when God can do great things through us if we are at a place then we're only enter the Holy Spirit ability to move let us do what we can do by faith we have to build on the basics is faith faith and we have to do it simply and we have to be omly and let us work and dig dig and cheerfully be careful about it in the role of God has called us if you're a housewife you be a good housewife sister you're a housewife you got five little children you do your best and God will help you but Junior you're a farmer you do your best your wife is away but you do your best and God will bless you same with any other any other brother benard's a mechanic do his best sister L Ronda works in the home sister Ruth the guy has a special job teaching the de with ANS not anybody could do that but that's her purpose in life that's her gift and God will use her and we all have the do it according to and don't try to do each other's gift we can't do each other's gift we're going to interfere I can't do sign language but I can read lips but that's still no good to those children I could read lips cuz I'm I'm I'm death from one ear and just one ear is down and when you're talking I'm looking at you I'm looking at your lips to see what you're trying to say to me so that is mine but each one has a place and and in 57 brother Bron preached he says water from the rock just simply by grace are you saved through faith see we're going back to Faith every time we go back to the basics to the ABCs and if we don't have the ABCs everything else is going to be messed up by grace are we saved through faith we will trust try to mystify it and have all kinds of seen lights and signs sirens and everything and all kinds of things to get the people saved maybe someone see did see it but that don't mean all as to see it you just believe it that's it and God has his programmed and he will let you set you in place in you in Christ and yes he thinks you are the best for him but wherever you are God will place you just for him if you are just to stay on your calling don't try to get in somebody else's calling stay in your own calling if you're there I am he's reading I'm reading it now again just what I just said if you're a housewife be a hous Bo that's right from the word this is the brother Brown this is from the word whatever God has called you to do just remain there he knows where to put his hands on you to use you so we we we are in in in in Christ and we have to be in Harmony and we have to stick together brother ROM said brother ROM said out in the front of the street you behave we're in the backyard we could we could ask things out and when I ask things out with my brother and in here that's the far as should go I don't need to go out and say well me and brother Jim just had it out and we're okay I don't need to tell you that but Jim don't need to tell you that that's under the blood once it's under the blood it stays there you take that out is worse again so just things that happened to us in the past go got to go got to go we don't need it no more the simple Christian Life should be just as simple life of you and God not you new and your friends not new and your neighbors if they're a Christian you could fellowship with them but the Christian should be have simple life with God living in harmony with everybody we got to live in harmony we have an enemy and the old world is consumed by that same enemy we got everybody got an enemy Christians and non-christians yes sir and thus the battle rages and it's getting worse every day you you listen to the news if you got time and if you don't have time it's okay cuz you're not missing nothing if you want to get into the word get into the Bible read that more and that stuff that just fade away you don't it's nice to know what's going on around you not to be stunned and stupid say oh I you know don't be like that there there's a certain point but you could get be taken up in that stuff so much that are just consume important things by that enemy and th we battle rages but in the art of all Christ Jesus has saved us redeemed us and filled us with his spirit and that is the simple truth God all things are possible even in a simple Christian Life he preached in 1956 the true and the false Vine so we got two look how we could begin them up how we could bring them up through that beautiful type Israel that they came out of Israel the children of Israel came out they were on their way into the promised land they were sojourning out there in their tents they came to the country of Moab this is from Brother Bram now you could you could read it it's in 1956 truth of Vine he came to Moab where he did spring bring forth where Moab bring forth from lot's daughters they were lot's daughters Child by their father now the mobites is not unbelievers the said they're not unbelievers they were worshippers of Jehovah God certainly they was they even had fine preachers over there and he had one B name of beab b a l a a am a prophet but like the whole lot of hiring prophets was money crazy we see that today worse more than ever brother said amen selling their gifts oh yeah and they're doing today just find gift get things out in the world to make money and it's disgrace compromising so we don't have no time for compromising we don't have no time for be on the borderline this is this like the the story with the man with the train he said g to the Hedge he said I driving this train he said I'm getting the far away from the edge as I can I'm way right in and and just come to me that story but Ram talked about it and it says there and doing today fine gift things out in the world making money it's a disgrace compromising borderline one day in the world and the next day in church now this is word it's not my words and and like I said you could read it yourself one day in church one day in the world or one day in the world when the church whichever way is wrong you can't do that you can't you can't sell out to be born again he says move plunge Inland so that well Inland Inland is in the Middle with the body don't be a on the on the head head with the body going and coming we have to get on the middle the inside stay far away he said from the borderline so it's just something that I mean striking me about a Christian Life and we do not have time to be mingle with the world we are so close now my brother to the end end of the road that time is soon be running out yes sir vam said over well in 60 65 years ago he says it's over how much closer Are We Now how much closer so if we are going to live a true Christian Life we need to line up with a true Christian Life we need to live that life we need to be our brothers on it's Christian Life yeah you behave you dress right you you talk right and you you hang with the right people that's a part of it like I said we can't be like lot wife and to be looking back and just complaining the back about what happened in the past we got to forget that we got to be our Brother's Keeper we got friends we got to help out we got to help each other we have so many different things and then then in as a Christian you have to go to church it says Ass some yourself as often now we have things going on we can't help that that's just that's that's life but we must center oursel around church church is the most important we got to work we got to live uh brother bar I got to give him got to give him credit he cannot get to church but when there's Church he's there when he's home he's there amen but that that's that's his lot that's his purpose to do that he may meet somebody somewhere God's going to use us for whatever we want I mean I don't know why God moved me from Newan all the way around right down oh a right back here and one trip down O A man seen me walk into a washroom and when I walked out he said you got a bad foot I never spoke to the man I just seen that he was putting fuel in the tanks I never spoke one word when I walked out he said excuse me he said you got a bad foot I said yes sir how you know that he said the Lord told me he said I want to pray for your foot he reached down he put his hand on my foot and he prayed he said how is it I said it's better he said no that's not good enough let me pray again and he prayed again and I walked across the parking lot my foot was good but but that devil the devil came back again but now today good healing is a process and we got to start with faith and being a Believer is a process we got to start with faith all things are possible and so musicians to come and the song that I was going to sing is called only believe only believe all things are possible in Christ not in the world there's nothing possible in the world to get us there is only in Christ and all things are possible now I'm not a good singer so J you're going to have to start [Music] Ruth All Things Are want GL [Music] [Music] [Music] GL [Music] [Music] I'm going to read I'm going to read a prayer a prayer that brother RAM and I'll just change a couple words because we're Sunday and we're in the morning it says and you want to Bow your heads you can CU it's a prayer blessed heavenly father with the presence of the older Spirit here now we we are going to approach your word and although with a bad voice trying to hold back and speak the words just slow and steady as we can I ask for your Divine guidance for our pastor yes Jesus the holy spirit will move amongst us this morning and may He Who is up and mental may he take the word of God and give it to every art that we need have that's sitting here the day may he feel here today this morning upon the good things of God may we feed upon them yes Jesus and to and today while we are talking on the word may our Earths be United many miles apart maybe be not miles in Calvary where where Jesus Paid It All the sufficient price and was required to give a great Judgment of God and may the Garden of Eden and today may we realize that we are freely justified by his resurrection and by his death burial and resurrection and today we are no longer of the world for we have been bought with a price thank you precious price of blood of Jesus blood of God and may we with grateful Hearts turn to him thee today with all of our mind and strength and that we have for written to in us and serve thee with a pure unadultered heart Grant it this day father if there we come somewhere that does not know you in your paring of their sins may this day come only to the cross us and may they confess their sins in the god that is just here to forgive today he's here to forgive you and may this be a great day for us all we ask in Jesus name the Son and the Lord Jesus amen amen let's sing only believing me [Music] [Music] h [Music] brother Carson sorry I ask brother Carson if he was wanted to take the service and I think that would have been the the uh the right amen God bless you brother amen uh you know yeah maybe you can be seated for a minute I need to I need to share something with you you know if you understand how the ministry works of it's God and brother Carson what you shared is basically my message you know he he showed us in the first scripture that in our past life we were the children of Wrath he showed us that we're all one body and now we're to be cheerful now we can dismiss amen amen and you know uh you know this this week you know we had a a you know us personally we were we were farming you know we had cancel Wednesday and and uh and if you're a really God's servant you'll you will you won't just make up a message but you'll just wait on God and and I you know anybody can preach anybody can look in the Bible you know I had thoughts come you know uh uh you know I had thoughts like Abraham you will supply the sacrifice and you know I had different this and that but it wasn't his thoughts it was just it was just the Bible you know and I even forget where we were oh we were going we were going we were pulling on the Kimble to go out with our visitors sister Ruth God bless you miss your mom this morning you may tell her hi we were pulling on the Kimble when God started preaching and taught us what to say today amen it's just amazing we serve an amazing God Amen when he gives a minister something then it's fresh it's right from the Throne of God Amen let's stand and read our scripture and and we're going to have a double header this uh morning and I pray that you'll pull and and I'll preach like a shotgun and brother Carson I personally enjoyed that beautifully and next time I won't ask you for taking the service I'll just give it to you amen that was that was really good amen amen God brings different gifts different times and different manifestations and different people and uh we I recognize I recognize that and and that's beautiful Matthew uh Matthew 116 and we're going to read John 13 and and going to you know know nobody's going to work this afternoon that's fairly cool in here and uh so I mean if we're a little bit longer today might be all right I believe it'd be all right man we we don't think twice of working overtime so man we always just want to thank God for being an awesome God and and and I I believe what brother Carson said you know we we're close to going home and and there's some you know we know the my Mysteries and that but there's some fine tuning in these Mysteries that we just need to just line up just a little bit and then he'll take us just just a little bit just a little fine tuning amen and I believe God started that with our what our brother shared and I mean it you're you're going to see you just watch how it D is amen amen Matthew 11:6 and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me let's go to 1 John 1 and 3 these are all very very familiar scriptures and I've preached this on being offended different ways and and went different ways but but God has a plan and God has a thought that he wants to share with you today I believe that the bride of Christ in the past and maybe even up till today we will change today have been offended in Christ I have been offended in Christ and I'll show you how uh John 13 all things were made by him and without him was anything made Lord Jesus we pray that you bless the word to your people and may you just give them with strength to to hear from your throne today and and keep us together and bless the communion service after our fellowship in your name we pray bless all that are online and Lord we just pray that you'll come and and Minister your thought that you've laid on us today and thank you for our brother Sharon Lord Jesus and forgive us for not giving them the service and and just uh feeding on your word from your servant Lord Jesus but we pray that you'll lead us and guide us in your name we pray amen you may have your seats this morning you know in this scripture in Matthew here we see that John was in prison and John was the greatest Apostle of all because brother Bram said that he wasn't just the one that that that witness of Jesus but he was actually the one that came with Jesus and actually said there he is right there he was the one that introduced Jesus to the world and here we see John that was in prison so I mean he had physically walk touch Fellowship ate with Jesus baptized Jesus and with the they with with time and and cares of the world and and different things his eyes got so glazed over he wasn't sure if Jesus was Jesus amen and here Jesus says this amazing beatitude brother Brown calls it the blessed beatitude but I want to from a way of of you know Jesus said let's just say that again in Matthew 11:6 he said and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me now every single one of you sitting here have been offended by your brother and sister in the past guarantee it and if you were offended by your brother and sister you were offended by Christ because our Prophet said this that it was God's choice to make you a a free moral agency it was God's choice to have me fail it was God's choice to have your kids fail it was God's choice to give you free moral agency and we love it when we're just nice little baby I go hold brother M and sister Abigail's baby and oh that's a great time and then we love it maybe on their wedding day and then we love it when they're making lot of money but we don't like it when they go through adolescent we don't like it when they're peeing the bed we don't like it when they get old and they slobber and spill their food all over them that's why we throw our old people in the old age home that's why we could care less about the young people when they change the life and come to adolescent you know what there is because we're offended you know why nobody takes care of their mommy and daddy when they're old is cu you're offended that they retell you the same story twice you know I got a thing here and it says talking about and I'll read this just to lay a foundation he said let your parents grow old and love them the way they loved you he said let them repeat the story over and over and over and over again because they let you say the same word a hundred million times and never swatted you let them fill the food all over you and spill the milk and make a terrible mess because they let you spill the MK and mess up the carpet and did they put you in the home you were offended because it messed up your program in God you know brother Bram said that we were the they were the attributes of God and God chose to make you a free moral agency because he was a savior he was a Healer he was a provider he was all these things and the only way he can be those attributes is for to fall down that's right you don't want a pastor that falls down then God can't even be fix your messed up life you just want them to fill your bank account amen and so we go through all these different stages of life and if we get if we have eternal life we came from God CU he's the only form of eternal life so we are God sitting here we are God as an adolesent this morning we are God that don't know how to talk yet we're God that knows how to shut up yet we're God that tells the same story 10,000 times and that was God's choice and it was beautiful in his flower garden that's why he has all different nationalities you know this is going to actually be a worldwide bride do you know I'm going to tell you something that'll shock you this morning it won't just be the Wyoming Church in heaven we won't just be the only ones that go up oh that's going to shock you you know there will be people that do things different than us and we will be offended by it because we won't like it but that was an attribute and a thought of God God thought of somebody being fat God thought of somebody being small God thought of somebody being old and the beauty of the Bride is in the beholder you picked your bride because you loved her and Christ picked you because he loved you he didn't ask for the Pope's permission or the denomination to Mission he didn't ask for the church or the pastor even the FF Ministries position so that's why people like Paul that went around butchering people God said I chose him amen hallelujah amen this right up continues to go he said let let your old parents enjoy life let them enjoy their friends let them enjoy the things that they feel comfortable with let them stay in the home that they've always been in because they let you stay in the home that you were comfortable with maybe this School you were comfortable with and brought the friends over that you liked uh-huh offended let them end their Journey with the pleasure that they tried to give you in the beginning of your journey h offended we're offended if somebody makes noise in church the minister is offended if nobody does make and makes no noise in church we're offended if somebody talks all the time we're offended if they don't talk we don't understand adolescent we don't understand sisters we don't un we don't understand God God made God was a feminine part God was an adolescent God was a baby uh-huh and see it's not just that you're offended at the word if you're came from God then you are God do you know the prophet said and I have this thing here that God Made You God amateur Gods on the world and you can speak it into existence you don't have to pray if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know exactly what God wants you just say God boom I'm going to come mind my week today it's going to be tomorrow and it ain't going to rain huh brother Carson talked about faith one body it's one person you know where's Christ it's Christ is sitting right here but we got this religious Hollywood perception that we we got to look up to pray to Christ come on when you could maybe look down to little Curtis or or little you know an or little amen Alice or something uhhuh it's it's sad that the body of Christ can't even dwell in one place and one time it's sad that we're cutting off toes and fingers and ears and we're like Peter we we think we're defending the message of the hour and we're cutting off the Serpent's ears and butchering people the same time God's coming behind trying to heal what we're messing up and we say we got the spirit of Christ watch this it's a misplaced thought it's a misplaced uh comp passion it's a misinterpretation of what God is it is let me show you something watch this he said where are we never respect people when they're alive you're too busy to help me do anything amen we never open doors for people we never say please or thank you we definitely ain't going to help you move amen we don't celebrate birthdays or retirements or old age or or anniversaries or nothing well we're we're Way Beyond that we're mature we got the Holy Ghost we don't celebrate achievements of the bride of Christ do you know the Bible says that when one weep we all weep but it says something else too it says when one rejoices because they got something really nice on this Earth You know the Bible says that I know the thoughts that I have toward you thoughts to prosper to be good and health Deliverance so somebody gets a raise or gets a good job or retires or buys a new car and PR God there Rel but you just let that same person die die and now you have to make a decision you never had time to help them move you never had time to to help them go see them when we're combining you never had time to go out for dinner you never had time to celebrate the versary or their anniversary or the retirement or their new baby or their new job or not you you were a busy boy but just let that same person die and you'll call up your work and you'll say Mr Boss I'm not going to be in this week because somebody died and you will leave work you will stop and rearrange your whole life you would drive for hours to a funeral to respect somebody that don't even have a clue that you're there come on now they're dad is Dad can be and you had that opportunity when you were alive but oh bless God offended offended amen God gave us each other to Rejoice with each other to enjoy each other it wasn't supposed to be a war zone man we're supposed to rejoice when babies are born we're supposed to rejoice when our young people are growing up and come to adolescent we're supposed to rejoice when they can go to youth camp we're supposed to rejoice when they get their first boyfriend or girlfriend yes boyfriend or girlfriend joice we're supposed to Rejoice at the wedding and rejoice when I retire but we get so offended do you know God that was his plan do you know the prophet said and I I'm not reading these quotes but I have them in front of me just to save time that we were his attributes and I want to tell you he said I want I'm just reading some short highlights he said these things were to be that way you were an attribute of God he said God made him so that his great attributes could be displayed that's right that was adolesent that was when I was throwing up or pee in the bed that was when I didn't know nothing that was actually when I didn't know how to talk you know my nickname on the school bus was meow cuz I couldn't say Mount cow and I went to speech therapy great to I couldn't say yes I remember my mom taking me to speech Shing them teaching me to roll my my tongue to talk but unless you were my mom you would have been offended cuz see I was but see God wasn't offended cuz God made me he made me exactly that way but yeah amen but see but see if we're not careful somebody becomes different than us they come from a different country or they raise in a different area or they come from from town or country or or a different you know Province or whatever and they do it different than us that's our religion and we're offended well bless God I never was RA that way God wasn't either because God was a god of variety just think of that blessed are those who are not offended in the brothers and sisters in the IM M brothers and sisters and the not fully come to the Statue of the perfect man brothers and sisters see they're still brothers and sisters and the ones that haven't even manifested that they are brothers and sisters yet because they still are brothers and sisters because the seeds planted in there from for the foundation of the world he said you nevered to serve God God already had chosen you so I'm offended because the ones haven't came to God yet you may have be offended because your kids are going Wayward and it's exactly God's plan and you don't like it unbelievable wow he said he made things this way God made it so that the attributes would be displayed he said if there wasn't this he said he never would have had a choice the opportunity to be a savior he would have never had an opportunity to do these things that's in marriage and divorce he said in the beginning was was life and it was eternal the the Eternal one and his attributes and these attributes became word and now they became our our flesh amen hallelujah I I I need to slow down to read this who is this Jesus he said he W as he was Emmanuel he was a self-existent one and he wasn't even God then but in him was attributes that was brother Dale with all of my failures that was the kids with all of their failures that was the teenagers with all of their failures that's what God planned now watch this this you got you got to catch this he said such as your thoughts see your thoughts I've seen something and then I think of it he said then speaking the word of thought expressed and so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was expressed and that's who we are this morning he said and and now all the same the same we are born again and we got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life we know that and he said now now can I talk among Christians would that be okay he said we are his attributes and Jesus came as a redeemer and many believes that but a redeemer is not to create something new when you get converted you're not made new yeah you're changed me you have a you're converted but watch how he says this here he says a redeem being redeemed is not a creation something new redeeming is to bring back which was already been so even the ones that you're offended with are in Christ they're not where you are and because they're not you're offended W man God hit me like that he was like dumping a dump truck on me he said it's not cre created something new he said redeemed it's to bring back which has already been see so there you are you're scared about what are you scared about you're god you're an amateur God he said you're scared about about what see all of it's in his hands and the clock is ticking perfect perfectly right but we don't like how it takes we're offended you know brother bam said this he said you know many times multiple times he said and it's it's on my thing here I'm just trying to he said if you wanted to do something nice to me he said do it to my children and he said that's how God feels ouch I I I put multiple of those that oh bless God you know I think they're off the I I think offended when you say that you're offended because it's different than your and I'm not talking about breaking the word I'm saying when when we're in a family see remember God was the self-existent one but when he spoke us he wasn't self-existent anymore it the the Bible the word and we maybe I pass it or will come to it he says that he dwelt with his family family and for you to attack his family is to attack God himself and his family's not perfect CU I'm a part of it and I'm imperfect wow he said why are family members embarrassed with their family members why are we embarrassed why are we you know when my mom and dad get old we' take them to every place they would go with us I didn't care what they did wrong at that restaurant that's my mom and dad they could knock the table over they could knock the place over that was my mom and dad before my dad died I showered my dad I took my dad to the bathroom and cleaned them I B my oldest brother said I couldn't do that I said that's my dad I never even I it wasn't even a it wasn't even a thought wasn't even cons and that's exactly what God feels like with the young babies and the Adolescent and the imperfections and the stupid fat Dale when he opens his mouth and says that's my boy regardless of what he does I'm not condoning sin but remember I hope I haven't passed it and if I come back I'll come back to it brother Brown said God chose it that way he chose CH it that I would make mistakes he chose it that you would make mistakes or he couldn't even portray all the things that he was and it never changed one Speck of the blood line now you may not condone we're not condoning sin and if you and your family if your kids are in the world condone but it don't change one spec they're your kids they're your a Heritage if you have the prophet said this he said if you have enough Holy Ghost to believe you're going to be in the bride your kids will be with you amen or you better get to the Altar and confirm your own Holy Ghost because it's a token they're your Heretics god brother Dale didn't raise no Devils it don't make no difference how they're living I didn't raise no Devils there devils have predestinated seed in them if you don't think so think of Rahab the woman at the well and need I go on Paul and David and uh-huh we think that was just all in the Bible no that's right here in a thing and we're offended we would be offended by David and what he did we would be offended by Paul and how he butchered the Christians we would be offended by the woman at the wall that had six hus five husbands or six husbands we would be offended if she came to this church bless God we're clean we're pure Hallelujah we don't have that spirit in this church well praise God I wish we had some of those Spirits in our church and the Holy Ghost could take care of those Devils amen we don't have no wom's at the wall woman in the wall like Rahab but maybe we need some of them because she married the chief of the Army and the lineage of Christ came through that family bloodline now that's crazy but we would be offended you don't know what you're doing God that's oh they will never get it see it's our our our this Spirit of of the age in Hollywood has raised it that's why you know men get five women and they married their their fifth or sixth woman is younger than their daughters and that cuz we just throw everybody in the garbage we're a throwaway Society you know we had a we have a TV there in the the hall you know for singing and the one blew up and I went back to you know where we got it and I'm thinking oh my goodness than aive this thing's only like I I thought I'd probably just got it paid for but I think it maybe was two years old and he said oh praise God he didn't say praise God he said you did really good it lasted two years and I'm thinking you're filling ships with this kind of garbage let's stop polluting the ocean you know the smart screens are a piece of garbage if they last for over a year you ain't got no warranty on nothing just throw out and buy another one just throw her out and so when we get offended with each other we just throw them out throw them out throw them out of the church throw them out of office you know when the the woman was had had an affair and her husband had had an affair and she came to the prophet and I don't have this in my notes and and she was going to be healed and God couldn't heal her because she had hidden sin and the prophet revealed it she screamed and she said nobody knows that you'll destroy my life and my family and my husband will leave and he said well it help you if I tell you what your husband did and he had done the same act and they came together and he was a deacon and she was a Sunday school teacher and when they confessed her sins to one another they came to the prophet and they said well I guess we'll step down how would you like it if brother Dale nominated a Sunday school teacher was a prostitute and a deacon that had messed around bunch of women you want to know what your Prophet said said why would you do that he said it's all under the blood now I wouldn't sit under that Deacon bless God I'd be looking for a new church you'd have to look for a new prophet and then you'd have to look for a new God because God needed prostitutes to save amen watch this he said you know the devil he don't attack you or your family and the devil don't attack the family of God so hard for no reason at all he don't attack your family he don't attack the less you know the Bible says that the most uncomely Parts get special honor that's the ones that we're offended with you know I went to the doctor I had a problem with my body and I went to the doctor I couldn't imagine any doctor want to do that job and you know when I got done I told the doctor I said no matter what you made it was wasn't enough it wouldn't have mattered to me if it was $1 million that would have been a steal I would have given him double that and I said if you were here and I wasn't talk to you on the phone I'd give you a hug because he fixed an uncomely part of me that was want me to jump out of buildings stand in front of trains because I was in torture I was in torture but with those parts we're offended and so we throw them out but with those parts God gifts our same God that we say we are he gives special honor special honor so that's the people that don't know Church order and Doctrine God gives special honor because they're coming into it that's the the people that make mistakes say the wrong now now now we're not con in it we need to we need to see you know you know he would say this like even for communion he says you know there's no Angels Among Us because you would already be gone the Rapture but if you take communion you know you have to make your heart right but is your desire to be right you know Peter made some really stupid mistakes but God give him the keys to the kingdom and I would have cut his head off you would have too you would have too don't look at me like that Holy religious thing I would have just chopped his I said buddy there is no hope for you holy offended I would have been past offended I would have been murder but you know what God said he said he's mine even though the crewed three times and even though he denied and even though he cares and even though and even though and even know he today my there's my boy you know we've had some people do that you know the story brother Brown told of the young girl that came back from college and the trained and and the mother had went through the fire and she she said that's she said who's that ugly witch or wake mother she was just disgusting burn that's that's exactly how we are in the church amen I'll say amen for you that's why we rate ministers on how long they Minister and their quality and their delivery and their Dynamics and we amen well we're never going to have brother Carson preach at the camp meeting because you know he's not certified we never have brother Dale cuz he don't know English and God says that's my mama and the guy come up told that girl he said you should be ashamed you actually need a a kick in your uhhuh because your mama and your God the morning was a thousand times more beautiful than you were your mama was 10 times more beautiful than you so I know your mama before she had you and she would have made you look like an ugly witch but when your house was on fire your mama went to Calvary for you huh and he became ugly to make you beautiful do you know the greatest thing God did brother Ben norrod preached this here the greatest thing God did do you know God's Own law wasn't that he could save us cuz he was God and we were humans wasn't possible and God's Own law was it that was a kinsman redeemer Ruth God had to become fat and ugly like brother Dale to redeem brother Dale he had to be one of us you see what you you you know where I'm going and what did the world say exactly what the message people say today there was nothing I would desire of that church no no he didn't look good he didn't talk good he didn't smell good there no Beauty and so we're offended and God said now that's my son right there that's my son right there the very people that you said has no Beauty I would never go to his church I'll never hear him preach bless God and God said but there's my child right there offended I wonder how much we're offended in you know you know I I tell you this the greatest thing you can do we're by the way we're going to or December and it nothing pleased me better if every single one of you came and if you didn't have the money talk to us God will provide it I'm dead serious you don't think I am I I ain't lost my mind not a bit God God knows exactly what he's doing God plans on you to be part of a family God planned on being part of a family but you're too good to be part of this family you're the part of the family that don't come to the family reunions on Sundays well bless God I don't ever claim that person amen that's good preaching brother Dell travel go go meet God in another Tabernacle go meet God with another attributes go meet God when they do everything different than you would do and you're just like oh that offends me and then watch God work on [Music] you I'm offended I'm offended cuz I have church earlier I'm offended to have it late I'm offended they eat in the church or don't eat at all or I'm offended that the preacher don't wear a tie because it's 300° and he wears blue jeans and a sweatshirt I'm offended we're all offended and that's why the Rapture hasn't happened because we're offended why can't we just look at somebody's Beauty when they're old and they spill their coffee at the restaurant and they got tuberculosis and they spill filling on their food and you got to wear a diaper and they got to put their teeth in and we say a they're too I can't go to the restaurant and God says that's my child said I wasn't embarrassed with you were ugly and no good for nothing you uhhuh I think the Bible says something like if you're embarrassed by him he'll be uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh offended well bless God I never went through adolesent I would never do that I think the Bible says something about hold not the sins of our youth to our charge offended you know in a family everything ain't perfect amen and when you have a nice pretty family and you can have 50 kids or well you probably wouldn't have 50 kids but you could have a nice old your wave arrows could be right full with lots of kids and it could be really running smooth and you could be like Hitler behind the scenes and everything's just lined up you know we got these 10 children just and let them all get married and you didn't raise their Partners they weren't born in their house and then have a family reunion oh my mama did it this way and my daddy did it this way and we cooked it this way and I like it was this and I like it was that and I like offended and almost every family on Earth and you know I'm right and if you got gray hair you'll know this for sure is ripped apart with the marriage of the kids because they are different coming into the family and they're not accepted as family uhhuh back to the year the devil's not attacking us so hard he said he would never come against the bride of Christ unless he seen something valuable in the family I want to just tell you something Church thieves don't break into empty houses thieves don't break into places where there's nobody that lives there thieves don't break into where there's value and character and discipline and a and a longing and a connection regardless of the uncomely parts regardless that's not to condone sin but in a family see there's immaturity immaturity in in a predestination there's people that haven't even been sign the Son of God on it yet so that seed just hasn't even germinated yet but it has just as much life in it as you did you know our Prophet said that in in a you know an apple seed there's all the apples that are in that whole tree is in that seed and that coconut that great baked monstrous oak tree like Jehovah God is all packed up in a seed that is uncomely and immature and maybe even in come to the light yet and so we can't let our light shine we can't be salty we can't witness we can't invite people because everybody's offended with everything just pick your thing and here's God in heaven the father of us all trying to hold her together blessed is he who ain't offended in my family you know me and Lan had a scenario if we were young and and kids I understand there might be some exceptions to the rule but we were kind of thickheaded and maybe even immature and maybe even a few other things but we had six kids under nine and if we were't invited to something that our kids weren't invited it was just automatically that we weren't invited CU they were just as much a part of me as as the blood in my veins and if if that you were afraid of my kids messing up your life well then I was going to mess up your life because it was a package ordeal and that's exactly what God's looking at and that's why he hasn't been able to take us home yet because we couldn't get along when we get up there well we can't get along down here so how are we going to get along up there cuz we're in tighter quarters and you know that's the truth you know that's the truth if you don't think that's the truth you just go anywhere and you'll know that's the truth you know we went to Ottawa last yesterday there's like multiple like six seven different churches represented there's churches just an hour and a half away don't bother coming just I just couldn't be bothered multiple two hours three hour oh oh bless God I'm busy but just let them die and we'll go pay respects to a dead man we're messed up we're messed up we don't have birthday parties we don't have anniversary parties we don't have any kind of party just the dream up a party New Year's party any kind of you don't you don't have do you just we makeup parties well if you're around my house that's a hot party or a cold party but let somebody die and we'll shut down the whole world get on an airplane you know there's people all over the world you know I going to tell you something and this is going to pinch Peter Chandler died and I love that man because he accepted me for exactly who I was he accepted me before almost anybody would accept me when I had the church in the house he sat and talked to me and you know I want to just tell you something he told me right before the last convention in Ottawa me and lanne got him a loan privately don't ask me why I didn't bother taking a picture for any of you that don't like your picture taking you need a slap cuz we might want to remember how ugly you were when you were here I stood with him talked with him privately and then he died I couldn't find one picture where it's just me and him alone that's disgusting but you know what he asked you know what he talking about when people are alive or died do you know he died in the church on Wednesday do you know he always went early to church and would spend the whole day praying and working on the church maybe cleaning vacuuming doing stuff like that you know repairs whatever and he told me himself I said how do you get people to come to church on Wednesday night CU like I know he's preached for 60 years and you got make worldwide we're in Ministry and all this and that remember what I said about the people still being alive remember you're never going to have come to my birthday party you're never going to come to brother Carson's in retirement you're never going to come to anything cuz we're busy we're busy we're busy people but just let them die Peter Chandler said brother Dale I normally have 25 at church on Wednesday night but I want to tell you something I seen a video and he died on Wednesday night in the church and they called The Believers and there was hundreds of Believers outside the church crying and mourning and weeping and all that he's a dad man in the church w praise God he's dead let's respect them I know people from all over the world to buy ,000 plane ticket to go see a dad man all over the world couldn't be bother going to church on Wednesday night bless God he was alive still we're not going to give him any flowers then well guess what me and L W's already made our funeral's arangement if I don't go in the Rapture I'm going to be cooked and I don't need any flowers you can send them to missions and you can just sprinkle me out in the flower garden and kick the dirt every once in a while spending money for a stupid stone that nobody goes and sees and flowers that are going to Decay and a four or $5,000 piece of Oak that you're going to put down and pour water on it let it rot that's you know an average funeral around here is about 20,000 you have visiting do you know when that average funeral in Serna is about or in Toronto is about 30 to 35,000 but you can get cooked for about 2,000 hey when you're dad you're dad but we have it in this little fried brain of ours that we're not going to say nothing nice to nobody we're not going to respect anybody we're not going to go visit anybody you let somebody go in the hospital you I tell you what we show hand don't show your hands cuz how many people went seeing sister Linda in the last six months brother Jim's wife but just let her die just let her die I'll say it for you ouch cuz you're too busy well you're a busy person yep you're really busy just let her die we'll have a nice beautiful funeral we'll throw up put the red carpet put showers you're messed up in your head you're messed up in your head because you're offended in Christ this ain't me listen brother Dale is way too to make up this message this is God telling you you're offended in God it's God's choice how in the world could sister Linda be in her State and God be a Healer and you're offended with God you're offended that God would let her be sick so God could be who he is God but we're not going to do nothing for her we're not going to take her flowers we're not going to take her Mother's Day gifts we're not going to take nothing but by the way we did amen we're not going none of that no no no no but just let her die we'll buy $5,000 casket we'll buy $5,000 worth of flowers we'll bring in the best minister in North America and you know that's the truth so you might as well just say ouch because God ain't stopping amen Ephesians 1 two Grace be unto you and peace from God the father from The Lord Jesus Christ and blessed uh verse three Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and Father of of our Lord Jesus who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now according that he has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Hallelujah and Without Blame before him in love but you know what you actually have to be alive you have to be alive now let's just go down and is it okay if I read a few things brother Brandon and I I'm sorry you're going to have to forgive me for uh oh my here here he said God when God chose us God chose you that you got the Holy Ghost and when he when he did choose you before the foundation of the world was for knowledge and he seen you and he loved you in your state before there was uh and He sent Jesus that he might be pay for our sins and reconcile him back to himself in love God would have never done it if we had the thinking of God because we would have been offended and let me therefore go uh any farther he said let me before we go any farther go to Genesis 1:26 and I'll I'll pick this up Wednesday and and it was Elohim and I mentioned this it was Elohim the word means in the Hebrew self-existence and there was nothing existed besides God and he was a self-existent one there he was all by himself and Elohim means uh all sufficient all powerful allmighty all self everything but in Genesis 2 he made men and he said I am Yahweh Jehovah and he said what's that mean he said I am all existence but I am one who created something off myself so if you're offended with any single person in here that's immature you're offended with God because God was immature off myself to be a son of mine it's impossible for God this is this this is an adoption in 60 or a temporary or an amateur one of the little ones a little one of mine Glory why he gave man god Jehovah means that he gave men to be an amateure God because the father he was a father God and He Man men amature gods and so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his f family and so if you're offended with the family even the immature and the uncomely and the babies and the old people when they get make mistakes and and then you're offended with God and now he's Jehovah and meaning one whom exists with his family and now God made men to be have dominion over all the Earth and he had dominion and the Earth is a man's domain is that scripture and he said now if it's his domain now watch this I said this before I know you questioned me I can feel it come back sometimes he said and now the Earth was his domain that's scripture and if it was his domain he was he was that means you he brother B is talking about God's creation that came off a god th you're God over the Earth that's an adoption paragraph 15 of 60515 e he said the Earth is uh he said he's God over the Earth and he could speak and it would be be so and he could speak this and it would be so and oh there he is god Jehovah and he's he's once was self-existence but now it's his family and it's his now I'm still reading and it's his little ones with him that we think are making mistakes and God made them exactly that way that's an adoption that's in that that last paragraph is 16 and 605 15 e blessed are those who don't shout at God blessed are those who talk behind God back blessed are those who point out God's failures blessed are those who are not offended in God because he chose it that he would make it you would be you would be free moral agent and you would come into Perfection but you weren't born in Perfection and there ain't none of us here this Perfection yet or we would have went on cuz when God's finished with us and we've came to the perfect like the prophet he would have just sent down a Char of fire took us home amen God help us it was God's purpose to be Supreme his his family his Earthly family watch this I I I I'm I just I'm just I hope you'll forgive me but it was God's purpose it was his purpose the father Supreme it was his family his Earthly family Adam and Eve and they were the ones that could be his family or with God because God's nature was with them and I said this before see the greatest thing God did even before he could go to Calvary was he had to be us he had to be flesh he had to become us to pay the price for us he had to be my brother that I was offended with cuz all the religious people were offended in that day all the religious it was them that crucified him and that spirit's still alive amen that's why we have different camps brother Braham and the King's been Redeemer he said you know he said Jesus died uh manifested In the Flesh God became man it was a law of redemption God had to do that it was this he said before he could redeem is lost Israel back he had to be a kinsman redeemer he said that's all in Ruth so now when you're offended with your brothers and sisters even ones you're not even amen we're not judges does anybody know where the last predestinated seat is they still might be out they might even be in the beach this morning now I'm not recommending you go to the beach but you know what I'm saying like wow he had to be our kinsman redeemer in order for man he could be Kinfolk man you became Kinfolk to God that's a new way to look at that scripture blessed are those that are not offended in me wow you know brother Brown said before Min you know that's that's that's That's Heavy that's heavy for me God helped brother Dale oh my goodness wo I need some good duct tape sometimes wow for the cars met some some things just wow wow God help us we think we're working for God we're working against God and God God's struggling you know you know when Paul was murdering the Christians he believed with his whole entire heart he was doing God's [Music] Will and so if brother did so if something happens and oh oh wow no wonder we don't have to pray anymore because we just gossiped each other that's where we get our comfort but if we could take these all to God then God would deal with it and we wouldn't be the and we think because we're gossiping we're we're warning people of other people's mistakes and all that and we're actually murdering them by their [Music] character wow God help me wow God became man to have sons and daughters he was a kinsman redeemer I'm trying to fly through these and we're way over line oh my goodness for not having a message God sure give me one my goodness and now when we're in Fellowship we come back there CU he manifested you and not that he wanted to have fellowship with you and he came down and he made flesh so he could perfectly fellowship with you see the perfect Fellowship oh my what th this is the power of being transfered this is right before the prophet died it's paragraph 235 and this is worth repeating now then now now we can fellowship with him and you can't back thereare because you were just a word in him a seed but now he's manifested you and now he wants to Fellowship with him and when he came down he made flesh so he could perfectly fellowship with you each other see that's perfect Fellowship he said oh my them are deep Mysteries oh you wanted me to preach on the seals or something he said those are deep M mysteries of God how wonderful see God could Fellowship in the spirit so God God could not Fellowship in the spirit with men so God became a man wow I'm going to close and I'm just going to give you three examples and we're not we're it's 1:00 and my goodness we're going forever um job was one you know job had three friends and uh that came and and uh were offended with job now I I want to just show you fast really fast in the scripture Job 1 16 to8 we're not going to read it but you know God chose job he said you considered my servant job that's Job 1 168 now if you go to job 2 now God had allowed Satan to attack job and so now they were disorderly in around the message or whatever the bride I mean job had problems right we all agree he had problems big problems and he had three message deacons come by and they were really straightening him out it gives their names but I can't even repeat them now I have them right here in front of me that's in job 2 11 and 12 the two deacons come by and straighten them out and job answered them and he said he said I've heard much many of such things are are miserable from you and then if we go to job 42 and God went to job's three friends and would you like to know what God told him would you like me to read that that's job 42:7 to10 and I'll just paraphrase it because we're running overtime God told them he said if you don't go to job and repent and get job to pray for you you're a dead man offended they were offended they said everything you could think of about job job 42:7 to10 said if you don't go to job and you don't get him to pray for you and repent you're a dead B another example in the Bible is Joseph Joseph was chosen of God Amen this beloved of his well chosen loved of his father his brothers hated him because the spirit of God was on him because he was a dreamer sold into slavering Joseph is a perfect type of of of Christ and all these things that happen huh huh you know the end of that story another one was Abraham when God chose him said go to a land where I'll show you and the mistake Abraham made was he brought people that God never included in the promise and you know they were offended with each other because they quarreled their servants and he said we don't need to quarrel so you can build another church wherever you want and I'll go to another town and you know when lot got in trouble and the kings came and taken him Abraham because he had the spirit of Christ went and rescued him I want to close with this scripture Ephesians 5:17 and Junior you give this to me I seen it on your post today and it was beautiful I put it on after I came to church Ephesians 5:17 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what is the will of the Lord is Let's Not Be unwise and let's have a little bit of understanding that the uncomely parts they came from God too and because they don't fit your program if you're offended Wow Let's stand that are not correct I'm not condoning being off the word I'm not condoning sin but it don't change predestination don't change the family part you got to let God be God let God Be The Savior and you just be the children because the prophet said this and I closing with this thought if if God will let me he said you know when somebody backslides they're not lost they're out of Fellowship so we can be offended with somebody's other fellowship and you won't have to worry they won't come back too quick and your Prophet said they're still converted they're still saved just out of Fellowship because that's sister Ruth like your brother Bill because he said when God seals the train car it's fit for the whole journey it's fit for the whole journey but the train car might go off the track not be in line with all the other train cars but it's still SE so be careful we don't get offended you know if somebody gets out of Fellowship they're going to do things that people do that are not in Fellowship that that even believer just hang on but they're not lost our Prophet said they could no more be lost than Christ could be lost because he said God don't do business like that he's a good businessman he don't start a he don't start building a shed of he knows he's got the money to finish his shed you know I was trying to teach the Africans that you know he said you don't build a tower you don't go to war until you investigate whether you got enough to win the war or finish the tower wow God help us to not be offended we think we're offended with flesh and blood but we wrestle not oh ain't the Bible good but against principal I ities and the Devil comes into houses that are full of gold predestinated seed tried in the fire of Jehovah and Satan's trying to get that [Music] gold help us not to be offended but to be wise and understand and understand God I feel like I could preach for forever woo unbelievable BL some for heart [Music] I [Music] [Applause] the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hal [Music] oh help was [Music] you think of our beautiful heavenly father and he [Music] knows all [Music] that reaction to an action Road I'll get you [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord [Music] [Music] just a little different I want us to say I'm so glad that they're yours I'm so glad that I'm part of a family Lord I'm so glad that my brothers and sisters are yours Lord that I'm not doing this all by myself I'm a part of the family of God huj if somebody's different than me doesn't matter oh huah what kind of a spirit of Christ we say we're Christ and we are but the Bible says that he desired that none would be lost [Music] [Music] Hallelujah GL [Music] hallelu [Music]
