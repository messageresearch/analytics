beautiful worship songen thank you musicians flow through me anden I tell you what if he flows through US it'll be amazing greatest experience of our life we just welcome you Allen just great privilege here and Happy Thanksgiving every amenah let's just go right into the word we just welcome em man our visitors amen for with us I felt like he should be ministering this morning amen then we we were at Jared Julie last night and and uh brother Bernard was resting and and we kind of had a vote behind him and said brother L Bernard could Minister this morning you know because I actually believe that any one of you Brothers could come up here and handle God's word I I believe that completely I believe God has that kind of confidence in you let's turn to Genesis 1:26 and then we're going to read over to Ephesians 5 and 21 and I ask you to pray for me it's going to be uh uh just something a little kind of pastorial this morning and I want to title my message Gifted Hands the woman the [Music] bride the woman the bride God said let us make men in our own image our image after the likeness and let them have dominion them is a key part them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and every cripping thing that creepeth upon the Earth in verse 27 and so God created man in his own image created in the image of God created he him male and female created he them verse 28 and God blessed them them plural and God said unto them let's just drop to Ephesians 5 and 21 and this is a a popular scripture you know of of husbands and wives and marriage and then it goes into the end you know a great mystery but I just want to read this top verse as we start here submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God lord Jesus we pray that you just take your word Lord Jesus and may you be with the speaker and the hearer both Lord Jesus in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats bless you this morning amen I want to minister on Gifted Hands and you know there's a story told in during the World War II and just to to lay a foundation and start our our thought there's a a story told that in in the the process of Hitler and the Germans bomb in a lot of those countries and over there in Europe there in one of the Cities was a statue of Jesus and like most of those cities they were completely liberated destroyed and this statue was also no exception to that it was greatly [Music] destroyed but after the war it was put back together and left in the city but there was one part of the statue that they could not re and that was the hands that was the hands of Jesus and you can look at the scripture and you can see all the things in Jesus Earthly Ministry that he did with his eyes and today the bride of Christ is Jesus hands and so they put a statue a sign on that statue with with the statue of Jesus with no hands and it said today you are his am and you know so many times in our in our life and and I don't mean here personally in this church but in our in our acquaintance and even even around the ranks of the message they say that cautiously and and I hope this is not taken wrong but I I want to deal with a spirit that's too close to us too close to me anyway and that's a spirit that we look down upon women women in the message have become doormats doormats they become second class they have women can't do nothing because they were an afterthought and that's a lie that's Complete lifee because Genesis 1:26-27 say that God made the woman then and he blessed them right period amen and the flesh part of the woman was God's plan it wasn't an thought it was completely God's plan and God made her in such a way that it was perfect to fulfill his plan he plan and if you look down upon a a woman and the bride your bride your wife or you consider them a second class in many places it it's just it's just a non-spoken kind of am man I I know I'm going I'm going out the Lim here but I'm not looking for popularity amen if you do that you're actually making your spiritual life second class to Christ amen God help us and and and and not only that you're actually looking down upon God's actually original plan see God couldn't be how could you be a husband without a woman how could you be a provider without a woman am man you think of all these naturual things but how could God even be God a woman because God's an object of worship and he wanted to be a Healer and a savior and all these things and if it had been for the creation of a woman God would have never been able to achieve the attributes that were locked that's right in [Music] him wow now you know we know in the Old Testament that Moses wrote the New Testament mostly and the Old Testament is law it's just I don't type of everything in the New Testament and we're not throwing that away and and sometimes we will look on of course there's much we can learn from that as types and shadows but we but but Paul wrote the New Testament and Paul brought grace and mercy and see let me let me just fast forward to this brother brother R said 73 times I'm not talking about you [Music] sisters see there's sisters n wom and brother Brown said he said he said when you looking tonight he said he said I'm a known woman hater and you have to when you think deep and you see you know he talked about doctors and if you go to a doctor and you're you're dying and they just give you a pill just just go home here here's an ad takeing ad think I'm musle relaxing no go to a therapist what's my real problem and we see this and all these things see you you got to get to the real problem brother brown right the truth I'm I'm not taking nothing away with brother Brown taking but when brother Brown ministered the the truth the emphasis and what he took was in the wrong place much of the time brother Brown said the reason I have the thoughts that I have for women is because when I was a little boy and my dad was a boat lagger he said I seen young women come in not sisters watch me young women come in with married men and be drunk together and and I have a Thal memorize V and he said they would give the young women coffee to make them sober enough to go home and cook supper for their husband but he said I'm not talking about you young women you young sisters yeah yeah that's right and see let's just turned here to lay a foundation I I feel like I'm losing some of you 2 Corinthians 5:17 he said therefore If any man be in Christ that's man or woman man or woman being Christ he is a new creature and the old things have completely passed away and behold all things are brand new yeah and all things are of God including the bride who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation Hallelujah let me just read some quotes that the prophet said here he said but I ain't talk I ain't saying that to you sisters because you all don't don't do that but I'm talking about the women of the word he said here in an uncertain sound in these are both in the 60s he said now silly women now he said that isn't talking to you sisters you know the Bible says you know the difference between a brother and a sister is position yeah and there's one thing that a sister couldn't do in the Bible yes and I was Minister for observe Authority on the word over a Brother Do you know praying a sister praying over the church or a brother is not observing authority over a brother that's right that's actually observing authority over God you know multiple times the go in brother Brown's Ministry I'm going to read him to to Anchor my Foundation that God spoke to a sister and said pray for a need and I won't use the prophet I'll use a sister or a mother and God will heal it and everybody was shocked including the prophet you know I never liked as a kid in M Elementary School I never liked a bully putting down anybody I just that's just disgusting to me it's disgusting to me if I Trav or that you know I go to Le I eat with the kids who's who makes us one Statue higher than somebody else but ourselves we got a low ego Jesus you can't be a sister and a sister can't be you but Christ died equally for both it was exactly the same Calvary it was exactly the same blood and we'll be brothers and sisters in glory they're not going to have a separate spot they're not going to sit at the back of Heaven the Bible talks about that and and and then the message that Christ and the bride were completely one he said in the Masterpiece family that they had to be a completely one being so how could you downgrade one like I don't think less my foot than I do my ear yeah yeah but so many places and I know we can have you know different cultures and different things but we've almost made women second class or property in the ranks of Christianity and that's that's never was God's plan if you if you if you think that answer me this question do you feel that way with Christ do you feel like Christ made you second property to himself do you feel feel like that when he gave you the checkbook that you could sign anything away in the promises of God you feel that way when you think of all the the promises that even in the message in our Prophet C that everything is ours if you just think you feel second class not like believe me this is not an issue here but it's around the world you know you know there's two people in the Bible that I I I found that actually you know and I'm I'm not preaching on this but I'm just mentioning this how how these Spirits rise up and they're man-made Spirits in closed and they're not of God do you know David paid 1004 skins I believe it was for his wife from Saul do you know why he paid that because Saul hated David and he wanted David to get killed by himself so God's hatred that was never God's plan Jacob worked two years seven years for his life and then worked another seven CU he got the sisters so if we were going to follow Jacob are we going to have multiple wives That's exactly the same scripture if I could get a wife for seven years I could have two someone would say that that Jesus Paid the price for his pride he paid it to himself who did Jesus send the price to to pay for the Redemption of us because the scriptures say that it was God's Own requirement for Redemption he didn't pay that to Satan that was God's law God had to obey his own law so God paid his own BT that's right God help us God help us amen 57 times he said you sisters he said seven times he said the best thing that God can give a man is something that Satan created really I don't think so in fact I know so the best thing outside of Salvation was a bride man our Prophet was talking about the spare that could get on a woman but you see in second Corinthians this ain't an issue in the bride of Christ yeah because they passed from Death onto life it's a new life and so there's there's no there's not even there's it's it's farther than the East is from the West with the Holy Ghost filed sister she could never be a jezebel never that's right see in Romans 8 it says 32 it says he's already glorified you those he called he PR he likeed he's already called glorified Hallelujah just look at some thoughts that our Prophet said here in marage in Dev ours he said I'm talking about in Marrow now not you sisters but we almost do a carry over let's talk about the sister that was in brother Brown's prayer meetings and die told the sister true to go pray for the woman that had a prayer Pray that was going to go through the prayer L with a sick baby you all know the story she prayed for the baby she got up and gave the mother her seat down close to brother Brown the prophet and she went up in the bleachers in about the fourth row the mother came up she was like 10th or 11 W in line the prayer line and the prophet just started to pray for he oh he said oh that baby's already healed God's already used somebody amen you know I mean ask question when's the last time that you were in a message church and there was an altar call and the minister asked the sisters to come and pray brother Brown did yeah the sisters come pray for the sisters because sisters would know and understand what a sister was at the altar pray for amen oh but bless God bless God that's a brother you got more you tell me the other Prophet was wrong no no he was wrong yeah it was just a spirit of EV and domination yeah this is true our Prophet had off CL with sisters up and he said now you sisters back there you come up and pray for these sisters as in a church the sister pray in ch brother went to pray for the baby and he said oh sister your baby's already been healed she said I see another sister where God laid it on her heart to pray for the sister do you know that sister refused to pray for the baby was tormented in herself and that because she never felt worthy she felt she was second class to the prophet was it God that it was man that it wasn't God it was God tell her to pray for he said I see you sister up in the bleachers up in the the for and he said you could pray for that baby way more than me because you have a mother's heart wow amen God help us he said here now here's the prophet talking I have a couple quotes he's talking about and now and you know I have some daughters St married don't you dare ever ever the Bible's very clear with it when Israel did it he never ever forgave him we never ever are unal yoke together in unbelief ever he said now watch this this is a prophet now I want you to notice that he's not talking about the woman he said a man without the Holy Ghost is a worse than a beast and is one of the only creatures that will take a baby from its mother's arms and throw it in the corner and R the woman wow you sisters that aren't married you want to make sure one thing don't worry if the guy can do nothing but make sure he's got the Holy Ghost you make sure that yeah better you start to death than he not have the Holy Ghost I mean the second thing would be make sure he's got some kind of get up and go but yeah but make sure he's got the you want to pray right through on that part like there's no maybe some show don't look around for around call us just look around for the pure good old fashion ho Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah God help us amen we know we know he goes into that quote in marriage and divorce he talks about American and and it's a A Woman's World we know that we understand that we understand that they worship the woman we understand that yeah but you know our Prophet also told us that he said don't show me a com you know I'm not concerned about what you know and I even makes me throw up to say it but like believe the sign or all these evil things I could care less about what's going I've never ever that if a minister come up here I rebuke him and I did it I don't want to hear about garbage so why we concentrate on garbage that's right that's right there's not one sister in here that acts like a worldly sister so why would we cram that down their throat you know I've had sisters that are here from another country and it ain't Africa tell my wife she said we're so sick of all the ministers do is preach us sisters down and they never ever say this Brothers do anything [Music] wrong and I'll just let you know they were there were Pastor daughters and they left their dad's and this message Brothers can sin just like daughters can amen we I understand perfectly when Adam and Eve were made she was made second I understand she was made so she could fall I want to tell you what she could have never fell if she had the Holy Ghost it's not possible I have quotes for that God knew that the first Eve would fall and I have multiple quotes here the second eeve will never fall it's because predestination it's because she came from God God would have to fall down she's a part of God see what I'm [Music] saying and we need to kill that that evil thing that we're going to you know what I'm saying yeah now I'm not we we know we're in different positions don't you know the Bible says for a minister when he's ministering to be a man of one wife that's pretty clear so that means the wife ain't to heaven the wife ain't going to have a wife so she won't be ministering amen look here in the mysteries of God revealed and then I'm going to read some Masterpiece quotes here he says put God into his body and Christ and and and Christ in the body was the bride and he said it brings the bride out and it won't fall to denominational creats no sir she said she's coming back to the pure on adulterated word of God being manifest and he said in and in 14 115 4:15 sorry she was the second Eve and she's not breaking I just this our prophet in mystery of God revealed 63 and the second Eve she's not breaking or sping her skirts in Purity and Holiness to her husband she'll stay with the word regard of what anybody says and you can have that uh move that you want and all the you can have all the elegant moves you want and all the Affliction she's not moving the reason she's not moving is because she's predestinated and got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's because of First Corinthians because she's been made a new creature amen so we see the difference in the old Testament and in the New Testament was when the perfect Adam came there was a perfect sacrifice and so in the in the in the garden we were dealing with a nonperfect sacrifice which wouldn't hold the bride Hallelujah and Masterpiece and this was I listened to this last night it's just tremendous it goes and goes he said from the perfe per perfected seed that died there and came back in the perfected seed in the second Adam talking about Christ and he said now it has become the true bride again back to the original word again Hallelujah and he he says here just dropping a couple paragraphs he said The Great Masterpiece family the second Adam Christ and the second Eve now already in the garden the Millennium amen back on Earth Hallelujah he took time as all through the millions of years to form the first perfect couple Adam and Eve and they fell and now it's been through thousands of years that he's molded the second Adam the second bride the second Eve again and now they are ready the Masterpiece has come and stuck down from it struck down from his side is help me Christ help me his hands amen the bride of Christ is Christ's hands on Earth his help man just like in the natur your wife is your help me you can read that in Ephesians 5 amen but here here is we have a purpose and a and a and a mold in God Amen God never looked on us like like we have our own man made Creeds and dogmas we have our our cultures could be of Satan am they are of Satan that they're putting down God's creation y God help us the Great Masterpiece family the second Adam the second Eve now already he repeats Us in just a couple paragraphs already in the garden of Millennium amen back to Earth again he's totally repeating it again the great Splendor that they left took them he said now notice this family it's husband and wife cannot truly be a family unless they are one unless they are one and now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam Christ the second Eve already returned back to their home oh the full picture of redemption it brings it back exactly to the beginning Hallelujah God help us God help us it's so easy to get caught in a religious spirit geds and darkas and and and cultures you know let's just go to Ephesians there and read that scripture and uh actually if you don't mind let's go to Genesis 2:18 First Genesis 18:2 first sorry and the Lord said and the Lord God said I I want you to to recognize this in my Bible it's got Lord capitalized before God and the Lord God said it is not good for man should dwell be alone and I will make him a help me for him and then if we drop to verse 24 and therefore shall the man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one person amen let's go to Ephesians 5 and I'd like to read that through the 33 I may I just uh you know we we we angle so much on this but if we we get the whole picture of what God's saying here you know in the end of this he says you know men ought to love their wives as themselves and he says no man this is God no man has ever hated his own flesh what he's saying there is no man has ever put down his own flesh cuz to hate is to push away to put down Christ number did that to us his pride and you'll notice when he searches in Ephesians 5:21 he first makes the men submit and wife to each other but we could concentrate on just the wife being submissive to the husband yes that's true but before he even starts that he's got you being submissive to your wife wow eans 5 and 21 let's just read that submitting yourselves one another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves to your own husband says unto the Lord for the husband hband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and the savior of the body now there you go is a perfect scripture for any sisters that aren't married you don't want a beast to be your head no you don't want actually let me rephrase that you don't want worse than a beast to be your head worse than a beast cuz you know most Beast won't grab the babies and kill them to rabbish the mother most most won't but a man will make sure you got the Holy Ghost in that man and yes that that that husband will be your head but his head is Christ and you can go right to the top amen amen therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything you see Christ is ahead of here it has you know God uses the ministry for their hands it's his hands that's right I'm speaking with my hands but it has nothing to do with Brother D AB if it does you should run for your life because it's Christ that's right it's all Christ it's everything to do with Christ you see how perfect this picture is in places you know we're not beat down but we just recognize that he's our head he's our everything am Hallelujah husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and they died for her he gave everything for me and you thank you Jesus that's a long race putting down that he might s sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of the water of the word that he might present himself a glorious church now I want you to show you this you know when God's presenting himself a glorious Church it has a bride in it that he might all those other ones were substitute that if they happen then God can have a glorious church not having sput rank no such thing that it should be holy Without Blame so ought men now he repeats this again he's not talking to the wies no more so ought men to love their wives as their own body and he that loveth them loveth his wife loveth himself now I'm afraid that there's some brothers in the world or even in this message that don't love themselves I'm convinced of that because get me [Music] do hurry up amen Jesus amen for man ought to for man for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but narish it and cherish them even if the Lord does the bride the church wow now this is the third time he's saying this sorry no sorry I just got a double for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that's that's considering the male and The Feminine Spirit together that's right back to Genesis 1 26 let us make man and The Feminine part were together Hallelujah for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones and for this cause shall a man leave his mother and father and shall join to his wife and they shall be one one flesh and this is the part we want to get to this is a mystery it's a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church you know as much as it would be wrong for a a sister to minister amen it would be just as wrong for a brother to try to minister to his wife without Christ being his head correct the exact same all done just as it would be wrong for me to share you my thoughts and ideas this morning it would be just as wrong for you individual husbands to share your own thoughts and ideas to your wife cuz you're not your own it's like the brother that came to die when brother BR was dying and it was early in his ministry and brother BR was there and he was he he literally died in a few years and a few hours and brother Brown came to him and he said now what he said tell me everything what's in like to crossing over so what's it like to die oh brother Brown oh brother die yeah so you can't have two husbands at the same time you can't be a jezebel and a holy ghost will person there might be some trying they're they're very easy to spot there you see them coming around the curb 100 miles away if you have any discern the Holy Ghost so what the whole thought is is Christ is telling you this morning you don't need to beat up on yourself as spiritually as the bride Christ never beat up on us amen we don't need to beat up on the sisters that I got the Holy Ghost yeah amen positionally placed for harose I speak concerning this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife even as himself that is the third time and the exact same chapter the that God tells the man to take care of the sister in love third time he thought we were dyslexic or didn't get it the first time that's not a joke that makes it an important part y y love his own wife as even as himself for the wife should reverence the heaven her husband just like we would reverence and respect our Lord Jesus amen amen amen oh it's it's beautiful amen we don't ever want to to do what God didn't expect us to do I want I want to show you another scripture CU I still feel like I'm losing some of you let me show you an example in Exodus book here's a god- calleded prophet that's the head dog on earth he was God to Pharaoh now you don't get a lot higher than that yeah God told him himself that and the scriptures say that God desired and sought to kill that's right kill them and our Prophet said Hallelujah brother that God spoke to his wife what how could that be she's the weaker vessel like she was oh my goodness God will never deal through a sister if he hadn't dealt through Moses wife God would have her killed amen the man that's right that that's like a long time Ked means you would have been yeah here I'm just seeing where I want to start read let let me just start in uh 22 here here's God given the purpose for Moses Exodus 4:22 and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus sayith the Lord that Israel is my son even my firstborn and the next verse and I say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy firstborn now here's Moses saying this to the enemy and watch what happens in the next verse and it came to pass that by the way in the end that the Lord met him and S this is you see that there and S to kill him I I got that's very confusing to me how could God have a chosen man and want to kill him and God the exact same God would work through his wife let's say brother to save his neck and his and then in verse 25 and then his wife how do you say your name Sabor sabora took a sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin of the Sun and cast it at the feet and said surely a bloody husband Thou Art to me so let him go and then she said a bloody husband Thou Art because of the circumcision here's what the prophet said in questions and answers he said and God would have took Moses life but perhaps the angel was standing there and said to his wife Sora do it [Applause] quick I'm here to kill him there was one person on the earth that could save Moses life and it was a foot down sister W what prop the angel the the angel was there to kill Moses yeah and said to his wife do catch it quickly that's right catch it that's exactly what he says catch it quickly and zabor went and circumcised the baby and said to Moses our so concerned about everything about your journey that your own Boy hasn't been circumcised wow wow see God actually uses sisters just like he uses us spiritually all together it's his Bri amen see in Revelations it said the wife the spirit and the wife say come the wife has made herself ready she's become the hand and she's let the word dress her she become the hands and now she's dictating with the spirit come on yeah hallelujah amen God help us but to mention here this going by the quote of the sister that prayed for the the baby you know that story very well she asked literally asked the sister for permission because she so feels out of place because she's asking to pray I want to ask you a question of this show me one place in the Bible where God said for a sister not to pray anywhere yeah for anybody yeah in any circumstances our Prophet said very much exact opposite he said you don't need to come to me to pray and you don't need to come to your pastor even to pray your little ones your child or your wife could pray amen I have another example here we know the story of brother brandham and his life where he was flying the airplane and God brought the airplane down that wasn't a Brother's prayer that brought that airplane down I'll just tell you something this may shock you but I ain't got a testimony that good I've never prayed once that I know that an airplane can down but this is recorded multiple times late in their prophet's Ministry laid in his ministry and this is what he says when he goes there you know you know the story she calls him Parson and she was standing there and God had spoke to her and said I'll send a Parson by a minister by why did God speak to her because God never considered her second class and this is what our Prophet said in that he said they came in the house and the whole purpose in the Minister coming was a brother to pray for her boy correct brother R said sister you pray first who when was the last time you heard a minister say that sister you pray first and your Prophet said this said instant you could tell that's right that she had got to God and instantly you could tell that she had a relationship with the father a sister instantly instantly she also noticed that she had on unconditional love regardless of how black her son was her son had lived a very dirty sexual life and had a sexual disease and was dying and actually in the flesh deserved to die if you were looking at it just naturally she said regardless of anything anything that's my Bo period period wow you know the story multiple times Auntie you pray first wow you know the boy brother Brown was in the area years later and and the boy come up to him you know that part and recognize him and said I'm the boy that you prayed for and it was because a mother but a sister had prayed y amen y that's right I believe just as much as it's wrong for a denominational a denominational ride you know the prophet said different places you know you got to you got to study them the the theme of how he's bringing the message you know the prophet said that the first Eve fell in the garden but the second Eve would never fall that's you and me that's that that's the predestinated Bride of CHR but he so multiple times that the second Eve did fall but it was the denominational was he said the first one fell in the garden and the other one fell in Rome taking the laws of men and the Creeds of men but the real bride should never fall because she's predestined amazing grace Amazing Amazing Grace amen we we need to really watch that we don't put in our own thoughts amen you know as a minister ministers don't put in any of you just Minister watch watch what God has and then we don't need to add to what God's put there let's just take it straight from him amen and we see so many amazing parts of this let me just read another one here he said what all through it the scriptures that was God's purpose what was God's purpose it was to have a bride yeah you see you know we can you see what I'm saying don't we don't we don't need to concentrate on on a on a worldly Spirit we don't need to concentrate on the ones that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that's not even only God can give them that Holy Ghost well let me let me give you this if we're if we're ministering to the bride that's got a worldly Spirit on them and they're and they're living in sin you preach all you want won't do it look it good if God don't pull them or no man come to the father man or woman let God draw them first that's right so we don't need to beat up the sisters that are already in the one quote already ready for the Millennium already in one because we're comparing them equal do a j never it couldn't happen couldn't fall not with the Holy Ghost watch what he says here that he might Rec himself himself a body a bride which was Eve the second Eve I back himself the same thing that he did with Adam and Eve given a type that they were Christ in the bride the same as Christ in the bride now the second Adam the perfect sacrifice amen the perfect sacrifice The Perfect Bride he said but God had a purpose and he hid it from the wise and prudent and he revealed it on the predestinated babes that would Le predestiny things God help us God help us I want to close with just one more story from our Prophet talks about this and and I just enjoyed studying this and and you know when you look into God's word it just goes on and on and on it was just amazing and you know the [Music] story but it was about howy R and do you know howy right that wasn't her name I didn't know that I part was but the right part was I can't even say her last name is Mos i e r and hadidi had just lost her husband in a farm m and the Very sons that were going wild one of them was the one that found his dead crushed under the tra I didn't know that it's all in the new ministry 59 in my new ministry and that's why those boys were so Disturbed cuz they just seen their dad the one for sure mangled like spaghetti under the tractor you know the story about brother Brandon and he was talking about that favorite song I like he's a same God that spoke to the woman at the well and he was saying he said you know this God that we serve is the same God that provided Abraham and he provided him a sacrifice when there was no sacrifice and he said he's not one spe different than provided and I want I want to just also throw this in here it was so so so real brother Brown's life because her husband had been smushed him and brother Woods had been in the forest and they had shot two rabbits for the family the because starvation was real in the states and that's how this testimony starts up with him rabbit and this what he says here I want to show you where he says just a minute it says sister how WR he said you all know he said we call her right but her name is and I told you what her name is it it wasn't even her she said a really loyal person funny that was even ear his boy had found him under ATT tractor smashed to death and the little boy had a break down something happened and they were staying with his mother the uncle because the kids were like well losing their mind amen and here's a sister that's not out of her place not deserving of just living life in the country it's it's a four-page quote just goes into it and he talks about the prophet's talking about he said you know it's exact same God that provided for Abraham the exact same God that could provide for hey right he's talking about food Earthly food he's talking about providing squirrels so they could shoot squirrels and how youbody sitting back there listening to that they just shot the rabbits they said they skinned them and were cooking them for them to eat there you can read this in the quote he said he's just as much as Jehovah Gyra today as he was back then Abraham and you know we Minister that year he's exactly the same God if he ain't exactly the same he's no God at us right he's exactly if you have a need here this morning you could just speak on it you're you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to ask for permission it's already yours it's already yours you just got to take Lord I'm taking it thank you very much there's this much less in the bank but there won't be that much less his bank account Works different than mine you can do a big withdrawal and it just it just automatically straight back up yeah there's not even a speed bum and hady Ray was sitting back and she was listening to brother BR said I want to specify this she was listening to brother BR say that he's exactly the same Jehovah God that he was with Abraham exactly it wasn't a b something it wasn't focused on brother Brown brother Bram was saying if I needed squirrels just like you needed Abraham needed laugh he said we just say help me yeah and here's how you rap in a terrible situation and she said that's nothing but the truth she don't know how she's going to feed herself she don't know how she's going to feed the kids she's definitely going to drive that tractor and her kids are losing their money I didn't know all that brother Bram says this he said and a super anointing swept over me she all she said was that's nothing but the truth said a super anointing swep over me and you know the story I'm trying to show you that message because God worked through sisters God worked through sisters and sisters to God w't second class sisters told God told sisters one thing don't handle the word over a brother don't Minister the word over brother just one spot that's a different position and that's it but we in our cultures and thoughts whether you want to believe it or not have not made women a part of except running the vacuum no no they should have Minister do you know I I'm going to tell you some plain language I had people on Facebook that I unfriended and blocked because they were playing rude to me because sometimes sisters came up and sang a special behind this B and I said I don't need you in my life that's right a special I had people tell me that was wrong for a sister that's testify it's wrong to give glory to God wow huh sounds like a dictatorship to me yeah sounds like a dictatorship to me and your pro I can it w't be hard the you sisters come on up pray for all the sisters brothers pray for their brothers you sisters you pray first and I'll pray oh could really pray that's what your Prophet said when the last time youve heard any man of God say a sister could really pray in the presence your prophet you know if we were going to you see we don't want to bring in man's greed amen we don't want to bring we don't be making women property we'll buy our bride depending on how wealthy I am and how good looking I am I'll get four cows 10 cows that's disgusting that's that's that's that's a that's an African Creed but it's of the devil I'll stand here and say it and I'll tell it right to their face it's up the devil it was polygamy now today my multiple wives you know what God told Moses it wasn't so in the beginning I want me to tell you something else let's go back to our Prophet let's use him for an example I read the story of him asking for his first wife and when he when his first wife died and he married the second wife brother Bram tried run from her and and dwell with other women CU he was afraid to marry her and God told her to marry God the go that's that's the top Dove when brother B asked for his wife he was so nervous and so young he could not speak the words you know this and her dad never said I'll take 10 cups brother Brown couldn't even ask and I'm not making he said all you can have her belly you can have her belly now if our if we wanted to have a modernday example of paying for a bride the s a prophet he never paid for either one of his Brides you read everything else he says except that part am try help us amen you know the story you know hady Wright was so so had Wright never had no intent no of anything no intent so WR didn't even understand the question or the or the Commandment or or she didn't even understand the prophet when he said you can ask for whatever you want she she don't it says it here and he said he said brother had he said to me brother what do you even mean I don't even know why you're talking about that's what you call innocent Blind Faith yeah amen there's no pre- agendas she never had a schedule she was still mouring her husband trying to figure out what her own family that the prophet said unto you he said you can ask anything that your heart desires remember this was a sister not a brother sister anything your heart desires and it shall produce right here and that you'll know that the Lord God in heaven answers the scriptures are true and they said the first thing I knew first time the new gift he said this was a new gift it was this new ministry the messages this is the new anointing and he said I could hard I could hardly hear her she looked around and she was talking about her little crippled sister I said he said you know I said no doubt in my heart it's in a few minutes that she'll be jumping if you want to heal your crippled sister and how he looked around again and he said Billy the greatest desire I have is salvation of my souls and he said there he said you could have asked for anything greater he said if she would asked for $10,000 she would have had it but he said God what I'm going to close with this see God in heaven God known what she would ask yeah that's right God know God know what you ask for us today amen the Bible also says and we could have went on for just too long but you know the Bible says that if you mistreated a sister or your wife I'm just paraphrasing this believe it's in James that God would block your prayers that's what God thinks of sisters but I just wonder if the spirit of around all the environment if we didn't take what the prophet said and just put the emphasis on the wrong spot see you have to remember this so now we're generally preaching to message Believers that are Holy Ghost filled but the prophet was generally featured to a mixed and he was dealing with a lot of the fall of Holiness and and The Jezebel spirit coming in where they cut their hair he said every time I come back this you're much worse yeah and people were that's when they let the bars down the goats come in the church and he was dealing so he would say things but we're not dealing with that no that's right yeah we're not dealing with thaten God help us just God help us see that you just go back to Ephesians 1 if we want to see that you submit yourself respect one another treat each other like craist human you know the prophet said this and I'm just paraphrasing in my study he said your wife or your daughter dad's and husbands you need to listen up she was God's Property a long time before she was your that's how he says it says your wife and your dos came from The Presence of Jehovah God and you mis touch it and vengeance is mine God would have killed Moses yeah except for his wife God help us to to to have the right proper life love bre I'm not talking about being other place I'm just saying it's beautiful it's just beautiful it's just amen but let's not put something there that ain't there let's not put something there that our Prophet never put there he's a great example Perfect Balance Perfect Balance you you could just go on and go on and go on he said it was my mom when his mom died he said it was my mom that held the family together not the dad the mom there's a prophet that knew God but he knew knew the balance he knew the prophet Prophet knew the value of a sister her prayer at the altar for L praying for the sick you knew the value a prophet die do we help Jesus help me Hallelujah am I to close with another scriptures just ripping me apart the New Testament talks about respects the pars and there is talking about money but respects is G if it showed respects the different categories of people that you were a sinner and guilty of the whole that's pretty plain English and remember that sister Christ died for her she came from Christ and she has a purpose beautiful in Christ God was making a bride for his son Jesus Christ Hallelujah God help us God help us to be in his let what you for I this road my [Music] heart joy and by [Music] me when Mery [Music] my [Music] Mercy Mery my
