them for for many years and what what they are today is what they've always been they are servants they have heart for people people brother Ben is more than just a preacher when you hear brother Ben and when you see brother Ben or sister Britney you you can feel the love in their heart and their genuine pastors and it's just an honor to have brother Ben put here with us to to minister to us today and I say let's let's just pull on the gift of God I have always been blessed uh through the ministry of brother Ben PR and so I I I count it a very high privilege uh to have him here this is going to be brother Ben's first time ministering in our new building and um uh so I I I I I tell you what we've never had a a a finer man behind this pull pit it in the in the 34 years of uh being here in pawy and so uh I just want to give him a a little Little Flower here and and let him know how much I appreciate him and let you know how much I appreciate him I appreciate this wonderful man of God let's stand to our feet amen get ready for the word of the Lord I I I I I don't I don't think it's wrong to to uh uh appreciate men of God they get enough criticism as it is that's right and U and so if I respect somebody I think I think sometimes it's good to let him know and so now he might have a hard time coming out and preaching after me bragging on him but amen uh but we appreciate him amen God bless brother Ben why don't we just sing Come Holy Spirit Come Holy Spirit I need [Music] thee come sweet [Music] spirit I pray come in thy [Music] strength won't you come in thine own special way all

bow our heads together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be here today thankful for your presence that we feel here already we thank you for the songs that have been sung Lord we know that you're with us because you promised that you would be you've never failed us yet Lord many times we failed to do our part but you've never failed on your part oh God and I'm so thankful for that today Lord I I pray that you would just move Lord over the congregation this morning Lord I I just want to be a hurt or a help rather to your people not to be a hurt or not to bring down lord but to build up I pray you'd Grant it today hold my lips Lord to only say those things that that you'd have me to say and only do those things that you'd have me to do Lord I'm your servant today move me out of the way and speak the this morning Lord I Thank you for this church Lord and the pastor and Lord the the officers of the church I pray you'd bless them Lord give them strength to continue to do the work of the Lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor Lord if there's one here that doesn't know you Lord like they should I pray you'd rekindle a fire lord within them today I pray Lord if there's one that's sick that you'd heal them today we believe Lord that by your stripes we are healed give them the faith to believe it Lord and we're trusting you for it and believing it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen we love the Lord this morning isn't he good to us amen turn with me if you would to job Book of Job and we'll read uh chapter 29 we'll start in verse one I while you're turning there I want to say how much I appreciate brother Wendell I I I can't build a man up like brother Wendell can but but we sure do appreciate your pastor and and he's been such a blessing to us he's been an elder to me in many ways over the years and so we're thankful for him and and for the church here and uh I'm so glad to see you uh still fighting the battle after all of these years and my mind goes back to the old church and and uh when we were there and and how the Lord has blessed you so much and I just pray continue to bless you I know that he will we're in his hand today and that's enough he knows what we're going through and that's enough do you believe that today you really believe he knows what you're going through he knows about you he he can see everything and he knows every twist in the road going forward amen so we believe that today Job chapter 29 and verse one say moreover job continued in his Parable and said oh that I were as in months past as in the days when God preserved me when his candle shined upon my head when by his light I walked through Darkness as I was in the days of my youth when the secret of God was upon my Tabernacle when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me when I washed my steps with butter and The Rock poured Me Out Rivers of oil then I want to go to the end of the Bible Jude chapter 3 or Jude verse three right before the Book of Revelation Jude verse3 it's a very common scripture says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints amen I pray the Lord would add a blessing to the word you may be seated this morning there's something alluring about the past there's something about yesterday that uh seems golden to us it seems like that it's a a time or a place that was better and I think we can all remember better days I I think no matter who we are how good things are right now you can look back and maybe through rose-colored glasses or perhaps looking at U things the way you wish they that they were instead of how they actually were but you remember things in days that were better and times that were uh more uh the way you wanted things and it seems like everything was in order and everything was appropriate and everything was going just like you wanted it to go and and yet we realize that the Bible tells us in Psalms 37:23 that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way the steps of a good man and you say well brother Ben I'm not a very good man or I'm not a very good person but I'll I'll say this you've been made good by the blood of Jesus Christ he he has changed you he saved you and I trust that's the case with you today and so you can say my steps have been ordered of the Lord the the routes that I've taken the places I've been the things that I went through the struggles that I had everything about me it's been ordered by God how many can say Amen to that today God saw it before I could see it and he led me down that path the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way oh the Lord knows what you're going through what you're about to go through and he knows what's best for you the Bible tells us all things work together for the good to them that are called according to the purpose of God to God so we can't just look at what has been but look at today as a this has to be a better day because it's the day God has led us to it's the best that we can be for today now I want to title this this morning going back to our future going back to our future now brother brandom talks about going back he said now if we looked around tonight he said we' go back to some of these great churches all the way down through the age and say this is it or this is it he said if you don't watch we'll be walking in a glare in instead of a light so he says we're going back to something but if we're not careful all we're seeing is a glare we're we're getting a what we're seeing is a mirage we're not actually seeing or walking in the light he said we're looking at something that passed years past looking back and he types it to someone driving down the road looking in the rearview mirror if you look only in your rearview mirror you can't see what's out in front of you and you're not headed backwards you're headed forwards you in life you can't go back you've got to go forward you're going to get older whether you like it or not amen the time is going to progress whether we like it or not we're going to be but you know what we are we're one day closer to the Rapture we're one day closer to going home one day closer to being together where we can express ourselves The Way We Were Meant to express ourselves one day closer to worship together one day closer where we don't have to look only in the memory but people people get caught up in that and and I understand it because there there's something special about memory but brother brandham tells us he said look forward look where you're going to and I want to say this you know usually when when I preach a sermon out I I'll preach somewhere I'll preach something I've preached back at home but this morning the lord gave this to me this week and so I haven't had an opportunity to preach it and I I just thought about us as a as a group this morning not thinking about anybody else but those of you that are sitting here let's not look back let's not look at what yesterday was let's look forward there's a future for you there's a there's a present to live in there's a time that you're living in right now that God wants to do something for you God wants to move in your life brother B says look forward look where you're going to look where you're going not where you came from all right so yesterday being in the past and today being the only living time now brother bam taught us that every age wrecked as it looked as its focus became on its rear view mirror every age wrecked traveling down the road he talked about Luther he said the Lutheran wrecked up he said because they wanted to stay with what Luther had and they couldn't move on he said the wesle went down that road and they got so far into sanctification but then they wrecked and the Pentecostals did the same thing they went down that road and then they wrecked cuz they couldn't get past 1906 and they couldn't see what God was doing in a prophet in our day amen and so what what happened is they they actually wrecked they actually C went off the road but there's going to be a bride who doesn't wreck up there's got to be a people who don't fall there's got to be a bride that doesn't do that by the window it's got to be somebody brother Miguel that that goes forward somebody that walks up instead of going down there's there's a group that goes down but there's a group who goes up and I want to tell you this morning I'm part of that group that goes up I'm a part of those that are called to go higher not to go backwards so so I don't want to just dwell on yesterday I want to see what God has for me today what does he have for me in the future amen amen so we don't want to wreck up on the road so we look forward brother B said we're commanded to look forward keep going on he says this he said their prophecy happened in their days this happens in this day and the next happens in the next day day that's pretty simple but it's good their prophecy happened in their days this happens in this day and the next happens in the next day he said it's allotted out to the end time and there's things that's supposed to be going on now okay and you remember if we could focus our attention you know we we're looking forward we're looking back and we're looking back at last night what a wonderful time we had in the bank we're looking forward to a youth camp coming up and and I'm looking forward to that too we're looking forward to something else happening but could we focus just for a moment on this Services what this service what would our services be like if we could look at the moment and say God I believe you've got something for this day you've laed out to the end of time you've laed out blessings you've laed out Deliverance all of these things and you've got something for this service this morning something for me he said there's things that's supposed to be going on right now he said according to the scripture the Holy Spirit on Earth poured out upon the people I say That's supposed to be going on on Sunday morning and Sunday night and Wednesday night that's what we're called for that's the thing that's supposed to be going on right now so though we see a Rapture in our future we see a we see deliverances and things in our past but we must recognize where we're at today now there are some things that I have no desire go back to we talk about the good old days but I don't know if anybody ever remember didn't you know that 1956 Chevy that's a wonderful thing I we have a man in our church brother Harold Bailey he's a wonderful man he just had his 80th birthday and he drove his Model A or Model T Ford to his 80th birthday party and it was it's a it's a beautiful car but he did it on a day when it was about 10 degrees outside and that thing has no heat I'm driving up there in our Expedition thanking God for modern technology yeah right because as good as the good old days were I got a car that's got heated seats not just heat I thank God for that right I mean it's it's something good and and science has progressed in that way I I don't have any desire you know I like to ride in a horse and Bug eat when it's convenient right but but you don't want to ride in a horse and buggy all the time you imagine when you'd had to start for church if you were riding in a horse and buggy this morning some of yall would had to start last week right it take you a while to get to church in a horse and buggy I I like my heated and cooled seats I I enjoy the conveniences of life and and yet we realize some of those things are detrimental and yet yet we we still use them I I don't want to buy encyclopedias no more right you remember when they sold the whole set and I remember when I was a kid wanting the whole set of the funkin wax or whatever they were bratanic encyclopedia you know you had the whole set and and I thought man if I could only get my hands on those i' boy I'd know everything and I always love to read and then the internet come along and you just got Google on your phone and as I said last night you can't really trust it because uh they'll just put anything on there in any order but yet you've got the information and I don't want to buy encyclopedias no more uh science has advanced and I believe God's bride has advanced as well that we're moving forward am and brother brandom talks about that in in countdown and he says he said being that science has advanced to the space that they have to get an astronaut he said then the church has advanced he said you notice each time it gets smaller come on it takes less to operating come on okay right so if you took your phone I don't have one with me but I've got this iPad now if you take this iPad it's got a little bitty tiny miniature chip in it and what they did for years and years you I don't know if you remember the old bag phones my Grandma had one in her van and some of y'all had some didn't you and and those things you had a great big bag and you take it out like a regular phone and you could call only people who had one and and it cost a lot of money my grandma I don't think she ever used hers because it cost so much money to call and she just had it it was a status symbol and but science has advanced by becoming smaller and we're always looking for advancement by becoming bigger okay now think about it bigger churches bigger more people bigger this and that and I think we ought to do what we can but that's not always advancement sometimes advancement is actually becoming smaller but within that within that miniaturization there's something more much more powerful than what there was in the great big computer if you go back to the 60s you find a computer would nearly fill this room and wouldn't have the power of what's on your phone today what's happening science is going down into miniaturization and the bride is doing the same thing brother B says as it gets smaller it gets more powerful as it gets smaller it takes less to operate it because brother William each one of us is a Dynamo is a power and and we become more and more powerful ourselves there name may not be many in number there may not be thousands of people around this around even this area that believe what you believe but you're powerful in what you have it's been condensed down into a group that believes what God Said and believes something that's happening in their day and has happened in their day it's condensed down into a Powerhouse and brother B tells us God's stop building all these other things building powerhouses Hallelujah prise the Lord now just because something is smaller doesn't mean it's not as good and I want to tell you the the burden of my heart this morning I don't want to go back to an airplane age though it was better than a vehicle age and though it was better than a horse and buggy I don't want to go back to an airplane age all right I don't want to go back to a 1906 ausa Revival come on I don't want to go back to a 1980s charismatic Revival come on come on I don't want to go back to that I remember as a kid sitting around in in a room and everybody had a prophecy and everybody had a this that and the other but we got something so much better than that why would we go back to the partial when we have the real brother B said we had partial realization now we have complete realization we've got the fullness of the word why would we go back when we can go forward when we've got that plus Hallelujah brother bandam said that he talked about the Lutheran and the wlans he said then Along Came the Pentecostal Brethren they came back in their age of the restoration of the gifts restore back the gifts speaking in tongues the gifts of healing and things to the church and we believe in those things don't we all of those things but but we have that plus right plus now brother R said now they did just exactly what the scripture said they would do and when they did they manifested it he said that's exactly right that was the focus of their age right that that's what everything focused on was the tongues and the and the gifts of healing and the gifts to the church but that is the focus of a different age I hope you hear me today it's the focus we have those things but it's not our Focus right he said but did you realize we're moving on from that he said we are in he calls it the bride time the selecting time the time the bride they said we would have amen so we've got to recognize our day and I just want to I just want to deliver my heart this morning and I know brother Wendell and what he believes and I have the freedom to do this but I just want to tell you I don't want to go back to that but there is something I want to go back to I want to go I don't want to go back but I want to be restored back back before there was any there was a caner worm back before there was a Palmer worm back before I want to be restored back all the way yeah amen to True Pentecost now now brother Bron said the past 25 years Israel just recognized that they're in the Homeland for something oh my they're in the Homeland for something it was prophesied they'd have to be gathered again Hosea said so we read it a while ago God help us to understand it I wonder if you've recognized you're in the church for something God put you in py Oklahoma for something and it wasn't to always say no come on Church it wasn't to always drag your feet it wasn't to be a burden to the pastor but God put you in Pony for something and that something is to help out the Bride of Jesus Christ to be a help now God put you here for a reason God put Israel in their land for a reason he said God help us to understand he said at the same time the bride has recognized the evening light and then he said just begin to recognize just begin to recognize so am I he talked about an infant bride being on the church I believe today we recognize who we are I believe we reached that full realization where we recognize who we are if you haven't this morning Now's the Time to do it don't wait till tomorrow Now's the Time to stand up and say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I've been called to hire things I've been called to better things I've been called to to a place where all the promises lay where everything belongs to me and you've heard that preach many times now he said the world has recognized the Nations has recognized science has recognized the devil has recognized it's the time he can wreck women oh if we haven't seen that in our day yeah wreck the church we've seen that wreck the people right he's recognized it there's a lot of people it looks good there's a lot of emot but it's been wrecked it's living off the glare of another day yeah and he says if that he recognizes that there's a uh there is something he it's an opportunity for him to wreck the people he recognizes that opportunity I wonder if we recognize the opportunity we have with what we've been given yeah oh my yeah that's good he said God has recognized that there's a people on Earth that he PR destinated to life amen he recognized this is the time to send his message and he said he's did it he said the people has recognized it the bride time has realized the evening light oh yes he talks about Eve and Sarah and Mary those tree women he talks about the stalk the tossel and the shuck he said all that must dry up it's got to die he said and the seed cannot get ripe until the shuck stalk and leaves are all dry now think about it for it can't get ripe until it's all dry that's right it saps every bit of the life all the life that was in that giant that stalk that stood up so high all the life that was in the shuck all that life is sucked into a little bitty grain of wheat all of that life is in that little that little miniaturization that Powerhouse all the life every bit of the life are you with me now there's no life anywhere else yeah there's nothing else to go to we feel like Peter when he said to whom would we go no you alone have the words of Life all the life has been sucked out of Luther all the life was taken out of West all the life was taken out of Pentecost and all the life is in the bride this morning then whatever we have need of we have access to today all the Life Is Ours amen we should not listen this church should not back up to any devil should not back up to any situation should never say well we're not big enough or we're not powerful enough or we don't have enough money it should it should face every situation and say we believe we can do it why do we believe we can do it because God put us here for a reason we're here for a reason and that's to recognize our day and our hour everything else is dried up and all the life is in us I believe the church ought to be alive is that what you believe this morning the church ought to be on fire if all the life is here we ought to be more on fire today than we ever was and if we're not we need to go back and get that fire rekindled again in our life amen hallelujah amen oh my now brother Bram said it's it saps every bit of the life it's all it was is that plus that plus now it's seed time or bride time the shuts are dead a prophet declared it yes the Shucks are dried up but this is the Virgin word time not touched I love that he said it would not be manhandled oh my that's the way I feel this morning I've not been touched by another another another Doctrine or another religion I've not been manhandled by Creeds but I am a believer that has been touched by the message of the hour I'm somebody who's been touched by the groom not by anybody else amen you understand now B said if I taught you a Methodist message it'd take no effect on you know I'm going somewhere this morning so I felt like I just needed to kind of lay this in oey the Lord he said he said if Moses if I taught you a Methodist message it'd take no effect on you this is bride time if Moses taught the message of Noah would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect he said denominational ages are dead and dry listen the bride will not be formed I want you to understand this the bride this bride will not not be formed under dead conditions yeah okay now think about it for a minute why why why can't you put a a an egg under a dead hen all right it's a hen but it's a dead hen well the dead hen has no warmth right has no atmosphere so brother brand said it has to be under condition condition for the age he said a Pentecostal listen a Pentecostal atmosphere I'm talking about 1906 Pentecost will not produce a bride right right because that Pentecost is dead yeah right right it's a dead hen yeah and it's trying to hatch out now what happens to an egg when it's under a hen some of y'all know more about this than I do but we raise chickens you know what happens under under a hen that dyes or a hen that doesn't sit properly an egg that's not been fertilized something's wrong with it what happens to it it doesn't mature it doesn't form into a chicken okay okay right it's just it's just a mess right so in order to bring order out of a a Yol I think brother juel was the one used to say he didn't like eggs he said I like the mystery of my chicken revealed and and I'm kind I actually like eggs but but there is a kind of a messiness to it isn't there it's it's it's all over the place it's just a jumo but within it is the potential to become a chicken but it can't become a chicken unless it comes up under the right conditions and it can't come up under a dead hen oh that's why the the bride's always going to have life in her there always must be life in the bride and there is life in the bride it may not be it may not seem like the life of Pentecost because we're manifesting something else it may not seem like the life of Luther we're manifesting something else it may not seem like even the life life of Wesley but we're manifesting it something different in our day but the life is there are you with me so far so the bride will not be formed under dead conditions he said it has to be under condition you can take a good live egg he said and put it put it under a dead hen it won't hatch he said it's the condition he said well that's the way it is in this age that we're living in you got to find out what is God's way of doing it for this age yeah he said that's what Martin Luther found that's what John Wesley found that's what the Pentecostals found in their age God's age and time to do it why would we get wrapped up in what God did in an age when the word was not fully revealed let's find out what he's doing in this day and follow that you so how am I going to know what he's doing today we had a prophet coming our day and tell us exactly where we are and point out to us the place on the map where we're at amen amen that's right bless the name of the Lord bless the Lord hallelujah he said that's what Martin Luther found and John Wesley founds what the Pentecostal found in their age God's age and time to do it and that's what we found in our age now there is something we need to go back to yes sir right because we have to go back to our future and I want to contend with with you and for you and to you today that our future is the message all right our future is the message that's already come our future is not some man that may raise up or some Revival that might come along or some some stir that might come along our future is this messag amen our future is contained so we're not looking we're not waiting it out and saying well this is good but we can't wait to see what's next but our future is actually in being restored back by the message of the hour so that is our future now he's taking us back in this age but he's not just taking us back to another age but he's taking us back to to a Rapture condition amen he's taking us back to a place now look what brother brandom had the vision of of the bride and preview of The Bride he talked about how that here come a here come a a church of America he talked about how evil they were all the things that were going on there dancing to rock and roll music how they come down through there and and they begin to they begin to move off and it might seem attractive to some people but to a prophet it looked horrible it looked awful and so he's watching them as they as they go down now he's watching them they're going down they're going down into hell they're going down into destruction and he's watching them going down he said oh God he said what's going to happen is that all we could produce and all of a sudden here come a bride remember he I don't have to give you the whole he he had a there was a bride she was dressed appropriately she was marching to honored Christian Soldiers she was she was a bride that was in step with the word and she was not going down she was going up but I want to tell you this morning that if you're in that bride that's going up you can't be in that bride that's going down all right you're one or the other and you might have people come around try to scare you and say well if you're not careful you'll be that church that's going you're not the church that's going down you're the church that's going up right you're the church is going up so I'm not here to scare you and try to say well you're you're part of that church that's going down that's not our problem prophecy we're the ones that are going up and yet Among Us he said there was some at the end he said maybe after I'm gone it began to get out of line he said they they stepped out and he said they were watching that other group they were maybe watching and listening they got out of Step you know how you would if there was two different kinds of music going on I'm not talking about music this morning but if there were two different kinds of music you'd get out of Step if you begin to listen to the other kind of music the other style of music they got out of Step because they were watching he said what that other church was doing oh God help us today we don't want to watch the churches going down Lutheran going down West is going down Pentecost is going down but the bride's going up and we are not called to watch that church it's going down we'll get out of Step if we do but we're called to go up so if we're called to go up there's a prophet's voice that begin to cry out get back in line oh and that's what I want to get back to this morning that's my future is this message my future future is the opening of the book my future is found in the word being fully revealed my future is when everything become mine I'm not looking for something else to follow some other move of God some other Revival somewhere else but this is the bride Revival this is my future Hallelujah glory to God glory to God oh God bless the Lord see the word word it's not our past it's our future it's the message of this hour it's not a dead letter but it's living Paul says the word of God is quick that means alive the word of God is alive it is alive it doesn't need me to make it live or you to make it is alive and if you and if you grab a hold of it and believe it it'll be alive in you the word of God is alive it's powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing is under a Soul and Spirit it can tell the difference between just theemotion and the true move of the Holy Ghost it can it can tell the difference between the the outside realm and the inside realm when it's God that's actually moving that this word can tell the difference it is the discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart it rightly divides amen now watch it has life in it yeah it is life it is Anointed it keeps our families I wonder if we believe that today it blesses our home you say well I'm looking for uh some other Pastor to come along or some other preacher you've got what you need this morning to make it all the way and you can sing like our sister sang this morning I'm going to make it you can wake up in the morning tell your spouse we're going to make it why because we believe the message of the hour there's life in it it's powerful it keeps our homes it blesses our homes it keeps our church spiritual amen I don't need somebody else's opinion to keep the church spiritual the message of the hour does that it keeps the church in order yeah don't tell me we have to leave the message or leave what a prophet said to to find a Revival the Revival is right here our future is going back to what a prophet said amen now when we do that what are we going back to my goodness are we going back to I'm just fat I don't mean I'm preaching hard it just means I'm fat good preaching good pre where we going back to yeah we're not going back to another age we're going back this message I want to ignite your curiosity this morning though you've heard these things before but I want you to I want to stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance we're going back to the back part of God's mind right all right this message took us back yeah into the inner workings of God Amen oh my into what he thought about us yeah so that brother the Mitch when we see this message we're seeing God's thoughts about us right and when we see God's thoughts about us and we begin to identify with those thoughts we begin to realize that's me we're going back I don't want to go back to 1906 I don't want to go back to the 1980s some people want to go back well in the 9s we had more Fellowship around the message I don't want to go back to the '90s I want to go back to the message of the hour let me live the message let me believe the message let me have an open book let me believe what a prophet said we're going back because that Prophet took us back to the back part of God's mind look at Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother brandom said now God's secret mystery he had before the world began back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve he said and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed he talked about how he wasn't God and he became God when he had he was an object of worship he said now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery he said that's what I want to speak onto the church this morning the hidden Mystery that of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began he said how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then I believe in what is being done you're going back to timelessness it's eternity back to oh my is it where we going back to 1963 no we're going back to the Eternal thoughts of God this message is not dated it's not for 1963 it's not for 1955 it's not for our grandparents or our great grandparents but this message is eternal it come from the Throne of God and it brought us back to the thoughts of God glory to godess Hallelujah makes me wish I was the kind of preacher your pastor is this morning but we have such a great message don't we such a great message don't we something we can go back to when we get astray when we move when we are we're going to fail sometimes we're going to mess up sometimes but don't worry you can go back you can't go back to when you were 21 by yourself you can't go back to when you were 55 but you can go back to the message of the hour and have the same joy and the same peace you can go back to God's word for this day and have the same anointing in the church the same power the same God MO moving Among Us hallu glory to God opening of the book took us back to a place back before I ever sinned I don't know what that means to you but that means a lot to me going back with the Caleb where I before I ever made a mistake before I ever sin before I ever did anything wrong this message is taking me back hallelujah hallelujah back to what he said I was hallelujah amen back to my existence in his thoughts in the mind of Elohim listen job's saying oh he said if I could be young again if I could be young again God says it's like he I finally got fed up with it you know he he said job let me ask you a question yes oh my oh he job said if I could only control my times and my Seasons if I could only go back if I could only if I could only be young again and God said job I want you to understand you were somewhere yes where were you job when the morning Stars sang together where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy Hallelujah no wonder we Shout at the O opening of the word no wonder we shout when we hear the word preach no wonder we shouted there he said brother the Ben I'm pretty quiet you shouted there all right it doesn't say all it doesn't say all the sons of God except the quiet ones are you with me now I I'm just trying to get you out of your comfort zone he didn't say all the sons of God except for this one or that one except for this church or that church but all someone say all this morning all the sons of God without inhibition without worrying about the person next to them they all shouted for Joy yes sir amen we shouted there yeah yeah so we can shout here that's going back now look heard a message spirit said well we don't need to shout what would we need to shout for well I shouted there oh my I shouted there I'm not going to wait till I get to heaven to shout again because I believe the message of the hour is for today amen amen yes sir Jeremiah 29:11 you've heard this many times he said but I know the thoughts that I think towards you this message is the thoughts of God to us it takes takes us back to what the Lord thought about us which is thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now watch carefully brother B said and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind he said yes she was she was existing in his thoughts he said what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not he said the Eternal thoughts of of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal he said if you can see this you'll see many things I just love that statement if you can see that the thoughts of God are Eternal and that the bride is the thoughts of God and that you are the bride you'll see many things Hallelujah brother Brandon tells us three things about God he tells us he's unchangeable I love that about God he tells us he's infinite in his ability and he tells us he is omniscient he knows everything right Brother Band said he's never had a new thought about anything someone say anything anything never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have I love that and knows the end from the beginning because he is God Amen thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he was drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God he's not bound by time at all the thoughts of God are real hallelujah oh what that ought to mean to us he's not a builder with a blueprint where something might go wrong or the plumber might not show up on time or the electrician might not show up on time but he's God it's already done in his mind it's already completed hallu Hallelujah David tells us in Psalms 139 brother brand references this in the church age book he said my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth he said Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in thy book all my members were written which in continuous were fashion when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts toward me oh God how great is the sum of them listen it would do something to us we' we'd have tears running down our face we we'd begin to speak out in the house of God we'd begin to worship like never before if we realize how precious the thoughts of God were towards us before we were ever born before we were ever formed in our mother's womb hallu brother brandom bless the name of Lord says this glory to God oh I just love him this morning don't you now watch this brother BR said and back there where in the mind of God back there if I could have known as I I know now oh my what a revelation this is Brother wend this helps us because we look back and say well things were better but look if I could have known as I know now and could have looked over the whole span of time and he would have said to me what time do you want to live now think about that for a minute you you might get all caught up and say well I would love to live back when brother Brandon was here but God put you here for a reason yeah I would have loved to have seen the revivals of John Wesley I'd have loved to see I'd just love to see somebody preaching that many people without a microphone we become dependent on these things and I'd just love to have seen it I'd have loved to have seen I'd have Lov to seen when Jesus was on the earth I'd have Lov to seen when he sat down brother the kby and he taught the people and they all sat down on the hill and he sat down on the hill and he be precious words begin to proceed from his mouth brother brother say was the greatest anointing that was ever on him don't knock your pastor when it seems like well he's not fire he's not anointed listen the most brother BR said the greatest anointing that was ever on a man was Jesus sitting down on the hillside and speaking to the people blessed are the peacemakers all right what was I would have loved to go back and and sit there and listen to those things I'd have loved to go back to the day of Pentecost and experienced what they experienced and been there in that upper I would have loved to have been there but he said if I could have chosen a time if I could have chosen a day that I could go back to he said I would have went back I have said this time right now I wonder if we have a revelation of that today you were called for this day not for another day if I could pick a time in my life listen you might have been 20 you might have been 40 you might have been 60 brother the dur but he said if I could pick a time to live it'd be right now because you're closer to that body change than you ever have been you're going to step into it one of these days he's taking you back to your future hallelujah hallelujah oh if we can only get a revelation of that old age wouldn't bother us trouble wouldn't bother us situations wouldn't bother us why because we're Going Back to the Future amen hallelujah the more broken down we become the more old older we get the closer we are to going backless hallu he said i' said this time right now just the eve of the ending up of world history and the oncoming of the kingdom of God to be established in the earth he said I think it's the most glorious time of all ages is right now I say God take me back I remember a time in my life when I was young I was 16 years old and and and already out of the house and I was helping a little church in Texar Canada Texas I'd go down there in the afternoon and I'd pray sometimes for hours at a time and it's all I had to do I didn't have any money I didn't have any I just stay stay there in the church and prayed and I remember what that time was like you guys that are that are that age you're a little bit older you you don't know what a precious time it is to be able to have time to spend with God now I'm older I got kids I got a wife we got a church we got things that we have to deal with all the time and I look back at that time say what a wonderful time but if you gave me an option I'd go back to today I want to go to today because he's done more for me today than he's ever done I remember what it was like I remember sometimes like job we begin to think I remember when my steps were washed with butter and oil I remember when the secret of God was upon me I remember the presence of God so real that I be to talk in another language I I remember what that's like but I'm not going back to that I'm going back to the beginning back to the thoughts of [Applause] God hallelujah you can't get too caught up in how you feel cuz how you feel is going to change and if you're not careful you just constantly begin to seek emotion and seek emotion and seek emotion but the word of God is unchangeable come on we need emotion we need times when we're just bathed over in the presence of God yes we need the times when we're drunk on the spirit of God and I believe that that could be every service we could get that way but let me say this there's going to be times you just don't feel it and it's in those hours that you have to say I'm going back to my future when God is silent it seems like the heavens are brass and things are not going like they should I'm going back to my future let me do the work of God let me be a volunteer let me be willing to do whatever I'm asked to do because I'm going back to my future I'm not looking at the temporary hurt or the temporary hardness or the temporary hardships I'm not looking at those things but like Paul said I see a crown ahead of me a Crown of Life at the end of the road I refuse to look at my bonds I refuse to look at the prison I refuse to look at the change I'm going back to what was I want to take all those with me that I can now if we know I just got just a few more minutes and we'll close you don't know how many a few minutes are on listen how can we go back to what God said it takes the Holy Ghost let's just be real about this we can't do it in our own power it takes the Holy Ghost to bring us back to the message of the hour he said he would give us the power to become Sons what is that power his own life the token life back on the believer that's the power that makes the Sons and Daughters of God without it we cannot go back to our future I want you to notice how brother bam answered us a question in paragraph 39 of questions and answers number two in 1964 if you want to go look it up he answers a question about the Holy Ghost and and and how do you uh how do you know is is it an experience or is it uh is it something else is it just you take it by faith he said now that's a good question he said now the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive yeah he talks about how the evidence wasn't tongues he talks about how he thought it was love but he found out it wasn't even love because even the Pharisees could have love he said there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that I know of and that is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour notice how he puts it a genuine faith in a pro in the promised word of the hour that's the hour that we live in he said now he said when a man receives Christ in the manner that he is in I'm skipping through the you can tell by the paragraph numbers but when you have time it's a long answer you can read it for yourself he said but when a man receives Christ in the manner that he is in he said you can't accept it as being he said now some of them say well I'm a Lutheran well there's nothing against that but the Eagles don't feed on that that was as far as it was that was fresh food for that day I'm a Wesley and that's all right but you're living in the past he said so being a well- Tred Theologian had nothing to do with it being meenal had nothing to do with he talks about Christ he said what made him different he said he was the word made flesh not the word for the day of Moses Moses was that day he said not for the Days of Elijah Elijah was the word for that day but he was the present tense word and they were living in the back okay right they were living in the back but not far not far enough back are you with me now they were living in yesterday but they were living in what they could remember but I want to live in what God remembers are you with me now now he said he was the present tense word and they were living in the back he said the same thing repeats he said that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when God reveals to you and you see it thus sayith the Lord and you accept it he said not what you are not what you was or nothing about it it's what God has done for you now he said there's the evidence he said now the Holy Spirit when he comes it's a witness unto you that this word is right how many believe that today I know the Bible is right they used to sing in the black church I know the Bible is right that means somebody's wrong I know the Bible is Right somebody's wrong that's the truth isn't it he said the word it'll tell you that the word is right but not just the word for another day the word for this day he said not the word for Luther not the word for Moses we witness this the truth but it's another day he said what if Jesus would come and say now Moses as Moses come Tak you out of Egypt I've come taking you somewhere else what if he said let's go to work and build an ark I'm the Lord God I'm going to float the world away now I'm going to drown the world he said the scripture never said he'd come like that he wouldn't have been the Messiah no matter how much Ark he' built whatever he'd done he'd have not qualified the Messiah there you are it's a qualification what was it it was evidence of who he was what is it today evidence of who you are you're not looking for another message but you've got the message of the hour you believe the message of the hour and it's an Evidence of who you are now and you manifest that word now Christ was that which is perfect how many believe that yes sir aren't you glad we had a perfect lamb amen he was examined he was found perfect he was that which is perfect that which is perfect didn't need to replay that which was in part okay he he didn't have to he was the ark he didn't need to build an ark because he was the ark amen he didn't have to relive Joseph's Day or or or Paul or or or one of the Old Testament Saints Day as day or Jeremiah's day he could live in his day because he was the perfect realization do you realize what you what you are back in all the other ages they were just the types of a bride but you today are the bride there was bride in every age but they without us could not be made perfect Hallelujah they were just a type of you they were looking forward to you they're waiting on you and Paul tells us that we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part should be done away not the true gifts won't be done away but it'll be that which is in part that part that fails 1 Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part should be done away with he said all these things are jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues he's talking about as an Evidence of the Holy Ghost people trying to get the Holy Ghost by speaking in tongues all these other things when that which is perfect he said we do have today oh I know you've heard it before but hear it again this morning we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication then that which is in part is done away with do you believe it today what are we going back to back to a true Pentecostal experience back to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the manifestation of the word for our day back to the faith once delivered to the Saints listen there had to come a time that the veil was rent and the Old Testament was the Old Testament sacrifice was no more it couldn't do have any more effect on the people the veil was rent and the mercy seat that was there become a judgment seat and The Mercy Seat was there hanging on a cross you all know what brother T the unveiling of God how did The Mercy Seat come into full View and Paul tells us he said we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord we're coming into something what are we doing we went back to a place where the word was unveiled we went back to a place where the word where the book was open and when we went back we saw ourselves in a future image and we're change into that image Hallelujah I'm not done being changed for the window I was changed last week I'm changed this week the more I look at it the more I become what it says am the more I become what it is oh my can we say Amen to that today amen bless the name of the Lord that's good pre thank you Jesus that's what the church has done he said it come from Luther Westley back to the original grain back to its original Glory back to the glory it was at the beginning he said the same son manifesting the same thing in the west changing from glory to glory it changed from Pagan into Luther from Luther into Wesley wesy the Pentecost on and on changing from glory to glory producing the hidden mana and now it's ripe to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning the same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost Hallelujah the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost amen that's what he says Hallelujah this the same Holy Ghost that's manifest today from Glory into glory to glory back to its original seed all right with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same signs same wonders same bapt not some not some Pentecostal interpretation of the signs but not some Pentecostal or Methodist interpretation of the gifts but the same signs yeah the same wonders the same baptism same kind of people acting the same way if they got drunk on the spirit I can too yeah with the same power he even says the same sensation yeah right now Sensations can be good or bad love is a sensation and so is hate feelings can be good or bad but we always match them up with the word so it's the same sensation what same as what not 1906 when Pentecost come along not 1738 when when Wesley got saved 1517 when Luther nailed the the 95 thesis to the door of vinberg oh my not to that but back to acts two because acts two was what God had in his mind for the church glory glory to God but I want you to know that this age doesn't stop at acts to cuz that age had to go down in the ground it was their Destiny to go down in the ground but now brother we have a predestined bride a predestined for somebody that's not going down they're going up this age is going back not just to act too we're going all the way back to the mind of God and what it was for us before the beginning the veil of denomination was rent but the BR said it was from glory to glory and the next will be remember what he said there was there yesterday was had its prophecy tomorrow has its prophecy but there's something something for today and something that's next and listen what he says is next the next will be changeed amen from this Glory oh I'm looking forward to it I'm changed from this Glory into a body like his own his body where we shall see him he said Abraham saw the same so God took Abraham back to his future yeah yeah you realize that he didn't just take him back to his past because taking him back to his past was insufficient yeah because if you'll remember when Abraham was 21 yeah he and Sarah were probably already married so if he took him back to 21 they couldn't have children then yeah yeah he did not oh God I hope you understand he did not take him back to just 21 but he took him back into his own thoughts to a place where he was perfect yeah you watch what he did I wish I had the voice of strength to preach it this morning you watch what he did he going back we're going back to a Rapture he took Abraham and went back to his future he was a young man again but this time he could produce the promised son what did he do he took Abraham back Beyond his mistakes yes sir on Hallelujah because there was no mistake in his future so when Paul wrote about Abraham he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief why because he took him back took him back to his future oh my I say God take me back today I don't want to go back to just emotionalism I don't want to go back to just things that I was yesterday I want to go back to the pureness of God take me back to my new body take me back to what God has for me in his mind come on brother bless the Lord that's what this message came to do that's what's next amen oh I'm so glad I know what's next you don't know about tomorrow but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow and I know what's next what's next is a change of my body hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory thank you lordless we're going back to this 1 Corinthians 15151 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed and brother brandom goes back in the mind of God and tells us about this scripture he says then we'll all get together and when they begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death hallu but just of a sudden there will be like a sweep go over us and you're changed you're turned back like Abraham was right yes sir oh if we just realize your mistakes are not your future your old age is not your future your gray hair is not your future our bald spots are not our future but we're going back we're not just going back he's taking us back to like we were at 21 but without sin without without what we went through without all of the things that messed us up without all the family history without all the drama oh my he's taking us back to what we were said God had a picture of you and he knew what you would be and he's taking you back to that my he said what's this Sudden Change he said after a while you're traveling like a thought and you can see those then who are already resurrected oh what an hour he said then we'll gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air job said oh to be young again look at these guys oh to be young again these guys sitting up here oh to be young again I wish I was young good job buddy I wish I was young I I want to know what it was like to be in the presence of God and be young I want to know oh but one day I will be all that I had brother BR say it's like a shadow of a shadow of a shadow all that I had as a young preacher all that I had when I was 21 all that you had by the dur when you were young all that you had with your family that was so wonderful but it was just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of the perfect love of God and when we get there it's so far beyond anything that we've ever seen and he told job he job said I wish I could go back and he said wait a minute he said I'm going to show you something job he tore the veil yes he tore the veil off job's eyes opened up the seals and suddenly job saw a redeemer and he stood there and he said and I know my redeemer liveth I wonder how many of us could testify of that today I know my redeemer liveth I wish I was young again I wish I was better than I am I wish I was in a better body but I know that my redeemer liveth he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth Hallelujah he said though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God he tore the seals off give him a revelation of who he was he said job this is your future I'm not just going to restore you back to what you was I'm going to make you something better I'm going to give you a future let you know your redeemer is in charge for even what you're going through right now hallu keep looking at that unveiled word the musicians come keep looking and you'll be changed the same Holy Spirit anointing the same word that produced The Miracle the Paradox of the new birth in your life will produce a body change keep looking he said brother Ben I my marriage it needs help I've got some issues begin to W that's why it's uncomfortable sometimes to focus on it because it needs help keep looking at the word look look at the word find out what you're supposed to be as a husband or as a wife brother being my home is not what it should be look at the word brother being we're we're not we're just not having the services that we want to have look at the word I've always enjoyed the presence of God in this place I enjoy it it's here right now but if you're not what you want to be don't go back to a time in your mind go back to the word what has God called me to be what has God called me there was a time of the been when I used to witness when I used to oh run the wheels off my car to tell people about the gospel what about today what is it today see Aunt Tracy sitting back there what about today the devil's come after your body but there's something for you today there's a place for you in the house of God today can look at what yesterday was today there there's a word of God for you today a reality for you today Hallelujah a presence of God you up in the boo I know how hard you work there's a presence of God for you today you can feel the god a man that that believes God can feel his presence Can Can Be Touched by the presence of God yes can know his word the same holy spirit that anointed that word to produce a new birth in your life is the same Holy Spirit produce the body change if you've never had that if you've never had a paradox in your life Now's the Time Now's the Time he said but brother Ben it's just a Sunday morning service you you know what you need today is the dayu of Salvation would you bow your heads with me maybe you've tried to quench that Holy thirst with things of the world you say brother Ben there was a time when the freshness of the spirit of God was upon me like job when the anointing was on my Tabernacle there was a time when I just bathed in the presence of God when I come to church and now things are different but he's with you now why don't you just ask him back in look why don't you take a good look at the word examine yourself Lord change me in your image you can't do it yourself you can't artificially produce it but go back to the word maybe you're more solid now more seasoned maybe you maybe you're a better Christian today I trust that you are but if you're not you can be a better Christian than what you you were even at that moment of the miracle of God in your life why don't you go back to your future this morning this message is our future I want to stand for that I want to believe that let nothing distract me and
