========================================

[Music] for making himself a Doctrine and standing that Doctrine and then they got so much tuck away till the Holy Spirit couldn't get into the church they just become another Idol like a brass serpent it become an idolatry every fell said I am belong to this and I belong to that it was an idolatry what a mess we were in at the end time but God rich in his Mercy has sent back the Holy Spirit upon us and vindicating his word tonight as he promised he would do God promised he would do these things look what he did look what he did how now we can see how he promised each age a certain thing to happen and we find out that it happened just exactly like it and he said that he would do because he's rich in his Mercy to always have mercy to fulfill every word that he has promised he has to do it and always in order to stay God always he does this his word always comes to pass in its season his seed that he has sold into the Earth what did he do he put it here in the word and that's a seed and every time the age comes along that seed wrens up and then uh Reformation comes forth and he promised it and it does that now we did not deserve these things we did not deserve these blessings of God because we had went out after the things of the world went in the air of Cain Cain building a nice Altar and a nice Church putting flowers up on it and thought that's exactly what it was it was a bunch of apples or pears or pomeg grants or whatever it was his father and mother had eat in the Garden of Eden it run him out and so he offered that back to God and God rejected it but Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King and today the Bible said in Jude that they have run in the way of Cain perished in the gain sand of Kora see running the way of cing building altars building churches denominations making it flowerly big more members than the rest of them taking in things anything that come along and it jumped up and down or shook hands or was baptized a certain way or spoken tongues or run through the floor they put their name on the book that's right and then turn on the real truth that be preached and denied how can it be so notice what a mess we were in notice and the Bible said and they went in the way of balum and perished in the gain saan of Kora perished in the gain s what was the gain s of Kora well you think you're the only holy man well God's all of us are holy the whole church is all right ever all of us get together that's what we ought to do that's where they perish that and we truly deserved it we deserve to be that but God rich in Mercy has pulled us out of that chaos and let us see it before the thing hits here rich in his Mercy and sent us back a Revival of Divine Healing and the coming again of the power of God according to history no Revival ever lasted over three years this revival carried for 15 years it's been a burning fires around and around the world why because we deserve it God rich in his Mercy not because we desired it or because we deserved it rather just think of what it's done I think of one of your sisters right here in Phoenix that many of you know Miss Haddie walr she had cancer of the heart and she was in the prayer line up here when Brother Moore and I were here the first time about 15 18 years ago and she was dying with cancer of the heart and she should have been dead a long time ago but God rich in Mercy thank you Lord sent his power upon her and he saved her life and she's living today God rich in Mercy Congressman Upshaw a great man uh I think he was the president or something of the of the Baptist uh Southern Baptist convention at one time or vice president or something he had done all he was a good man he did all that he know how to do he went to every doctor nobody could do nothing for him he was bound down ministers had prayed for him he' had a gallon of oil poured on his head anointing of different ministers everywhere one night Los Angeles California walking up to the pull pit looking a bunch of wheelchairs about twice three times and watch sitting there all up and down the aisles back and forth and then there laid over there a cop with a little colored girl and little negro uh girl and her her mother was sitting by her and my brother had bringing the prayer line up and I was looking knowing not what was going on and I seen a doctor with Tardis shell glasses operating on a little negro girl for a throat condition and she paralyzed and I looked around I thought where is the child at I couldn't see her after a while way down there no hope lovely little girl about seven or eight years old to be she paralyzed the rest of her life there was her mother down there on her knees praying then I said this doctor operate on your little girl in descri she said that's right sir and she tried to get the baby to the platform they told her not to do it they tried to quieten her down by the time they got her quiet I thought well we'll get a chance to pray for her in a few minutes maybe people right here was there that night and I was looking out over the audience I I seen that little girl going down look like through a a little narrow road with a doll in her arms rocking that doll no matter how much the doctor said that she was going to be paralyzed arrest of her life God rich in Mercy sent down the Holy Spirit by a vision and that little girl got up out of there and she and her mother H hold her hands and walked down through that aisle praising God way back there said an old man Congressman Upshaw many of you knows his testimony he had been a good man tried all of his life 66 years an invalent in a wheelchair pushed in bed crutches under his arms that he walked with never no more to walk normal and there he sat there looking on that all of a sudden I looked out and saw a vision Gary come walking down across the top of that audience bowing his head walk as good as anybody I didn't know who the man was I said there's a great man sitting back there he fell off of a wagon when he was a little boy or onto a hay frame and heard his back they board Holes in the Floor to keep the vibration when the people walk from striking on his back I said he becomes a great man and he keeps growing greater he's sitting in a great circle at the White House and then this man come and told me said that's Congressman upsh you ever hear him I said never heard of him and so he run a little ension mic back there and he was talking back and forth then I started to look around I seen the old Congressman coming walking towards me in a vision just as perfect and normal as he could be God rich in Mercy pulled him from that wheelchair and he walked without cutes till the day he died God rich in Mercy when doctors had fail when science had fail when everything else had failed God was rich in Mercy the congressman up y I think of myself as a little old boy I remember as a people call me today a woman hater the reason it was because I seen so much immorality out of women when I was a kid I hated them and I don't do that now because I know these some good ones but I remember how it was so bad so immoral and I thought my I I'll never be around where people's at I have no education so I won't get any and little old kid sitting there not even a shirt on with my uh coat pinned up like this with a safety pin and it real hot and the teacher said William aren't you hot with that coat on I said no ma'am I'm a little bit chilly and she made me go over to the stove and and put some wood in the stove and I like to burn up I I I didn't have no shirt that whole season through and I thought if I could ever get the money sometime it I could get a little uh get me a 3030 rifle i' come out west here and live out here and hunt for the rest of my life I didn't want nothing to do with people just stay away because they didn't like me and and I just stay away from them and then every time i' go downtown to talk to anybody see some Fellas on the street I knew I'd say hello there John Jim how are you oh hello see they didn't want to talk to me didn't want nothing to do with me because of my daddy and land that made whiskey and I I didn't do that it was nothing I done and I would have been that type but now I said to the wife not long ago my wall is plastered with the best guns that can be bought oh and I think of them old dirty clothes tonight I've got two or three good suits and no friends I have to hide out in the wilderness to keep away from people what's the matter is it because of my personality is it because of my education no God rich in Mercy saw me in that condition and he saved me I remember being led by the arms as a blind man I could not see everything from me was a blur I'd be blind the rest of my life but God rich in Mercy restored back my sight I'm 55 years old and still got good sight God rich in Mercy is the only thing that I can say once the church had no provided way of healing they had one but they turned it down but God rich in Mercy has sent them a gift of Divine Healing that is the holy spirit Among Us confirming the word with signs following God rich and mercy I have two or three pages here of these does but I ain't going to try to strike them because I'm I'm conscious that it's almost time to start that prayer line but God rich in his Mercy many of you here tonight the doctors turned you down there's people sitting them wheelchairs they'll probably never come out of there they were there to stay someone paralyzed in different way they would never couldn't come out there's no way for them to come out but God rich in his Mercy has provided an atonement don't turn it down receive it there's men out there with heart trouble there's people with Cancers if the doctors can do nothing with you're hopeless helpless in this world but God rich in his Mercy has sent down the Holy Ghost and right here now to confirm the word to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever yes amen because we deserve it because God is rich in his Mercy amen now that's the one that's the person it's that Lord Jesus he is not dead but he has risen from the dead and he's alive forever more and he's the same yesterday today and forever still just as rich in his Mercy as he was to the woman that had a blood issue and she started through the crowd there was no hopes for her the doctors had done all they could do she had a blood issue she was dying and she touched the Master's garment God rich in Mercy turned around and told her I were cond I condition and she was healed of this Blood issue a little foul prostitute went up to a well one day to get some water no hope she'd been excommunicated from The Virgins from around the people her life was no good and she thought what's the use of trying I'm turned out there's nothing left for me but she looks standing over on the side or standing by the side of the well and there was a man sitting there who told her all things that she has ever done God rich in his Mercy that same God tonight's just as rich in his mercy and just the same as he was in them days God rich I think we have 200 prayer cards out here or what we've called out of them 200 we're going to call them and let the people line up we're going to pray for them but before we do it let there be some newcomers here that get away from all superstitions this is not a superstition it is a manifestation of a promise of God it depends on what you're don't virtue in any man there's no power in no man but we as Believers have authority not power but Authority someone asked me how long ago said brother brand you believe you got power to do this I I ain't got no power at all but I've got Authority every believer has it if you refuse it you'll stay where you're at but if you'll accept it it'll do the exceeding abundance because God is rich in his Mercy take a little policeman stand out you're on the street his clothes hanging half off of him he's just skinny the Cap's got his ears pulled down and he walk out there where cars are coming down that street at 50 mil an hour 300 horsepower motors in them he hasn't got the power to stop a bicycle that's right but just let him Blow That Whistle and hold up that hand and watch the break squeak he hasn't got power but he's got Authority the whole city is behind him and when a man or a woman I don't care what condition you're in you've got the authority of God by promise because his rich and promise to do exceedingly abundantly if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you've said got no power but you got Authority remember when he told me back there I said you'll be able to reveal this secrets of the hearts you do you remember that many you Phoenix people he promised it what he promises he does now there's some of you here that hasn't got prayer cards and no doubt how many sick and don't have prayer cards raise up your hands all right if you want to know not Authority not power but the authority of the word the things that I do shall you also Jesus Promised in Luke 1730 that just before his coming there would be like the time of No Moses or Noah when they were eating and drinking and giving in marriage and knew not to the day that Noah entered into the ark he said to be that time then he said also as it was in the days of lot and said this will take place in that day when the son of man shall be revealed when the son of man is revealed in the last days now what he how the son of man revealed himself in the person of this Angel which was the son of man absolutely Abraham called him Elohim he was a son of man revealed himself just before the Gentile world was burned how did he do it to the believer to the make believer he sent two preachers down to preach to him but to the real believer he stood with his back to the tent and he said Abraham amen is Abram the day a few days before before that but now he Abraham where is thy wife Sarah said she's in the tent behind you said I'm going to keep my promise to you I'm going to visit you oh Abraham was aund years old and Sarah was 90 but God rich in Mercy kept his promise they brought the baby because God's merciful and he full of Mercy he's rich in Mercy he keeps his promise notice with his back turned to the tent Sarah laughed and said how could these things be I'm old how can I have pleasure with my husband as a a young married woman while he's aund years old our family relationship has ceased many many years ago how could this be and she laughed about it and the angel with the son of man with his back turned to the to the tent said why did Sarah laugh how can these things be what was it Jesus said in St Luke 17:30 that and the days like it was in the days of lot same situation before the Gentile world is burned up he said the son of man will reveal himself in that day he made the promise that Malachi four promises it would tell a message would come forth that would restore the people back to the original Pentecostal message and with the same blessings they had on the day what is it it's a two-winged eagle both New and Old Testament flopping its promises together of God the fulfill what the promises of the Bible said it would do amen God rich in Mercy would not let his people about this denominational rich in goods and things of the world ladyo see in church age but he didn't make a way of Escape believe it people God bless you amen God rich in

John John June okay I don't have my reading glasses on so forgive me amen uh fur fermill okay and that's the uh the pastor there in the Philippines he is going in for eye surgery tomorrow so let's

family the this morning and the Kelly in particular also continued prayers for Trent he's uh which is a grandson and he's uh uh doing much better no seizures for three days and also Christian another grandchild continued prayers amen so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and opened up the service brother Harry and I believe he's got an announcement amen after before after prayer this morning so God bless you this morning before we go to prayer I do have a couple things to to bring before you all um brother William well knows this is the uncomfortable part of Deacon in um timing is interesting since brother Wendell decided to spend time talking about a Deacon's responsibility on Wednesday um a couple verses that I'd like to read first um in Luke chapter 16 starting at verse 10 it says he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own 1 Corinthians 4 and: 2 says moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful and Colossians 3: 23 says and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men so this is really more for the parents um and I count myself among you um we've had a couple issues that uh I would ask all of you to uh be speaking with your children about um first thing is we've had uh some issues that have been going on in the uh in the women's bathroom um the uh cleaning crew going in behind has found um things smeared on the walls in some of the Stalls um and uh some things scratched or carved into the walls um I'm assuming from my side that this is going to be the younger children that are doing it if it's older children you know better on your own but we're going to assume it's the younger children and so I have zero desire to set forth any type of rules about what age a child needs to be before they can go to the bathroom on their own that is fully up to parents so please talk to your kids if you think that you need to escort them to the bathroom obviously if this doesn't improve then we might have to put in some type of rules and guidelines about that um but this is to me this is parents talk to your kids obviously my daughter will be be getting an earful from me um just to make clear um at the moment there is not an issue in the boys restroom but take the time to talk to the boys too let's remind them not to get anything started to start any problems like this um second concern that we've had um are uh and this one I will talk directly to all the kids um I know all of y'all love the candy after Services I'm sure that you don't want that to go away um but we've been having an issue with candy rappers left lying all around on the ground outside um our pastor has been here on days in the middle of the week where he's been coming through and been picking up all the rappers all over the ground which obviously that is not our pastor's responsibility um he needs to be focused on taking care of the flock not the building he needs to be taking care of preparing the sermons visiting the sick praying all those things he doesn't need to be picking up candy wrappers outside um and and so uh all of you kids throw away the candy wrappers stick them in your pocket to throw away later bring them inside and throw away at the trash can by the door um once again parents when you're having the other conversations if you will go ahead behind and have those same talks um obviously we want to be teaching them to be good stewards of everything that's been given to us um you know we've we have to believe that the Lord believes that we're good stewards cuz we've been entrusted with a new bus now that's come along um but at the same time that means that we still need to keep caring for what we do have and we need to be teaching our children to care for it and take responsibility for those things so once again we'll now go before the Lord in prayer if you all will bow your heads with me Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord I pray that first off Lord that you would take control of the service service today Lord that Lord this is it's never a comfortable time to go into these types of announcements and these types of things at the beginning of service Lord but Lord I pray that you would help all of us to have uh the right kind of attitudes Lord Jesus help us all to to be able to enter into the service Lord to to Worship You Lord Jesus to to be in your presence Lord let us not have any type of of of grudges or any problems Lord that would that would hold us back from entering into your presence that would hold back the service Lord Lord Lord if if I I said it wrong or approached it in the wrong way may you forgive me for it Lord may you just Soo the atmosphere and what should be done Lord Lord as always we're needy people coming before you Lord and we just lift before you these these requests Lord we lord lift before you those that are that are out traveling Lord and brother Robert and sister Brianna Lord and I know that sister Angie McDougall is out of town and any others that may be traveling Lord I pray that you would just watch over them Lord that you would keep them where they're at Lord And that you would bring them back home home safely Lord Jesus Lord I Lift before you my son Silas at at home Lord and my wife Stephanie Lord that Lord you see little silus that's been battling the stomach bug Lord and then just my my wife that's just tired from trying to care for a baby and being pregnant and everything Lord I pray that you would just go to them this morning Lord that you would touch them both Lord that you would strengthen them both and lift them up Lord and Lord that if you're willing they would be able to to come and back into service this evening Lord Lord we lift before you these other requests Lord we lord the prayer request of sister Kathy placed in Lord for for her P the pastor back back in the the Philippines Lord that you would just Lord be with them as they would go in for eye surgery tomorrow Lord Lord we know that that Lord you use doctors Lord and you use procedures Lord Jesus but Lord you're the one who does the healing and Lord we pray that you would just reach down and that you would that you would touch them Lord that you would be in the procedure that you would Lord that you would keep everything clean and sterile that it should be Lord that you would guide the doctor hands Lord and that that Lord your very presence would be in that room Lord Lord we lift before you these requests that sister Carol has brought before us Lord for for her friend Kelly Lord that has been sent home for for hospice Lord Jesus Lord we lord we know that that means that the the doctors on their side are saying they can't really do anything else Lord but Lord we know that you're the one that's that's always in control Lord that you're you're the one that can heal in any type of situation Lord and we pray that your will would be done here Lord we lord we lift for you uh um prayer for Trent Lord as he continues to uh he seems to be doing better but that you would just continue to to touch him Lord for for Christen Lord just continued prayer Lord Jesus Lord we lord any of the the needs that that may not have been spoken Lord but those that are represented by the uplifted hands Lord may you just Lord go to minister to each one Lord and may you may you handle each situation Lord because we know that you're still the one that is that is in control Lord Lord we pray that you would take control of the remainder of the service Lord be in our worship Lord Jesus help us to to enter in Lord to to praise you to lift you up Lord Lord I pray that you would be with brother Wendell Lord as he's been studying Lord and and and trying to find the the words that you would have him to to speak to the people this morning Lord may you just may you take control of that gift you've placed in your servant Lord and may you minister to the needs of the people Lord Lord we just love you and we thank you and we just commit the remain of the service into your hands in the name

totally cancer free no cancer uh in in his in his brain and and um and then the other areas that he had been struggling with and that morning uh that day he had been able to eat for the first time uh and be able to keep it down and so we're just so thankful to God so we want to continue to pray for Brother David and um we sure we sure love brother Morris let's look here in Acts the 2 chapter in the first verse amen but when and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place somebody say one Accord in one place one and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven I remember the sermon that brother uh John preached here uh some time back on sudden ly amen suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues of uh like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues and the as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude come together and were confounded because they that every man heard them speaking his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born May the Lord add a blessing to his the reading of his word God bless you you can be seated here today want to uh speak here this morning on living under the expectation of the supernatural um living under the expectation expectation is is an anticipation of something happening it's a confident belief or a strong hope that particular event will happen so amen it is a it is a hope it is a suspense there there is a am man an anticipation of something an awaited event and so we uh as we as we come in the presence of God I I think there should be uh there should always be an expectation an expectation of the supernatural amen amen when we come here in the house of God it should never be nonchalant it should never be uh uh another day at work or a amen a business as usual but where God is there's always the Supernatural is that not what the prophet's said where God is you can expect the supernatural amen and so uh I I I've thought of the awaited event a wedding is is one that has a lot of anticipation and and hours of preparation amen a lot of lot of sweat and pressure and tears and and anxieties and frustrations and last minute fixes amen that comes with a with a wedding and and you sisters know that a little bit more than us guys if amen all we want to do is kiss our girl and uh but U uh you ladies want it all to be beautiful and want it to be right and and and and want it to be and and so amen but there's a lot of preparation why are we preparing is because there is an anticipated day there is a day where where you are going to meet before friends and God and you're going to say I do and you're you're going to be forever United amen and so as the day gets closer there there is a sense of urg y there is a sense of pressure there there are things that are are are beginning to take place Amen in the anticipation of this awaited event amen we we look at the uh the the uh even our youth meeting that is coming up and and and as the as as the event is is coming amen for you young people you're anticipating you've been looking forward to it uh we were there in in uh in um Black Rock uh at at the at the meeting the other night and amen and and the young people coming up and saying we can't wait next week's the the the week and and uh the different ministers letting me know said amen our group is is is so excited for next week there is an anticipation amen there's something there people are looking forward to coming and and meeting with friends and meeting with God and and seeing the supernatural to come among them amen so so there is a there is a sense of uh amen uh uh uh a duty amen there there's a sense there that is that that is h a a preparing amen getting things together uh making sure all the plans are there wait waiting for that event I I think of another one is amen the birth of a child amen when a when a baby's fixing to be born there's been a lot of preparation that that has been taking place casually amen as you're getting the baby bed out or you're amen and you're getting things together but as as the day begins to get a little closer and that that expectation of that child is is no longer months and weeks but it's now days and you're you're not just waiting casually but you are under amen a a a a great expectation when that baby is going to come I I think here today amen that we should never forget that that we must prepare for the presence of God Amen in the Old Testament times they amen the priest could not just come into the presence of God Amen but they had to prepare there was a something there was a certain protocol that that they had to follow there amen they had to be dressed right they had to be cleansed there was a certain process even with the lamb amen if you look there in Exodus 29 and 19 it says and thou shalt take the other RAM and and we're just breaking in here amen and Aaron and his son shall put their hands upon the head of the RAM and they shall kill the RAM and take of his blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tip of the right ear of his sons and upon the thumb of of their right hand and upon the great toe of their right foot and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about and thou shalt take the blood that is upon the Altar and of the anointing oil and sprinkle it upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him and he shall be hallowed and his garments and his sons and his and his sons garments with him there was a preparation to come into the presence of God you know that amen God wants you and me to be prepared to come into His presence I think it's important that as we as we come into the sanctuary that there should be a preparation amen there should there there is a certain Duty that the song leader has Amen to come and lead the people into preparation because we want the supernatural not just another guy singing amen anybody can get up and say hey it's good to see you and it's good to see you and it's good to see you we're not here to see you and you and you we're here to see God Amen and anybody can sing song Anybody can play music and anybody can set an a PE but only those who are prepared to come into His presence amen no man deserves to come into the presence or to stand behind this sacred desk unless they are prepared no woman is prep amen it deserves to come into the presence of God unless you have done it the way God has called us to do amen well let me tell you something amen you've got to be prepared to come into His presence under this New Covenant amen we're not we don't just come in as regular Billy Bobs and Susie q's and amen but we come into the presence of God and we come in prepared we come amen awaiting for his presence I I say this morning amen when I come to this church this morning I was asking God to come supernaturally I was asking God lord I I don't want this to just be another sermon I don't want it to be just another amen another message or another another song service or amen but I want to please the Lord as our sister sung this morning I want to pray to please you I I want to come prepared for you I want your anointing to be upon me because only the anointing can break Yoles only the Holy Spirit can set the captives free only God Amen can take me and change me and give me something amen where the living for I want his presence can you say amen amen you've got to prepare amen getting your ideas aside amen the prophet of God said it took him 10 days Amen to get their ideas aside and and and to get their schisms over and to and to settle their hearts that there is a promise that Jesus told us to wait upon and we are expecting God to come and fulfill his word Amen brother brandham says now you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it they were all in that upper room with one Accord when suddenly there come a from Heaven a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind the atmosphere was right and it takes an atmosphere to do anything amen now you come in this morning and maybe you're maybe you're sick or amen maybe you're fighting depression amen but you understand amen you can do all of that outside you can be sick at home you can be depressed at home but when you walk in his presence amen I I need something beyond the Mortal man so I'm not here to lift up my depression I'm not here to lift up my sickness I'm not here to wallow in discouragement I am taking off amen the garments of heaviness and I'm coming before his presence and saying God here I am I'm in need of you I need your spirit I need the Holy Ghost I need you to touch my my soul can you say amen amen Simon was given a promise that you'll not die until you see the Lord's Christ you're going to you're man you're not going to die now Simeon was an old man and he had been waiting but he'd been living under anticipation now I I I I just want you to understand now amen God giv him that expectation a long time ago and it took a while amen from the time time that he the Revelation came to the time that the Christ child showed up but he had to live under anticipation the scripture says he lived at the Tabernacle or the temple expecting he lived there expecting he came daily expecting he come with an anticipation because God hallelujah he was now an old man amen he was a man that amen was fixing to go to the grave and and the closer he got to the Grave amen the greater the anticipation because God had given him a promise that you will not die until you see that Christ child oh my amen as we begin to see Leota and we see this world falling apart oh how there ought to be something burning deep on the inside of us how expectation should be getting greater and greater the day is coming I'm not talking about a youth camp I'm not talking about a baby being born I'm not talking I'm talking about where we leave this mortal world and we reach and and we put our hands uh upon that Supernatural land that we have been waiting for oh can you see man amen the time is coming where your where your faith will become sighted where your expectation will reach home and that land will become real it's an expectation within your hearts can you see man amen blind Hannah living under the expectation now she's just blind as can be amen she came in Daily and could you imagine all of the hundreds of children that came through that place on a monthly basis Hallelujah but she was a prophetess and she was not going by her sight she was blind Hallelujah she wasn't but she was there was something in her heart that was saying the time is coming now you say now what caused the expectation it was the anointing of the day it was a preparation there was an elect the prophet said there was an elect on the earth that God had foreordained not to miss what God was doing oh that should make you want to shout you're predestinated not to miss what God is doing amen why don't others see this Prophet why don't others see this end time message amen why don't others they just come and go amen they they don't care amen about the preparation but not the bride the bride has got her royal garment hor the bride is in preparation she knows she knows she knows because God predestinated that heart and ordained her to see this Revelation there there's something within her that is creating an expectation of his coming can you say amen amen faith is expectation faith is not Blind Faith sees in that other Rim Faith knows it is near it's not a blind faith you're sitting here this morning I hope you're not here this morning amen just to go through the ritual of music and a sermon and amen and then go uh uh Fellowship afterwards we're here this morning because there is a faith declaring that Jesus is Alive there is a faith Hallelujah it don't matter whether you're young or old this ain't a this ain't a a Jew's gospel this ain't a white man's gospel it's not a it's not a black man's gospel it's not a young man's gospel it is the elect gospel for the lack of all tongues and Kindred the lacks of all ages amen the holy spirit is there creating a hunger A Hallelujah a desire for more of himen now listen I want you to understand brother brand would say in the anointed ones at the end time he says he in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery of God ought to be finished here is the question if you follow in that line in of this hour will it be finished will I find faith will Malachi be fulfilled in this time now I just want you to ask ask yourself the question he said here is the question will it be finished amen here is the question you answer it will I find Faith the answer or the question will Malachi before uh Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time will he restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original of the word you see that's where our faith R lies upon that's we're talking about a living God we're talking about the same Pillar of Fire I'm saying the same Pillar of Fire that was taken over the p over over the uh uh the picture was taken over the head of brother bradam amen you know some people missed the point they they I you know I had a man come into my office and said was that the man that you worship amen and I I'm thinking well it depends on which one you're looking at Hallelujah I'm looking at the pillar of fire and yes yes yes yes that Pillar of Fire is returning this day well come on church I'm not worshiping a man it is the pillar of fire over that human being that brought this message unto me oh young people amen this is a young man's gospel this is a young woman's gospel there is some that'll bring reality can you say Amen the same Pillar of Fire that was with our Prophet is standing here today to take you into a Rapture Hallelujah is to take you into a Rapture now brother Brandon would tell us what this is doing amen he tells us he says now this brings you right back to the spoken word and then you are God's word made manifest Jesus said the same thing he that believeth on me the things that who I am and what I come for and the purpose I do to bring a man back to believe the word of God and to take nothing else with it the works that I do he will do also oh y'all ain't hearing me amen what no what is it what's the purpose of that Pillar of Fire what's that purpose of that Pillar of Fire it brings you back it brings the word back it it opens up the original word seed and you can take that word into your heart and it will Hallelujah if the Malachi 4 seed and the revelations 107 seed that was predestinated in William bram's heart and it came and produced everything thing the Bible said that it would produce if you can take that word amen into your heart and say as the elect of God my faith has been turned back and that book has been given to me and that Revelation is real in me then you can stand up and say I believe uh and I'm expecting and I shall see God can you say Amen the expectation he said now he that believeth on me who I am what I come for and the purpose I do to bring a man back to expecting to believe the word of God and take nothing else with it the works that I do shall he do also and and then brother brandom says there you are well shout hallelujah hallelujah this is not just a figment of man's imagination there is a reason that God sent us this Prophet amen now just believing that God sent a prophet ain't good enough Amen to have Brother bram's picture on the on the on your wall is not good enough but the pillar of fire in that picture if the god of William brandom is your God if the anointing of that word is your anointing then you can expect God in your life hallelujah amen I know there's a lot of people that might worship him but I'm here to tell you I'm worshiping the god of William Brandon and I'm believing the message that William brandham brought to us someone says well he got it a a lot of places but he missed it I choose to believe that God put that Pillar of Fire over his head because God was confident that that man that he predestinated was going to lead us into a Rapture he didn't say that I'm going to show up to the seventh angel messenger and to a few other teachers he says I've got one messenger and he is the teacher he is the one to take us into a Rapture and brother I'm expecting a Rapture I'm expecting the supernatural I'm expecting God to be with me I'm expecting God to heal I'm expecting God to deliver I'm expecting God to F with the Holy Ghost because that Prophet came with thus sayith the Lord can you say Amen now it's the womb of the church that holds the seed and when the seed is within that womb it begins to create an expectation that's right but glory to God now when you're first pregnant anybody can say well you know say well I got the strip and it says I'm pregnant but I I need to go don't tell nobody yet don't tell nobody because I got to go see it from the doctor first and and they and they want to keep it secret I know I know some want to keep keep it secret I don't want him to know that I'm having my 10th child so I just want this to be a secret amen but after a while amen after a while the expectation after a while there is a declaration that something has taken place in the womb of that Mama that she can't deny it anymore she can't I I I'm I'm here to tell you I have got I am past Pentecost I am past humanistic ideas I'm a p Hallelujah I am past your opinions I am past amen what this one thinks or what that big preacher thinks I am past I have sealed the word of God in the womb of my heart I have no room for nothing else but thus sayith the Lord I have no room oh church I'm expec thing to give birth to that Supernatural word it is within me can you see man now Pentecost had to die in order for you to be married to Christ the word the denominationalism had to die in order for you to come into this position of Bride that creates a special kind of attitude come on now now as long as that man is living your old husband is living then you're not allowed to get married now and if Christ has said that to his church how much more is Christ you've got to be dead to your old man in order to be married to Christ the word you've got to die to your old thinking you've got to die to to what you knew is Right you've got to die to your own nature and you've got to rise in the power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit you are now married not to a Creed you're married not to a dog you're married to Jesus Christ the word what an expectation now that Bozo you married to before he was a man of sin he was a man of come on now Hallelujah it was like the it was like the the the boy that or the girl a man that uh had been missing and and uh uh is a boy or a girl had been missing I think it was from around here close to Oklahoma for a long time and been been kidnapped at Birth huh amen it was a girl and so uh uh he and and they and and they every year they were doing this little they were doing this little snapshot the FBI and they' put it on the milk cartons and everything every year every one year about 12 years later amen someone says I think I've seen that girl I think I've seen that girl so they came in they done research or they amen begin to Stak make stakeouts and and and and finally amen uh uh they they they nabbed this girl and amen and she was she was a she was a pretty rugged girl I mean she she already had a pretty rough criminal record and man and so they got her and and uh man they they got the other man and they done the DNA test well this man that she's calling father is not her dad so they call this other one who's been looking for his daughter for the last 12 years to do the DNA test and it shows that he is the father of this 12y old girl now now when they when as they break the case and they come in and they tell the they they introduce the girl to her real father and the girl's looking at the real father and saying he's not my daddy he's not my daddy I don't know who that man is they say the DNA shows that he is your daddy you were stolen from your crib in the hospital she looked at the manine dad's over there crying she ain't wanting to go to her dad she said he's my daddy and he goes no he never was your daddy he said this was an evil man this was an evil man that took you out of a hospital he has done bad things to you amen and she begins to quiver her lips begin to quiver as she begins to He Man all of the years of torture begins to come come out through these tears through her heartened heart she begins to look at that man who had made her Rob and made her do amen uh a vow things and sold her body and and as she begin to look back at that evil man that was not even hers and she looked at her innocent father who is saying that I've never taken down your crib your crib is still in your room I have always loved you you you Hallelujah I've been looking for you year after year day after day through the tears and the Soul I've been looking for you and I want to tell you amen you never were the Devils you never did belong to him you had to die to your old nature you have to die to your old man and you can rise in the newness of Christ you always were a son and daughter of God the devil was making you evil but God come to give you life and life abundantly can you say Amen now that girl has now got to find who she is her expectation is now a different expectation she's looking at life a lot different now she's seeing things through different eyes now she's seeing the are you understanding her expectation has been changed amen from embarrassment and imprisonment and defilement and is now looking to a hope and a promise a love can you say Amen it's the atmosphere of expectation you're not you ain't got the act the expectation of the denominational system with a little bit of a jump and Hallelujah even the Baptists are doing a little bit of a you know these These Days Baptist used to be the guys with just a piano in Oregon now they've got they've got all these guys out there amen their skinny jeans on and they're amen it's just a expectation is just give me a little a little bit of happiness while while I'm here but the bride has got something that is some it's it's it's greater it's more Supernatural there is a soul on the inside of you that was predestinated by God it was created in the image of God the serpent his children just want to amen enjoy life while they've got it amen it's a condemned seed they'll never come into the realities of the supernatural but you you your soul has been imprisoned in your body amen it's been imprisoned by that sin nature but I'm here to tell you he whom the sun sets free is free indeed amen it frees me from sin it frees me from Habits it frees my expectation for another real I'm expecting Angels I'm expecting the presence of God I'm expecting healing I'm expecting Deliverance I'm expecting the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm just any day now my Lord is coming and when he returns I will be with him brother the Rand I'm talking about Pentecost he says now it's the attitudes of the people that brings the results that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came he says because they got in one place one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results maybe you come this morning and you weren't in the atmosphere of Praise maybe you've got here this morning and you weren't in the atmosphere amen of of of coming in maybe maybe Oh Glory to God Amen the priest had to have the blood dipped on their right toe the right thumb and their right earlobe before they could come into the presence of God they had to be dedicated right amen what is right hand Jesus sits on the right hand of God what is the right hand of Fellowship amen there's where the power lies the right hand Jesus amen when when when when when they said Jesus was was was sitting on the right hand of God in other words he is on the right right hand of authority amen all that God is is given to Jesus Christ and God says the priest you and me every one of us not a preacher as we've been looking in the church ages it's not a preacher that goes into the into the most holy Place anymore amen it's not just a certain SEC that goes into to the presence of the Holy Ghost anymore now it is every one of you are coming in once it was death for the common man to go into the presence of God amen once it was death but now it's death to stay out of the presence of God once it was death amen for you to walk in but today God says come unto me come into this anointing come into my presence come with expectation man you've got to walk right you've

hairs Hallelujah so one day she cleaned out the tub amen got got everything all looking good hallelujah it's not one day I mean she always cleans the house but but she was making a point at it this time amen amen squeaky clean and then when I come out of the shower after a bit she says now let's go walk into the shower Hallelujah let's see well glory to God and I'm going well dog on Amen losing my hair yes yes yes she says I've still got my beauty where's yours amen amen now when I look in the mirror and I see this dying body sometimes I I remember the boys used to you know when they were younger especially they' talk about my rugged hands and my calluses and they they'd feel me and they'd be they'd look at dad as if I was I was Mr tough guy and I was thinking you're right I'm tough Hallelujah man I used to love it just just love it but these days as I'm holding the grandchildren and then I look down at my hands and my hands are getting thin and my skin and and and and there's wrinkles all over it arthritis is setting in amen and I'm looking in the mirror in the morning time and things don't look too good things just don't look too good but when I look into that mirror I'm seeing something more than a dying W Martin I've got an expectation and I say Lord I'm still here on this Earth brother brandom says if you weren't if your purpose was finished you God would take you and I just look at myself in the mirror and I say you're still here and you've still got a purpose that's right I look at that old these old baggy eyes and amen my the the eyes are no longer clear anymore and amen but what I can see is amen I'm saying I am living under an expectation for the supernatural amen when I'm going to the store I'm always under my breath saying God give me somebody to touch amen as I as wherever I go in the job or amen whether wherever it is God let your Supernatural presence be with me let me talk to somebody about this hope that lies within me give me an opportunity to let the hold come on Church why because I'm a Son of God I've been ordained in this day the eyes of my understanding has been enlightened by this message and the Holy Ghost of power has anointed me to bring victory to this generation I have a purpose can you say amen glory to God now I remember when I was a kid I'll just tell y'all a story before I move on Amen my hair story wasn't in the notes and so I remember on the bus going to votch we were homeschooled I graduated at 16 and um but I continued going to votek and uh we had to ride the bus for several miles from our little from sinina to Prior and um well I got known they they they would they would call me the preach well it wasn't that I was being a blabber mouth or anything like that it was just cuz I stuck to my myself uh quite a bit but they all started making fun and I remember a girl I would come over and try to sit on the front seat and that way I wouldn't have to worry about any other nonsense in the back a man I me the guys try to smoke cigarettes and try to do things and the and the bus driver was you know he would pull over and back then he could knock heads together can't do that today but and uh so I remember girls coming up I remember one girl especially trying to get my attention and asked me to her well she had her uh she had a mini skirt on and had her legs up there on my seat and so when I turned her around I mean Hallelujah and uh we're not Hallelujah Lord help me Jesus not hallelujah amen and so I I I'm looking and I'm and I'm I'm thinking how how disgusting and so I turn around and one boy came up during the during that year and he said what's different about you and I said 'well I know the Lord I'm a Christian and he said uh I I I want to be a Christian and I said you want to be a Christian I said well we can pray right here all you have to do is repent and ask the Lord to forgive you of your sins he said I'll do that well I was going to just take his hand and we were going to pray on the bus right he got down on the floor he knelt down on the on the floor and I led him through a sinner's prayer and he become my buddy and he says can I go to church with you and I said sure and I remember as 16 17 year old boy dad let me help him baptize him as a kid baptize that boy that I had led to the Lord and it was because of that others begin to ask questions and begin to to see what and and the reason I'm sidetracked here is because you have a purpose I I think how many's been enjoying the Wednesday nights it's not the preacher the the anointing is upon the bride the oneman ministry William brandham was the prophet to this age there can never be another Prophet we must line ourselves up with the message that was given only to that seventh angel messenger is that now what the scripture says unto the angel of Leota write these things then the leoan messenger now he's got that message he is delivering the message but once the message is delivered it's no longer in him it's now in you you you you you you you you you you it's no longer in the seventh angel messenger it is now now in the body of the Bride brother brenon would put it this way he would say Moses was God to the people he says he would come and the light the anointing would be upon him and it would shine until he have to put a veil over his face because the people were scared he says and then once he brought the word of the Lord to the people then he could take the veil back off because his glow was no longer there he says it was no longer in the prophet Moses now it's been delivered to the people when God gives us a messenger he's not up there to make himself look good he's given you the book The the thing was the open book Mighty angel coming down with an open book seventh angel is on the earth at the same time that the Mighty Angel comes amen the Revelation come to those seven angels coming down to that messenger and as he begins to declare then Revelations 10:8 says you go take the book and you eat the book because you've got something to do you're going to prophesy you've got a purpose come on Church there is an expectation in the bride amen there is a Ministry Tree in you not to sit there and wait for the amen for the you know the the the good old uh Rapture to come you've got a purpose here on this Earth you sayen now it's your attitude if you're putting it all in the preacher that's the wrong attitude if you're putting it all in the prophet that's the wrong attitude if you're putting it come on now amen it's the nickel lean Antichrist spirit that wants to take the anointing away from the church that wants to put it on a few holy men amen and I'm not just a holy amen we ain't looking just a few guys that we've lifted up amen a few musicians a few singers a few preachers but God's called a bride body we're a part of that bride body can you say say Amen well glory to God Amen don't you just love him amen it's the attitude that's what brings the results amen that's what brings the results brother Brandon would say he said you can put an egg on Up Under a pup and it hatch the chicken just the same amen I put it in the incubator it'll bring the chicken just the same it's the atmosphere hallelujah amen he says he says what we need uh is a holy ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of God is a moving one Accord one place gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders let's move ourselves up somebody say let's move ourselves up look to your neighbor and say let's move up let's move up into that bracket Step Up in faith move out of these Dimensions up here into the next one oh glory to God Amen if you're getting thirsty enough if you get thirsty enough you're going to want some water amen if you get hungry enough for God then God's there to meet you but there's got to be a hunger and expectation a thirst well praise the Lord do you love him amen he says the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than anything else there is in the world your prestige your life your job your anything that there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it come on Church the Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you you young people than everything else in this world your prestige your life your job your anything there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most you say well I'm afraid amen that they my work I I'm afraid that my husband my I don't be afraid let that be first place let everything else go let that be first well I expect to get it one of these days brother Brandon not one of these days now this is the time let it be the first before I do anything else let me have it right now desperate amen that would help answer our question when you get desperate for it really you've got to have it or you die I'm here to tell you today I've had enough church I've had enough religion I've had enough a dry experience I want the presence of God I want you young people to get that same kind of an attitude I want this more than a job I want this more than a track I want this more than a Prestige I need God I need God I need God I need the Holy Ghost you amen amen keep praying he says keep praying keep praying just keep praying oh Lord there's one thing could keep us that could keep a spontaneous healing service and that would be unbelief I've noticed around over the crowd as I look out there through here Lord that little streak of dark trying to hold back the Glorious light Yonder that is circling around trying to find its way down through that Darkness to touch somebody oh Father give me strength Give Me Faith come on church amen are are you hearing what the prophet is saying the pillar of fire circling around but there's a Darkness it's that darkness of unbelief it's that darkness of mediocrity it's that darkness of laxness it's that Darkness amen that I I I believe in a prophet I believe in God the devil knows that there was a prophet the devil believes in a God you've got to have an experience with that God you can't say my Daddy's got an experience or my mama's got an experience you've got to have that Supernatural God in your life come on church amen when go to Camp we're not going to feel good we're not going for emotions although that's all part of it I want that word to energize my soul until there is something down on the inside of me that never lets me go you'll have an emotion you'll have an experience when that so down on the inside of you has been ignited when the presence of God comes in it stirs everything within you can you say amen yes sir now he says that little streak of dark trying to hold back that glorious light y that circling around trying to find its way through the darkness to touch somebody he said May the people understand that you have proved Lord that I'm telling them the truth how many believes that brother brandham has told us the truth how many can see the supernatural Cloud the supernatural the supernatural Pillar of Fire that Pillar of Fire has been taken the picture of many many times brother Josh sister Loretta amen Went to went to Washington here the other the other day amen and went to the what is that uh uh what is the name of that the Library of Congress that's the woman that was there amen the Library of Congress amen and they walked up and they said there's a supernatural picture in here of of a of a of a of a a pillar of fire amen and they've got they've got all of these Supernatural things it's unexplainable but yet it's it's it's true and they amen and they brought out the picture of the pillar of fire over brother bram's head and they say this is the most asked sought-after picture of everything we've got in here well glory to God even science has to prove it come on now it's there it's there we're not making this stuff up the FBI did look at it they did do their forensic and testing they did do they did say it is a supernatural light but we don't need that picture we don't have to have that picture because every time brother bradam says that circle of light is resting over you then he would tell you your name and your address and what you've done 20 years ago and what come on Church there was no other explanation brother brandham wasn't smart enough I got to thinking about all the names have you just stopped to think just just the next time just start writing names down every time brother bram's Discerning and telling them names how out of 30 years of telling them their names and their address could he get it right every time because he was under expectation he knew who he was Saints I'm not a prophet therefore I'm not expecting to be a prophet but I am the bride the prophet said you're going to be a glorious bride he said there is going to be a super race a super Church who under their M messenger will become amen the final voice are are y'all understand you are that bride what are you expecting amen May the people understand that I'm telling them the truth you said when you was here on Earth if I do not the works of my father then believe me not if I do not the works of my savior then may they not believe me but Lord you are doing the same works that you did when you was here on the earth and I pray now that they do believe in a portion Give Me Faith to break the Blackness from over them Lord that that Power and Light Of God might fall upon every soul in here that it might heal every one of them Satan you're exposed you're a devil you're trying to hold this group I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ come out of the people and leave them alone and I say amen somebody say so be it so be it I want unbelief away from me I want all doubting Spirits away from me I want to fulfill my purpose give me the ability to say so be [Applause] it can you say amen amen expectation now Elijah amen was under the expectation of the fire to fall he had restored the altar of the Lord there in First Kings man 18 and 30 it says Elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people come un near I came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down now it's interesting that God says I'm going to send you a Elijah the same one that restored the altar of the Lord is the same one that is going to restore the people's Faith the people's confidence back to the fathers can you say amen amen watch this he was under expectation if you go on down there to the 36th verse and it came to pass that at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice are we in the evening lights that Elijah the prophet came near and said said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word now the prophet our Prophet said now see he was a prophet he wouldn't have dared said those things he wouldn't have dared done those things except he had seen a vision he was God's Prophet to restore Israel back back to the Living God come on Church hallelujah amen and God has done that in this day too there has been a Vindicated Prophet to restore your expectation back to the supernatural Hallelujah well glory to God am I doing all right here this morning glory to God I'm under expectation amen now brother brandom the visible Union of the Bride he said now before Closing one time I was up in the Glacier National Park and we heard all day long that they had a that they had a glacier fire that was going to fall at night so the people were busy all day long getting the thing ready because they was going to pour that fire out that night and they put a liquid fire falls and like a GL great Glacier of water and it looked like a rainbow almost it when it comes out and the fire falling out of this glacier all around through the through the park and wife and I and the children walked all around all throughout through the day and we wanted to stay to see that fire Expedition it was promised us that we would see it and we'd witness it someone say it was promised that we would see it and we'd witness it and they said we have it ever they said they they have it ever through the summer seasons and so forth and said well we'll be able will see it and they said we promised it tonight we're promised that they're up there getting it ready now and after all had been made ready for the event and that's what's taking place right now it's all being made ready for the event a church being pulled out for his name's sake taking his bride from amongst the world and these denominations and all the world and the filth and the things of the world everybody the event Was Made ready everybody was standing out and and they said keep watching right up to the top of that mountain there amen now notice all was ready everything had been kindled everything made ready and everybody was standing out and I had my head sticking up my arm around my wife and we was looking children standing there all of us looking up like that my it was something cuz we were expecting it it was a it was promised to us amen the word promises this it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the heart of the children back to the fathers it shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out my spirit from on high the former and the latter Reign shall come together in these last days these all these promises through the scriptures that's been given we're looking upward watch at that true bride Across the Nation this hour looking up Church he's coming one of these days just as sure as I as he come the first time he's coming again get everything ready separate yourself from the Shu lay before the sun and keep looking up be under expectation all at once we heard something from the top of the hill a voice come down through the loud speaker all things are ready all things are ready they've been waiting all day long they've been under expectation all day long they've been promised this all day long but the time come where the voice said all things are ready let this man standing right here to the end of the side of me man who says then this man standing at the side of me said Let the Fire Fall and hear it come pouring down across the mountain a glacier of fire blazing a licking a sight to behold brother let's get all things ready for one of these things the fire is going to fall we're going up let's get ready for the fire falling time we're in the last days we all know that we're ready for the coming of the Lord the thing to do is to separate yourself from all sin separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world don't love the world or the things that are in the world can I hear a great big amen I am living under expectation right man living under that expectation are you living under the expectation it's easy to say Amen when someone else is standing beside you screaming out amen but are you living under expectation not after the preacher and then the anointing comes you know the anointed preacher comes out and after a while you begin to feel the anointing oh I'm living under expectation because I'm living in the presence of God and the things that displease him is going to displease me and I'm going to learn to keep my mouth shut when I need to keep my mouth shut I'm going to learn to keep my my my attitudes right when I need to keep my attitudes right I'm going to learn to love amen when I need to be loving I'm going to learn to forgive when I need to be forgiving I I I'm going to learn to be praying amen when I need to be praying come on church I I I I'm living under an expectation where two or three are gathered together in my in my name I will be in their midst that means if me and my wife will gather together in prayer and around that word of God the anointing can come down in that living room with me when I lay hands on the sick the scripture says that you shall lay hands on the sick and they sh shall recover I've got a responsibility to live in that presence I've got a responsibility to believe I've got an responsibility to to uh expect can you see man now as we get ready to close I want to give another story that brother bradam told about a a brother by the name of Levi am man and he he was a a little preacher and he said he was telling me of a little story once and he said that when this certain people is wife they were staying with they had all gathered all his stuff up and old broke up truck and started out of town and he said his wife he said she said did you know what I ought to have gotten got a drink of water before I left that place said I'm thirsty and um he saidwell honey there there's a hydrant she said well go on till you hit a better place you see he went a little further and he said there's another hydrant she said well let's just go on ahead you see but said when she got out into the country where there was no pump and she was just fighting for a drink of water and said after a while way over in a field was a little old country pump way out in the field Plum across through a bunch of cattle and she was afraid of cattle but he said but she said Levi I've just got to have a drink of water so he stopped the car and said before he could even get the car hardly stopped She Was Out and and and had that cutting across the fence and she had to have water and when God becomes that real to you when you start thirsting like that that it's either God or you'll die you can't stand it any longer than something's going to happen you get to business then with God and that's when it takes place I've got to have you or I die I've got to have a drink of that Supernatural because I'm a human we all know we're humans we all comb our hair we all go to work we're humans we got our jobs we got our we got our families we go to school but inside that body of yours is a predestination need it's so and it's thirsty it's longing for God it's thirsty it's got something it's craving you try it to satisfy it with pleasures and drown it out with your games and try to drown it out with your things but after a while you just get so thirsty you've got to have God after a while you can feel thirsty you've got to have the Holy Ghost or die you can't just go to church you can't just listen to a tape anymore that's church is fine listening to tape is good but to an unregenerated heart it means nothing even though that heart is predestinated ated Moses was born with a purpose predestinated to be a prophet but when he took a when he killed that Egyptian because of that something on the inside of him and then he ran away the prophet of God says 40 years later Moses had already forgot about Egypt about being a deliverer it was not in him but when that came when that came real when that reality came down into h him at the burning bush there was nothing that was going to take it out of him anymore are you hearing me hungry are you thirsty for God I know he's near the Apostle Paul says fill after him while he is near reach him while he can be found he's not in no one could see the light except for when God allowed the picture to be taken but we knew the light was present because that Prophet was a had a transmitter to see in that other realm he seen the light the vision came before him it was just like seeing me seeing you he simply told what he saw you and I aren't prophets we can't see it but the prophet has already declared that he's here so we can live under expectation I'm not leaving until I get it I I'm not turning around until I get it I am going I must get something to drink if the musicians would come living under expectation Moses or Elijah he repaired the altar he told him to dig around with the trench put Barrel after barrel of water over the sacrifice and over I mean he made it and then he comes and kneels down before the Lord and says I've done all of this at your command I follow the vision I know what's going to happen next Let the Fire Fall the prophet has rebuilt the altar brought the supernatural before us and he says the bride must expect the fire to fall The Rapture is in order the presence of God Among the people and in the [Music] people is the Cry of the day it means I can expect right there beside the prophet I didn't even have the vision but I know he did and he rebuilt The Altar and he said now you can expect the fire to fall that's just as good to me as seeing the vision myself the prophet has spoke it he's never been wrong I can AC I can accept those words and expect the promise to come to [Music] pass oh that makes my heart just want to do a couple of Skips and some Pitter patters and it's an expectation are you thirsting are you feeling your hunger and your thirst with other things repent the Zeal of this age is repent if you're not where you need to be repent for God who was rich in Mercy for his great love has come to this age so that you could see clearly the path and there is still a lamb that is still bleeding there's plenty of blood you say brother Wendell I I I I I'm a backslider there's still plenty of Blood Brother W I've done some pretty bad things there's plenty of blood the elect of God will never exhaust the blood of Jesus Christ are you hearing me don't let anything keep you from a genuine repentance in your heart if you have failed come back to God don't leave don't step there in in condemnation don't sit there in in in well I get get get get out of this and let your soul begin to thrive and the only way that you can start expecting is to have all of your sins washed away the only way that you're going to be able to truly expect is when your heart isn't condemning you and everything between you and God is made right and you and stand up and say Satan I'm here with a purpose if you're a young man or a young woman that needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope that that cry gets so great in you I [Music] pray that the Holy Ghost would do something so real in this service tonight's service in the Youth Camp that is [Music] coming I remember my [Music] niece Hannah she was not just a real outgoing person just sort of shy and even had a few complexes you know great piano player great just a real Precious just a real Precious dog of God but I remember she said I want the Holy Ghost she said I'm going to go down to Louisiana camp and I want the Holy Ghost and when she went down to that Campground she she was one of the first in the services and she was always the last in the services and and she had been fasting that entire time all through Camp all of her friends they would they enjoyed the services but they weren't quite thirsting like she was thirsting she went to Captain for a reason first service came and gone second service came and gone and we had received a a text or a call or something and said pray for Hannah she's still not satisfied she wants the Holy Ghost we begin to pray we're all praying and I believe mom wasn't that the last service the last service Hannah had been fasting Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday went through six services and at the end of that last service she's there at the altar you promised me you'd fill me with the Holy Ghost and the glory of God came down upon Hannah and filled Hannah with the baptism of the Holy Ghost she was thirsting she was thirsting and it got to the point she didn't didn't care if she had to cry in the fence wait through cows and maneu she had to get to the well I see if you want it you got to want it more than you want it you got get more more than you want to play drums or guitar piano singing a choir you got to want it more than playing basketball with your friends you got to want it more than having a business got to want more than preaching a sermon [Music] if you're thirsty there's a reason you're thirsty because your body is made up of water when you get dehydrated you got to have some thirst your mouth gets parched your lips will crack your tongue gets thick I've been thirsty can't hardly swallow anymore you feel like you're going to swallow your tongue but when you get the water it quenches The Thirst and on the inside of that predestinated Soul there's something that no one nothing else can feel but God nothing else can fulfill that desire I can't pump you up I can't give you desire either you got it or you don't if you've got something in here that is craving and you've tried it here and you've tried it there and you still end up empty and dirty and if you've got the craving there's more of God to be [Music] had why does the chicken not look up to the sky and just sit there and dream about flying he's got his head down pecking but why does the eagle in the chicken pin hatched under the egg or hatched under the H why was his heart always looking up chickens don't soar in the sky as Eagles do and because there was a cry in the heart of the eagle saying I want to go to the heavens God sent mama up to him and said Come On Son you're not a chicken and when he heard the Cry of Mama screaming and he looked up and saw that great Majestic bird chickens didn't see it chickens didn't hear Mama screaming like that and getting too close those chickens go to the CPE they're going to hide eagland you heard Mama saying come on come on and when you come in the presence of God that's what he's saying come on I love you you're mine yeah you born in that body but that soul is predestinated come [Music] on he the hunger we thank you [Music] Lord thank you for your presence thank you for desire thank you for that something that when we get up in the morning time that little something that I saying I want more of you sometimes going to bed it just feels so empty and you think back over the day and you thought
