I have received Mercy amen I'm thankful for that good to see everyone here tonight and and um here on a Wednesday night and we just say God bless you and um good to good to see uh brother Aaron over there on the drums and and uh we appreciate him and learning the drums and uh so I'm just so excited uh for that and I think I think he's doing pretty good amen it's good to see everyone let's look here in the Book of Romans I um uh I was going to start the um the get back on the church ages tonight and um um and and I've had a sister that has been ready for those Church ages and and um and she's not here she's in the hospital and and so I thought um that I would I would wait until Denise gets out we'll start it next week so whether she's in or out amen we'll we'll start it again next week but um but we are going to um Minister along the lines is is what we're fixing to go into in the church ages is the is um the two judgments and um so I thought that I would Minister here tonight amen uh and just title it Mercy versus judgment J and um so let's look here in the Book of Romans 1 and6 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God un salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness now this is incredible holding the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God has shown it unto them for uh the invisible things of him from the creation of the world is clearly seeing being understood by things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they become fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man to birds and four-footed Beast and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever and amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we are so thankful to you tonight for the blood of Jesus we're so thankful for Mercy Lord we're thankful that we can gather together and we can worship you we can love you Lord and not worshiping a a dead Idol but Lord is I heard brother murl praying and wanting your presence to be among us father that's the desire of every one of us we want your presence to ever be with us Lord the Living God and Father we ask that you would just come now as we have read your word and that you would help me Lord as to say only as you would direct Lord and may you just bring our hearts and teach us Lord what you want us to know and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated if you still have your Bibles open I would like to continue to read now we just we just read that the I'm not ashamed of the Gospel there in 16 and 17 for it is the power of God under salvation and then we read from 18 down to the 23rd how that they've changed things they've known God they've known the ways of God they they were without excuse but yet they've chosen uh the creature over the Creator and then we see there in the 24th verse where where he where the Apostle Paul says now God has given them over to a repeate mind and and so we want to continue on in this 26th verse for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change change the natural use into that which is against nature likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a repeate mind to do those things things which are convenient being filled with unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness malice maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to Parents Without understanding coven uh Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable and merciful who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death and not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them now I got to thinking as I um listening to uh watching um a few things on the inauguration and and and um um there was a woman Bishop how how many heard that woman Bishop um you know and um reprimanding you know she was she was talking her whole sermon was to the President and Vice President and uh speaking on unity and praying for Unity and and um you know and her Unity is the community across diversity and Division and teaching to hold uh multiple perspectives and life experiences as valid and worthy of respect and she admonished president Trump in the name of God she's as Presbyterian Bishop she's never she never as everything I heard never used invoked the name Jesus but she was instructing him and pleading with him to be merciful to the gays and the lesbians and the transgender children and they're fearing for their lives and and she just goes on and on and on and on and and first of all thinking of the Blasphemous behavior of any kind of a preacher that would have an opportunity to use this as a national International um platform to to to to preach the word and let alone she she was out of her place in the first place she is the Apostle Paul says in Timothy I suffer not a woman to teach nor usurp authority over a man but she is commanded to be in silence and under subjection but we as we as we begin to think about this and I as we are in the church age book and and we're looking at the judgments and we're seeing as we're fixing to get into the two judgments that there are there is a judgment that happens here on Earth and then there will be a judgment that'll take place the white Throne judgment that'll take place a thousand years after the Rapture so there are two judgments that are taking that that are going to take place and the word is the very thing that is to judge us now so the believer will will never stand as the bride of Christ we will never stand uh uh before the Judgment seat of that white Throne judgment but we are being judged right now with the scriptures now it's important don't you think that that's important to let people know where they are it it's it's important you see we don't want to blend in we we want to be respectful of all people we want to love all people we we we we definitely don't wish harm I I seen somebody on the on the on the U the prayer page the other day uh saying praying for for uh all of those there in California of course we're praying for those because those are real genuine people they're they're genuine people they've lost lives they've lost they've lost homes but yet we know they're under judgment and we know that sin is is bringing the judgments on the earth and yet it should behoove you and I the responsibility of me and you amen you and me uh to to get it right and to and and to be a voice of Mercy to this dying generation how are you going to a voice of Mercy tell them the truth of God's word now now how many of you children just just read are just understood for those of you that that you know you a lot of us here we know that there's lesbians and you know girls liking girls and boys liking boys and and and and there's all of these transgenders things now did y'all just read here in the Bible that I when I just read this to y'all did y'all hear what God said about it did did you all hear that now is that is that Bible that that's Bible and yet that preacher who shouldn't even she has no right to be there in the first place but there she takes her International audience and instead of standing pres president I listen I I am not here to defend any politician let them do what they're going to do but I will say that President Trump did say the day before or we're going to get back to where there's only two genders a male and a female what what well that's Bible done it he made he made those things we we're not going to be butchering our children anymore if I have my way we're going to make sure that we're going to protect and yet she is coming in and and and instead she's taking the side of sin all in the name of mercy be merciful now I want you to look here in in Ezekiel 3 And1 17 and and if you want to turn there go ahead and turn there because I I want you kids to see this as well uh I I've got it marked uh in in and and I think it's I think it's very important Ezekiel 3 and 17 and I I I I believe our as the Bride of Jesus Christ We Are The Watchmen we we are God's voice how many believes that that you are the final voice to the final age now now look at Ezekiel 3 and 17 you you kids family well good good for you amen it says son of man I have made thee a Watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the word of my mouth and give them warning from me and when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speak uh nor speakest to warn the wicked from his way to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand yet if you War the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity would he yet uh but thou Hast delivered thy Soul so so we can see when God's word we we don't we we don't question God's word in the slightest when God's word says anything who are you to be afraid or ashamed to stand up for that word if God said it then you need to be bold enough to believe it and stand for it because there's somebody that needs to hear that and amen I I'm I'm not I listen I Don't Want to Go to Heaven by myself I want to take every lesbian I want to take every homosexual I want to take every transgender that I can find with me I want to show them the right way so that they well can you say Amen how many believes God that God loves alcoholics sure he does that's why he gave his word how many believes God loves uh transgender and and and homosexuals God loves them with an eternal love amen and God gave his word and when God gives us his word amen you and I then we're responsible for the knowledge that God has given us amen now look let's let's look at the mercy of God first 1 Timothy 5 and 24 the scripture says some men sins or yeah you can you can turn there that's that's all right we'll we we'll take our time here for a few moments first 1 Timothy 5 and 24 it says some men's sins are open beforehand going before the judgment and some men uh they follow after so so we can understand that there is there is those that are that that there are those who who are who are going to to God's going to show them uh his words it'll be the same books that are open today that'll be the same books that are open on the Judgment Day amen at the white Throne judgment the same books that are going to judge the people is the same book that you are being judged with right now the same word that you are receiving in your heart and you're repenting of those sins in your heart and you're making them right is going to be the exact same word that they're going to have to stand on on the day of judgment the only the only difference is is you have the opportunity to wash your garments to repent of those sins that you are doing you don't put those things under the rug you don't say well I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ so it doesn't matter what I do you don't know God loves you you're his bride you've taken his word and you have washed your garments you've washed the sins well glory to God the Bible says that you are going to be spotless pure undefiled Why by the washing of the Water by the word on judgment day at the white Throne judgment it's nothing but judgment on Judgment Day there is no saying sorry there is no there is no recourse there is no place to go can you say amen I think this is this is amazing amen so some men sins are open beforehand and the some men they follow second or 1 Peter 4 and 17 we can turn there too and I think these are these are good scriptures to turn to we um we we definitely appreciate the U uh the the the board but uh the these are good to write down amen and because brother Brandon's going to be talking about it in the church age book on the next lesson amen so 4 and 17 uh uh first Peter and it says for the time has come that judgment must be began at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear you see what I'm saying so so here we stand here tonight and I think that there is a great responsibility on our shoulders now we look amen I'm wondering what kind of a Jesus is the world looking at it it it what kind of a Jesus now now I I brought some now if I were to sit here and tell you that this here amen is is an advocado what would you say amen why why is it that you can tell me what do you know what this is amen so why is it that you can tell me that this is lemon is because you know it for a fact I can try to tell you that it's an avocado but you've already know what it is right because we've already had an avocado I Hallelujah right here so there is an avocado and there is a lemon now what I just read in the scripture is just as real our opening scripture about homosexuality and lesbianism transgenderism that is such as real as this being a lemon and this being an advocado how is it it how is it that Jesus has become the figment of these people's imagination they think because they can't see him they think because they don't they can't see Christ they can make up whatever they want to of Christ sure and you know what the world is buying it the world world is buying it right see I I I could I could I could tell you anything if you don't know it if you didn't know my wife if you didn't know my if you'd never seen my wife and I have done this before amen I I I I've used this illustration uh when I went uh uh and preach places where they don't know me and and I'll tell them now my wife my wife will be here a little bit later on she's a blonde headed woman she's she's uh she she she's slim she's tall and uh she's got and I and and I'll just and I'll just put it out there and when you all see her amen make sure you let her know who she and and and and and and they're looking they come back and and and I'm preaching along these same lines and and then someone raises their hand and and and laughing and I say can I help you and they say we know what your wife looks like I've talked to your wife she is is not blonde she is a Cherokee Indian I had the rest of the people fooled I had the in all of the rest of them fooled but the woman that knew my wife says ain't buying [Music] it there's a lot of people claiming that they know Jesus and they don't have the slightest idea who he is for Jesus according to St John five uh uh St John 1 amen hope this uh don't go too slow but I just thought I'd take this evening and and enjoy and enjoy a little bit of teaching but there in 1 John 1 And1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God God the Apostle Paul that we just started out what's the very first thing that we read from the Apostle Paul I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God under salvation in the beginning was the Gospel was the word the word was with God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God now going on down to the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so if you want to see Jesus today you're going to see his word living in human beings you see you see what I'm saying so so what are you looking at amen what what what if I what if y'all never seen uh uh uh uh you know I I I I seen I think the girls must have forgot uh their their uh their vacuum cleaner over here amen and and you know but I I I was I I was if you never seen a vacuum cleaner before amen and you kids had this had this vacuum cleaner and you and and you come and you turn it on and and and I could tell you how good that vacuum that that vac that vacuum cleaner is amen anyways so I could I could tell you how H how good this vacuum cleaner is and and and and how uh uh but but you see until you've experienced it until you know what it is then you could be duped by me you could be duped you could think you could think well well you know I you know I could I could tell you I don't know I could tell you that it's that it's a um a carpet cleaner or or or something like that huh it's a shampoo no okay is that is that thing making something Hallelujah I Tred but you can you can see how that if you don't know what it is I can convince you of of I can convince you one way or another but when you know what you know and you then you can believe what you believe then there is nobody that can ever take that away from you because you have experienced it for himself can you say Amen now amen now I want you to I want you to look here let's look here I want to show you something else let's let's look at something here in Mark Mark the 4th uh chapter and the um Matthew Mark Luke and we're going to start here at the 17th verse let's see uh Mark our 12th verse amen huh well what things things Hallelujah amen now there there Mark 4 4 and 12 amen it says that sing let's see let let's let's let's go to the 11th verse and he said unto them unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them so now they were asking if you were to go on up to the 10th verse when he says when he was alone they they asked him about the parable why why are you doing this in Parables he says because they're going to see and think they know what they're what they're seeing but they don't understand what they're they know nothing about it hearing they think they're they they've got all of this all here but they're not understanding it but he says but unto you is given to know the mystery of God can you say Amen now now now I I I I am the one that brought that up here and it just my it just didn't work I was I I tried it my office while ago and I plugged it up and it would just blow and steam out everywhere and I thought this is going to be great they're going to think it's a a vacuum sweeper and it didn't work amen but you see we the the the the so we want to we want to have an understanding of what Jesus we are looking at what if what if we thought we were we we were right and then we were deceived what if we thought that we knew the right way and we and and and and and we've known the wrong way the whole time but thanks be to the Lord that he gives us his Bible and he sends us a prophet to tell us go back to the Bible and that's what we have been taught now now this is what brother brandham would teach us he says now and and and he was talking about the the place over in India I believe it was there there in India and and he said U he um let's see no that's not it um uh he's talking about Shadrach Meshach and ab bedo he said did you ever notice the innocence of it and who that image was made of he said it was made of Daniel the image of a man he he didn't he didn't he say the spirits of the Gods Heathen as we are today we've got three and four of them the the spirits of the Gods lives in him and made they made an image unto Daniel and he said all that won't make bow to that image will be thrown into the fiery furnace now you notice Daniel is off the scene at that time get what I mean ever who would not bow to that image would be cut to pieces or thrown into lions or burned in the fiery furnace or something as a punishment and that's the way the Gentile dispensation begin with a pagan form of religious worship with the persecution of them who bow to it uh to make them bow to it and the Bible predicts it'll end the same way a holy man Jesus Christ an image to him to worship it and so forth so so brother bradam is telling us just as there in the Gentile when as it began with the Gentiles and they were all they we are all cre uh uh uh demanded to worship this this image of a holy man so is it going to be in the last days that the church is not going to worship Christ but an image like unto Christ a merciful loving uh one one that is inclusive one that is God so loved the world right and they they they have built this image unto the people amen another place there in the spoken word is original scene brother brandham says the Protestant hasn't got Jesus it's got a denomination the same thing an image unto the Beast amen so so we we want to re remember chain they changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator amen now now there as I was saying a while ago about that about that man in India that was healed and and he comes up there and he was you know the blind man brother Bram sees the vision of him he tells him of his past and tells him how while he came there how many children he had and all that and he turned around to the religious leaders of the world and he says now Gentlemen of the religions of the world your religion can do anything for this man he I said no more uh than than what to change his way of thinking you say well he's a son worshipper he went blind sincere in heart believed he was worshiping God uh he's he's worshiped the creature uh instead of the Creator the creation instead of the uh the Creator I said but he did it I said now uh why do you want to make a Jane out of him well you would tell him he was wrong and then that he should worship the insects uh what if what if you want to make him a cow worshipper you you would tell him he was wrong and worship the cow uh for the Muhammad the same way the Buddha the same way you would only change his way of thinking which is psychology he says we have the same thing in America only we don't have different gods but a man wants to make a Methodist out of a Baptist a Baptist wants to make a presbyterian out of the Lutheran the Pentecostal wants to to wants to assemblies out of the uh uh Oneness and the Oneness you know something out of something else what is it it's psychology that's right God saved certainly one true and living God it calls men to worship and we've got that in America the only only another form we only have one God but we have a lot of these different organizations that tries to make people think it's the it's the Methodist way or the Pentecostal way the Church of God way and it's just psychology but no matter what church you belong to if he isn't born again he is lost he said just another form the same devil it's just under another form thinking they're worshiping because they are Baptist or Pentecostal or they're Presbyterian or whatever and that makes them feel that they are right that makes them feel and and and now don't ever let that be that we just because we are message Believers that we're just trying to get convert people over to our way of thinking that is not the way it is it is a living God living in his word right now and that's why we've got to be born again so we're not trying to convert you children or convert uh uh the the world to to bromism we're bringing them to the present day scripture and if you don't see scripture today then you're the same as the Jews they could understand Moses but they could not see Jesus as the Living Word because Jesus doesn't want it just here Jesus was the word and that's what God is doing for us that's why we want the baptism of the Holy Ghost because only a born again person can truly reflect these scriptures in our lives yall understand what I'm saying so you can you can say well U you're in the wrong denomination you need to you need to come over here to and and and we and and how many how many has has has seen folks uh so excited when they first come to our church a new way of thinking it was all brand new H wow this is man and they but after a while it means nothing to to them see it's not converting somebody over to a new way you've got to be born again and then and only then can your body house the uh uh the The Living Word Jesus Christ can you say Amen Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me Hallelujah so so what was Jesus he said okay take your Bible don't dismiss it Jesus says here's the Bible take it read it here I am and they they're saying well but Moses see they couldn't see the present day scripture therefore they died they went into predition because God is in his word and God's revelation comes to us and when you refuse the light of the word as it comes then you must die how many how many remembers what it used to be uh what it was like there in in uh in the wilderness they they they were to follow the pillar of fire amen when the pillar of fire stopped then they would come and they they would put up their tents and then when the when the pillar of fire started moving on they had to pick up their tents amen the Levites had to get in order they had to take off amen and and and and anyone that that was left behind that says hey I just got here and put up my tent last night and I sure don't want to pick it back up amen they were left in the dark to wander without God and and and they perished in the wilderness okay so it is it's a type for you and me we want to always walk with God can you say amen amen John 10:37 says if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me I'm talking about a real genuine Jesus it was a real genuine God in the book body of Jesus Christ there's nothing mythical about it the Old Testament there was nothing mythical about it it was the pillar of fire that would come down amen before the people in the days of Jesus it was Jesus Christ the great God of Glory coming down God vindicating that he was alive and I just want to tell you today that God is still alive today and that he's vindicating himself by living in your body Oh Glory to God can you say amen amen that's that's exactly right amen so then we search the scripture to see what Jesus was to be and then you would see amen that he would that the Bible says he would heal the Blind and that he would set the captives free and that the spirit of the Lord God would be upon him and that this man would be the deliverer he would be the Messiah this would be the one oh glory to God Amen the Pharisees didn't understand him they were saying no you're not amen but the woman of the well says I have read the scripture you're the man you're the one we've been looking for you're that one this woman was a harlot this woman was a bad bad woman but God did not amen dumb down or water down the message to her amen it was the message that told her that says hey go get your husband she said I don't have it he goes well yeah you're right' you've had five and the one you're living with now is not yours she had a choice I perceive that you're the Messiah you're a prophet we've been told that when you come you were going to be that way see see it was God in the body of Jesus Christ not in the temple God doesn't live in temples God doesn't live in in in in in in in houses and things of that nature Hebrews 10:5 it says wherefore when he come into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me God had a body acts 747 if you want to write them down but Solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stool what house will you build me sayeth the Lord what is the place of my rest see see it was it was not there there was nothing that a that a that a human could build for God but he says a body I'm looking for a body I've prepared a body I've prepared Oh Glory to God and what did Jesus do Jesus came to redeem us so that we would have be temples Tabernacle tabernacling the very God Almighty right here in leot to see why don't don't don't put that under a bushel don't be ashamed of who you are you are the Tabernacle of the most high God it's his word living in you he says I'll write my word in your heart I'll write my law in your mind amen you're going to they're going to know that you're my sons you're that I'm your a father and this is what God's desire is amen aren't you glad that God loves you yes amen now what did what did Jesus do Jesus just got through driving out all of the cellers out of the temple you take plated plated rope and I mean he went in there and they they had turned turned the temple into a a a just a a Big Show and selling and and making money and and so uh Jesus goes and and turns over all their money tables and and he says my house shall be called The House of Prayer y'all remember that and so so the the Ang the leaders were angry he says give us proof give us proof that you are who you are and this is what Jesus answered him there in John 2:18 it says then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou has done thou doest these things Jesus answered and said destroy this Temple and 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 40 and six years was this temple in building wil thou rare it in three days but he spoke of the Temple of his body they couldn't recognize that he was the temple there's a song that we used to sing and you kids probably still sing it in Sunday school and things we I think occasionally sing it here no you not know you not you are the temple know ye not know you not you are the temple know you not know ye not you are the temple you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost filled with praise filled with power filled with glory amen when when the disciples were ask and it was it was Philip there in in in John 147 Philip was saying show us the father amen and Jesus turned around and says have I not been so long A Time With You Phillip and you don't know who I am when you've seen me you've seen the father I'm his Temple oh now now what about what about the scripture that says there in first first uh uh First Corinthians let me see if I can get to First Corinthians here amen 1 Corinthians 6:19 it says what no ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you you become God was in his temple in Jesus that's what they just got through saying there in Acts he was in his Temple Hallelujah Jesus was telling him I'm going to go to the Grave destroy this Temple and three days I'll raise it up again they couldn't understand it and I want to tell you you are the temple of of the most high God you live his character you live his word it's part of who you are sure you make your mistak sure you you you have to repent of your sins sure there's plenty of those things amen but there's a different in sin singular and sins plural sin singular a is what that woman committed it's blasphemy it is unbelief do not believe the word of God but there are sins amen it's not the sin unto death brother Brandon would tell us amen that that the sin amen he said it should be translated is translated in in the in the Greek amen the death the death the sin unbelief but you and I don't have the death we don't have the sin we have spots we have stuff on us amen that don't belong we were born and shape and in iniquity but yet our souls were ordained of God so God gives us his word word to wash us to cleanse us amen and and when we're wrong we simply amen we take we take of that and we wash Hallelujah I'm always getting stuff on my tie and my clothes amen but I have to get something and wash it and get all the spots off of me because the Bible says we're going to be without spot wrinkle or blemish you've got to take the word of God don't you don't you sit there and and and justify your sin don't sit there and justify ify your wrongs it's a merciful god that has opened the book unto every one of us in this day and said wash wash wash you're going to be my bride without spot without wrinkle or any such blemish it's God's mercy see but the sin unto death is to refuse and disbelieve can you say Amen you love him oh my amen now Jesus had said man he he he said you know I it says the I've been so long time with you he says believest Thou that I'm believest thou not that I'm in the Father the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen John John 14:6 he says believest Thou not that I'm in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not from myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the work sake verily verily I say unto you amen or listen listen for I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whosoever what's whatsoever ye shall ask in my name I will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it oh glory to God down at 17th verse he says even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I won't leave you comfortless I will come to you yet while and the world sees me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father ye in me and I in you now before it was father in me and I in the father but then he says when the Holy Ghost comes it's going to be you and me I and you we're all are y'all y'all understanding it's the it's the presence of God living oh how merciful oh how marvelous how wonderful God's Divine love to every one of us amen his presence his glory his his love being exhibited through US amen oh I love him here tonight amen amen that they're in the 16th chapter and I'm and I'm I'm wrapping it up here now John 16 and 16 it says yet a little while the world that you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to my father then said some of his disciples among themselves huh what is this that he saith unto us yet a little while a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while you shall see me because they go to the father and they said therefore what what what is this that he saith a little while and we cannot tell what he saith and Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him he was a prophet and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of that I said a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me verely verely I say unto You Weep uh or that you shall weep and Lament The World shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy and and he goes on down to the the the 22nd verse and now therefore have sorrow you now have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy shall no man take from you in that day one day when the Holy Spirit comes back upon you you shall ask me nothing very very I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you can you say Amen all right now I'm going to bring my thoughts together while they're trying to tell us that this ain't an apricot or uh an advocado well they're trying to tell us we've been given scripture if Jesus were to come today according to the scriptures just just just just the scriptures I just read tonight if Jesus were to come today when he was return as I've just read what do you think he would look like Deon what would Jesus look like yeah think he'd have a beard like that what do you think he'd look like yeah H what do you think he'd look like you going to take a guess yeah what would Jesus look like if he were to show up if he would walk in this church right now what would he look like brother mer what would Jesus look like if he were to walk in tonight he would be in a body brother brandom says if he were to walk in to the building tonight he would be wearing my suit we he would look just like me he would look just like you you are his Temple he said they want they're all looking for this when he comes he said the prophecy in in when he's preaching when he's preaching the uh indictment and he's preaching the uh the the uh uh the trial he says oh you guys are all saying oh when he comes we'll know him we'll know him he goes the only the only prophecy given for this day will be God living in his bride not to say that there's not a physical body you y'all's not wrong in that but God didn't promise that here God promised this body what will it be word made flesh you see how beautiful it is isn't it just beautiful and they didn't recognize it then and the goofies ain't going to recognize it today but it's done seeing that they can claim to see but they don't hearing they claim to hear but they don't but he says but unto you is given to know can you say Amen do you love him here tonight amen oh that's just beautiful hallelujah amen if the musicians would come oh blessed be the name of the Lord now brother Brandon would say how could you go hunt for a pumpkin and you had never seen one or never heard of one how could you go find a watermelon if you never knew never knowed what never know there was such a thing and how it looked how could you find a tub and think it it was or how you could you could find a tub and think that it was a watermelon you could find something else and you would think it a block and think it you find a block and think it was a watermelon cuz you've never seen a watermelon you've never seen a tub you've never seen a block so someone can come up there and give you a rock and say here's a watermelon well you'd never seen either one of them so you'd go oh wow watermelon and you're holding the Rock and then someone else comes in and says that's not a watermelon you say yes it is it's a watermelon look at that shiny nice little watermelon it's not a watermelon yes it is and you could argue and argue and argue but if the guy knows what a watermelon is and shows you the watermelon then your eyes are open and the world is is in these foggy glasses saying oh God's a god of love God oh God loves all people he does and he's given them his word Jesus is the Redeemer save us from our sins not save us in our sins save us from our sins all I can say is I'm glad God has put eyes Sab on my eyes does it make me boastful oh no no no it shouldn't make us boastful it should make us thankful should make us very humble it should make us want to let others know the goodness of the Lord to us listen this is what God gave let me let me share with you and if she wants to cling to a rock thinking it's a watermelon then there's nothing else you can do but there's going to be somebody somewhere that says thank you thank you I I want to I I I want to know I I I thank you somebody somebody somewhere wants to be saved from their sins there's got to be an alcoholic somewhere there got to be a transgender somewhere that'll lead the love of God and say come unto me surely there's something somewhere we've got the answer we're not living we're not looking down on down our nose at people and say oh You Filthy Rich they're humans just like you they got mamas and daddies just like you they've got children just like you they're they're they hurt like you hurt they're trying their best for their families just like you're trying your best for yours but we're God's mercy because if God has opened our eyes given us his word then we can take that word and and and and and express it that I become sometimes we wonder oh I wish sometimes we look back at our past and we'll look at our past and we'll say oh and and and Satan will hold that over your head hold it over you just just keep holding it over you then you don't realize that God allowed you to go through that Valley God allowed you to go through those mistakes so that he could open up your mind so that you could be a witness of his grace there's a real Jesus and I see [Music] him I see him in you there's a real Jesus I seen him in in in brother Bram I seen him but I would be pretty nearsighted or near nearsighted to just put it all on brother brandom that word that he gave us has now taken on flesh and KN that word that that that I give as I'm echoing it it's taking root in you and the word you believe y'all's being an expression to those even you girls are preachers not behind a pull pit but your preachers you're your preaching the gospel through your life you you you boys might not be preachers but you're preaching the gospel because there's a conviction in your heart the the the I was listening the book of Romans and uh uh uh uh I I I I listen uh I've been listening to Romans for for a long time now and I and I I I and I and I cut today or yesterday as as I was working I caught it he says he says the Holy Ghost comes upon you and your he says and the Gentiles who have not the law has the law written in their heart either excusing or condemning what he's saying is the work of the Holy Spirit within you the the spirit of the word living in you saying you shouldn't have done that you you you should correct that we're saying you're good you're fine it's the spirit of life in you aren't you glad for that aren't aren't aren there there are preachers there's that that that preacher that was up there surely she's got to read that Bible she's got to read it but nothing in her heart to say you're wrong and here we are just a bunch of little nobodies I mean she she was standing before the world she was she was preaching to the president and yet here we are the Holy Spirit stopping right here in pawy America saying you're wrong and you just take the word that God gives you you just dip it down there with your faith wipe it off said Lord forgive me for losing my temper God forgive me for not forgiv Mama such a hard time I know I'm not supposed to be mean to Mama and here I am acting
