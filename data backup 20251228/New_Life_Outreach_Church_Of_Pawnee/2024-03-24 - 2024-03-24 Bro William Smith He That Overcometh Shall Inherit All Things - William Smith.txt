they're just a little furry balls with legs on it that bark but when they jump into your lap and they put their little teeny head right here and lick your little ear you just fall in love with it if

already gave you his his kingdom yes eternal life forever more that's right oh I love him this morning if we can all stand and read the word of God this morning I just love him this morning if we can go to Revelations 21 and you're welcome to uh turn these monitors down some you can focus on the big ones but praise the Lord this thing's going to make a lot of Racket ain't it man I don't like holding the mics but W does so good with his but he has I found out he started putting it on his little vest and uh I'm too fat for casual vest so I can't do like our pastor does but we just thank the Lord this morning keep him in our prayers this morning you know he's he's an example that we can look on when it comes to being sick I've seen him many times be here preaching and holding it the best he can and then run to the bathroom and vomit and walk out the door and go home and uh so if he's home this morning we know that he's he's not capable to be here and uh cuz he don't miss church very often and so if you love your pastor I believe I would enter in to that secret place and pray for him this morning Revelations 21 and7 it says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and I shall and he shall be my son she shall be my daughter in first John 5 it says here from 1 John 5 And1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begotten loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not grieved for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God go back to Revelations for one more verse or one more yeah one more verse Revelations 2 and 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayi unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord God for this morning we

a toothache Lord it hurts it doesn't make us feel good and Lord he's going through this battle for a reason and we just ask you this morning to lift him up father God and give him rest in his heart

if two or three gathered in my name you'd be in the midst Lord and we feel you this morning Lord we thank you for your Holy Spirit Lord and Lord just be with us this morning we ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen hallelujah you love him this morning Hallelujah my thought and brother wend was preaching I uh had this written down in my my paper and Overcomer and uh and so when he was reading Wednesday night I thought oh my goodness this is on my paper and and here in the church age book at the very beginning that morning that that service he starts reading and I want to go over something here just for a moment for my my thought this morning and it was really really powerful and he says God intend his creation man to express his word in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life living by the word would be the word expressed that is true isn't it but did Adam live by the word no because he was a living he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word to me brothers and sisters we can take that ourselves as a daily portion to make make sure that we are living the Living Word sometimes we put ourselves in the way and God can't bless you and I because we put ourselves there we let our emotions overwhelm us sometimes we let this mind of ours start clicking and before long you get a complex over somebody and it's just the devil I've had many people come to me and apologize because they had a problem with me but they didn't even know understand why it's because of the devil you know I'm the type of person that if it's really serious I'll go to that person and tell them hey you know you're irritating me or or whatever but if it's just something little stupid things I just say you know you Old Devil back off of my sister or my brother right I look at it differently than some people that get complexes yes because the complexes I do get once in a while they're not fun but there is a remedy that's true amen there is a way that we become Overcomers and this morning morning I would like to speak here this morning on he that overcometh shall inherit all things now remember only Believers only the elect comes to it to that that God has chosen you I believe that in Revelations 2 says he that overcometh so it's a promise to Overcomers right right amen so you have been promised to be an overcomer that's right amen saints of God I would be getting very happy to know that I could be an overcomer amen I would be asking God how can I be more of an overcomer of me sometimes we we put our emphasis on Satan so much that he sits there and takes takes it because he's got you already thinking the other direction that's true and sometimes it's you sometimes it's brother William gets in the way of the flow of God coming down and giving us our portion that we can have strength to be an overcomer okay and sometimes we just need to sit back and say mind mind your own business yeah that's right amen that's good and get that mind being fed by this Mana that's right from this Mana that God has stored up for this day in this Wilderness every morning there's fresh Mana to eat that's right Hallelujah and so we have to come to a place that we believe in these promises if we don't believe in those promises then we're not going to get into the word to find out who we really are that's right if we say that we are the bride of Christ then we are getting ourselves ready am we're not going backwards but we're getting ourselves ready for a Rapture we're getting ourselves ready for a wedding supper we're getting ourselves ready to come back with God and destroy everything that ever tempts you you're getting ready to go to Eternity with God but it's lies down into your own Hearts you say I overcome I come over excuse me I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about these a whole lot more going to Christianity besides not smoking cigarettes or drinking whiskey he that overcome shall inherit all things and he will be my son she will be my daughter I will be his God I will be her God I will give him of the Hidden Mana the hidden Mana what is that hidden Mana we got people out in other churches today reading the scriptures and they're doing their little preaching and they're eating Mana but are they really realizing the true Mana of God that's coming down for this day to feed you little bride it's something that o makes you be an overcomer it makes you have faith it makes you believe it makes you have muscles of Faith to be an overcomer this day you're not relying on a church you're not relying on your pastor you're relying on every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God for your abortion for that day we get so worried about everybody else what about me brother William why aren't you worrying about yourself oh are you going to go in the Rapture sometimes we need to turn around and look in a mirror and say what about you sir what are you doing Mr hypocrite but we got to get to a place where we're feeding off of the Living Word of God only only that's right hallelujah amen he says I will hide him away I will give him the hidden things the world on the outside of this curtain don't know nothing about it it's a secret race it's a secret generation it's a love Affair between the king of kings and his little lady Esther he watches her in the Kingdom how she presents herself how she's asking what does a king like what does he what does he like me to wear if I go in to him what should I do how should I walk how should I talk just be yourself be Sons and Daughters of God that's what he wants yes he wants you to know this so much that this becomes you praise be to God you get what I mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God now listen to this this is this is awesome every one of you in here have been born by a woman right and when you were born you were a son or you as a daughter to that little lady that birthed you and that Daddy that's sitting over there white fixing to pass out but you are Sons but do you realize Church you were Sons and Daughters of God before you were even in her belly before you were even thought of as a mom and daddy coming into this Earth you were already Sons and Daughters of God one day when the word come by you said wait a minute something clicked in your mind something went down into your heart and you said wait a minute I want to serve that God and you go to the altar you go to your knees you go in your car and you start crying out to God and you ask him to come into your heart you then you just recognize that you were sons and daughters of God you are already a son you are already a daughter you already had everything in you then to go through a Rapture everything you need of was already in you you just needed the blueprints to find out how to get it in the reality of your life so everyone of you are Sons and Daughters of God he created you in the image of God in flesh form but now he wants that Spirit to come down into you to magnify you to show you that you are not of this Earth but you are in From Another Place Another Kingdom that you rule right beside your savior Hallelujah so this hidden place of God it's a secret thing to the world they don't know nothing about it they think we're crazy but you are resting upon every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God because you believe the word for this day amen and you're waiting for the body change the com complete adoption but this this this transformation from the time you gave your heart to God until then that is placing you higher and higher up to the place where one day he's going to completely adopt you and you're going to have the fullness of the power of God laying on you then you walk on this Earth for 30 to 40 days in total power but until then you have the earnest of that great power to move every devil everything that comes in your way he has given you thus sayth the Lord hallelujah through that that's why you can say I shall and H all things because why your sons and daughters of the living most high God now I want you to put yourself here I'm going to say ministers but you put yourself there when I say it I want you to say your name out loud all right I'm not picking on ministers all right I'm not even picking on you guys but I'm using this quote for a purpose brother rown says this he says Ministers of the Gospel how many he of the Gospel I'll read raise my hand up as just as a Christian cuz let me tell you something Sisters You Preach a better sermon than we do when you walk out these doors your life proves who you are I can go down to the Baptist and look just like the rest of them but there's something on the inside's different when you start speaking God I tell the truth see but these sisters prove they're in the gospel many people have been saved because of our sisters living a gospel life in front of people and God bless each and every one of you for that don't care about your denominations and what the world thinks but seek in I mean seek to enter in to the hidden Mana where the full revelation of God is making love perfect in your heart sometimes we're looking out here more than we're in there listen those denominations are doing exactly what God said they were going to be there is many classes are going to heaven that we don't understand the blood of God is going to save so many people that you won't even understand God has the elect lady he's got a foolish bride a foolish virgin that he's going to to to give them uh the same overpowering faith when it's their time to get their heads cut off the 144,000 Jews every tribe is about 12,000 Jews of each tribe makes up this 144,000 Jews all right there going to receive the same blood atonement that you did when they recognize Jesus Christ through those two prophets they're going to be more than Overcomers when they see that they're going to say oh Lord forgive me for killing my Lord just like you did on the altar but they'll have to give their life physically life you only have to give this life now surrender it all to him and let him m magnify his holy spirit through you the word of God through you to speak every truth every sign every Wonder every Power every healing everything that God has promised for this day comes out of your mouth Yes comes right out of your mouth why CU he said so he said so all you young ladies just remember this there's not a man in this world they can say I love you like God can God will say I love you and he'll back it up 100% man only has two things on their mind and it's not even good but when a man has the Holy Ghost Inside of him he's going to respect you as a daughter of God and he's going to love you as a daughter of God in respect who you are they won't want to do anything to shame you and that's our God he doesn't do anything that ashame you and I but he gives that perfect love to you that great Mana to you that you can be Overcomers of this day hallelujah praise be to God and you and God and everything else is at rest let anything come what may you're hidden away what a place to live oh just let me abide there let me just abide right there in the Mana let me just abide right there and let me eat let me know God what I need for my daily portion oh God help me to be that man that you said that I was before for the foundations of the world Lord cleanse me Lord Wash Me Lord help me Father God give me my portion give me my Mountain Lord oh whatever it takes God let me have my Mountain Hallelujah let me have my inheritance Hallelujah give me that portion for me to stand here and be a witness of my kingom hallelujah hallelujah sure they eat Mana out there but they don't know about this they've never been in there have you listen to this very carefully now I'm G to ask you a question have you ever come to a place in your life where Christ mean meant more to you than all the arguments you could do about your church as Christ means more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotional or a mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there that something takes place that you don't know how to to come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place dear brother dear sister have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but till the love of God Is So Anchored In Your Heart heart that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love everybody flowing free from everywhere what a place to live what a hidden place that's the place where we got to come to my brother my sister that's the place where God Reveals His secret things it's not at the ball game it's not shopping it's not going into your clicks it's not going to your buddies but it's getting into the word and falling in love with the one that's going to give you that great love to be Overcomers there's only one place that God provided and that's through this Holy Bible through Malachi 4 oh we can read other books and get the get the get the idea of maybe the symbols why they had to do the certain ways of of each sacrifice and that's good knowledge go ahead it's great I'm getting into that that's great it's wonderful but we got got to stick with what the prophet of God said we've got to stick in the word we've got to stay right there Brewing over that word Brewing yes a mother H has eggs or gifts for her and I've got gifts of God and I'm going to brew over it I'm going to get so hot and so War of the god that I live for that I'm going to produce the word for this hour I want to get so far up here that the devil can't get up there I want to get so far up that the only thing that's touching my wings is the angels of heaven I want to get so high that everything on this Earth Earth becomes dead and I'm seeing the heavenlies where I'm supposed to be in the hidden place when that eagle gets so high you'll see a little Dot and then before long you don't ever you don't see it no more why because he's so far up the eyes cannot see it I want to be so high in the presence of God that the devil don't even know where I'm at right I want him to be looking and asking where is he and one day I'm going to swoop down there and smack and say bad devil and fly so high that he can't even see me so every day he's going to be tormented not me I'm want to get so high in the presence of God that I don't feel no Satan bothering me fly Little Eagles fly Hallelujah he says here he goes in that we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to reproach before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make herself ready if you notice it says she has made herself ready yes brother William how do we do that right here right all the Mana you need to get you ready to go away [Applause] and oh we don't need a big preacher we don't need a big church no we need this right here this right here church will get you to a wedding supper it'll get you ready it will get you every promise in the book is yours you need healing it's right here prophet of God made it very clear before you leave your seat you believe that you're already healed before you get come up and get prayed for he said if you don't don't even come because God only recognizes Faith don't come up here hoping you come up here believing that's right that you are going to be changed and God comes on the scene that's right you want Victory exercise by reading that book and plying it to right here fall in love with him in a great way so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or lying or stealing I'll serve him this is going to blow your way but that's up to you you huh see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay down see got to be able to lay down well I I've got this habit and lay it down leave it there at the altar don't pick it up okay well I got this complex here it is Lord oh I believe it praise God it was a good service brother wendle and you took the complex with you no you leave it there say devil it's yours it's not mine I'm an eagle I fly and you leave it there yes sir why because that's faith believing that it's going to be done and it gets done yes am Hallelujah but it's so lay it down I just don't understand brother brandham lay it down and read it and follow the word of God and let the Bible prove Malachai for I had a third grade education but I tried to prove this man wrong and every time I did I saw him here before long I said okay I'm done I'm done I just believe I laid it down and today you're not going to get rid of me believ brother Brandon is not the prophet he is the prophet and anybody says that we only need this well he is about as dumb as a bunch of rocks because brother BRS in the Bible Malachi 4 you can prove it by Malachi 4 tell him go read it prove to me that he ain't in the Bible people get so in tune of what they think is right instead of letting that go and let God flow through them and show them thus sayith the Lord way yes amen maybe our pastors wouldn't get so gray-headed sometimes not trying to be funny but it's the truth see God could not push you through a little pipe pull us out on the other side and say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make a decision for yourself I have to make a dis decision for myself in doing that we show our faith and respect to God you're going through these trials brother Mitch is going through that trial because there's some gold there is a diamond that's coming out on the other side Hallelujah all the Mind battles brother Joe that you've been through all these times and now you've been serving God you're a diamond in a rough brother Williams a diamond in a rough but it's going to be a beautiful Diamond Hallelujah but we go through these things so God can show his little bride off Hallelujah show you that you can be more an overcomer when you realize that you're an overcomer devils are going to be scared all right you remember when we played football when you little dinky guy like him you'd get open I'd throw the ball at you there times You' drop it but more you caught it the more you fear everybody feared you at a little age because you had confidence that you can catch that ball and you became a very good receiver for this little pawy America church but it's it's called repetitions you get back up and you do it again you get back up and you do it again you keep going until you have it down perfectly why we're a team why in the world would I let this finger poke myself in the eye why would I go to the chopa immediately and just chop this finger off no there's intelligence here that tries to protect this finger because I love this finger this finger picks up my food this finger helps me to grab things I like my feet I know I got big long toes but I still like my feet I love my Long Legs I don't like my belly but that's my problem I got to take care of it but I love this guy right here I don't want nothing to happen to it but it does go through trial sometimes and it gets a splinter in it but this hand automatically says well I don't want to do nothing about it you dumb head yeah yeah you should have picked up that board no immediately oh ah ooh e and you pull it out you're protecting that finger when we get the love of God in us we're not going to let the devil mess with not one of us it don't matter what they're going to instead we're going to be on our knees we're going to cry out to God because we're Overcomers why because we're a body we're a Believers we're getting ourselves ready when I see a fault in you I'm going to lift you up and say in the name of Jesus make her well in the name of Jesus I'm going to ask her for give her of the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus I believe she's going to be healed yes Amen in the name of Jesus she's going to learn to be in church for 30 minutes early but I'm talking to him I'm not talking to you and I'm not putting you down I'm putting the devil down under my feet and lifting them up in prayer right in the Holy Spirit where God is and where I can meet God in a face to face communion talk and say my little brother needs you Lord he's struggling I got a brother that the devil's fighting God I need to pray I need to pray I need to enter in into the kingdom of God step in for one another I love you I'm going to pray for you yes that's an overcomer because when you're an overcomer you're not looking at them you're looking at him that's right that who gave you the overcoming power to be Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah why I might be the little pinky don't do too much when I drink I drink like this do you guys do that when you get a glass of water my poor little pinky don't get involved in it they don't but it does when it grab a hold of the shovel cuz I put that little pinky right behind the the shovel and I get my knee and I get a big old bunch of dirt on there I don't just use my shoulder I use my knee I use my leg I use my my backside my other backside grab a ho to the back and throw a big old chunk of dirt bigger you get the faster you get done hallelujah you want Victory dig your deep a little deeper dig your de your ditches a little deeper get ready for rain cuz it's coming church we got to get to a place that our mind is set on the word of God only hallelujah praise be to God I feel good today oh Hallelujah and I was supposed to preach this evening oh God knows his thing Hallelujah Abraham was promised a child but but he must maintain This Promise for 12 TW uh 25 years and up and downs that he had Temptations to those 25 years but he held to the word and the promise and guess what you got him a baby the promised son Hallelujah praise God why because he believed God he believed who he was he believed that he was the father of many nations not to boast but he knew it because he said so how do you know Sister April that you're the bride of Christ because he said so how do you know because the word said so that's right says if I believe in him and he I believe in him the son would be the Son of God I'll be with him if I live for him I'll be there with him if I give my life to him I'll be there if I believe Malachi 4 I'll be there because I'm going to do what the Malachi 4 said and what did he say go find Jesus he showed us what Revelation 10:7 is he showed us in Revelations in Malachi for what he was here for to turn the hearts turn the hearts of the little bride back to Pentecost the regular word the original word hallelujah because that original word is perfect love that hidden Mana that's hid out there but is open to your eyes in here hallelujah why Hallelujah why why because he loved you he loved you but I'm a stinker doesn't matter he still loved you Hallelujah you believe that Israel was promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it whatever The Souls of their feet trod upon they have to give give it to you God said to Joshua it was all there the land was there and God gave it to them but they must fight for it you want to be an overcomer you better fight you better do like the prophet of God said you do what these preachers said get your sword of Faith your sword and start fighting start fighting that devil and get your victories you want your promised land this morning fight fight you got sickness fight you got things that you need God to come on the scene fight fight let God come on the scene and give you an overcoming Holy Ghost Field baptism of the Holy Ghost dancing singing whatever he wants you to do be willing to do it all he tells you to jump up jump up he tells you to run the aisles run the aisles if he tells you just to sit there and believe then sit there and believe Hallelujah we have a variety of people here if everybody was like me you'd be sweating You' be sweaty and you stink but look at some of you got some nice jackets on nice ties nice Cowboy shirts on sisters got some real pretty dresses on got your hair all made up it's a Garden of Flowers all kinds and I need every single one of you Hallelujah you know you put flowers just in a pot by itself and you don't have no green to it it doesn't look so pretty but when you put some kind of green plant there and you put flowers around it oh it just magnifies that flow so just remember you bunch of flowers you got to have this green guy once in a while to stand so you can be magnified how Beauty you really are praise be to God I know that was funny but it's the truth we need each other we need each other hallelujah praise be to God the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it but you fight every inch of the way God has got Amazing Grace to give you and he will do it but you have to fight every inch of the way I've been be behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that was being a fight continually it certainly has but if but we must fight if we must Reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that do easily besit her us that we might run this patience and this race that's set before us we must lay them aside ourselves we can't say God you come lay them aside for us we've got to do that ourselves Revelations 3 and 21 it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as also overcome and I am set down with my father in his throne did you hear what he just said I grant to sit with me in my Throne did you know there's going to be a day that that Jesus that we love so dearly that's on the right hand of God is going to have his throne and he's going to sit there and guess who's going to sit right beside her right beside him you all power of that kingdom is in your hands everything that he was he put into Christ whatever things in Christ he puts into his church all power all inheritance all things and we can tap into that today by the Holy Ghost our Earnest he's placing us into that revelation of who you are you want to have faith like brother durren do what he did start studying reading crying out to him yes dying to yourself yeah you want to be like Christ brother dur for many years have been striving to be just like Christ and I believe he's there I believe he's there but Abraham he didn't notice the well of water land for he left up his eyes and saw the tomorrow for he would inherit all things the real Christian today lifts up his eyes and sees the promises of Christ blessed are the meek that they shall inherit all things they shall inherit the earth the the real Christian by faith looks up and sees that call him what you want to he lifts up his eyes and when he did that God said Abraham walk through the land sh all you yours she's all yours when we get to a place that this is our total absolute everything that we breathe everything that we talk everything that we do you're going to be able to walk through every Temptation and get Victory because God's going to say she's all yours amen let's have faith like Abraham Revelations 2 and 17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat the hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in that stone a new name written which no man knoweth saveth he that receives it Hallelujah Hallelujah when I can see a preview of it it makes me Rejoice seeing that our anchor holds within the veil the Bible says he that overcometh will I give a white stone and the new name that no one knows but himself don't make any difference what people say you know yourself when you been bought and to brought into the inner Veil no one could tell you any different not because you joined church because you did this or that but something just tells you that you got a stone that's in your heart not a hard Stone a soft one the stone makes your heart soft instead of hard Ezekiel in that old time I'm hurrying church and when when the law work put into the Tabernacle in the ark of the law of God Ezekiel spoke the anchor time or another time now the people there are two classes of people today they seen class that tries to do something to save themselves each one I'll go to the church on Sunday that's very good I want to be religious that's very good I stay under the law and when that other by going to church and being good it's not something that you do yourself it's something in you doing it for you the Holy Spirit In Your Heart the reason why people come early is because it's in their heart to do it it's something that draws them to it listen in church there's something in you when you wake up in the morning and say w it's Wednesday morning but I'm going to church tonight because there's something calling you to come and hear from God in the fivefold ministry that's why we should be paring ourselves at work on Wednesdays for this opportunity if you have a 15minute nap get a 15 minute nap right before you come to church get ourselves ready to hear from God not worry about everybody else but worry about you and myself come in and get something from God so you can fight the devil the next day fight the devil until the Rapture comes something that will give you an experience to be an overcomer for this day so that you can inherit all things of Christ Jesus that give it to you and me Hallelujah why because there's something on the inside of you Hallelujah now notice in the inner Court the people that live in there inside there seems to have always Fed Up always feeling good Ezekiel said feeling fed up yeah feeling feeling good Ezekiel said I will write my laws a new and put in the heart where the law used to be a stone in the ark and the Ark present the heart then I will put my new law in their hearts in the ark so where is the ark today your heart it's your heart so where are you going to place it where are you going to place all this great stuff where are you going to place it here oh you're going to place it right here and it's going to manifest Sons and Daughters of God that's pretty easy brother har pretty simple why are we struggling is because we're not eating the book The reason why you struggle and I struggle is because we're not eating the book and believing it oh brother William I study every day good good good then what's the problem it's the believing part you can read all day long ain't goingon to get nothing out of it but you pray and you seek God and you start reading this because this is life or death to you it'll change your life it'll change your life it'll make us want to do things that we really wouldn't do unless it was him CU I'm going to tell you something it has to be the Holy Ghost for you to love me because if you really know me you wouldn't like me that's the truth that is the truth my heart is the bond of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark and the heart is the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart God is not known to theology God is not known by mental conception God is known by the oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again experience that's in the human heart yet man and women live a good life and love God by mineral conception but the real hidden place is in the heart hidden in Hidden with Christ Christ the Holy Ghost comes into that heart he is in you with your your Temperance and he is living his own life to his own will through you Hallelujah I'm almost done Isaiah 54 everyone knows these scriptures right here Isaiah 54 and14 in the righteousness shall thou be established thou shal be far from opp Opposite I can't say that word for thou shall not fear and from tar for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the Smith that bows the coals in the fire and that brings forth an instrument for a for for his work and I have created the ways to destroy no weapon that is formed against me against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee is judged thou shal condemn wow I guess we better watch how we say things about people huh cuz that same person you talking about is living a holy ghost life is going to condemn you wow wow wow wow I think we just need to sit there and think about that for a moment this is the inheritage of the servant of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord now brother R says this he says you brother this is God's word which is sharper than two-edged sword it's the greatest power that was ever put in the hands of man and God's expecting Abraham's race to put sin sickness and all kinds of devils to the flight wall that's right we've got the most powerful weapon that there is what is it the word he says here Aon vanwinkle left them with sticks and stones but Christ left us with the word of the spirit it's fight let's fight let's stand for Christ let's stand for the word let's pull the sword out of its sheath and fight Mark 6 Mark Mark 11 32 and 34 it says verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in its heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you what things so soever ye desire when ye pray believe that he receive them and he shall have them couple more things and I'm almost done now only this journey he's promised to supply everything that we have need of whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do whatsoever things he repeats what I just read now he give us the strongest weapon that there is on the world and that's prayer Pray is what changes things and Christ does recognize what a force he has when he kneels and his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't recognize power that is if wa excuse me he doesn't recognize what power that is talking to us we don't recognize it but if we can recognize oh people could only recognize that that's what is given right unto them anything that you ask Will for will be given sorry for being stuttering here if you can appreciate the faith to believe it God's word is true God's word will defend Satan anywhere any place any time praise be God I got three more scriptures and I'm going to let you go Jeremiah 20 uh 10 it says for I heard thy defame of many fear on every side report say they and will report it all my infirmities watch for my H uh hatred hatred is that hatred not hatred Halton yeah thank you saying got say that word too yeah thank you you he will be enticed and we shall pre Prevail against him and we shall take our ramage on him I like that I want to kick him where he don't like it I love when I I I know this just sounds horrible but when I was in the world I didn't like to get hurt and man people teeth was the easiest thing to make sure that I didn't get hurt I would stick my finger in there grab their tongue do anything I could not to get beat up the devil it's time to just whoop him it's time to whoop him it's time to whoop him but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one there terrible how do you say that word man I'm starting to stutter all of a sudden praise the Lord I feel him he's here therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not Prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not Prosper their Everlasting cons confusion shall never be forgotten but oh lord of hosts that tries the righteous and seeth their and the Heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto they have I opened my case sing unto the Lord Praise of the Lord for thou Hast delivered thy soul of thy poor from thy hands of evildoers Timothy 6

if you want that great faith that Abraham had that what we need to have get in your Bible get into your messages find find yourself in the in falling in love with the word of God because when you fall
