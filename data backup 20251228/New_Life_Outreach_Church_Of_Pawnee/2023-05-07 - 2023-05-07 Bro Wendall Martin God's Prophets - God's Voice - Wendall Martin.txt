that are grieving and it seemed like every time that any of us have been over there there's always been a news they've just been bombarded by time the news TV Crews and and so we want to continue to pray for for that family there in Henrietta it was just a very evil and tragic situation amen and I'm someone asked well where is God in this I said that's the problem amen we have forsaken God and we're living in a world that is evil and amen but we're preparing we're preparing we don't have a guarantee we don't have a guarantee to even walk out these doors and someone shoot you amen we don't have a guarantee the guarantee is we're going to a land we're preparing for a land we're making our soul right with God right now and brother there will be no death associated in that land we're preparing for that can you say man we're looking to that right now amen for God is is is preparing us and taking us so we appreciate everyone for that and if you have your Bibles let's look here in the Book of Revelations the first chapter and um we're going to read the first three verses and um then will lost then we'll skip on down to the um this the 19th verse praise the lord well how many has got victory in your soul today amen Revelations 1 and 1. the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John so now God's going to Christ is going to reveal himself amen and he's going to show his servants that are to come and then he's but he's revealing it through his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen now that word time is at hand in other words amen this is the beginning what you are saying we are going to bring to you amen the the the the the the the revelation of how where the church is going to be from it start to its end amen and so we're thankful for that now it's going down the let's look at the 19th verse write these things the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter so now he's fixing to show us now this is this is amen the history of the church this is going to be taken place throughout the church ages amen and he says the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou has seen in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the seven angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches now let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for for your grace and your your love to us for your help Lord to the families who have Lord lost their loved ones and while one was a wonderful homecoming Lord of a Dear Old Saint Who had who had lived the life and reflected Your Grace here on the earth Lord there's another one Lord with a family that is grieving and Lord and fighting hurt and anger and pain and I pray God that you'll be with them Lord be with all of that family there in Henrietta today I pray Lord that your your angel would be with them and help them to make sense Lord and just rely upon you and draw them closer to you father I pray Lord that you would be with us here this morning that your grace would be a prevalent Lord in our in in our midst and that you would speak to us father as our prayer we love you Lord with all of our heart can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen we're thankful for the name of Jesus I want to speak up just um I'm just going to take my time a little bit this morning and and deal with a real simple subject and that is amen the The Messengers of God's prophets God's voice amen and and I want to deal with the importance a man of of uh this of this church that we uh God's church that we are a part of Amen the scripture uh tells us that all the Bible all the scripture there in second Timothy 3 and 16. all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so the Bible amen this this Canon of scripture is is uh inspired of God anointed men of God now it's easy for us to look at the scripture as I believe her in any any sound Bible believer believes that the Bible there is no error in this Bible do you believe that no error in this Bible amen and and that God put this together amen and nothing can be added to this Bible and nothing can be taken away from this Bible this is the complete revelation of God amen there's no no other Revelation you you can't amen any no any other Revelation outside of the revelation of of what God has placed in this Bible a man is is is the affigmund of man's imagination and so therefore we cannot take um anything that that uh that Mormon brought or the Maccabee brothers or that any of these others that would bring amen because their teachings do not line up with the Bible so therefore we cannot accept that as as the uh uh authoritative word of God Amen we cannot take uh uh you know Muhammad we can't take any of these other other men who have come in and tried to uh add an addition to the Bible there's only there's only one Bible we believe that God put these 66 books right here and we believe what that word teaches us amen now we uh but what we do realize amen is that or what we sometimes Overlook is that these were men mortal men just like you are amen that that that that that had to to to work they had to uh uh they had families they were mortal men who who was born and who died they were Sinners that had to be Redeemed by God but they were anointed men who were set aside for a specific purpose and that was to be the mouthpiece of God to their generation amen and to the Future Generations that were to come can you say amen and and so amen but and the but the scripture says they're in second Peter 1 and 20 knowing this first that no private a prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen so God would take a mortal man and he would play Separate him first of all he would separate him to himself they were born prophets of God and God would come down and would anoint them and use them in in his kingdom now amen the scripture uh tells a lot about these about what God thinks about these prophets they're in Ephesians 2 and 20. it says you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner uh it's Cornerstone amen they're in second Peter three and two it says that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior there in Revelations 22 and 6 and he said unto them these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass so so we we we see that when God places his anointing upon a man and causes him uh to prophesy he he is Anointed of God his words become the words of God to that generation amen now is that man a failure in in by birth absolutely the man is a failure at Birth the man is Immortal the man makes mistakes the man is he is is going to there's going to be plenty of times where God comes in and has to say hey amen I I told you to do this and you've done that Moses was not even allowed to go into the promised land amen and and yet the Bible says that God spoke lip to ear with Moses so so so we we yes God's using mortal men but their words are divine their words are set in stone forever throughout the eternities and you will be judged by the words of the Divine words that came through those mortal men can you say amen amen now so when we look at the scripture today we are believing that God can keep his work aren't you glad that God can do that that God can so take a man and so anoint him and and and and so trust those words that he would build his church upon the Revelation that comes amen forth out of their mouth now another thing that I want to look at for prophets God always sins a messenger at the junction of time now now I want to I want us to look here for a minute God always sends his prophets right where there's fixing to be amen a junction or right when there's fixing to be a change right when there's fixing to be something take place God will send his Prophet to come in amen and to show us the way listen take that road not that one not that one not that one this is the way Hallelujah now you say now now now now why can't God send Angels he does send his angels to His prophets and um us mortal beings must be spiritual enough to know who God is with and be willing to follow another mortal man well praise the Lord mortal men have problems following mortal men amen more Mortal me I have problems following another man and we're not to follow the man God vindicates that man to be his Prophet by never letting his words fall to the ground his prophecies are true and the scripture says there Amen in in the in the book of Deuteronomy if a man were to rise up and to prophesy and his words come to pass then believe what that man is saying why God vindicates God's will always vindicate his prophet amen now amen so he sends these men he will raise them up they are born with these gifts in their heart amen and they're usually separated from the religious order of the day but they're raised up to represent God and the Supernatural is always with that Prophet to vindicate can you say Amen look look at Noah Noah was a an end time Prophet Noah was raised up because there was a junction of time judgment was fixing to strike and God wanted to bring Mercy to his people now God could have just changed all of their hearts and God could have amen done something different but he raised up a prophet he raised up one man to declare his word and his and his and there was two there was two reasons to to pronounce judgment and also a man to provide a way of Escape so when Noah was out there saying God is fixing to judge this Earth amen now if you read all of the all of the stuff the scripture says that amen the last days would be just as it was in the days of Noah amen as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man it's going to be the same way amen so you go back there and you look and you see all of the perversions when it said God repented that he even made man but yet he had an elect there on the earth and he says I am going to provide a a way of Escape well praise the Lord amen go back and read it the scripture says this day would be the same as that day amen it would be the same but you see God was coming to pronounce judgment God was going to bring judgment and I just want to tell you amen it was 120 years before the Judgment came 100 somebody say 120 years they had to wait 100 oh isn't that something well if that was of God it would have happened 20 years ago oh if that was of God that would have happened 50 years that would have happened [Music] 120 years of waiting before the rains a hit but you know what amount the elect of God was waiting on the inside of that Ark Waiting for God to fulfill his word and I want to say today there is something today there has been a message that has come in our day saying it's fixing to rain brother it's not going to rain rain it's going to rain hell fire and brimstone this Earth is fixing to burn up you need to come into Christ the word can you say amen amen Moses was an end-time messenger he was sent to deliver Israel from the 400 years of Oppression of slavery and God appeared amen and he told Moses I have called you to go down and represent me to the children of Israel now Moses just was saying now I I need to have some kind of a I I I I want to know I need to know for myself that it's you I see you in the burning bush amen but I need some evidence myself and the children of Israel are going to need some evidence amen I just can't go down there and say that I'm a deliverer that I'm a prophet or that amen but I need something to know that you are with me and I tell you what it's God's desire God's Supernatural and God will always make sure that he vindicates his man that he is in amen he'll do it and you you can rise up and say anything you want to but until God Vindicated himself can you say Amen so when he would go out there and Moses would give his prophecies and it would come to pass the children of Israel were gaining strength and courage when the every time that that prophecy would come to pass when he would stand up and say Amen a pharaoh I'm going to speak flies into existence amen the children of Israel were hearing that too and and he would tell them Amen Let My People Go and and the Lord would Harden his heart and then amen so here there we go at every time the prophecy come to pass it was it was it was a checking of the heart of the people it was bringing a a a a a a a a a confidence to the heart of the people that God was speaking through that prophet why because it was going to require mortal men to listen to a mortal man it was going to require human beings to listen to another human being therefore God was going to show be on the shadow of a doubt that he was with Moses how did Brother John have you ever thought about it what cost two and a half million people to believe that one man on that to Exodus time it was God vindicating over and over and over and over that God was with him why was God doing this over and over because it was going to require the elect of God to know that the supernatural God was there vindicating his work you see the prophet was a word prophet he didn't just come in and say but you see he went back to what God had already told Abraham at the end of 400 years I will deliver with a strong and mighty hand and now here he is now anybody could stand up and say amen I I I'm the deliverer amen I'm the prophet I'm the one that's come you seek anyone could say it but you see there was one man that God had Anointed with his holy spirit to bring them out and into Hallelujah any preacher can get up there with a gift and sing and and and preach and any any preacher can say whatever they want to say but when When God says it then you know that it's him well praise the Lord now the Bible says that when when God Appears to Israel in Horeb he brings them out and now God's wanting to show himself who he is so God is going to God's going to show what really took place amen and and the Bible says they're in Exodus 19 and 16 and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God and they stood at the neither part of the mountain and mount and Mount Sinai was all together on spoke because the Lord descended upon it in a fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mountain shook quite greatly and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses Pake and God answered him by a voice and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai on top of the mountain and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mountain and Moses went up can you say Amen now now I want you to catch the picture God is revealing himself in a real in a supernatural way to let the people know listen I am with everything that Moses told you about at the beginning amen I'm here to vindicate it I am the god of all gods can you say Amen now now if you were to go on down to the let's just see their reaction let's look here at Exodus 20 and 18. and all the people uh saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die well praise the Lord amen so now they're saying hey whoa whoa whoa we're Mortals we're in this we're in this defiled flesh we we come from from a sexual birth there is no way that we can come into the presence of God but praise the Lord amen you look there in Exodus 8 or Deuteronomy 18 and 15. amen you and then of course if you read all of all of those scriptures you will see amen but here's where God makes the Declaration they're in 18 uh Deuteronomy 18 and 15 the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee and of thy Brethren like unto me and unto him you shall hearken according to all that thou desirest of the Lord thy God and in the day of the assembly saying let us let me not hear uh again the voice of the Lord my God neither let me see the great fire anymore that I die not the Lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken I will raise them up a prophet from a Hmong their brethren Hallelujah so now God is now going to show what he's going to do when God wants to speak he's going to bring up a prophet from among mortal beings well praise the Lord are you understanding you see now God the unchanging God what's he ever sets it into motion it will forever be in motion while in this while in this in this lifespan can you say Amen so mortal beings God will raise up praise the Lord did you notice that it's hard you know who's the hardest one to listen to in your family his dad you know why because Dad wants to lead and the family knows all of his failures well praise the Lord you know you know you know because Dad sometimes have to say Hey guys you're wrong and then you look back and say who are you who are you to say we're wrong Mr Perfect right and it's hard Hallelujah who who who finds it hard sometimes to follow the pastor why because sometimes he has to stand up and say you're wrong and what you want to ah yeah oh yeah let me see how you've handled your family yeah how did you have can you say Amen but you see it's yeah and sometimes we're looking at the man and we are failing to see the office Hallelujah you are failing to see yes God ordained a mortal Fallen human being by the name of Wendell Martin to be pastor amen and it's because of that there has been many that have just walked away and said I can't follow that Fallen flawed mortal being right huh but you see if we can see Hallelujah now I'm just using this in the natural because we all God has ordained Fallen mortal human beings to lead his church the fivefold ministry the pastor uh the Evangelist Apostle Prophet teacher the uh all of these men are raised up out of mortal beings now this is in a in a small category the husband the father is the head of the home the pastor is The Shepherd of the flock but the prophet Hallelujah are y'all still with me I can teach false Doctrine I can get off I I have a tendency how many has ever heard me have come up and apologize there's things to taught you know that I've had to come back and say hey guys I was wrong and you've got to look at me with Grace and say well amen show us in the scripture and where there's been some that's even I've I've even I've something that I've preached and you say brother well that's not exactly correct and and you show it to me and I look at it and I say well dog gone I missed that one and I have to get up and say hey guys I I didn't read the other verse all right amen because I am a mortal it's not that I want to be wrong it's just that I'm a mortal being and I'm capable of that but a word prophet is one that God takes from the from his birth and keeps him because he is a man that the people are going to have to look to now are there times amen are there are there times where where I mean are we are we dealing with Mortal men when we're dealing with prophets yes yes yes and there were plenty of times where brother Brandon would take on the on the seals or on the on the seals he says I went through the seals Hall at one time amen back in there in the early days amen and he was telling us as he was as the angel the Lord was standing there revealing the seals he says guys I brought this all he says I took that first horse rider and and made him the Holy Spirit he said that's all I knew and he said all today I would have made an awful mistake I would have made an awful mistake if the angel of the Lord hadn't came in the room and said no that's not the holy spirit that is the Antichrist in deception now the prophet had to come back and say now listen but what was God doing God was God already told us that he was going to come in three stages of his ministry and in that third stage is where is where God but he was getting the people's attention so that he could accept we would accept the word when it came what praise the Lord now I hope I hope I'm I'm doing or not not too scattered here but now I will raise there there go back uh sister keys are Deuteronomy 18 and 15. I will or 18. Hallelujah 18 and 18. I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unity and we'll put my words in his mouth and he will speak unto them all that I shall command him and it shall come to pass that whatsoever whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him can you say Amen so now God is telling them okay I'm going to hear you I got you I'll raise up a prophet it would have been a lot easier for you to just sit there and listen to me but now I'm going to raise up a man and I will vindicate that man and you would better heed to what that man is saying Hallelujah it would have been easier just to surrender yourselves to the but we're mortal sinful listen it takes a special being a man to come it's going to take a special body to come and bask in his presence how many ever comes into his presence when you feel his presence and it just sometimes you're numb sometimes I get into the spirit of the Lord while I'm preaching and I've gotten so deep into that other realm now imagine that you can sort of see the glass the eyes glass gloss over a little bit amen but when a man comes out of that he is so he is so uh he's wore her out this body he cannot handle it therefore God sends prophets to do that well can you say Amen now when God sends a prophet that man those men are bold they're Fearless they'll stand against all the odds amen why they're separated from birth to be a prophet I want us to look just real quickly to Jeremiah look at the Prophet Jeremiah who stood at the most at a most crucial Junction of time for Israel and and there he was bold with his message pronouncing judgment upon the nation and the scripture says the king the princes the entire nation hated Jeremiah and he and is because he wasn't for the good of the people let's just look here real quickly Jeremiah 38 and 4. it says therefore the princess said unto the king we beseech you seeks thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of War that remaineth in this city now if you and again if you go back there and look at the prophecies Jeremiah is standing up he is saying because you have rejected God because you have refused to turn away from turn back to God he says I'm going to uh he says you're going into judgment you're going to be going into Exile and it begins to uh predict what is fixing to take place and that they're going to be there for 70 years and so uh and and so here he says he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city in the hands of all the people in speaking such words and to them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but hurt then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king it is not he that do anything against you and then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon with with uh with malca the son of Hamlet that was in the court of the prison and and they let down Jeremiah with cords in the in the dungeon with no water uh but mire so Jeremiah sunk in the mire amen now now now I want you to catch this now Josephus says that he sunk into this amen it was it was like a lagoon and he had sunk all the way up until he couldn't sit down he couldn't do anything he was in manure now this was what the the the society had done to that problem could you imagine if they would have had internet on that day could you imagine Hallelujah if they would have had internet and what was been circulating and that'll that old Prophet amen if he was God's Prophet you know he'd be trying to to help us to defy our enemies he'd be trying to to Rally us all together you know as a church now here we are amen you see he he if we need an encourager not a condemner who needs Jeremiah he's condemning we need someone to encourage us well praise the Lord but you see Jeremiah was God's selected man if you look there and Jeremiah 1 and 4 it says and the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee before thou cameest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child and the Lord said unto me say not I'm a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant you see God called that man now the people didn't believe it they didn't believe that the angel of the Lord appeared unto Jeremiah as a child they didn't believe it well praise the Lord but I want to tell you it come to pass exactly well it come to pass exactly like God said it would amen well glory to God I tell you amen you know you look you your prophets have always had to Stand Alone look at their and first Samuel 3 and 18. and and Samuel told him every wit and hid nothing from him and he said it is the Lord let him do what seemeth him good and Samuel grew and the Lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground well praise the Lord so what do you anyone we we God oh a prophet at the junction of time amen what about Micaiah am I going too slow here this morning Michaela was standing the 400 Hebrew prophets amen you remember that there were the two kings matter of fact if you want to turn there in in First Kings 22 and 1 and we're going to read a lot of this chapter here amen and and I I think it's good for you young people or for all of us y'all we we these scriptures we should uh we should know them and and know where they are and and and and read them for ourselves I the the board is wonderful and and and it does make things it helps us to put a lot of material in in one service but but uh uh make sure you go back and look at these things here because the scripture is plumful we are built upon the foundation of mortal men mortal man that were ordained of God with his word can you say Amen now watch amen now we've got the two kings I'll set the stage we got the two kings we've got Wicked Ahab who was living under a curse because the Prophet Elijah had already said because of your sin you're going to die and and and and and and and and that uh uh Wicked Jezebel is going to be eaten by the dogs amen now the lukewarm compromiser the lukewarm church member is Jehoshaphat he knew that that that that Ahab was cursed but he wanted to get along so here we have we have the cursed Wicked Man and then we've got uh Jehoshaphat a lukewarm King it says and they uh they're in uh First Kings 22 and 1 and they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel and it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah come down to the king of Israel and the king of Israel said unto his servants know ye that remeth of Gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria and he said unto Jehoshaphat well thou go with me to battle in raymeth Gilead and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I'm as Thou Art my people is thy people my horses is thy horses now I want you to look here they were all Israelites but one was a separate to Judah unto God Israel had had already backslid amen but God was now dealing with Judah now watch now here's Jehoshaphat saying my people are thine my horses are thine and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together somebody say Prophets about 400 men and said unto them shall I go against rameth Gilead to battle or shall I forbear and they said go up for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and Jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides that we might inquire of him and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat there is yet one man Michaela the son of imlah by whom we may inquire of the Lord but I hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and Joseph had said let not the king say so then the king of Israel called an officer and said hey sin dither Micaiah the son of emblem now the McKay is already in prison and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said each on his throne having put on their robes and avoid place in the entrance of the Gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them and zedekiah the son of kanina made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the Lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to raymuth Gilead and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it in the king's hand and the messenger that was going to call Michaela speaking to him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like the word of one of them speak that which is good and Makaya said as the Lord liveth what the Lord saith unto me that will I speak oh man and so he came to the king and the King said unto him Ikea shall we go up to Raymond Gillian or shall we for bear and he answered go and prosper for the Lord shall deliver it in the king the hand of the king and the King said unto him how many times shall I adjour Thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord and he said I saw all Israel scattered upon the heels I'll ask sheep that have not a shepherd and the Lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat did not I tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil we've got we've got four now we don't have 400 in here and we have what do we have amen 45 50 people here this morning amen okay could you imagine you against one man you against God's prophet why don't you try 400. amen so we had we had 400 at our youth camp a little over 400 there so take all all of those people and make them all spiritual men make them all Prophets and they're all saying thus saith the Lord go on up for I am with him with and here comes this guy in rags that has been eating amen stale bread and water and he comes up and says you're going to die now here's the stage is set are you hearing me hear the stages set who are we going to believe are we going to believe well I'd like to preach right now but we're going to believe all of these preachers here in laodicea that same all Prosperity is on its way Hall we're live God is sending Revival you've not seen a Revival yet oh the Revival's coming no no no no Micah's Vision lined up with scripture Micah was simply saying what Elijah had already said Ahab was living under a curse and my chaos Vision he lined it up with scripture these men were not lining their prophecies up with scripture for the prophet had already sat Elijah is cursed now here comes Micah against the 400 he had heard from God but any true Prophet will always go back to scripture any word prophet and he comes out now with all the confidence and boldness I love a word Prophet he's pretty confident and he says Imam and he and he tells them and he tells him you're going to die Israel is going to be without a Shepherd let's go on down to the 19th verse it's uh you know we just read the 18th verse he said there's you know the king of Israel 18 said unto Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil and he said here thou therefore the word of the Lord this is the prophet I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven sitting by him in his hand on his right hand and on his left and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he shall go and fall in rameth Gilead and one said on this manner and another set on that manner and there come forth the spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him and the Lord said unto him wherewith and he said I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his Prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so oh God Almighty When God says what about the scripture in this last day that says he'll turn them over to a reprobate mind because they've loved not the truth God will send a lying Spirit upon you and make you feel like you are right and you will be damned because you have refused the counsel of the Lord laodicea laodicea hear the words of the Lord there was a prophet that Rose in this day saying come back to the Bible but now they don't want it because they've got anointed men out there preaching and suiting their fancy and making them feel they're all right sorry the Lord has put a lying spirit 23rd verse the mouth of these prophets and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee but zedekiah the son of Chana went near and smote Micah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the Lord for me to speak unto thee and Micah said behold Thou shalt see it in that day when thou shall go into the inner chamber to hide thyself and the king of Israel said take Micah carry him back unto amen the governor of the city and to joash the King's son and say thus saith the king put this fellow in prison and feed him the bread of affliction and with water of Affliction until I come in peace and Micah said if thou return at all in peace the Lord has not spoken by me he said hearken all people every one of you now here is the spirit of deception here are men claiming they have scripture when the scripture has already told them Ahab is cursed sons of God don't you believe that nonsense amen this read you read you read in our church age this lukewarm Church age it is a church age that is under the curse of God can you say Amen Junctions of time now we understand and I'll tell you how dumb I'll tell you how how how dumb Jehoshaphat was amen Ahab convinced Joseph hat to change clothes with him amen he said you put your when you put your garment on and I'll put my and I'll put your guy and and should they change clothes Lily and I'm thinking what a friend what a friend amen so eat so Jehoshaphat if you read on the scripture Jehoshaphat is wearing ahab's garments are you hearing me jehoshaphat's wearing ahabs and AFS wearing jehosh vets and the Bible says when they were in battle and and and and Ahab took off or they took off running and amen and the one guy just takes it takes it up in the air just but yes the Bible says and that Arrow was anointed of the Lord [Music] and it struck Ahab wearing jehoshaphat's clothes [Laughter] can you say that uh he was Vindicated by scripture and they wouldn't believe it well praise the Lord now I want to say the unchanging God has never changed his program God always somebody say always he will always send a prophet that's the way he does it Amos 3 and 7 surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth the secret unto his servants the prophet even to this last Church even to this last Church age Amen in the days of the voice of that seventh messenger the the mystery of God will be complete can you say Amen now now now some now again some people say that those Prophet Messengers was only to the Old Testament Church no no no no no no we were founded this what you believe is founded upon the prophet Paul's teaching Hallelujah well praise the Lord amen they sure were Paul was the prophet to the New Testament Church he set the church in order he divided law From Grace amen even to the point that Peter in his in his epistle he says now there's many things that our brother Paul writes that that are that are hard to be understood and some wrestle to their own destruction some wrestle with this Mortal man who went about killing all of the Saints and they're wrestling with what he's trying to tell them and Peter says and they do so to their own destruction Hallelujah that's scripture amen the Paul was bold about it Paul was bold with his Revelation they were in First Corinthians 14 and 36 he says what came the word out from you or came it unto you only that's First Corinthians 14 and 36 now we're in 37. If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be arrogant let him be arrogant Galatians 1 and 6. I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which there is another not another uh but but there will be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and if and we as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than you have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God do I seek to please men for if I yet please men should I not be the servant of Christ I I certify you Brethren the gospel was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of a man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now he goes on talking I remember for a Time sake was going down to the 15th verse but it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I may preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither when I went up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and then returned to Damascus then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and a boat with him for 15 days so he is saying this is not something my gospel that I'm preaching I didn't get it from the other 12. I didn't get it from this I didn't get a friend God has separated me himself as a light to the Gentiles can you say Amen now and the Apostle Paul even rebuked Peter because Peter was over there still trying amen trying to to bring dissension between the Jews and the Gentiles amen hear the Apostle Peter was used of the Lord to go and bring the gospel to then Gentiles but here he was trying to keep himself from you know from eating with the Gentiles and the apostles the Apostle Paul withstood him to his face the Apostle Paul says you're to blame the reason why we've got dissension between in the church here between the Jew and the Gentile is because you are acting the way you are that's in the book of Acts amen so so God did use has used always will use a prophet at Junctions of time you believe that now now each of the seven Junctions or period of this church history God used men to rise up now we're going to be getting into this in the weeks to come but look at Revelations two and one now these are the stars that are in the hands of of the Christ the one walking in the midst of the candlesticks now remember amen he had he seen the stars and then he seen the seven candlesticks Christ walking in among all the candlesticks and then he says now this The Mystery of the Seven Stars are the seven angels now those were those angels amen are messengers their Earthly Messengers and in this case here amen uh the in in the in the in the New Testament when you when you look there at this word Angel it'll actually in the Greek uh it'll actually say Earthly messenger or you that's that's the that's the definition so angels can be used for a for profit and it can also be used for an earth or an Heavenly Angel you just got to look at at the at they use the same word uh when when dealing with either or but this here you can clearly say you can clearly see that he's talking about the the Earthly messenger and most all uh Scholars agree to that now uh they're they're in Revelations two and one unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks let's go on down to the next Church age Revelations 2 and 8. unto the angel of the church in Smyrna these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive let's go down to Revelations 2 and 12. unto the angel in pergamus write these things saith he that hath the sharp sword with two edges two and eighteen and and unto the angel of the Church of thyatira write these things saith the Son of God which hath his eyes like a flame of fire and and his feet like brass Revelations 3 and 1 unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits and the Seven Stars I Know Thy Works thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead Revelations now and I want you to look I want you to look where are these Stars where are these Messengers they're in his right hand not his left hand his right hand his he there in his right hand praise the Lord now he's letting them know Hallelujah I've got I'm going to happen there's going to be seven distinct periods I will have a messenger to each one of those periods or Junctions amen there's going to be age period And there's Junctions at each time and I will always send a messenger in there at the end of those periods amen I will bring them in because they're going to take you into a into a different light now if you were to go to Revelations 3 and 7 under the angel of of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shuteth and shut it for no man open them until it comes on down to Revelations 3 and 14 unto the angel of the Church of laodicea write these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so so here we are now we're living all the way down in this seventh age amen there's already been The Messengers that have come throughout these last two thousand years they have come through those ages amen and they're dealing they're they're these are prophecies that are being dealt with the church didn't really know it until this last day when the when the veil is taken off the Plan of Redemption the people had to trust every one of those Messengers even even Saint Martin but wait wait back there in those Dark Ages when the Bible was was was was was was uh uh you know taken away from the church and even all of Columbus and Martin all every one of them spoke with tongues every one of them had signs and wonders every one of them seen Visions every one of them had the powers of God in their life there was a supernatural presence with those men what praise the Lord but now we're living at the end the end not the end of a dispensation not the end of the first age or the third age or the fifth age we're living at the end of the seventh and at the seventh messenger's voice the mystery of God should be complete isn't this beautiful now God has always done it he's always kept it now we're built upon the words of those Prophets now we understand that now down Through the Ages we can see we can see through Revelations 2 and 3 that we'll be getting into we'll see how that the word started out hot but even at the end of the Ephesian Church age the very first one he says I have somewhat against you you've lost your first love and then he's called them to repent and then we come into the second age and we find that that Spirit of deception that was trying to make its way through but could not make his way through the first church age was now coming in and it says hey you've got those ones that are that are the the that are uh uh uh you you've got the the you know nickelatins that are among you that are talking among you trying to conquer the laity by the time he gets into the third age he's he's standing there amen and he's and he's and he's giving him an open rebuke now you're letting Jazzy Bell to even teach you at Roman Church he's worming her way in warming her way in but in the midst of it all there was always a messenger standing up declaring those Messengers gave their lives for this they would stand up they said come back to back turd can you say man oh yes until it goes on down they man until the church goes to that very dark and the Bible says that amen when Luther Come Thou Hast just a little strength you don't have much strength and then here come Wesley the time of the of the uh of of of of of of of of the great the open door that's when the evangelism struck across the world Hallelujah but here we are we're in the in the very very last I want to tell you doesn't that give you confidence doesn't that give you confidence to know we we ain't got something way out in the future how is it Brother winner you can get up and preach that you believe the Rapture could come like any day right now is because the Bible has declared it the messenger has come to let us know amen now why is this Heaven messenger so important because it's the completion this is when look look look Daniel and John that what Daniel was to the Old Testament John was to the new they were and they both seen the same visions amen they were both told to seal up their books they were both told that it would be opened at the end let's look here at Daniel 12 and 8. and I heard but I understood not then said I oh Lord what shall the end of these what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but let's all say it together but the wise shall understand when the book is open the bride is going to understand what has been taken place let's look here let's let's go to Revelations five and two amen now remember all of those did you notice that in the Book of Revelations The Book of Revelations has the same symbols a whole bunch of the same symbols that that the Book of Daniel had the same symbols amen incredible isn't it but now now let's look here in Revelations five and two and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals and remember it's sealed up it's closed up and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look upon I went much because no man was found worthy to open or to read the book neither to look there on is that right but what happened the lamb opens the book opens the book let's let's go now let's let's go on downstairs to Revelations 10 and 1. amen and you you we've went through those on that fifth chapter lots of times amen so the lamb has opened the book now here comes the anointing of the mighty Angel the angel of the Covenant Christ the anointed one I saw another Mighty Angel come from Heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow was upon his head his face where is the sun his feet pillars of fire the same image that we saw there in in Revelations one and he had a in his hand a little book what a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now let me just stop right here some people get get all they get tangled up on the on the one foot on land and one foot on sea okay show me one scripture where Christ will ever put his foot Jesus what physically put his foot upon upon uh upon the Earth until after uh uh uh until the millennial reign and the Seas will be done away with before the millennial reign so when Jesus puts his foot upon the Earth he's going to be in uh he's going he's going to come on Mount Olivet and when he reveals himself to the Jews is that right when he reveals now now watch where what are we talking about on land and sea let's let's look here real quickly to Revelations the 13th chapter amen and if I'm confusing you're welcome you're welcome to to speak up this morning okay so there in Revelations the 13th chapter the first verse and I stood upon the sand of the sea and a beast and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having the seven heads ten horns and upon his horns uh ten crowns upon his crowns the name of blasphemy and the Beast I saw was like unto a leopard a feet of a bear in his mouth of a lion and the dragon and had power gave pan power and had great Authority now if you look at her at the three at these four deals that are that are there they are actually this is actually going back to Daniel what Daniel had referred to as well we know this all heads up in Rome I saw one of his heads as it were the wounded to death and the deadly womb was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon and gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who was like unto the Beast and who was able to make war with him and so now now we understand that this this is Rome now let's go ahead let's go all the way on down to the 11th verse and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth so now we've got one Beast coming up out of the sea we've got one coming up out of the Earth when the anointing comes in this last day it is a spiritual coming it is God coming to prepare his people before his physical come the second coming of Christ when he comes he's not coming he's not going to put his foot here on Earth we are going to catch up to meet him if you're waiting for Christ to show up on Earth you've you've missed the rapture we are going to catch be caught up to meet him but he sends his anointing and what is he doing he's put one foot upon that USA I just want to put it Hollywood and he put the other one on Rome and he said time shall be no more now watch watch what he starts to declaring here amen he's that's an anointing that says you can't have my bride you can't have my church the denomination can't have them a Rome can't have them the the the the the the daughters of of the of the great can't have them and neither can Hollywood transsexualism can't have them homosexualism can't have them nothing can have them I put my word I've put my anointing upon them and I am claiming them man now he so in the second verse he had a little book uh with his hand with his in his hand his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and he cried with the loud voices when a Ryan roared and when he cried seven Thunders under their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand up on the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein are and the earth and the things therein are and the seeing the things there therein are that time shall be no more but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now if you were just going down in the voice which I heard from Heaven speak unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up it shall be uh thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings can you say Amen now all right so here we stand here today what at this evening time I've got a problem with anyone who would say that brother Branham has added anything to the Bible no no no no no no no no this is The Complete Book come on and anything that brother Brandon would bring or anyone else that would bring has to come and line up with what is already here well praise the Lord and when you can look back they said to president one time they said oh you could write the 23rd chapter of of Revelations there's only 22 you know and and and brother brother random says no that's adding to the word you can't add but the promise was that he would bring the pieces together that the Saunders would honor and it would which was the the the the revelations contained in those seals the lamb come in this day to finish it up to where you can see the full Redemption most most people most people say it's the seals is coming afterwards and that the sales act you know most most of them are all saying that the seals are uh that the that that it has to do with the Jews amen they're putting it all over there with the Jews and they're also and that the you know the Antichrist the Antichrist is is a Muslim and um amen I mean that's that's where these guys he's got what what what what what are we what are we talking about God sends us a prophet God propped that word to us to show the completion of redemption show what is taken place first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh Church age so that you and I and what what's the end of it that book is the title deed to the Earth there is a church that is taking that word they're believing the while everyone else is dismissing it while everyone else is second throwing it off you and I are hanging on to this word with everything we've got you know why because we know who we are we know we're the completion he ain't looking for a Revival down here we're looking for a Revival in the skies we're not looking for something to take place here we're Hallelujah the Revival of God sent when he said behold I send Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen yes wonderful thing have you ever stopped to think have you ever how far am i way off yet do I have a little more time amen yes everything that John wrote in the in the Book of Revelation was in symbol form everything about that book is symbolic and God will only reveal it Hallelujah have fun I have fun just going to listening to some other guys occasionally I don't suggest it to anybody because it's just it's it's it's it's a bunch of nonsense when you know uh uh what what God is doing but remember the trumpets are for the Jews the seals have been opened up to the elect trumpets have nothing to do with us those are tribulation those are tribulation sounding you and I the seals have been taken off the cover we're going to be getting into it but the cover has been taken what God has been doing all along Hallelujah God's been doing this all along through seven ages and Satan has been trying to destroy that virtuous woman he's tried there's always been there's always been uh uh twins in it there's always been the the seed of God and the seed of the serpent there's always been God moving and then Satan moving all here Daniel you're going to go to the Grave it's going to be a long time but you're going to stand in your light at that day and all the righteous they'll understand John seal up the book it's not time oh can you say Amen but then God turned right around amen and showed him hey hey I will unveil it I will invale it at the at the evening time at the evening time and I'll show the church who she is she is Miss Jesus Christ can you say man yes yes oh did the world don't know it they're claiming that they are the Christians how many in Pawnee know anything about the true Christianity they have seen it in the churches and the denominations they've seen it lukewarmed oh it's so lukewarm and it doesn't even portray Christ at all oh Lily I'm getting ahead of myself but in each age under each one of those seals the elect was sealed under there and the Bible says touch not my oil and wine that's not my I've got an elect down in there and you're trying to kill them and oh yes you are slaughtering them you're you're 68 million of them you are sending them to their grave but you've not been able to touch that soul and you'll never you'll never take the light of my word from them every time you kill them they're going to come up on another age and they're going to keep coming up and they're going to come up and one of these days I'm going to reveal who she is every name that has been placed on the book amen is going to be they're going to all be called and redeemed I will show myself in them I will take her home amen I'm coming after a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish oh yes there are the other churches amen they're going that it's there's nothing but judgment left for them there's nothing but judgment left for the and Oliver highlights but the bride will set it aside aren't you glad that God sent a witness to show you who you are in this generation Nation oh yes amen have you ever stopped to think about it have you ever stopped to think about the Old Testament just as the Apostle Paul amen was able Apostle Paul wasn't adding anything brother Michael he did he wasn't adding anything to the Bible he was simply going back and taking what the lamb was and what it meant what the Tabernacle was and what it is he was that one that was separating and showing what was the type and now it's the Fulfillment now here we are seven Messengers later and he's taking it all he's saying now let's look back and see what this was what the dragon was let's look to see what the Beast was let's look to see oh yes let's go to Revelations 13. oh yes let's look over here let's look here and he's putting it all together so that you can see who you are well praise the Lord why has there been seven years of science of sight why would God seal why would there be why would God put seven candlesticks and Seven Stars and the Great Horror and the four horseriders and the dragon and the four creatures around the throne and why would he do this in simple form I've got two answers and I'm fixing to close number one he wasn't going to let the devil know the end of the product the devil truly thought that he had this thing beat that praise the Lord now now he don't know he don't know Satan does not know the Bible says the secret things they're they're in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 put put that up there six keys I think it's 29 and 29. the secret things belong to the Lord our God secret thing devil don't know the devil don't know what's in the back of God's mind but those things which are revealed belong unto us it didn't belong to the first the second the third they weren't rapturing this is the rapturing age God has hid it under cover and taken off the cover now it's not just God knowing about it now it's you knowing about it and now that the devil knows about it he's doing everything he can to kill you well that just makes me want to shout can you say man now amen so he could do great damage the devil could do great damage if he knew the whole plan amen so there's not been any kind of activity going on number two the church if the church knew that there were 2 000 years in this Redemption she would have gotten Lacks after the first age she's just sit next well we got another couple thousand years to go amen hallelujah what can you say man if he would have went back and and told him the church would say well you know I you know I we we might as well eat and drink and be married because it's going to be many generations Jesus ain't coming for another 2 000 years amen the church would have been loose there would have been no on the mark there have been no waiting there had been no anticipation but as it was every Church age that has went to the ground every generation of Believers has went down to the ground expecting it to come in their generation they have went down the bride has went down believing Grandma went down believing great grandma went down believing great great great grandma went down believing and there's going to be a time where there shall be no more death there's going to be a time where you and I are not going in the grave but we're going to meet the Lord in the air those that are dead and crash shall rise first and you and I will rise to meet them I think it's wonderful so the secret is in God then God comes and brings it out in simple form and then God comes and reveals it to whom it was for if the musicians would come thank you for your patience Hallelujah oh yes do you love him first it's with God secondly it's given by a prophet in the simple form and then thirdly God sends a prophet right at that time and reveals what the symbols are can you say Amen oh I'm gonna give you a little I'm gonna I'm gonna give you something that's gonna blow your mind well maybe not all of you at the end of Revelations John kneels down to worship the angel he's he's so he has so beside himself and the angel says don't do that get up get up get up y'all remember reading that I'll read it to you Revelations 22 and 8. and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am of thy for I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them that keep the sayings of this book [Music] God revealed it to John by a prophet [Music] Prophets praise the Lord and can I can I just can I just can I can I just blow your mind some more after he told him to seal it up then the very next words and he saith unto me seal not to prophecies of this book oh I I have a feeling that it was I have a feeling it was probably the evening time Elijah I just have the I just have a feeling it was probably it was probably Elijah I have a Hallelujah this now this ain't this this ain't the Bible this is just my opinion I have a feeling that since Elijah that there are supposed to be this coming of Elijah to the Gentile Church I'll send you Elijah and you go back to Elijah and Elijah was the one that picked up all of the pieces of of the old amen of the old altar and the Bible says he put all the pieces back together and it was on the altar it was of it was on the put together of the old altar the restoration of the old altar fire came down you know I I just I just happen to believe that there's a special connection between that Elijah and this Elijah [Music] you love him I I just I I was I was in Pentecost and I I had to do a lot of believing it took a lot of believing for some for some stuff that was taught I mean I it took amen because I couldn't find it in the Bible but I'm sure glad that I I don't have to worry about anything these days I can find it in the Bible I can find where it is written can you say man what is it it's to give you a faith because it's going to require a faith greater than any other age it's going to be a it's got to be a perfect faith and brother I want to tell you still wrestling with well this one and that one and this one why don't you come back and look for Vindication and say God let me not miss the vindication oh I know there's a lot of good men and I know they claim a lot of wonderful things but brother God Is So Vindicated his man hold those 400 those 400 prophets out there they they they did hit they did hit it on occasion they did they were wonderful men bail them hit it on occasion [Music] amen but he was a false prophet there's a lot of prophets out there there's a lot of good men good teaching why don't we go to the one it's hard to do because Satan's going to try to push you away from that Micah [Music] he's going to try to push you away from that one that Ahab should have heated but he didn't it wasn't in his heart to heed but oh God I'm so thankful that you've given us your word open your word to me this morning I pray that you open your word to me oh don't let me don't let me think I know let me know that I know Let Your Grace be with me teach me your ways teach me your words can you say Amen aren't you glad that God sends Messengers to us amen it's not important that you listen to me now now it is it is important God sends pastors but I've got to line up with with the messenger of that age just like every other age God did not appear unto he didn't say unto the angels of Smyrna I enjoy [Music] if you look in the Bible there was never more than one major prophet on the earth at the same time Elijah had to go off the scene before Elisha Elisha's Ministry was second unto Elijah look at Moses look at Noah look at all of these others yes there were Minor Prophets that there was the major word prophet there are prophets in the body of Christ prophecies in the body of Christ there are tongues and interpretation Gifts of wisdom and knowledge in the body of Christ but only one Messenger to an age you all understand what I'm saying and God does that because he wants you he'll vindicate that you vindicate that gift not that you worship him but that you worship Him that you worship that it won't take us turn our thoughts from this and that and this and that an eternus to the realities of who this is for the word was made flesh and I say today there is a bride who is being made Word Flesh and we shall be like him do you love him I I know I I know a lot of us just got back from a to from a from a wonderful Jubilee but you see the reason why we can have those wonderful jubilees in those meetings because we know what they're saying we know what it's about and it takes guys like me [Music] oh amen love y'all love our church love our girls over here and our boys over here all of our teenagers love all of you I'm happy I've accepted the word I sure hope I wasn't too scattered when you start dealing with prophets you could oh my the Bible says nothing but prophets amen that whisper by the prophet [Music] of Malachi whoa can't you see why I'm happy I have accepted the word [Music] the revealed [Music] that whisper again by the prophet of Malachi [Applause] [Music] can't you see [Music] I'm happy oh yes I've accepted the words Jesus [Music] [Music] come on [Music] what's up you kids May wonder why do we call this yeah you ever wondered why we call this the message like y'all ever thought about that maybe some of you don't [Music] because the Bible is seeds and there's a designated time for each of these things to come to pass on its purpose so God shines his light on certain portions of scripture they're all good but Moses couldn't build a boat to go down into Egypt that light had already Shone now God was shining on this one right so the message of each age it was God coming to that age and Shining lights on scripture for that age now we all believe in it we all but you see there was a time it's hard to believe there was a time where the church didn't understand justification it took Martin Luther the light to shine because the word had been totally lost and it was all in uh what what was the language of the papal Latin fixing to say Italian Latin it was all and and but it took Martin Luther and the shining and that's when the Great Reformation of the just shall live by faith and justification but they all still smoke their pipes junked their alcohol they were as just as Loose as a Goose here come here come Wesley Shining Light on sanctification [Music] 1906 outpouring of the Holy Ghost it was a light are y'all understanding so the message when we say the message what we're saying is we're living in present day it doesn't do away with any of that I'm still Justified I'm still Sanctified I still speak in tongues but God's given me the furtherance I'm glad for the message do you understand the prophet God bless you now of my one more time [Music] I'm happy oh Jesus I've accepted the words of the Lord hallelujah your words that were spoken [Music] I love you for you are mine I love you for you divine [Music] I love you forever it's true [Music] you are Jesus who died God bless me now as we prepare to dismiss now I I love you for me I love it I love you for you [Music] I love you forever [Music] I'm fixing to go and lay hands on sister Sharon here in a few minutes the devil is really really working hard on our sister and I would like for us to pray before we dismiss and our sister has really been sick and I just want us to all bind together while the anointing is here today and be believing with me as we as I go to lay hands on her we love sister Sharon father as we come to the end of this service and we we look here at our selves in your life how precious it is that you would take the cover off of us to let us see Who We Are it puts a confidence humility that you've done all of this for us you've done this so that we can clearly see who you are and we see you as a Healer we see you as our groom I pray Lord [Music] that you would hear our request as we stand and favor for our sister and I ask Lord she would touch her or her stomach can Lord she's not been able to eat and she's been throwing up oh Jesus hear the request of this people this morning see your daughter who's faithful to you and loves you Satan trying his best Lord he wants to kill her he wants to take away her faith but I'm asking that you would give her a confidence that you've got everything in your hand [Music] father I thank you for it Lord we give ourselves to you now we love you with all of our heart we're asking God that you would be with us in our fellowship and that you would bless the food that the sisters have prepared and just asked that your grace would be with us Lord as as we go to eat Lord we love you now in Jesus name amen and amen [Music] I am the Lord your healer you are the god that he lift me you are the Lord my healer [Music] you set your word and the humanities you
