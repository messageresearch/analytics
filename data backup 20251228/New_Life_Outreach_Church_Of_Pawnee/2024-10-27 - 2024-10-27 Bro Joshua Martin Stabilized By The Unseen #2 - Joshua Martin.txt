your Bibles this evening let's open our scriptures to 11 Hebrews 11 And1 amen did you enjoy the songs this this afternoon the special amen it is good to have brother William and sister Sharon with us I I forgot to make mention of that this morning it's it's good to have them with us I know it's a it's a a Bittersweet sweet for them bitter for us but I know we're going to miss y'all around here but pray the Lord blesses y'all when y'all uh go back to Arizona but Hebrews 11 And1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen can we pray this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father oh Lord uh we thank you for this opportunity Lord to come into your house one more time lord maybe never take it for granted father that we have an open door to come and sing and to worship Lord to let off the pressure and to receive encouraging words father we ask that you would be in this part of the service God we ask that you would move One More Time Lord as we felt your presence this morning Father we ask that you would move again speak to the hearts meet the needs father We Lay the service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated this evening I'm just going to continue on my subject on stabilized by the Unseen um brother Brandon would say in look if men come out there just as an idol to look upon the serpent they received nothing but when the True Believer came out and looked upon the serpent with spiritual revealed truth that serpent the serpent itself being in the form of a serpent it represented sin already judged then they seen their sin their unbelief already under judgment from the serpent from the Garden of Eden as the serpent was made out of brass which means divine judgment see the altar was made out of brass the Brazen altar which the the sacrifice was off offered upon brass Divine judgment he says if you had come out and just looked at it just to look at it he says nothing would happen but the True Believer with a spiritual revealed truth would look upon it and would see in that brass serpent it was the atonement and the freedom of what was binding them the the the the the the snake bites I believe what what what what what the atonement was for at that time he would they would look at it and realize this is the thing that I'm needing to get my Deliverance they would have understanding and I believe that the True Believer hears more than just sermons we hear more than just just quotes and and scriptures but I believe when we hear this message we hear substance we hear something that is calling out to us and revealing to us that we've got a future and brother Brandon would say now listen real close to this remark Faith now don't forget this now Faith is designed to see what God wills and wants there was no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and give to the human race to find out what the will of God Is So faith in the word of God reveals and it's designed for you to see what the will of God is you know we don't just look at the we don't listen to tapes just out of Duty but I believe we can find the will of God for our our marriages we can find the will of God for our families we can find the will of God and by faith we can put that into action we see what God designs and what he wants in this generation and brother Brandon would tell us that Pharaoh would look out a window and would see the children of Israel and would say that they're just mud dobbers they're just slaves and brother Brandon would say that Moses would look out the same window and not see slaves but he seen Victory you see it was the faith of God in the word of God which would produce the will of God in their life and I believe that faith in the word of God would produce the promises in every one of our life you believe that you believe that this evening so when when Pharaoh was looking at slaves Moses was looking at Victory and I believe whenever everybody else looks at circumstances they look at sicknesses they look at the they look at uh things by natural eyes you see more than circumstances you see Victory you see more than the Valley of the shadow of death but you see that he is with me it's looking in the Unseen by faith and realizing that the Unseen is walking with us every step of the way and it's not that we're hoping to have it but the Brandon would tell us that hope is looking for something but faith has something faith is the evidence the substance of things hoped for so it's not that we're hoping to achieve Victory but faith has already achieved it for the brandom says now we reason with our mind but the heart doesn't reason the heart just believes we look with their eyes but we see with the heart do you look you you you take something complicated you see I I you say I don't just see it you mean you don't understand it understanding comes from the heart you have your understanding and so by understanding we know that Victory is right around the corner for us you know whenever you feel like uh you get dry in your get dry in your experience with God you don't hope for Revival you believe for Revival you start to press toward a Revival you lay you lay aside the weights that easily beset you you're working and you and you're working to achieve something with your faith you see brother brandom says hope looks for it but Faith achieves it brother brandom says now look he says uh hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now see faith says God said so in its mind that settles it sea I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now God said so and that SLE says see that's Faith but hope says God said so I'm expecting to get it someday you see I'm expecting someday and as long as Satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants and so hope is pushing off Revival for right for for another year for our next convention for a youth camp but faith says but faith says Revival is right now hope says healing is way off in the future but faith says it's right now he continues on to say that's right you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property and I love how he puts it it's your personal property you know if I come up to come up the dev and I took his tie it's not mine it's his tie and so now he has every right to come track me down hunt me down and take his tie back because it was his in the first place so he ain't coming and stealing it from me he's taking it back you see you can't steal Joy from the devil you're just returning it back to it's original owner but hope is pushing it off that you'll never get it you'll never get it you'll never see Revival you'll never see Deliverance in your family you'll never see uh Revival in your marriage you see but faith says no I'm not hoping for it I'm achieving it I'm grabbing a hold of it and bringing the Unseen into reality oh my that's what this message has done it has brought the Unseen into reality but the brandom continues on to say you know faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen is that right Faith acts now it's positive I love that Faith acts now it's positive it's not a negative thing you know brother Brandon would say it's like putting a an apple before the horse to get it to move he says it's not it's not a negative thing it's a positive thing that you can reach out and grab you're seeing but as long as Satan is putting it off for another day that's as good as he wants you to get but you see even if you don't see the results now you've got substance you've got something to grab a hold of you know brother Brandon would say that Peter didn't walk on water he walked on substance ain't that incredible he says and he stepped down and said it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he go when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared and what came what come in his mind the first thing I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk the next thing he looked at well he looked at his symptoms he he looked up there and seen how big them waves was and he got scared and when he did he went down see what he feared happened what he believed happened and when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed and and and and later on in the quote he says substance would have walked right over top of that white cap it would have went right onto him ain't that incredible so he didn't walk upon the Water he walked upon substance until he started to fear fell and you see brother the brandom says what he feared would come upon him and that is something that the devil likes to throw upon Church Upon church members message Believers is the fear of failure and brother brandom says what you fear is going to come upon you and job would say what I feared has come upon me and so the devil wants to throw these things on you that you're never going to be good enough you're not going to make a Rapture and you start to believe those things and it pushes you in that direction and takes away the substance that this message has brought you but this ain't the time to throw away substance for fear it's time to throw away fear and grab a hold of substance and brother Brandon would say in the Book of Job it says here job feared and when he feared it it actually happened what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him his faith would have taken it away and kept him from it but his fear brought it on he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now he know it wouldn't have happened it wouldn't have happened see what I mean and if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just haven't got the faith sufficient it'll never happen that way see but if you know you're it's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance of something and so Faith goes beyond fear hope is that hope is is combined with fear hope is is hoping I'm going to get it but there's that little chance I might not get it and brother brandom says if you're afraid that you're not going to get it don't worry you're not going to get it but if you actually believe he says there's a substance behind it and I believe every one of us is is wanting a Revival right wanting a renewing in our lives wanting a renewing in our in our families but we're not hoping for a Revival we're expecting a Revival right we're not hoping for an an outpouring of the Holy Ghost we're expecting the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but you see before we can ever see the supernatural we've got to expect the supernatural right you're never going to get up and get something if you don't want it in the first place right many want to see the results but they don't want to expect the results they don't want to put put the effort in in of entering in and pulling out a Revival for themselves you know it was Elijah that would say I see the I see the I hear the abundance of rain right and there was and you know and if you look up the scripture he he would say this before he seen The Cloud of a man's hand I always thought that he had seen the cloud then said I hear the sound of the abundance of rain has anybody else ever thought that I always thought he seen the cloud then said it but he said it first then seen the cloud so before he ever seen any in the result or or any any actions or or seen any evidence he was already preparing for the Revival and you notice what what why would start this revival into motion the Bible would tell us he would call a showdown upon Mount Carmel right and he would get a 450 priests together and at the end of it he would say if God be God then serve him if B be God then serve them but you see what would happen if during The Showdown 450 50 priests would be slain by the Israelites and so the very thing that would keep them from moving to the things of God once they would slay them the very next verse if you look there in First Kings 18 and 40 and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of baale let not one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brick Kon and slew them there and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain so as soon as the the the all of the the priest of bell was slain then the Revival would start to move into action oh and I think if there's ever a time to get rid of sin in our lives let's slay every priest of bail let's slay every emotion that will try to hinder us from the things of God so that we can see the abundance of rain oh Hallelujah he would he would say I hear it and but Brandon would say when we find Elijah kept looking until he seen just the size of a man's hand no unbelief would have caught that real quick is that the best that you can do see if that's all you can do we'll take it back but what was it he was looking for the supernatural oh he knew that only the hand of God could do it and when he saw that hand j s u s he had F I F AI t h yes when he saw it he said I hear the sound of the abundance of rain what wasn't he accepted the first move but you notice brother brandom says he was looking for the Supernatural and he only knew he would come by the hand of God ain't that incredible so a man is not going to bring the supernatural only the hand of God can bring the Supernatural and so if we get our eyes upon the hand of God and say Lord whatever you bring from behind the pulpit I accept it it may hurt but I accept it I'm wanting to get rid of all of the hindrances so that I can see the move of God and you know that we had a prophet in this generation that would call for a showdown he would he would line up all of and I love how brother Brandon he the confidence that he would have I believe there was a blind man that would worship the son and he would call them all out and say if your God is able to open his eyes come up and do it if your God is able to open up his eyes come up and do it he was calling a showdown letting the Believers in the congre ation no if you think that is God have him produce the results but if I God is the truth it will produce the results we know what would happen that his eyes would come open it was a showdown letting you know that there's a Revival for the bride and Miracle has missed it's it's Revival but the bride has got a word Revival in this generation that you can experience day in and day out on the good days you can live in Revival on the bad days you can live in Revival we see we didn't just get an Elijah in this generation with with to bring a showdown but we also got our own cloud right we didn't just get a a cloud of a man's hand but we got a cloud of God's face his head letting you know that I'm returning to the body to bring forth the results so it ain't us trying to produce the Revival he brought the Revival and what would brother brandom say he says that's the Lord up there oh it it wasn't a man's idea it wasn't some intellectualness coming down it was our Lord coming down with an open book the bright Revival letting you know I hear the sound of the abundance of rain and brother Brandon would say I hear the sound of abundance of healing so whatever you have need of I hear the sound if you can just get rid of all of the doubts all the skeptic feelings if you can get get rid of all of the priests of baale then you can see that there's abundance waiting for you and I like how Elijah would put it I he didn't say I hear the sound of rain I hear the sound of abundance of rain and not just a little Trinkle but it's going to overflow all of your ponds it's going to overflow all of your streams and I believe the blessings of God it's not just a little bit but there's a there's enough to pour out upon our lives and it overflow pour out upon our marriages and it overflow it's abundant not just a little bit but abundant brother the Brandon would say this here how do you know what the truth said the devil I know it's the truth it's God's word it's the truth something begins to pulsate in your bosom that it is the truth then make ready you're coming out of there just as certain as I stand in this pull pit tonight don't look at what you see how bad I'm crippled how sick I am what the doctor said don't look at that look at the Unseen what God said before you feel any different before the pain leaves before the hand moves before the eye can can can see one sight you make ready for it's going to come oh he says before you see any evidence of it you make ready because it is going to come and he would point there to the to the people in the wheelchairs it says you get ready you're coming out of it oh you may feel like you're in a slump this evening but get ready you're coming out of it you may say you don't understand I'm in a drought that is worse than than Israel don't worry I hear the sound if you're getting rid of all of the unbelief in your life I hear the sound of the abundance of rain don't worry you're coming out of it oh Hallelujah and you see that's just not some empty words of a man trying to prophesy he was letting you know if you truly believe it then start making preparations dig the ditches so to speak speak if you truly expect it to happen then act upon it oh but Elijah was looking for the Supernatural and I believe that we can look for it and see it you know I read this quote this morning but before Jesus ever rode into the city they were making ready for him to come but the Bram says now watch now here now here BEC comes riding unto the city just exactly what the word said he would do riding uh riding on a little donkey coming into the city these were not looking at the Creed not looking at the temple not looking at these other things not looking up the priest or what they had to say those that believed him were standing there with with palm in their hand just waiting for the first move you never heard them say who's coming oh no they knew who was coming they knew what the word said you see but then brother brandom says there was another group that would hear the commotion would come out and say who is this and brother Brandon would tell us they wasn't expecting in him to come so when he came they didn't know who it was and I think it's so incredible cuz brother brandham says why was they in the city in the first place was because God had told them to do a feast remember that and brother Brandon would say the very one that told them to do the feast was now riding in the city but they failed to see him and and and and I and brother Brandon would tell us that what Jesus was there upon the cross they were there singing songs you know they pierced my side you know and brother Brandon says it was happening right in front of them but they could not see it their expectation of how it was going to happen did not match the way God was coming to to to uh to express itself and don't don't let us get an expectation that God is going to move a certain way and when God starts to move we miss our Revival right we miss our visitation we miss the way God is talking to us because you're never going to get a Revival unless you expect a Revival right and you're not going to expect a Revival unless you know you need a Revival right and so brother brandom says those who were looking for him did not say who is this they recognized him and they started to act upon who they seen and brother Brandon would say this watch Elijah when he accepted it you know his life must have been renewed he outran ahab's chariots he ran before the Chariot when he could hardly climb the hill he ran before the Swift horses get the rain barrels out I hear the sound of abundance of rain the first move Glory as soon as he accepted him it hadn't even rained yet he didn't see one drop but him accepting it would bring such a Revival that he would outrun the king's chariots and let me say this you you accept the word the bride's Revival and watch a new Strength come on the inside and you can out run every unbelieving Spirit you can out run every skeptical spirit that tries to come against you it's not you seeing the results it's you accepting it which brings the results oh Hallelujah brother Brandon says he could barely walk up the hill before but once he accepted it then he could outrun the Chariots oh not when he seen the manifestation but when he accepted he accepted the substance of it and then that would bring on a renewing oh Hallelujah and Elijah he wasn't looking for flashy things right he would hear the thunder he would see the lightning he would feel the earthquake but he knew that he wasn't looking for any of those things but give me something true give me something person
