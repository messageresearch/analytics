like to look here in The Book of Mark the 16th chapter thank you musicians we sure enjoyed the special this morning and and um enjoyed the worship and it's sure is good to see uh everyone it's good to see our friends from Oklahoma City God bless yall so good to have y'all this morning and um and I brother Myrtle is already mentioned sister Hannah and sister Caroline and and um it's always good to see you sister Caroline I I I agree I like that smile too amen and I I have a I have a feeling there's another one that likes that smile amen and uh so but God is so good to us this morning amen let's look here in Mark 16 and 14 afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and up braided them uh and up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them that had seen him after he he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with with them confirming the word with signs following amen I'd also like to read here in the book of second Timothy the 4th chapter amen and we'll start at the first verse here praise the Lord amen I I think fall Time Is Here praise the lord it's getting getting chilly out there uh 2 Timothy 4 And1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but will Heap uh after their own lust or but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables amen God bless the reading of his word you can be seated here this morning I want to minister for a little bit here this morning uh on a on a simple subject it am man the god called preacher and um amen we are thankful for men of God and um we we talked here uh a week or so ago on the doctrine of unbelief and and and how that the Satan is is very uh he's very Sly and he's he's very uh his his ways the Antichrist is amen is anti- word and he comes in the in the simp simplest of forms to to take us uh away from what God's word says and so we want to always line everything up line our belief system up with the word of God in in all that we do now the prophet had taught us that the amen that the Antichrist Spirit was so subtle it he says it started with some some Deeds just amen some some things that were little contrary to the word they had left their first love in that in that first age and amen and and and then it become a saying and then before you know it when you got to the Third Church age it had it had become a Doctrine amen and it wasn't a Doctrine according to the word of God it was something that was totally contrary to the word of God and yet these men were preaching it as as if it was was the Gospel truth and they were amen bringing it bringing it in but that doesn't change the fact that that God has has got a plan and his plan to Amen to to for people to be saved is is through uh the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen preaching is the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus it is to show or to introduce the living Christ to the world Amen a a a preacher is to to prove that Christ is indeed alive amen and that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is not just some figment of man's imagination but it is the very power of God un salvation amen and so we we can see as we as we uh uh as we read here that that he was saying I I want you to go and I I want you to to Proclaim this good news I want you to Proclaim it with authority I will be there with you you lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover amen you'll cast out Devils I will be in you bringing my words to to to reality to the people can you say amen I I I want to I I want to say to every every preacher in the building here this morning amen every preacher there is a great responsibility that is upon us as Ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen you've got to be divinely called you've got to be divinely trained and you've got to be divinely inspired of God Amen sometimes you know as the congregation we the congregation doesn't really amen know the process or many times don't understand what what is involved in in in being a preacher because the the preacher is living in two different worlds he's amen he's got to provide for his family he's got to go to work many of times he's got to amen uh uh uh love his children and raise them up and amen but yet there is a call upon on his life there's a there's a a a deep cry for Souls there's there's there's a a deep cry in the heart of a man of God that that wants to see the reality of the supernatural alive among the Bride of Jesus Christ amen he's not just one that is that that that is settled for just amen coming up and preaching occasionally behind the pulpit but he is ordained of God he is inspired tired of God to to to get this message to the people and he and he knows he's got to get it right he knows he's got to preach it exactly the way brother Brandon preached it in the spirit that brother Brandon preached it or he will have to give an account on that very day can you say amen amen so there is a responsibility that is that that lays within the bosom and The Souls of of the preacher amen I will say many times the that Satan will try to to kill the vessel even from very at at an early age or even from birth amen Satan will try to destroy that man and that that you you'll notice as amen H there there there there are uh uh Satan's got his got got his got his gun zeroed in on him because he's got a call from God Amen and God will even allow the devil to take that man to the last of his ability amen but brother Brandon would tell us but it's all in the training amen it's all in the training he says we cannot have Revival until we get men God called men God trained men that's that's not trained in the schools of Theology and of education but rugged men of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training men who are not afraid to face the fire men who has come in the presence of God and know knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men that has been trained to know the Living God somebody say know the Living God it's all right to train them by the word but the letter kth the spirit gives life and before we can have a Revival uh this revival God has to call out and and train men God trained men to carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat or in the Lion's Den or wherever it may be they're ready to go because they've been in the presence of God and they know he is whether it's the victory or defeat they stand still they still stand the same that's the kind of training God does to men it's very strange to think that God would do that that God would train his men like that but he does and you know we have an old song We sing some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood God leads his people through great trials to purge them and sometimes it takes years to do it as for myself I believe God right now is training such men to meet the front line men are going to go through and shaken from their feet and sometimes it looks like the whole thing is Fallen but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God and keep their face forward and keep moving on can you say amen amen so as we as we have just uh uh looked here it's more than just being able to look at a a a at your computer and put some quotes together and to put some uh a few notes together amen and it's a wonderful thing I I I I think of uh brother Kobe and having the you young men to to to be able to you know get up and testify and and talk about the word of the Lord and and and what it means and and and you and you look at quotes and you look at scriptures and and this is a a wonderful thing because I think every one of us should be a I don't care whether you're a preacher or not you you owe it to your soul to dig into that message amen and to see what brother bradam said about it and you owe it to your soul to read your Bible and to pray every day that's not the preacher's job to be spiritual for you amen it is your job Amen to take the word of God and the message of this hour amen I don't want to just say and the message the word of God which is the message of this hour amen and and Proclaim it amen within your family in your life but you see amen even still with all of that that is not a call to preach the word you see God has ordained men amen not to be able to look at quotes not just look at scriptures and put them together and put a little sermonette together but he has anointed those men to preach the gospel under the power of the Holy Ghost amen I I I I I put a challenge to every man of God Amen or every every young person or amen anyone in this building under the the sound of my my voice and if you feel a call of God upon your life amen listen I I I want to say Amen keep a routine of quietness before God keep a routine of Amen uh amen just setting alone with God and saying God I want you to feel me God I want you to amen I want to hear from you I want to get it right I want the prophet's message amen not to just be right here in my mind but I want the prophet's message to be right here in my heart amen this this this just ain't going to cut it but I want the power of God living and residing within this heart and making Revelation to live within me can you say amen amen a preacher doesn't just study H H for a sermon amen he's not just listening to a tape for a sermon a preacher amen is taking amen his call that responsibility seriously as he goes in before the Lord amen in that Sweet Hour of Prayer Oh Glory to God Amen a preacher is called to deliver and to set the captives free through the anointed preaching of the word the preacher amen these days are amen are simply explainers we got too many preachers that are explainers we got too many preachers that are amen that are Educators amen but that is not according to the Holy Ghost plan God's not sent the preacher to educate you amen he has anointed the preacher to preach the gospel under the anointing of the holy spirit in this day that we're living in amen now a sermonette on a certain topic is not a preacher a few scriptures and a few quotes to parallel author is not a preacher we got to have a preacher amen under the anointing of the Holy Spirit you see dead sermons though using scriptures and quotes amen they kill but it's the quickening of the power of the holy spirit that gives life amen amen hallelujah so preachers we've got to preach the gospel Jesus was anointed to preach Jesus amen and it didn't just have some some nice but empty words coming from a good man Jesus was not amen a well-meaning man full of sympathy for his fellow men and and others felt good around him and amen and wanted to be around him no Jesus was the very word he was anointed of God to preach the gospel well go glory to God Amen Jesus knew what it was to swing that sword Jesus knew what it was to set captives free Jesus knew what it was Amen to heal the Blind and to and to raise the dead why he was anointed to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ so let me put it this way Jesus was commissioned and Jesus was anointed to preach the gospel there in Luke 4:18 he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance amen that that means to announce the release amen of the captives and the recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at liberty or to set at H H free them that are bruised to preach or to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord what can you say Amen amen what was this acceptable year of the Lord this was the Year of Jubilee when the captives amen were to go free it was the Proclamation that Satan's day is over and the power of the Eternal God that was on the earth Amen to bring Deliverance to God's people amen oh yes amen I I I want to tell you amen that God knows what he's doing God how many believes God still alive today how many believes the anointing is still on the Earth today and that the anointing can still set the captives free Hallelujah now I know there's a lot of Kneads I know there's a lot of Knuckleheads amen a lot of preachers that that are behind pull pits today that don't belong behind pull pits amen well praise the Lord amen and there ain't nothing that can help a person like a preacher and there ain't nothing that can destroy an individual like a preacher amen a preacher can can can can bring amen healing to you and help you and pray with you and preach the gospel to you and set you free and a preacher can also scar you amen and leave you for dead because he's he's he's a he's not a he he's under his own wisdom he's under his own theologies and well praise the Lord and there's been too many in the message of the hour amen that takes the word of God that has come so pristinely that has come so precisely that has come so anointed of God well let me tell you something friends there's never been a day like this day there's never been a time where Satan has been exposed like in this day but yet there are preachers amen that'll get up through their intellect and try to call carve out their own amen following and carve out their own ideology and they the people of God well yall might as well help me preach amen they the people of God but that does not do away with the fact that God's going to have a preacher and God's going to have an anointing and God's going to set the captives free and there's going to be somebody that makes that rapture amen now God so involved man in his eternal purpose of redemption that he will do nothing outside of the agency of man amen now Jesus was the lord of the Harvest but Jesus turned to his disciples and he says the Harvest is ripe and the laborers are few pray ye the Lord lord of the Harvest to send labors into his Harvest this brother bradam would say he's making himself with man so bound together that he works only through the agency of man he chose man to work for him he could have chose the son to preach the gospel he could have chose the winds or the trees the stars but he chose man veils himself inside hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to whom he will can you say Amen what would Jesus say amen he says there in John 14 and 10 he says believest Thou that I not that I am in the father and the father in me and the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall shall he do also and greater than these shall he do because I go to my father can you say amen amen but I are y'all following me here today God works through the agency of men man now just because God is working through the agency of men men does not mean that God is needing your mental Powers it doesn't mean that he is needing your intellect oh no he doesn't need you to sit at your computer and come up with quotes uh amen that are interesting amen he's not needing you to learn the Greek and the Hebrew what he is needing is somebody that is surrendered to the power of God oh praise the Lord amen Jesus didn't tell the apostles amen go up and set you know seminaries and and teach all about me and what I did and go to new cities and set up new chapters and get new disciples amen I'm going to leave but now amen I just want you to go and and and teach something that I have done in the past but you see Jesus was not going he's not interested in just something of the past he wanted the world to know that he is alive today that his words are true today that his power is real today well come on church amen it's not something a of a yesterday but it's a reality of God's word today amen now he done something wonderful he was raised from the dead and you would think in the natural that that man amen or that Jesus would look and say now I want you to to go out and tell it wherever you go and amen set up all of these chap and get me a following out there but you see he says I don't want you doing anything until you go to Jerusalem and I want you to stay at Jerusalem until you've be endued with power from on high and then when you are that well can you say Amen what was he telling them I'm going to anoint you with the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead The Same Spirit that dwelt in me has got to anoint you with that same word hallelujah now today preachers amen it's it's it's just become a thing of Amen sharing quotes and I love quotes amen hallelujah but if you're not under the same anointing that brother brandham was when he preached this message can you imagine brother brandham amen preaching uh uh uh that that that seven that crazy seven Thunder Doctrine I never heard brother brandham preach that now brother brandham talked about the about the seven Thunders giving Faith the two Souls Doctrine find that quote in the in the message for me on Amen these doctrines that that that are out there you know don't don't even believe in predestination and so we've got men that intellectually looking in computers and and they're and they're and they're taking a little bit of this and they're taking a little bit of that and they're taking a little bit of this well it's no wonder we've got a bunch of confused folks around these these days it's no wonder amen that the power of God because it's got to be by every word of God brother Bram did not dismiss the word of God brother brandham brought us back to every word of God well well I'm here I might as well preach this morning amen you see what has taking place is we've got a bunch of intellectual numcols that don't have the Holy Ghost and they're over there trying to lead their own cult following and that's not the message of the hour that's right well praise the Lord but it does not take away from the Holy Ghost in his church amen amen God calls now preachers God calls you he ordained you he separates you amen hallelujah the preacher has emptied himself surrendered himself to the Holy Spirit and you will never ever ever be above the prophet you will never ever have a revelation greater than the prophet you will never ever correct the prophet you must preach what the prophet says say it exactly like and then live it the way the prophet lived it Hallelujah brother Bram says now to bring up this faith in Christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good godsent man a a good godsent preacher I admire them their gift is far beyond anything could be done in any anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God can you say Amen the responsibility is upon us not to be just shooting off at the mouth and not just having an intellectual uh uh talk but an anointing of the holy spirit that will that will line us up with the message of this hour yeah praise the Lord nowen I I I you know uh the last I seen amen the the throughout the seven Church ages the angel only came to seven men unto the angel of Ephesus unto the angel of samna well praise the Lord unto the angel of Le oosa can you say amen and then the men of God pick up the inspiration I can't I'm going to I'm going to be driving that home all all throughout my message this morning the inspiration of the hour the mighty Angel did not leave when brother brandham left the same angel that brought the words of life to you and to me through the that seven Church age messenger is still here to anoint if you will hear what he has to say can you say man it's empty vessels does God still call preachers today yes he does Amen he's going to he wants to anoint and to use he would be the intelligence he will do the leading Jes Jus at one time had said take no thought what you shall say man don't don't come up with your own plan just keep it the way that I want it can you say man the anointing of the Holy Spirit I believe am man uh brother brother brandham would just and I'll just read this to you am man he says now he he said surrender to me and I'll walk in them and talk in them and speak in them them and work in them oh my that's it I'll do the work just let them humble let them just empty up and I'll just beat my enemy out there through them Hallelujah you see he says that's it you can't do it in yourself now you're not a match for him but if you'll just let God do it get the word in you then it'll all be taken care of now God fortified his army with what what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it's God's dress the inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer forese before Satan gets gets to it done uh done done told it what is it it's God dressed up in the church these offices God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is it that's God's dress wear that's God's presence that's God's spirit working through man and if that office denies any of this word then it's not God's dressing no not that it's that wolf in shapes clothing watch that fellow beware of him but when he just takes what the word says remember that's God because he's speaking the word of God Amen he says now now but but but if he says well it isn't oh oh oh my he says get going sheep get going can you say amen amen so so what is what is the prophet of God telling us amen God said that's these in order now I don't understand how amen how we're all going to be able to make this Rapture I don't understand how how how we're all going to be able to come into the unity of the faith I don't understand how amen how it is that it it in my it in in you know that God would allow me to to to to be the head of my wife and here I'm living in a in a decayed body amen I hear I'm still fighting Devils myself but I will say this that God has set these offices God has set these positions God has set that there for me to lead my wife well praise the Lord God has anointed us to do so God has anointed preachers to preach this message under the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah now anything that we have read so far of what brother brandham has has taught about a preacher is not an intellectual man standing behind a pull pit there is an anointing that is to follow the fivefold ministry because God works through that Ministry well praise the Lord amen now Hallelujah the apostles were told that the same Spirit who anointed Jesus would come upon them amen Jesus said they' know what the holy spirit is because it was with them now in the body of Jesus Christ and he told him that he would continue to work through them amen a a and when Christ was raised and ascended on high he says he's given the gifts unto men brother bradam says that was the apostolic commission and it will never cease until the last Soul comes in now Jesus would say if you're there in John 14 and 15 if you love me keep my Commandments I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knows him but you know him and he dwells with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father ye in me and I in you can you say Amen now Jesus is letting them know that there's fixing to be a transfer he is going to be leaving but the Holy Spirit the same holy spirit that anointed Jesus would be upon the body of Believers amen Jesus plainly tells his disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they received their credentials from on high I don't want you preaching I don't want you witnessing I don't want you doing anything until until you are endued with power from on high and only then can you Proclaim this gospel Acts 1:8 he says but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me how many Wants To Be A Witness of his resurrection amen telling stories of the past is not going to cut it friends talking about a Jesus of 2,000 years ago is not going to cut it talking about our prophet's Ministry of 2,000 years ago is not the intent that the God had for this last days God's got a powerful Church there is the holy spirit that is living today in his body here on the earth and the prophet of God says this would be the most powerful age a church of all ages this would become the most powerful people why because she's got her doctrines lined up she's got the life lined up she's got it lined up with thus sayeth the Lord if there's ever been a time amen for preachers to Stand Tall it should be today if there's ever been a time for a preacher Amen to be humble it should be in this day if there's ever been a time time for the people Amen to to expect the supernatural amen from the ministry it should be in this day because there is an anointing Upon This Land Amen to take us into a Rapture folks can you say amen amen God take your word God hallelujah amen now these disciples these Apostles amen couldn't just talk about a story of yesterday amen about a yesterday God that don't set the captives free right the god of Jesus Christ was now living in those disciples there in Acts 4:33 and the Bible says and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all can you say Amen the Apostle Paul says I didn't come with enticing words I'm not trying to find a following I didn't come with some kind of educated a a a talk I come with the anointing of the holy spirit amen just to read there in 1 Corinthians 2 and 1 say I Brethren when I came to you came not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom when declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you sa Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling my speech and my preaching was not with the enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God hallelujah well praise the Lord hallelujah amen now he could have sit there and said listen I was Head and Shoulders above all I was taught by G amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost chose me to be the the Apostle I know what I'm talking about amen I've got my I've got all my my my tees crossed and my eyes dotted I've got everything thing all lined up now you guys amen I'm the chief bny rooster around here and y'all listening to me and y'all listen to my interpretation no that's not what the Apostle Paul says he says there was an anointing that fought let me tell you something that same anointing now you'll never be a prophet I'll never be a word Prophet there is hallelujah there is only one scent to this generation and that is William Maryam Brandon but what we've got is too many educators that are trying to teach something that they don't know nothing about what we need is the anointing of the Holy Spirit the same anointing that taught it to brother brandham which we listening to those tapes to come back upon us well glory to God I said glory to God hallelujah I thought this would be a little bit more of a shouting message this morning but I'm doing all right hallelujah hallelujah that's right now we've had so many how many how many oh here I am going off on a little tangent how many of those men that stood with brother brandham that brought confusion into this message yes sir well praise the Lord the Thunder movement that is that is that is Shipwrecked and C all so many heartaches was started by a man that sat right there in brother brandham Services the two Soul movement all of these things all started with men that sat in the same Hallelujah but you see well glory to God I was in Ohio preaching one time and someone says youen this this brother he was he was he was a real good close man with brother with brother Lee Vale and and he's a good man I I I love I I love this this this elderly gentleman and and uh he he told me he says now now brother W you know what the Bible teaches I said well I I I try I try to amen I like to say that I know a little bit about what the Bible teaches and he says all right there's one Prophet to an age and there's one teacher to an age and I go um a I said now the teacher is the prophet no no no no no the teacher is the one who's taking the words of that prophet and I said where are we going here he says brotherly veil was the teacher see brother bradam was the prophet brother lale was the teacher I go that's not the way the Bible teaches it we don't Hallelujah the prophet comes in brings the word clearly to the church amen and those of us who have calls Upon Our Lives better line it up with what he taught well glory to God oh well we need a we we need a handbook to the handbook really we need a handbook to the handbook to the handbook Hallelujah I was with the Thunder movement uh uh you know visiting them uh in my early years and and and and they said I saw I started question questioning about the Thunders amen and and uh I had the tapes but I I so I'm I'm I said well well what are the Thunders oh it's a mystery brother I said well if it's the Mysteries that's been unveiled then tell me what it is oh it's just so so good I said so what is the mystery you don't have the mystery yet no you need to call you you need to call Joseph Coman call Joseph Joseph will oh he's God's servant he oh no one in this message even knows anything and I'm going really Hallelujah so I called Joseph keman amen and he he spends all the time telling me this one's wrong and that one's wrong and that one's cursed and this one's cursed and that one's cursed and he's going amen after two hours of of everyone else and amen and he's he's pretty well whacked everyone else down and he's the only man standing I say so what is the revelation of the seven Thunders oh brother that's in a mystery form Hal Hallelujah and I'm thanking God Amen get me out of this mess the prophet of God came in to reveal the seven Thunders it's not going to be a man that reveals it the prophet of the Hallelujah then I found out right there in in black and white where brother bradam says amen that the seven Thunders are the mystery that are contained in the seals well that just blew him out of a job right but look at all the thousands who are so confused who cannot open the Bible and see anything that resembles and cannot open and listen to the message right on when you have got men that are explainers well praise the Lord but Jesus made it clear in everything that he done I don't want you doing this intellectually amen Jesus the word lived by the living father that's what Jesus himself said only by my word and spirit can you live Eat My Flesh and drink my blood eat my word and take my life why is why is there so many that have fallen away someone says you're doing a good job brother Wendell why has there been so much falling away from the world today where they're saying that in the Millennials there's like only 40% believes in Christianity okay because the word has been so intellectualized and explained Ed away why has there been so many leave the message is because the words have been explained away we've put our faith in a man and not given heed to his message that's right until kids believe salvation is just listening to a tape brother brandham said the kth but the spirit gives life my words are spirit and life but you can sit in a message church and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you'll allow that Old Devil to come in and before you know it you're putting everything in I've talked I've talked with one of the the big preachers one of the last ones to leave the message that's cing causing all the Havoc around the world I sat right out here in the parking lot before there was a parking lot Hallelujah I said the problem is you have you have based your ministry amen his dad was there in the Tabernacle and he was raised in the Tabernacle and he was talking about amen and you know all of these stories every time you was with him amen it was constantly H H uh uh you know brother Ram's done this and this miracle and that one and this one and that one and that was fine to me amen but the Miracles wasn't what got me I was raised in Pentecost I seen some Miracles what got me was the word but he constantly tell well amen and and now he's over there and and and i' I'd preached with him a couple times I'd preached for him amen and I told him I said the problem is you've built your entire belief system on little stories little things that brother Bram done and and then when someone comes in and tells you well it didn't quite happen that way well and they start putting question marks in your mind then you're sitting there thinking huh huh I said you have built your entire Ministry around stories and then when when they come in and and try to shatter the thing on the bridge or the bear or whatever you're just like and I said if you don't if you don't need if you don't get the power of the Holy Ghost in your life brother you'll walk away from this thing and it wasn't three or four months later when he did walk away from that that's right yes sir he never had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost ain't going to take you to some God of yesterday it's going to take you of a God today you can you can you can bring all the proof you want to you can try to tell me that bridge thing didn't happen you can try to tell me that this bear thing or whatever you want to bring it don't matter to me I believe what he said I don't need you I don't need you to to to prove and you and I Hallelujah and I don't have to prove Pro to you anything I don't have to prove to you the bridge or I don't have to prove to you the amen this that what I've got is come from the Holy Spirit he has already proved it stay in the word but it's because men have put so much on a man that when they think that man has failed and I want to tell you brother Bram was faulty just like you but that message on brother brandom had to repent just like you but that message brother brandom had come on church now we want what what has caused these thousands to leave what has caused is because they Hallelujah is because the message a good portion of the message folks as I'll put it off on a dead man of yesterday and there's no reality of the holy spirit in their lives today I want to say that the message did not die with William brandham and the Holy Spirit is here to to Quicken it even to Sister charity and to Sister Haven we need the anointing of the Hool come on Church we're not getting them to a man we're getting them to the message we're getting them to Jesus Christ he says well this this brother we all know him but I'm not going to mention his name well you don't even know you don't even know how to lead anyone to the Lord you won't even know brother Wendell how to how to how to deliver alcoholics and thing I said excuse me he said it's sad when the message has to send folks to the Baptist to get saved and that way we can come in and then educate them afterwards I said you brother have got you you have you're you're you're you're you're looking at things the wrong wrong filter you're preaching through the wrong filter come on church that's the reason why amen he was uncomfortable when we tried to preach about the seals when we tried to preach about the power of the Living God today he was wanting to point it all the way back all Jeffersonville Jeffersonville Jeffersonville brother Jeffersonville is not our headquarters Jeffersonville is not the one that we answer to we answer to the Living [Applause] God can you say Amen point the people to Christ sir and if you point them to Christ you'll point them to the message of the hour and you'll be preaching under the same anointing and it won't be under this slant or that slant or this slant or that slant then you can quote any quote you want to and you're going to amen it that's right oh it's Freedom brother it's Freedom when you can when you can look when you can look into the message and believe every bit of it it's Freedom when when a preacher can stand up and and preach preachers quotes that others are saying don't belong in the message anymore because we got a more perfect way the prophet did not say we have a more perfect way he says preachers preach this message why because it's not in words it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon that word can you say Amen well I found too many faults with preachers so I don't believe in Preachers anymore Hallelujah well then won't you divorce your wife Hallelujah because I'm here to tell you your wife is pretty faulty and you can't believe in marriage anymore or you can understand that that little lady loves you and that you love her and y'all can get prayed through because God has ordained marriage and God is ordained well glory to God are y'all with me here this morning yes sir Jesus says I'm the anointed word and you can read this amen John in the sixth chapter I'm fixing a cut in amen and he's said you know you want you to eat my word Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and the disciples were all bowled up well I I I amen and then Jesus comes in and says as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it and when Jesus knew it himself his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing but the words that I speak unto you are they are spirit and they are alive can you say Amen acts 10 and 38 I don't have it here but you can put it up there sister Keys acts 10 and 38 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power he was not just a letter not just a word he was anointed who went about doing good and healing all the sick all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him can you say Amen now a l intellectual faith is not God's intent there was someone preaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost here some time back and people were really touched of God and and were seeking for the Holy Ghost saying I I he says I don't care if you've been in this message for a long time if you don't have the life of God in you and the Holy Spirit was there to back it up and the Holy Ghost was moving and people were weeping some was even at the altars and some were weeping before God when the service was turned back over a man stood up irritated and he says who believes this message well hundreds of hands went up he says you've got the Holy Ghost turned around dismissed the service do you not realize that the Devils believe and tremble we're not here with intellectualism trying to convince you that this message is right you will have to have the same power of the holy spirit that made Jesus Christ the word made flesh to make you the word made flesh in this day it will take don't you allow this message Hallelujah to become part of your brain God's looking for word made flesh he's wanting to anoint his word for this day and make you Messiah not intellectual Giants not somebody that knows all the quotes he's wanting somebody he can live through right psychology is the study of mind and behavior psychology you know searches for how the mind works and how it affects the behavior psychologist treats patients through psycho therapy so they take them to in order to get them out of their rut they introduce a new form of thought so when they introduce this new form of thought they're no longer thinking like they were what an example if uh for for those that are for someone that is addicted to pornography the psychologist on any kind on any kind of these kinds of addictions it always includes a psychologist and this this psychologist will go through go through their past but then will also begins to bring the realities that they they have not been thinking about supposedly they do this what is it doing to your wife think about your wife what is it doing to your children what are they doing they are introducing new thoughts and hopefully those thoughts will become greater than the thoughts of naked women so what they do is they introduce and they want you to begin to look Hallelujah now I I'm I'm I'm fixing to hit you we might have to take this off the internet praise the Lord amen did you realize that that was almost exactly word for word what was said by a message man that said that he was in he was in pornography and been prayed for and prayed for he says and finally he said I started Overcoming By thinking what it's doing to my children what is it's doing to my wife what it's doing to this how it's bad for me and slowly i' I'm I'm I I've overcome it that ain't overcome it that is mind over matter that is a change of thought the preacher is not Amen to introduce psychology the preacher is to preach the word under the anointing can you say amen amen let me tell you something the psychologist will treat the preach the helping to relieve the the the symptoms through be a behavioral change teaching you a new way a new form and then he'll prescribe either medication or you you know some some kind of intervention to help man manage the the the the the the the health conditions of your mind amen but that's not the way that matters of fact you go back go back go back and look at what brother brandham talked about because back in brother bram's days they were trying to get them to pass a psychological test before you were able to be a preacher in some of these denominations brother Bram says can you imagine Peter sitting before a psychologist could you imagine those disciples sitting before a psychologist he said this ain't psychology this is the power of God under salvation but when we start using this message amen as as sort of a a a different form a different way and changing your you know behavioral patterns I'm not looking for someone to start wearing skirts down their ankles I'm not looking for someone to keep their hair H H uh you know long I'm not looking for someone to start being good to their husband and their wives I'm looking for something to happen way down deep inside I'm looking for New Birth I'm looking for the power of the Holy Spirit I'm looking for the Holy Spirit New Birth in the church [Applause] Church preachers aren't commissioned to teach them how to deal with it preachers are commissioned to cast The Devil out now the spirit the holy spirit is still the discerner of Hearts he still knows what you need he still knows where your hangup is he knows how to set you free he still has a sword come on sword of the spirit can you say Amen the gospel does not deal with your psyche the gospel does not deal with your intellectualism amen your your mind the gospel deals with the soul and setting the captives free praise the Lord fear is a spirit and must be cast off pornography is a devil and must be cast out these are devils and it requires the anointing can you say that brother brandham talking about John Jesus talking about John and brother brandham is referring he said no wonder Jesus said what did you go out to see and that forgetting for uh forgotten beatitude as I preached on it when he went across the hill the Disciples of John said he said what what did you go out to see a man dressed in fine clothes he said that that's the kind that they'll call Doctor Holy Father father they wear soft clothes and they kiss the babies and they marry the young and they bury the old he handles a pen knife what would a man like that know about a two two-handed sword on the front Battlefront he said do you do do you see a man dressed with a priest's robe soft clothing he said that kind of preacher did did you see that go to see that he said no them kind kiss the babies you know bury the dead they don't know nothing about a two-handed sword of the on the Battlefront they're out there with some kind of intellectual speech to the kaanas club and some or something and you know and they're all they're all right there but when it comes out to the battle to face it they know nothing about it now as I begin to wind down here this morning Preacher God don't want explainers there's a difference in a proclaimer and an explainer proclaiming the proclamation of what he saw what he knows what he's experienced with God in that room all by yourself alone with God saying God I need something to feed your people something that your anointing is going to back up an explainer kns deals with the intellect an explainer is he's a newscaster he's a that's those are the talking heads that that dig down and try to if you can get talked into it you can get talked out of it am I am am I making that clear this morning am I doing all right if you can get talked into it out there in that parking lot sitting in that truck that day he said I'm giving you proof brother Wendell I'm giving you proof I said the bridge didn't attract me that didn't you're you're look you're you're looking at all the word attracted me I said you're talking to the wrong guy I came out of Pentecostalism that's all we done was measured each other with measuring sticks that's all we done was trying to be more spiritual than everyone else that was denominationalism trying to divide and divide this one looking more spiritual than this and I said and all I can see in this is just a big mess everyone's all trying to get get their corner on the message I said what got me was the message and the only thing attracted me was the purity of it and you can't take that from me oh come on I've had the guy say man with your talent and with your gifts and you're preaching what would you come join our group I don't want to join a group I have joined Heaven's group I'm standing with this word can I hear an amen hallelujah then when you look and you genuinely look and you genuinely took take the word you're not going to take one little portion of brother brandham to pit another portion well praise the Lord do you love him you're not going to pit with this one and that one against this one and this one against that one and Hallelujah brother bradam says or Jesus says I want you to Beware of the Leen of the Pharisees and when they were looking at him then then then Jesus says the doctrine when they were tooking at the leav they were talking they were thinking about bread and this that and the other and then he finally saysi want you to be H uh uh cautious about the doctrine of the Pharisees their teachings is unbelief their doctrines are unbelief and a little bit of that leaven will mess you up well praise the Lord praise the Lord now we can pick on a bunch of Knuckleheads outside that we knows went way off but what about some of our knucklehead ideas where we've got our own pet little deals and we're deliberately excusing what brother what don't y'all stop preaching with me now where brother bradam clearly taught going to church every time the door is open and you want to excuse that and you're claiming you're following the message there's some leav I said there's some leaven you've got to take every word don't you let Satan talk one bit from [Applause] you Hallelujah you want to take the gifts ah we don't believe that's not that you you might get that from your talking points from your Talking Heads but you're not getting it from God's Bible and you sure didn't get it from William Brown well praise the Lord amen now brother random did warn us he said now he says Paul saw it coming he warned that this little subtle priesthood that would come and take over with false doctrines he knew they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part of the Holy Spirit Ministry and even right among us today those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the leoty best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it that's a far cry from Paul who said that when all come together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship and the church corporate never learns this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time the God gives a visitation of the Holy Spirit and the people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when Luther left out of Catholicism the people stayed free for a while when he died then they simply organized and they thought they uh they what they thought they believed and set up the Creeds and ideas and repudiated any that said opposite to what they said they went right back into Catholicism with a little bit different form well praise the Lord amen little bit different form now amen now that there was in the that that there was in the in the church age book amen there in in the Ephesian church and um the the fisan church age amen here's another one from the church age book he says but as usual God don't people don't heed God's warning the Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful the manifestation of the spirit is so blessed that after that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see the Revival goes on that is when the Antichrist comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize set up your Creed of what you believe and put it in a church manual and they do it they organize they add to the word and they die just like Eve died taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts it's what God says hallelujah well praise the lord we we have relied upon the intellectual side of this message and we need to take every word and say Amen to it well praise the Lord am I doing all right here this morning I'm feeling pretty good I I right now I could probably preach Without You amen but it's good to have an amen hallelujah amen that's right now brother Brandon would say and your sincerity and all that you want to confess you just want to take it to the ma Methodist altar the Baptist altar the Pentecostal altar but there is an altar somewhere that he has chose to put his name in and and he would meet you at now if you get everything running just right you're going to run everything's set in order if there's a short in that wire the light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you take one of God's word or one of his places and in your heart have a selfish objective it'll ground the power of God right there if you do it because you want to be smart you want to be different from somebody else or something right there it's grounded it blows the fuse you're wrong you've got to come back with sincerity in your heart your motives and your objectives amen placed on the on the right on God then search for his place can you say amen God don't want God don't want God don't want this message ending with with wend Martin let me just put it you don't want his me this message Mage ending with you and your wife and then the then your kids all grow up out in the world because they've not experienced the power of God they've not experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you don't believe in going to church get it back where it belongs and let a preacher preach and let the power of the Holy Ghost bring Salvation to those kids you've got a choice but it's usually a bunch of backsliding folks that don't want to take what brother brandham says and it's their children that pays the price I've been scarred well welcome to the club Hallelujah let's share some scars I've been scarred badly I've been scarred I've been scarred by preachers I've been hurt I've been hurt to the quick I've been hurt I didn't think that I'd ever recover but God healed me and I've also got something to tell you too you've hurt me too so am I going to quit believing in the body of Christ am I going to separate myself from you because you've hurt me well I know my personality I know I like to gab and I know I've hurt you some of you are just surprised yeah yeah I have the capability of hurting people but that doesn't take away from uh Romans the 12th chapter sir that says we're onebody many members and we've all got to be fitly framed together it doesn't take away from that it just means I need a little bit of blood and you need a little bit of blood and we got to give the preacher a little bit of grace and the preacher needs to give you a little bit of Grace and if he is a true preacher he'll always line himself back up with the word listen my message is not infallible but the M time message is infallible I can make up I can make Stakes I've had to stand up behind the pull pit and say guys I got it wrong I preached an entire sermon one time I preached an entire sermon Amen on on the when you're on when you're hanging by a thread brother murl comes up afterwards and said it wasn't a thread I said yes it was it says a thread he says that thread amen they could they they they she let down she let down the spies with that thread I'm going oh okay well all right so it wasn't a thread well praise the Lord Brother brandom said 500 one time instead of or 700 7,000 amen but that didn't make him a a bad profit but I'm going to tell you something they on the seals when brother brandom said something and all of a sudden the spirit of God just came in the room he felt like death in he says something's happening something someone everyone okay I feel death someone says go back and read that scripture again and what he was putting to the Jews it was to the bride or vice versa y'all remember that the angel of the Lord was correcting brother brandom in the seals that's right you know why because you're going to have to get it right and that's the reason why us preachers are got to get it right we got to get it right we got to preach it right we got to preach under the anointing of the Holy Spirit we got to say it the way the prophet says it we got to believe it the way the prophet believed it well praise the Lord now amen I'm I'm I'm trying to find a way to pull over here hallelujah amen do you love him yes amen now when we when we look here brother brother brandham in the indictment he he puts it pretty clear what you do when you take one word someone say one word word and you misplace it now let me just put it let me let me put it clearly it's one thing to misplace this written word when you've got a million different interpretations correct brother brandham says how can he fault a man when you don't know which way to go but when God sends a messenger yes sir and the pillar of fire has come down to vindicate that message and for you to Discount what he is saying this the way brother Brenham put it you know he was he was talking he says uh uh he said thee same thing happens right here I'm cutting in this indictment he said exactly the same thing again let me just go up and just just just read the whole thing he says as I said about that Minister last Sunday Martin Luther King down there with them precious people leading them right into a death trap oh if somebody could only talk to that man I wish I could just for a little uprising of the school proposition see it's a lot of different it's it's a lot differ my goodness if the people ain't got heart enough to associate with a man because of his color they're condemned and dead anyhow he says what if what what if somebody said all the Irish or somebody all the German or somebody else that had to disassociate that would never bother Christians that'd move right on that man's a Christian as a minister he shouldn't be he shouldn't lead the people into a Revolt like that against that they're going to cause Millions to die die it it'll start another revolutionary it's a shame to do that now now watch now watch how he's how he's tying this in he says the same thing happens right here exactly the same thing again that's right the people how that only look at truth and see the truth what the truth is our church don't believe that we got some other way we ain't well it ain't the right way it ain't it ain't the thing he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ from the of sins now they won't do it oh they what then what do they do uh that's just one thing out of hundreds we'll get to maybe as as fast as we can now the second crucifix crucifixion then if a man accepts Father Son and the Holy Ghost a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the name what does he the preacher do to the people he crucifies the effects of the word to the people when he says mark 16 was just for that generation and God himself said uh God said himself right there Jesus talking to them go you andw all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them how far Every Nation every Creed every tongue every race every people and the same God these signs shall follow them and when a man tries to cut that out of the Bible he crucifies the effects to that congregation so I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you're guilty of murdering the Lord the church hated him why he was their God they hated him and denied him to be the Messiah no sir they didn't want such a messiah as that and today the church does the same thing it denies the word they don't want it it's contradictory to what they have been taught to believe by their Creeds the word is the Messiah you believe that that well the reflection of the word is then is what a reflecting Messiah is the Holy Ghost Among Us he's reflecting himself wherever he can find a lamp that he can look through and that ain't smoked up with Creeds and things he can give that light can you say Amen now now now hear me hear me because we're not talking about we're not talking about denomination I'm talking about the denominations inside this message will you give me a few more minutes how long have I been up here oh my goodness oh my goodness no wonder we're all getting tired hallelujah what about when brother Brandon was asked would the bride have a Ministry would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture now brother Brandon was still under the anointing this is the question answers in the seals it's the same oneand that brother brandom when he's given the wrong interpretation or he was he and it wasn't he was he just misread the scripture and someone says go back and read that scripture again and then he he goes oh brother see how how the holy spirit is so accurate remember that he saids will the bride have a Ministry the question he said sure that's what's going on now certainly the bride of Christ it's the message of the hour the bride of Christ she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour can you say amen amen he says he says in another place oh I know there's many rise up and go out and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's my teacher when you get that idea you're just wrong for why did the Holy Spirit the holy go set teachers in the church if he was going to be the teacher there are first apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors the Holy Spirit set the teachers in the church so he could teach to that teacher it isn't according and if it isn't according to the word God doesn't confirm it it isn't the right kind of teaching it must compare with the entire Bible be just as alive today as it was then the real thing manifest can I hear a great big [Music] amen you take that and I that these are just these are things that we believe so I'm just I'm I'm taking those things there it's the spirit of the Antichrist Whispering can you say Amen that first scripture that we read I charged thee there in 2 Timothy 4:1 I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick the living and the dead it is appearing in his kingdom preach the word now Paul is looking here at this time be instant in season and out of season when preaching isn't in season you got to keep on preaching am reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned un fables can you say am man fables fairy tales Batman Cinderella Superman myths things that can't be proven fables things that can't be found in scripture nor in the message fables they will find teachers that will bring their own little label cuz you can't back it up from kber to kber you can't back it up from Genesis to Revelations you can't back it up from 48 to 65 you can't back it up but because somebody has got some Charisma and they pull there's going to be teachers there's going to be false teachers they're going to be but in the midst of all the teachers with all of the fables preach the word amen fables are going to be taught fables going to be taught as Bible Fable is going to be taught as the message fables are going to be taught as as if it's the truth and if you're not good and if you're not looking into the message and searching it out for yourself huh but we're not dumb driven cattle we're Eagles and we're eating eagle food and at the Prophet brought it to us on the wings of the Holy Spirit brother I want to say if you can see it this morning you can have it you want the anointing of the holy spirit in your life you can have it you want the power of God to live in you you can have it you kids you want the anointing of you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost the way they had it at on the book of Acts you can have it just the same there is nothing to keep you from it other than the doctrine of unbelief that's right I say God get done belief out of my life and let the Holy Spirit live God bless you as our musicians come thank you for your attendance this morning now the Holy Spirit Jesus says Jesus never said go and train to do this he said go preach the gospel and these signs shall follow the preaching let's not learn to make a lecturer who can stand and just put them flowery things out in in that make you feel like you're sitting right in the presence of an archangel that isn't it having forms of godliness he that's a lecture not the Holy Spirit In Action some little fell that wouldn't know his ABCs might come down with the power of Faith with the word and make the spirit do things that that man knows nothing about and Den iing see there you are then there are the organizers they're prosperous they're successful smart a worldly wisdom just exactly like Satan did to Eve that little helpless woman he came right to her and tried to sell her on the idea that she could be wiser than what she was and that's what she was looking for instead of staying right there with the word what the word said he wanted to sell her on the idea that she could be wiser and she brought his product he says you don't scientifically prove God you believe God you believe it if you don't believe it then a man that says everything is not uh that a man says not scientif it's it's un Orthodox is not right then that man can ever be a Christian he has to believe by faith we believe God not by education not by theology but by faith you are saved [Music] said notice Faith finds a source that others don't see his word is a sword Hebrews 4 and12 said that in that is the word the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword even discerns the thoughts that's intense that's in the heart that's the word of God the only thing that can hold the sword is a hand of Faith nothing else can do it nothing else somebody say nothing else yeah you have to see something in otherwise scientific you scientifically educationally you cannot hold that sword you cannot do it by education it's too Twisted it's too complicated it'll deny itself and everything you can't do it Jesus says it's hid from you so forget about it you cannot know it it's hid when God hides anything it's really hid can you say am man so what do we do we don't try to figure it [Music] out We [Music] believe We believe We believe what has been brought to us in this day and we stand solidly with that word you love him Hallelujah praise the [Music] Lord give me the word it's a l that I give me the [Music] word yes my total [Music] victory over every

using this message for a crutch God's not wanting you to to use it for a crutch he's wanting you to use it for a sword this morning as I have preached some things I've hit hard and I have felt these last two services that where where I have preached in the doctrine of unbelief and how that comes from the pull [Music] pit just because there's so much nonsense doesn't mean that God's not real and just because someone says God doesn't filled with the Holy Ghost like he used to doesn't mean that he do and just because people say that there's no healing anymore listen if you can believe it if you can believe it with all of your heart you can have exactly what the Bible says you can have if you can believe it but you're going to have to get rid of some of those old tabletop quotes and some of those oh I thinking well this is my opinion you got to get that all off and you've got to come right back to what was set on the tapes you got to believe every word of it now can you say man I love
