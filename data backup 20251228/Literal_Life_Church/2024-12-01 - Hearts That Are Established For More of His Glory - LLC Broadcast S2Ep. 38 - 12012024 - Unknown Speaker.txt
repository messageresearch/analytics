encourage you today [Music] it's not what I prayed for it's not what I wanted it's not something I understand my circumstances may be so confusing I'm placing it all in your head your your ways are higher than mine I want mountains to move you want me to CL so I'm going to trust your work your will and your time your ways are higher than mine [Music] one day I'm sure I will look back in marel and how you knew best all [Music] along you see from Heaven you know it's the hard times that make my face steady and strong your ways are higher than [Music] mine I want mountains to move you want me to CL so I'm going to trust your work your will and your time [Music] your ways are higher than mine oh when I start to die help me believe somewhere so far above me your ways are higher than I want mountains to move you want me to C so I'm going to trust your words your will and your time [Music] oh your ways are so much higher than mine [Music] your ways are higher than mine Psalms 112 and verse starting at verse one praise ye the Lord blessed is the man that fearth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments his seed shall be Mighty upon Earth notice the the promises and the things that come from a man that fearth the Lord and delighteth greatly in his Commandments and I don't want to boast this morning but I I really feel this blessed because I'm starting to see some of these things come to pass in my life just simply because as a young man I fell in love with the Lord I fell in love with his word and I can tell you there's there's no greater thing I greatly Delight in and that's the word of God and his Commandments his seed shall be Mighty upon the Earth the gener generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous a good man showeth favor and lendeth he will guide his affairs with discretion surely he shall not be moved forever the righteous shall be an everlasting remembrance he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings I don't know if you know what that means but it actually means in our in our everyday terms here he shall not be afraid this blessed man shall not be afraid of bad news because that's the problem with bad news is that we get fearful sometimes we can get fearful of stuff that hasn't even happened yet that's the way the devil works but he's standing in such a place and such a position in the Lord that he he is not afraid of bad news and bad things that would come his way his heart is fixed it's fastened it's because it's trusting in the Lord his heart is fixed that's the part I want you to concentrate in his heart is fixed it's not up and down it's not like a roller coaster it's not everywhere it's not in and out it's not believing one day and not believing the next it's actually fixed it's set because he's trusting the Lord his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies he hath dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness endureth forever his horn shall be exalted with honor the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall Nash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked Shall Perish and I'm just going to remind you uh verse 7 and 8 he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting the Lord his heart is established how many this morning want to say Lord establish my heart establish my heart now in 1 Peter chapter 5 I want to link this in and may not get to all of this today but I have next Sunday as well so we'll just try to split this up but in in 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse uh 10 but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus I want to stop right there do you know what the Lord is called you to he's called you to to glory amen we're called to Glory he's called us un his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever so after you've went through trials after you've suffered a while it'll make you perfect establish you strengthen you settle you how do you how many want to be settled this morning and all of this is the precursor all of this is the pre-work of the Lord to bring us to more Glory so I want to speak on hearts that are established for more of his glory that's what we're called to for more of his glory now when I looked at Psalms chap 1112 here I was greatly blessed to read this to see this very blessed man of God who feared the Lord and uh that uh that attribute that was in him and all these attributes got my attention but particularly the one that said that his heart was fixed and it was established he had a heart that was fixed uh it was fastened fixed means fastened it means it's positioned it's not jumping around but it's got a he's got a heart that's fixed and the reason why he's so blessed and there's more glory and prosperity coming in his life is because he's got his heart lined up with God's Commandments number one but remember when we're born and again his Commandments and his word is within our soul so now I want to bring this out this morning that our hearts have to be in line with what's in our soul see why do you say that I thought the heart was the soul there's too many places in the scripture that to tell us and I've been speaking on this the last few weeks talking about our heart a little bit because our heart our heart are the seed of our emotions our spirit memory conscience and all that that's a different thing than our soul we are three three part being can you say Amen matter of fact Jesus separated this so I'm not unscriptural this morning Jesus separated this as he quoted from Moses Moses told the people when you serve the Lord when you love me love me with all your heart soul mind and strength you're not just your soul but you have your heart you have your mind you have your strength and God says when you love me don't just love me with your soul love me with all of you love me with your heart that shows us that the heart the heart can be different than what's going on in the soul how many knows I preached this the last few weeks the heart can have condemnation on it but God doesn't condemn us in our soul there's therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus so you can see the importance now that you live a life of this as this man does here that not only is your soul fixed is your soul settled it's settled that I I believe I'm a believe I know I'm a believer it's as good as done I'm going to Heaven someday I don't fear death can you say Amen my soul is settled but now it's important to get your heart just as fixed and line your heart up with where your soul is that you have a heart that's established because as you've been learning the soul you know where you are in God you can say Amen to that but you see your heart uh is not something that you follow your heart has to follow what's in the soul can you say Amen you get it now your heart is not something to follow the the the worldly songs say follow your heart they tell our young people follow their heart no no no no we don't follow our heart the heart is deceitful Above All Things the heart can be uh feel like it's saved one day and feel like it's lost the next the heart can fall in love with somebody one day and the next say they can't stand them come on now you know that's true you got to Heart yourself and if you depended on where your heart or emotions were every day I'll tell you you you'd never know where you stood and that's why it's important to get now our hearts in line with what's in our soul get our hearts in line with the what the word says about us what the word where he where are we we positioned as a son and daughter of God can you say Amen praise the Lord so now we see then separating the heart conditions sometimes and Jesus said that love me with all your heart soul mind and strength to with all of you with everything that you are you should love him not just with your soul so when we've been separating and preaching on the heart we've been separating that heart condition sometimes from your soul your heart can be up and down your heart can hold grudges for many years your heart and I'm talking about Christians your heart can hold a grudge for many years how many remember my teaching on it there was a young man in the prayer line and he says he's come to the prayer line for for two things and that's to Deliverance of a smoking habit and next thing he said you've held a grudge towards a family member since you were a little boy that long he held a grudge so now here he is coming for more of the Lord but you see now you can't come without saying I've got to address this Grudge because I can't fully come to the Lord free until I deal with what's in my heart sir so so now it can have grudges it can have hurt the heart can have pain for years all all this while still sometimes in church sometimes with a with the true spirit of God it's hard for us to believe but someone can have the true spirit of God and still have something in their heart that's not quite right but you see now I'm taking this to the next level because this man in Psalms chapter2 it's not just that his soul is a fixed but his heart is AIX his heart is fixed on something it's it's it's it's settled can you say man it's established and it's not his heart it's not that his heart is following every whim that no his heart is following one thing it's what the soul says it's what the word says so now if you can imagine that that I'm I'm the soul and I'm going in a certain direction and I'm confessing the word and the Soul's going forward by the way this is the soul this is me the soul it's going forward all the time it's going it's confessing the word that word drops in your heart it's going forward I know who I am I know where I belong along I know where I'm going it says the same thing as Jesus said I know where I came from thus I know where I'm going these are kind of statements that come from the soul level but you see now your heart is a different thing and so now as you're going forward then you got to get your heart right behind you brother Jason get you're you're my heart okay you get right behind me right behind me and so you cannot be going with the soul and the heart is just going everywhere and running down the aisle and going this way and looking that way yes I knew you would do that very well you can't have that going on or you're going to be a mess as a Christian the soul is heading the direction and so you tell that heart where to go can you say Amen that heart must follow what's in your soul you say well I don't know if that can happen well then you don't believe Christianity because he said love God with all your heart soul mind and strength that love that's in your soul say I love the Lord Brother Paul everybody loves the Lord and True Believers love the Lord but you can't just love them from your soul you got to love them from your mind you got to love them from your heart and that heart I'm not done with you yet that heart has to follow in every footstep the same way as your soul is going every day you want a scripture I wish above all things that you would be in health and prosper as your soul is [Applause] prospering I wish that you're you would be a healthy uh Christian in all ways and that you would Prosper nothing against Prosperity but it's only as your soul prospers don't pursue Prosperity if your Soul's not in the right place don't pursue the world's prosperity and get your heart rate without the Holy Ghost you got to have the Holy Ghost but when you have the Holy Ghost you've been converted you know where you're going it's never weak it's strong and it's going in a certain direction and it goes the same way it has to follow you're not following your heart your heart is following where your soul is going got your hands up I want you to do just like the soul says it just like this amen God Amen very good you're coming along my heart's coming along with My Soul praise the Lord do I need to get a beer like this and everything appreciate you buddy thank you my dad used to say had a little joke when he went in restaurants he made fun of some of the waitresses and waiters cuz they'd say okay I got your table Walk This Way please and my dad would start walking exactly like the waitress sometimes it was embarrassing cuz they walked a lot of different ways just thought I'd add that in that was funny wasn't I like Walk This Way please and I watch Dad just walk and he was going like whatever way that waitress would walk he's walk I said dad what are you doing what are you doing but it's to illustrate R the heart the rest of your life your private life needs to be in step and aligned with where your Soul's going but you've got to clean that heart out and get it in line with where your soul is because a Believer must learn they cannot ignore what's going on in their heart in fact today I would say that the heart must be aligned with what is happening in the soul it must follow it it cannot be left to itself the heart and emotions cannot be left to themselves I appreciate all your comments and how much you enjoy the word I love to get it it's very appreciative but if your heart is still locked up we're not moving into a greater glory that he's called you to if your heart is still locked up you can't say Amen in your soul and then go back home and cling to your habits and the bondage of your heart I'm not here to put anybody in put anybody out I'm not here to say whether you have the Holy Ghost or you you don't have the GL you have to know that for yourself I'm not so sure I like ministers that were saying whether you got it or not I think we should be careful of that you have to know for yourself but if you know you got it and you know that you you were changed on the inside you hold on to that and it's anchored it's settled that's why Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and are heavy laden and I will give rest for your soul where the soul the soul has to have rest first in other words you have laid down the strugg to try to gain entrance into heaven Yourself by your good works you lay all that down when the Holy Ghost comes you are at rest I've made it because he went to Calvary for me he took care of my sins my soul is complete in a Sabbath an eternal Sabbath maybe I should preach where the Soul's at first on now so you can see where it's at so your heart can follow the soul is in an eternal Rest by the Holy Ghost it's in an eternal Sabbath the work is finished it is done I am saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Hall it's not tossed about by every wind of Doctrine but the heart can do that the heart can be tossed about with fear the heart can hear the word from the doctor and all of a sudden fear grips your heart and I'm not saying that's not real don't deny that you don't have those feelings but you got to bring that heart right back in line with the word of God I know that's what the doctor says but my soul says I am healed by the grace of God what's the soul saying what's the word saying and then you got to give it time to see how God will bring that healing because he may not bring it instantaneously but all the while your heart has to be in line with where your soul is going praise the Lord so now we we we can't follow all the Preaching Online or here at church and say amen and then follow our heart all week you can't follow the heart the heart has to be trained to follow where our soul is going say well the body's not going to uh inherit the Rapture I know that understand that but this body will come so in tune and so filled with the spirit of God that it'll be so consumed by it someday that it can't take the glory of God anymore and you have to take your new body see we limit how much the Holy Ghost fill all of this body fill this mind I should I don't think we should ever limit that praise the Lord so we must have the same security and stability in our hearts as is with our within our souls this this man in the text says that he guides his affairs with discretion this man guides his Affairs his Affairs don't guide him can I get an amen amen Adam ruled and Reign Over this Earth Adam controlled things Adam controlled his environment but when he fell his environment controlled him that's the fall of Man but when Redemption came through Calvary to begin the process of bringing back Sons Back to Eden again what were coming back to every day in our lives is a control can you say Amen not that things control us not that our emotions control us not that our finances control us but we as a Son of God control our finances we control our emotions can you say Amen by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah his Affairs don't guide him he guides his affairs with discretion oh I want to live that way more his heart is lined up with his soul the Bible says I wish above all things that you prosper and be in health as your soul prosper the soul that has crossed into let's talk about the soul again a minute the soul that has crossed into eternal life by the Holy Ghost is at complete rest it has no condemnation it's already passed into eternal life it's already glorified you know the Bible says that it's already glorified sitting in Heavenly places already that's your soul it's already sitting positioned as a Believer sitting in Heavenly places in Christ that's your soul with the Holy Ghost position secure sealed fixed which means fast and securely in its position by the way in the soul there's no fear of death at all so you have to pray about that because if you have this huge fear of death in your soul level that means things aren't settled with your salvation right because when salvation comes and you have accepted your pardon and your soul has passed from death un life and it's been converted what comes with with that is the security that you don't fear death you don't fear death at all Paul stated from his standing in the soul and you will state this as well when you have the standing in your soul death where is your sting grave this is the soul speaking can you say Amen death where is your sting grave where is your Victory I am completely unafraid to go to the Grave I'm completely unafraid if it's my time to go today if I drop dead in a heart attack today I am completely unafraid I'm ready to go my soul says that where's the sting because Paul where you get that from uh Satan had his Stinger taken out at Calvary he had his sting of death taken out of Calvary God just took it and plucked that Stinger of death out and now all he can do is Buzz around your head what about this is and it's there's no Stinger Paul said where's your stinging you lost your Stinger at Calvary where's the sting of death it's gone right I don't have any fear of death amen I don't have any fear of the Grave where is your sting I don't fear the grave I don't fear this is this is the state of the Soul can you say Amen Paul had another one he says for me to live as Christ and for me to die is gain it's actually better it's an upgrade how many likes an upgrade death for a Christian is not death it's an upgrade and I'm telling you it's a huge upgrade and it's the best retirement you could ever get there is no better retirement plan than the ho ghost I'm here to tell you there's no upgrade like the holy ghost that you're going to get someday can I get an amen can I get a shout in the camp that's what your soul says for me to live is Christ so until I die I have Christ I can make it but for me to die it's an upgrade it's a gain that's why I'm not afraid of it it's a win-win situation if you have that fear this morning of death and are not come to that rest in your soul I'm not rebuking you I'm just saying you need to come to that rest in your soul that your sins are forgiven that you've been Justified and the only way he looks at you is through the blood and you can say I've passed from death and judgment already in eternal life already passed from life I'm not afraid of death you can have that Christ today by asking him in sincerity I want to know that this rest is upon my soul level you can know that today I wouldn't leave here till you had it you got this huge fear death that I I'm going to be condemned by God you can bring that condemnation to him this morning and that'll be settled he he became me that I could become him he took the Stinger of death death is only just a a a transfer room for believers can you say Amen when you give your heart to the Lord then then your life is a hunger to get that heart cleared up and that heart cleaned and that heart settled and that heart lined up and secure cured like the soul is that's right fixed my heart is fixed is mentioned three times in the Bible David says it Lord my heart is fixed so I will give praise to the Lord Lord my heart is secured it's fastened my heart is set on the goal my heart is not up and down my heart has been fixed in line with my soul and what your word says some other examples to show us the difference in the heart and the soul I want to bring this one up there's some stuff I'm going to skip this morning and get to it next Sunday but I want to bring this up because this brings the difference in the heart and the Soul can you imagine Jesus quoted Isaiah 29 and verse 13 where it says wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by The Pri recept to men this isn't the fear of the Lord of the man in Psalms 1112 you know the difference in the fear of the Lord and the fear of man the fear of the Lord is a respect it's an honor for his word but it's not fearful being afraid that I'm going to be condemned at judgment that's not it no we don't live with that all the time but the fear of men when it's taught from you then it causes men to do this to remove their can you imagine somebody can let me say it the way the prophet said it for as much as the people they draw near me with their mouth and with their lips they even honor me but their heart is far from me how in the world can that happen now I know this is an extreme case but it's an example that somebody can be so well at honoring the Lord and nobody really really knows except God that heart can be so distant from the Lord I know it's convicting I know I'm preaching hard but listen I'm just saying to you may we all just get this desire this week Lord Line This Heart up with where my soul is Line This Heart up with where my soul is let it follow what the word is saying in my soul
