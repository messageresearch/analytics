========================================

to Isaiah chapter 3 Isaiah chapter 3 . see I'm so good the angels are playing the organs I guess I don't know I'm gonna I want to read this out of the Amplified and I am going to do a kind of a lengthy reading um and then just a little bit actually we'll read chapter four as well but I just want you to follow along in the Amplified you can stay seated because it is a little bit lengthy but we just ask the Lord to bless his word now Isaiah chapter 3 verse 1 for behold the Lord the Lord of hosts is taken away from Jerusalem and from Judah and stay and the stay in the staff every kind of prop and the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water the Mighty Man and the man of war the judge and the professional prophet the one who foretells by uh says divination and the old man the captive of 50 and the man of rank and the counselor and the expert Craftsman and the skillful enchanter notice all of this is being taken away anything that could do the people any good and I will make boys their princes and with childish shall they rule over them with outrage instead of Justice watch how perfectly this types today and the people shall be oppressed each one by another and each one by his neighbor the child shall behave himself proudly and with insolence against the old man and the Low born Against The Honorable person of rank when a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father saying you have a robe and shall be our judge and ruler in this heap of ruins shall be under your control in that day he will answer saying I will not be a Healer and one who binds up I am not a physician for in my house is neither bread nor clothing you shall not make me a judge and ruler of the people for Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is Fallen because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord to provoke the eyes of his glory and defy his glorious presence they're respecting of persons and showing of partiality witnesses against them they Proclaim their sin like Sodom they do not hide it woe to them for they have brought evil as a reward upon themselves it's just we're living an almost complete Sodom I don't believe we're there yet I believe there's one more stage after the transgender takes hold I don't even want to speak it but I don't think we're done yet say to the righteousness say to the righteous that it shall be well with them for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds woe to the wicked it shall be ill with them for what their hands have done shall be done to them as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them O My People your leaders cause you to err and they confuse destroy and swallow up the course of your paths the preachers out you know in the in the denominations and things they just confuse the Lord stands up to contend and stands to judge the peoples and his and his people the Lord enters into judgment with the Elders of his people and their princes for by your ex exactions and oppressions uh and oppressions you have robbed the people and ruined the country boy is it in ruin you have devoured The Vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your house what do you what do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor says the Lord God of hosts moreover the Lord said now watch this because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk without stretched necks and with undisciplined flirtatious and alluring eyes tripping along with mincing in an affected gate also says in another translation was swaying of the hips and making a tinkling noise with anklets on their feet therefore the Lord will Smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion making them bald and the Lord will cause them to be taken as captives and to suffer the indignity of being stripped naked there I've never seen so many things in in the news in that of of it seems to be mainly women just stripping naked and and making some comment about it that this I am totally free to do this I feel totally Comfort but they're completely stripped naked and then he also says which I thought was interesting and I was just can't remember it was the other day and I don't know any day you go out you see it but it's just the the women don't even cut their hair anymore they shave it like a man it's just completely shaving down and this here is saying that the Lord's gonna Smite their head that they'll they'll be bald and and that's it's it's happening today in that day the Lord will take away the finery of their twink tinkling anklets the Caps of network and the Crescent head ornaments the pendants and the bracelets are chains and the Spangled face veils and scarfs the headbands the short ankle chains attached from one foot to the other to ensure a measured gate the sashes the perfume boxes the Rings and nose jewelry the changeable suits of apparel and the in the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses in the fine linen and the hoods and the veils there was one spot I don't I don't think it's here it was another translation and and when it said fine linen it said fine linen undergarments even it was just it's just completely described today and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle or rent and instead of well-set hair baldness and instead of a stomach or an uh girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty thy men shall fall By The Sword and thy Mighty and the war you can't hardly find a real man today and in her gate shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground now notice this is saying that even even this has such an impact and such an influence that it comes into the daughters of Zion chapter 4 and verse 1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own Apparel in in another again in another translation it says um let's see here I wanted to read that in the Amplified uh it will provide our own apparel they're gonna they're gonna wear what they want to wear they're gonna they're gonna provide what they want to wear only let us be called by your name to be taken away our reproach of being unmarried but in that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious so you have this picture of just complete and utter Darkness the lights have gone completely out it is it is pitch as as as as black as pitch can get it's just complete darkness but in that day the branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and lovely to those of Israel who have escaped and he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem and for eternal life after the Lord has washed away the moral filth of the daughters of Zion their pride and their vanity and the haughtiness and has purged the bloodstains of your Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit and blast of judgment and by the spirit and blast of burning and sifting and the Lord will create over the whole site over every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flame of fire by Night notice that's how God appeared to the children of Israel Cloud by day a pillar of Fire by night for over all the glory shall be a canopy a defense of divine love and protection and there shall be a pavilion for shape for shade in the daytime and from the Heat and for and for a place of refuge and a shelter from storm and from rain I want to catch one more scripture Psalms 139 Psalms 139 and verse 14. just getting my scriptures out of the way up front I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them God in in this in this laodicean age in this age of complete and utter darkness when when the picture looks Grim of the daughters of Zion there's yet a beautiful branch of the Lord that's risen to the Lord she's beautiful in the sight of the Lord and not only that but she should know that she's fearfully and wonderfully made we all need to know that male and female we're fearfully and wonderfully made but what I want to focus on tonight is is true beauty women of God I want to I want to just call it true beauty women of God I hate being stuck to my notes but it was just how the lord gave everything to me and so I'm just going to follow this along and and uh you just you pull the night I know you're tired but pull on the gift amen brother random said their supposed silly women LED away with diverse lust Hollywood all this kind of stuff bob hair wearing shorts wearing makeups all this kind of stuff which is Unbecoming but then he says this he makes a comment do you know the woman plays a great part in the last days now he just mentions and is what I would say is an ill-famed woman it's it's the silly women it's it's they're LED away in diverse lust but he and then he says and the woman plays a great part in the last days but I also believe that if the if the woman of ill Fame if if the if the daughters of Zion who have turned away from the word of God play an important role in the last days then so does the real beautiful branch of the Lord the women of God plays an important role in in the last days are you with me tonight all right I'm gonna do my best to preach even if you're quiet you know the Bible said that those who who Escape out of the great damnation will be a beautiful Branch before the Lord someday I'll get to it the Lord willing for it for you women's let you see what God thinks of the women that really escape this damnation of this day said she would be beautiful that's God's God's proclamation of you today is that you're beautiful you escaping the the influence of this world God says you're beautiful a prophet comes and declares that you're beautiful amen we've heard many times that God before he was God he was in the spans of Eternity and and and he couldn't even be called God yet because it was just an eternal Jehovah it was Elohim he was self-existent there was nothing yet created but yet in him was all these attributes that he wanted to let to let out he he was craving to for these attributes to be let go to be manifested to be expressed out of himself and it was all bottled up inside of this internal being it was it was he he he filled all time space lie everything it was just Eternal there was there was no uh uh uh substance as it were that we could we could touch God and yet he had everything that God is wrapped up in there it's like the seed of an of an apple tree and all of that was just bound up in this seed called called Elohim and it was just he was just dying to express it to to to let it to let it grow and produce other apples so he created angels to worship him and just bear with me we're just going to walk through time a little bit he created angels and thus became God and he became an object of worship and that was an expression of his attribute that was that was something that God could be expressed his attribute could be drawn out of him but it it still wasn't everything that God was it still wasn't all that God had it wasn't his fullness so God God it's it's it's it's it's uh well it's it's just all those potentials were laying in him and then so he created the heavens and the Earth God did he created the heavens and the Earth and out of that became this bore this this attribute that was inside of God that he's a creator that attribute was in God and when he created the heavens and the Earth he became Creator but he didn't just want to stop there he could have he could have stopped with the with what he put in the ocean he could have stopped with what he put in the land but it wasn't good enough it wasn't good enough to make light and darkness there there there was still an attribute inside of God that he wanted to come out and so he created man he created Adam and placed him in the garden to till the soil because because God there there was there was expressions of of God there he was a father and he needed a son to express that attribute of father he needed he wanted a fellowship he's he's a fellowshipper but he needed he needed to express that attribute in order to become uh the the gray Great Fellowship or the one that we can commune with and and so he he's he's expressing these things and everything he's creating and all that he's doing he's expressing attributes and then let me catch myself here and and he wanted that Fellowship but I want you to notice something this is and this is really important that I think is just so beautiful is that he created Adam and and he's and he's going through and it's good and it's good and it's good and he creates Adam and he says it's good and and then he puts him in the garden to till the soil and then and then he says then he says but Adam needs a help me Adam is in the image of God and and if that's the case of Adams and the image of God then Adam has attributes within himself that he's needing to express and he can't do it and just how he is he's he's tilling the soil he's moving things he's naming the animals he's he's speaking things you know this tree over there I like that better and this and that and so so Adam becomes a little Creator but yet there's still attributes inside of Adam that need to be expressed to show the image of God because Adam was created in the image of God are you with me Adam was created in the image of God so all these attributes were bound up within Adam too but but it it the important thing that I want you to catch is it took an actual person close to God's heart in order to for those attributes to be expressed it took a person close to God's heart it took Adam being created and placed in the garden to have fellowship with God in order for these the greatest attributes of God to be expressed that took another person it took a person to be expressed Adam was working for the Lord and yet God looked at him and said there's something still missing there's something Adam he doesn't have a help me I don't know if you can be sad in the garden I don't know maybe he just said I know that feeling when I was by myself I didn't have one of my kind but I've created Adam so that's that's that's fulfilling for me but Adam needs somebody like him so so God puts Adam to sleep he puts Adam to sleep and he draws from the very heart of Adam to create Eve he draws from from the rib and and and I just thought it was beautiful when when in Solomon and uh Lily's wedding just that whole thought of of God taking the rib I always thought you know right side lower rib you know and and the man's missing a rib now and and I always thought that but it makes to me it makes more sense for God to take it from Over the heart of Adam to take that rib because it would need to be somebody who who he could put his arm around and who he could love and who he could cherish and who he could protect and and that and that and so God took it from Adam she was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh but it took it took another human being it took particularly it took the woman to draw out the attributes out of Adam are you with me God is a loving husband so he had to create this picture on Earth of Adam and Eve of a husband and a wife he had to he had to he had to manifest that he had to draw that attribute and it took the woman Eve to draw that to to to to to manifest that that God is a husband God is a loving husband it's and and to show that there was a unity of love between husband and wife in a in a fullness of Fellowship between their hearts there was complete and total intimacy there was no walls no fences nothing hidden it was complete honesty complete openness complete Fellowship complete love and then and then it was also a fellowship between between that love and and between their God and and it was and it makes and you've seen it before the the the triangle of husband wife and God and it takes that to make the full picture and then when that was made God didn't just say that it was good he said it's very good it's very good this was the complete and perfect image of God was found in Adam and Eve but yet there was more attributes that were locked up inside of God and inside of Adam that needed to be expressed and and and I want you to just notice God's Great purpose was prefigured in Adam and Eve the great purpose the whole thing the whole picture of redemption was was was lying there and Adam and Eve Eve fell Adam stepped out as a redeemer God stepped out as a redeemer it was attributes it was attributes inside of Adam to be a redeemer to be a redeemer to his wife the the the scripture said Paul writes to love your wives as Christ of the church and laid himself down for it so so brother you have an attribute in your heart lying there inside of you that your wife draws out of you that you actually you you sanctify her the scripture says you sacrifice you you give of yourself you you you manifest God by by giving to your wife by protecting her by loving her even as you love yourself God wanted to express his fullness still he created Adam and Eve he created the Earth but there was a still a fullness of God that he wanted to express he's Jehovah Jireh he's a provider this is all even before he stepped out and did these things all of this was lying within God he's he's Jehovah Jireh a provider he's Jehovah Shalom our peace Jehovah Rapha our healer Jehovah Nissi our Victor Jehovah Sid canoe our righteousness Jehovah shama the Lord is present Jehovah rohai Our Shepherd and then I just want to point out one that I I I've just thought is remarkable to me remember I'm talking about true beauty in women of God Abraham needed strength in his old age God comes to him as El shadiyai El Shaddai as is the bosom one it's the breasted one brother Branham said that's just like a woman she he God this attribute inside of God is is is the breasted one and we might you know kind of I don't know about that that's kind of weird but when you understand a woman when she has a child she draws the baby to her breast and when the baby nurses it draws the nourishment from the mother it's actually getting strength from the mother and so when God comes to to um Abraham Abraham needed something to draw strength from and God becomes has this attribute inside of him that he's going to express to Abraham and it's God the strength Giver God the sustainer god the life Giver and he's still God the life Giver today when you need strength when you're weak go to al-shaday I go to the breast of go to God draw from his strength draw nourishment draw life from him draw fulfillment draw satisfaction in him that's what a baby when a baby it can be crying but when the mother takes it to herself that baby just and and you know it's it's just always funny you know with when the kids would be nursing you know and they're just making those noises of satisfaction as they're drawing in that life from the mother and it's just funny it's just they're they're just completely satisfied they they don't have a care in the world they don't fear they don't have a worry they just know that they're with Mom and they're drawing strength from that I think it's amazing this is this is Sister you're fearfully and wonderfully made God made you that way and not only did he make you that way but you actually reflect this attribute of God of our shadiyah you reflect that you have a great purpose in the economy of God and and you're fearfully and wonderfully made because when the baby the the baby's born anymore from what I understand they do it all the time as long as they can as the baby's health is good they'll put the baby right on the mother's chest so it goes right skin to skin what that's doing is it's releasing chemicals and the baby and in the mother and those chemicals they call them bonding chemicals they're bonding chemicals that just right from the get-go that baby and that mother is creating a bond when the woman is breastfeeding the baby there's chemicals being released in her brain and in that baby's brain it's a bonding chemical that's why you know not that a dad would be hesitant to run into a fire but but a woman will run into a burning building after her baby that's because of that bonding chemical she's bonded so much that that is now it's bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh she feels that thing she she loves that baby she loves that life and she'll do anything she'll lay down her own life for that child God wants to be bonded with us in that same way that's reflecting God's desire God's heart to be bonded with us so we draw our strength from him we draw our life from him and layer to see him when when there's so many things that we can turn to and we can we can go to God wants us to turn to him to be the life-giving resource is that okay with you God divided the masculine and The Feminine spirit that he put in Adam when he created Adam there was there was a masculine and a feminine in part to that and and I just thought you know Satan is just so cruel and such a such just perverts things a truth of God lies in there masculine and feminine in the beginning but then God didn't keep it that way he separated that out of Adam he he left Adam with the masculine part and put the feminine part with Eve and and and and took from the very makeup of Adam to put in the feminine part of Eve there was no identity confusion there there was no and I'm just going to call it straight there was no transgender mental illness in the creation of God that's all right you can be quiet the transgender used to be a mental illness and now it's it's rampant and they're in their Paving way because they call evil good and good evil we are we are in almost complete Sodom and that's just another part of it but there was no there was no confusion there was no mixing there was no matching it was just feminine in the woman and masculine in the man that's how God created it it was a distinct separation and it took the bride part out to a life allow for that separation Eve had to come forth for God to take that that feminine part put it in Eve it took her in order to make that distinction and that separation Christ needed to express his word through us he desires a bride to express himself through to have preeminence in our lives and he does it through his word because his his word is him he is his word when we talk about a seed it's the seed of God it's the word of God it's the gene of God and and he puts that in in in in those who he's predestined to eternal life she makes it possible for him to express himself in this way the bride of Christ makes it possible for him to express himself in this way Christ in the in Christ The Mystery of God revealed the prophet says Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing I'm talking about the bride part of God it's the Bride of Jesus Christ she becomes the revelation of the entire thing you we we think that Jesus is the is is the revelation of it all and he is don't get me wrong now but but but he he Christ in you the hope of glory makes you the revelation of the entire thing so even in Jesus Christ although he was the fullness of the godhead he wasn't fully expressed in the body of Jesus Christ there was more that he wanted to express there was more that God wanted to give outside of the body of Jesus Christ come on say Amen I'm not bringing a strange Doctrine so God came form in the form of Flesh now watch the picture now going back there was there was a first man Adam then there's a second Adam and if there's a second Adam there was a first Eve and there's a second Eve so Jesus Christ is called the second Adam and he comes forth in a body God comes forth in a body of Jesus Christ and and he comes forth so that a part of him can be taken and then his bride can then be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh God tore into the body of Jesus Christ blood came out and then God that happened so that that the spirit of God could be divided into his bride so that so that the masculine and feminine in the second Adam could be separated in that in that in that feminine spirit of God of Jesus Christ could be placed in the bride she would be the Bride of Jesus Christ and because we're born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and and spirit of his Spirit we become him and he is the word so you in the word become the same person you in the word become the same person when you receive that word into yourself you become the same person as the word of God all of this prefigured by husband and wife masculine feminine Adam Eve to show Christ and his bride man he purposed a woman to do it he purposed the church the feminine part to do it in sister this is the reflection that you reflect of God is is the the very plan and purpose of God there's a mystery that's hidden inside of you o Daughter of Zion that's the importance of a woman that's what she represents that's the beauty of a Godly woman that's why it's important what you dress like that's why it's important what you wear how you wear your hair not because of some bondage but because of what you represent in God's purpose and God's plan it's not about the length of your hair it's about representing a consecrated Life by not cutting it I remember years ago I heard someone ah you say you know Nazarite vow and the woman's under that that's that's just that's hogwash you can't find that the Nazarite vow was was a vow of consecration unto the Lord and that's what the woman is representing as consecration into God that's why you don't you don't trim your hair that's why you don't cut your hair because it's a crown of concentration it shows your commitment to one man because in the scripture only a harlot would cut her hair it's a representation of life of an inward work it's it's not about how much you can take off before you cut too much it's not about how much we can get by with without sinning you understand now it's not about trimming the ends it's not about how much sin you can get by with before you just get too much where's where's that line at where's that line see you're representing something there's something that's lying within your vessel that is that is beautiful in the sight of God if you'll just follow his word it's not about uh how much it's a fully consecrated life to Jesus Christ Isaiah referred to it the the attitude of the women would become so much that they would cut their hair until the style even becomes shorter than a man's a woman in the representation of God's purpose is why a bad woman also represents this great drama that's played out through the ages I I don't want to focus on the bad woman I want to focus on the good I want you to see yourself as the woman of God that you are I want you to see yourself what real true beauty is but but you have to almost take a step back though and see because Eve did reject God's word and it was playing out into the purpose of God but Eve got away from her mate by going away from the word she rejected the authority of God's word and that's what brought death she received seed and knew her womb that wasn't her husband's seed you see a woman has been created sister you're fearfully and wonderfully made because you can receive a seed into your body from a man and and and a baby can grow in you and be birthed by you you become a life Giver you become a life-giver and and it's just so amazing fearfully and wonderfully made God Made You to receive that your immune system should attack that seed your immune system the way that God's made the body is is and that's why when they put and do an organ transplant they have to they have to give you medication and things and and hope that your body doesn't reject that organ because they're putting a life inside of you and your body was created that your immune system was created to go and attack that life and and let your body expel it get it out of your body because it's drawing from your life but her her immune system would attack it but she's been created in such a way that her body shuts off that part of her immune system so that it doesn't harm the life that's growing inside of her old things pass away All Things become new the old man is dead in the Life of Christ lives what was once rejected is now embraced in the life of a Christian so you see sis this is what your your you're expressing in your natural body you're expressing an image a greater purpose of God do you see it a little bit clearer tonight her DNA literally changes parts of her DNA literally changes so that her immune system won't attack that your DNA the the very thing brother Stephen strew talked about the DNA your DNA actually parts of your DNA changes says you're fearfully and wonderfully made a man's body can't do that a man's body can't do that I don't care what they're trying to do today implanting in men and everything that that's that's they're under an illusion they've gotten away they've accepted a perverted way a man's body can't do that you see he needs the woman to express that and when that life is inside she becomes a prisoner to that life there there's there's no way for her to stop it it grows Until It Breaks forth and expresses itself she craves certain things her diet changes all of it is is that life inside of her craving something new because she she may never been able my wife loves coffee and when she was pregnant she couldn't drink coffee that little life inside of her they didn't get enough spankings I guess when they you need to spank them more for making you not be able to drink coffee that life and then she'll crave things that she never craved before weird things I know I know uh one sister and she'll know who she is she she she would eat I think it was a tomato and drink a cup of coffee because something in it was what the baby was craving it was it was her diet changed it was it was it was a life inside of her that's growing and when you become a Christian when you become filled with the spirit of God that word of God that's inside of you can only feed on the word of God your diet changes from worldly things and goes to Heavenly things [Applause] your diet changes she's she's so the woman she's needed she is important to express the plan and purpose of God God is a husband the prophet said of the church and the church is his bride the prophet said so you'll understand I no longer call you church I'll call you bride he was trying to get this point across it's not just a church it's not just a just we're not just here it's you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're an expression like the woman reveals the seed of a man the the the church is Christ himself revealed that little seed when it's when when that baby is born it's an expression of the man it's an expression of the love between the man and the woman but yeah eve took the wrong seed and and we know that she had to do that in order to for the attributes that were bound up inside of God to be expressed remember brother Boaz referenced that Samson was choosing against God and yet it played into the plan of God so we we we can fall Eve and and and I'd like we'd like to probably all sit down and have a good talk with her someday but yet God needed her to be to be uh uh I can't remember it's not necessarily a byproduct he he he he needed her for the fullness of of God's plan God's purpose to be expressed to be expressed she had to be created so she could fall that's why a woman shouldn't handle the word of God that's not saying anything against you sis that's just saying that God created you for a special purpose and when you try to handle the word of God you can misinterpret the word of God and be deceived just like Eve was Eve came under an illusion and took her own thinking over God's word we don't want some illusion of some sort but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through us not some illusion of Christianity but a real genuine New Birth where Christ can reproduce himself through your life it's a life you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by himself just like that little baby does you just become so in love with him you just surrender all a woman she becomes so in love with the life inside of her she just surrenders to it surrenders to the cravings surrenders bears bears the backache Bears the pain of Labor that bonding chemical is so strong in a woman's body that even though she travails in childbirth the the the the chemicals in that woman's brain will actually almost make her forget what she went through the pain she experienced because and and and it and it makes her remember the love she felt so she'll go and do it again that's how God created you you are fearfully and wonderfully made God said multiply and replenish the Earth to Adam and Eve there was a purpose in that there was a purpose in it being man and woman it's not some illusion and I just say if if there's anyone under the illusion today getting under an illusion wondering whether you like whether you're a man and you think you like men or you're a woman and you think you like women or you think you want to be a woman and you're a man or or or or a man and you're a woman you're under an illusion you can come to God and ask God and God will show you the purpose for your life God will show you the truth of it if you're under an illusion of of what a Christian should look like or where you're at in your Christian walk go to God seek God and God will show you God will tell you our Pastor said a statement not too long ago he said knowing God's purpose and and and your purpose will settle you if you have that confusion go to God ask him to show you his purpose for for his purpose and his purpose for your life and when God shows you you won't be confused no more let me let me skip some of this Eve was the mystery inside of Adam you're the mystery inside of Jesus Christ so just simply put what an important role the woman plays in the plan and purpose of God you should feel valued sister you should you shouldn't feel that that hair and dress and things and is is a condemnation to you or or a binding and imprisonment to you ask God his purpose in that ask God his plan behind that ask God his purpose for you and you'll see how important you are to the plan of God now when a woman goes and she acts like I'm just going to take a little turn here when a woman goes and she acts like the daughters of Zion that are that that that that act like the daughters of man it becomes a grievous picture she's supposed to be a daughter of God but yet she's acting like a daughter of man she's she's sing but there's a reason that she's acting that way there's a reason she's doing it it could be a spirit there's a spirit on this age of that there's a spirit attacking any genuine man any genuine woman there's a spirit on this age that's attacking it she could be coming under the illusion of that spirit she surely has to reject God's word in order to go do that but it may be because she's comparing herself she's comparing herself she sees the women of the of man the women of this world are stripping their clothes off she sees that she compares herself she she she a woman is built to want to be pretty and and to men we're thankful for that right that's all right you can say Amen in your hearts but there's a desire in a woman to be beautiful and she may feel like she has to compete with what she's seen she may feel like she has to compete for the time and intention of her husband and so she'll act out in ways that that that she normally wouldn't and that A Daughter of Zion wouldn't but by acting that out she'll attract the wrong man she'll attract the wrong attention she'll do things a woman who has her confidence and the Lord wouldn't do if you could pull up that video if you have it when a woman has her confidence in the Lord she wouldn't do those things and Isaiah painted a pretty clear picture of what that looks like now I want to I want to show you just a little video because um I I just when I read this this is actually where this this thought or when I I read this in a book and and I looked it up and when I watched it I it just struck my heart so heavy that that to preach this just struck my heart when I walked when I looked at this video yesterday it was posted in April 14 2013 when I looked at it yesterday it has over 70 million views and I'm gonna I'm gonna let it play and then I'm gonna comment a little bit on it because there's just a couple of things that I want to say so if you have that you can go ahead and hit play on it I'm a forensic artist worked for the San Jose police department from 1995 to 25. I showed up to a place I'd never been and there was a guy with a drafting board we couldn't see them they couldn't see us tell me about your hair I didn't know what he was doing but then I could tell after several questions that he was drawing me tell me about your chin I get kind of a little bit intrudes a little bit especially when I smile your jaw your jaw my mom told me I had a big jaw what would be your most prominent future kind of have a fat rounder face the older I've gotten the more freckles I've gotten I think I have a pretty big I would say I have a pretty big forehead [Music] once I get a sketch once I get a sketch I say thank you very much and then they leave I don't see them all I had been told before all I had been told before the sketch was to get friendly with this other woman Chloe today I'm going to ask you some questions about a person you met earlier and I'm going to ask you some general questions about their face she was thin so you could see her cheekbones and her chins it was a nice thin chin chin she had nice eyes she had nice eyes they lit up when she spoke she had blue eyes very nice blue eyes [Music] this is the schedule that you helped me create and that's a sketch that somebody described of you see [Music] [Music] the second one looks more open Friendly and happy I should be more grateful I should be more grateful of my natural beauty it impacts the choices and the friends that we make the jobs we apply for how we treat our children it impacts everything couldn't be more couldn't be more critical to your happiness do you think you're more beautiful than you say yeah [Music] time as women analyzing and trying to fix the things that aren't quite right and we should spend more time you should spend more time appreciating the things that we do like perfect it's the more beautiful I think [Music] but we live in an age a world that tells you what's ready and then if you're displaying the attributes of God and what God said about you then the world the world will tell you that's old-fashioned that that's whatever this is what's beautiful if you notice the the the drawing that the person that the people met that these women met it looked more like a woman they're seeing they're looking at it and they're seeing the reflection of her beauty they're seeing what they're they're just they see her in a different light than what that woman is looking at herself she fills these things but but God has said that you're beautiful like in that a little close stay with me are you with me amen thank you Ellie we could be looking at ourselves in comparison with what the world says inspiration from Satan and then the different people have different opinions then because everyone want to tell everyone but so so you have to find an absolute change it the only opinion of what true beauty is never changes is the opinion of God now she says in one spot she says it's not the beauty it's it's it's it's it's it's what you how do you perceive yourself that impacts the jobs you choose if you had to choose a job how beautiful you are according to the word of God and if you don't see yourself that way ask them to show you it's her self-worth it has to do with her confidence of the world you your confidence and you'll miss all the positive things God is doing in your life if your point of reference is larger this isn't anything they really are and then at your point of reference is it's all when you compare yourself it always gives you a false sense of reality now real quick I'm doing pretty good amount of time for a minute Tick Tock has become the most popular of social media it works so fast it can work as fast are [Applause] it's particularly targeted young teenage girls dad you better look at her phone I would recommend trash in it it targets young teenage girls at least heavy on showing things [Applause] looks like what to believe they give young people dangerous challenges they're using medications and Natural Things [Music] there's an increased ADHD anymore they see inequality thinking has been fed by the platform exploded shutdowns their needs talk about posting very loudly about very intimate and intense things and people are encouraged to be vulnerable they call it as people are expressing these things doing it so if you post a video there can be a complete another strange review thank you too close it's coming [Music] you believe it another spot he's talking about the children of Israel he sent them into the Wilderness from the rest of the world that's what God's done to you sister he separated you what did they do saw the pretty women and Memorial that's exactly right an image right uh she uh she started at the beginning said she'll continue to strip herself women beautiful today or any false thing that's your purpose sister that's what your purpose is follow after the Lord speak to him for what's beautiful speak to him for your purpose that you were in the very mind of the god back from the beginning and you are an important part of the expression of God's plan women play a great part in these last days she would be beautiful the daughters she would be beautiful in the sight of God amen father we come before you Lord and Lord I've done my very best to express themselves father but to compare themselves reflection a real woman I pray father that you would let us be in your image so much of the emphasis of your purpose your plan more than ever and Sodom becomes more like Sodom God let our hearts of Zion let our hearts granted Lord we love you and praise you God I just asked you I just I I keep feeling of yours if any sister feels like she's not beautiful if she's looking to the world for what beauty is and what true beauty is in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen real quick don't say happy birthday today happy birthday God bless you Brothers enough chair you know that song [Music] my voice [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] oh I have you beautiful forever [Music]
