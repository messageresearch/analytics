========================================

spoke out the judgment of this man in the story you know the story where he just spoke the judge and he said this man needs to be killed that was the judgment but when when david offered that judgment call he didn't realize if he's putting judgment back on himself because he was the one that was doing it so we learned a lot of lessons from this so i just want to pick it up here this morning in verse 7 and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy master's house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things wherefore hast thou despise the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon and um we realized then that the uriah was killed because you know he took his wife and then he had uriah killed on the uh out in the war so you know that story you're familiar with that god speaking back to him so now watch now the judgments come from god verse 10 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house david the sword will never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against so now the judgments continue i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou didst it secretly so part of the pronouncement here is that god was not pleased that something was done secretly you never do anything secretly god knows all things but as a king now he did something secret did not do it openly but whatever is done secretly if you're a son and daughter of god it will be revealed openly someday for thou this secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the son and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die now here's where grace comes in aren't you glad when grace comes in because david repented he says i the lord hath put away thy sin david and thou shalt not die he should have died he deserved to die but thou shalt not die how be it because by thy deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die so bathsheba was pregnant and so then in the next few verses then david starts to appeal to god even though he's been forgiven he starts to appeal to god in fasting and prayer that the child should live that child should live and then you know the story that god says no it would die he pronounced it so we want to get into this this morning and i pray that the lord will give us an anointing and a spirit there's so many blessings and instruction from this but we just want to take it piece by piece and i pray that you'll have an open heart heavenly father bless your word it's already been spoken it's already been done and it will not return void lord it will bring forth a bride in this age in this satan's eden lord we pray you'll bless every heart from different backgrounds and different places even this week maybe they've been through different trials and temptations lord but you have a word for us lord to live by and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god lord may i stand in my office this morning that it's just to simply feed the sheep of god may the hungry ones be fed this morning i pray and i ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you why don't you shake somebody's hand again as you're seated and we appreciate you standing for the word of god i had been referring to the story a few chapters later i had been referring to the story of amnon a little bit in second samuel chapter 13 and we know that the story of amnon is a very tragic a very terrible story of rape in the bible and i would say that it's even more terrible that story is even more terrible to see something like this happen in the royal family of israel it's it wouldn't be expected that we would see a story like this in the bible but we we know we would see it maybe in the heathen and in the unbelieving nations but when we have a story like amnon come up amongst the royal family of israel the king of israel that god elected that's kind of unexpected um that this would come out of the very people that are to be upholding the moral laws of god and the commandments of god and the law of moses it's just unexpected and yet yet it happened just the same the bible didn't hide it and thus god did not hide the story god didn't hide the story god left it in his word they recorded it and yet it's here and so if god didn't hide it we don't hide it if god doesn't hide it we don't ignore it and everything god places in this bible is for our instruction for our revelation and for our good if he left something in there then it's to our benefit can you say man although we want to deny it we won't say no that stuff never happens and you know we we want to go those directions and yet god god somehow leaves this in and so when he leaves it in there must be lessons for us in it and so we cannot in this age overlook the mystery of christ and redemption in every part of this bible how many know the prophet of god said that if you don't find christ in every scripture of this bible you need to go back and read it again we as the bride must catch the mystery that's in this bible we must catch the mystery that's in our history can you say amen we must catch the redemption in every scripture because that's what it was written for there's a redemption to god's people can you say amen and so we we see then that that if we miss christ in this then we must go back and read it again ii timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of god how many has read that scripture before all scripture there's not one verse that's left out there's not filler scriptures all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable to us for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness there's not one scripture left out not any scriptures to be ignored everything has value to it can you say amen and god blessed us with the full word of god and not only the full word of god when man tampered with it and put veils over it god in the last day says i'll take all the veils off of that bible and my bride will see it the way she should see it and that's why she'll become a spiritual powerhouse because no devil when you're in the word and the word is in you there isn't any devil can stop that process you're under the power of redemption can you say amen how many raise your head i'm under the power of redemption god has redeemed me and that redemptive power can only go in one direction and that's up can you say about hallelujah so all scripture is to be studied and to be of value if you're not in your bible you should be in your bible you should become familiar with the scriptures see sometimes i read certain parts and it's just so technical keep reading it keep praying with it sometimes i read it and the devil tells me and it is the devil telling you that's not relevant every part of it is relevant relevant somehow can you say amen and and so now we should read it and especially the scriptures that hold the mystery for our day because there's particular scriptures that hold a mystery in them for our time that we live in there's certain scriptures that are very important to the bride because they hold the mystery for our day and david david in the bible coming to his throne finally after so many years under saul and all the transition happening within the message finally david who was the one that was supposed to be god's choice for a king finally david comes to his throne through the help of gentile warriors and that's all a mystery for our day david was placed on the throne through the help of gentile warriors which is a type of the bride of jesus christ gentile warriors that said we believe in you david you're going to be on the throne someday and we're going to fight until we put you on the throne glory be to god but look at the story now look at this in this it had a change of events that we didn't expect david came to his throne through the help of gentile warriors everybody's happy he's on the throne and then all of his enemies were subdued around him he had victory over all of his enemies they were subdued and so you would think that was it it's done it's come to its glory the message has come to its glory but then something started in second samuel chapter 11 and the story takes another turn for the next several chapters the story the glory of him being on the throne the glory of all this coming into place and god sending a prophet and then put a king on the throne and all this seems like it's all ready to go and then the whole story takes a turn when david sins and it's it's a it's a it's a turn of events that was not expected can you say man i'm going to say to you this morning there are some directions and things that the message has went not the message itself but the movement of the message it took turns that we didn't expect can you say amen things have happened that we didn't expect to happen within the message and in our ranks it took a turn and nevertheless always remember this and this is from wednesday night brother gideon and that is no matter what happens god has victory in mind in the end for the bride he's got victory in mind all the time for your life for the bride he's got the victory in mind at the end can i get an amen this morning so brother gideon preached on removing the hindrances and so when in hindrance comes like aiken ache and taking uh two things ache and messed up the ache and stopped the battle of a.i he ruined a battle that they should have won because you know what he did he stole he it was about money and it was about clothes babylonian clothing come on people say amen well how did all of israel start to lose their victory money and clothes from babylon is the thing that brought them down and they couldn't have full victory which is what our brother gideon preached to us god has to remove the hindrances you have to remove the hindrances you got to search it out and find that gold and find those things in your tent and bring them out and they stoned all of akin and his family because why victory is important to god and you can't have full victory when you keep the hindrances in your life i'm not re-preaching gideon's message he preached it good enough but i was so excited to know that god's standing there saying i know israel did this and he didn't say a consent he said all of israel sinned and he says i know this has happened this is little this is a glitch this is it i don't like it i'm angry about this and they can't victory but listen god's saying how can i get this dealt with so i can get the people back to ahai in other words he says oh you blew it so now just try some other cities you won't get a i know he took them right back to ai again when god dealt with the hindrance and the hindrance was gone and the sin was out of the camp he directed them right back you're gonna get the victory over ai that's the same god that i served this morning i don't care what happens in our life i don't care what hindrance is i don't care what pain sorrow mistakes sin can you say man if you're a son and daughter of god god has your victory in mind even when you don't have your victory in mind god's got your victory in mine and they were going to go back to a.i ai artificial intelligence because why that one has got to be conquered anybody waking up this morning this world is full of artificial intelligence we're affected by it but that no devil is going to take the social media and artificial intelligence and we're not going to back down that's something that's got to be conquered in a believer's life oh i can't get enough amens this morning you know it's the truth those cities speak of our victories today hallelujah with the story of david now it takes another turn unexpected and trouble trouble hit the house of david for several chapters as a matter of fact he said you're never going to see the sword depart from your house now i'll get to this at the end if i have enough breath left i'm excited this morning this is an anger this is excitement we have a strange way of expressing it but it's excitement but this is my title this morning accepting troubles but embracing grace because where i want to go with this is sometimes when we make a mistake and god comes in our life and begins to bring because we reap what we saw and he brings the judgments sometimes the judgments we want we want god to affect all of the situation by grace and i can tell you in david's situation he didn't he didn't i should say this in his eyes he didn't give every situation grace but he gave david grace he spared david's life but there were other things that he dealt with the rest of his life and we would say selfishly well that's not my god and god he should be able to get rid of all of this that's our perfect world that we want in a perfect world god should have done this and god should have done that and god and so we bring our own judgments to how god should a judge how much grace he should have gave me let me tell you something i'm preaching my final conclusion here is that we we don't deserve anything from god and any grace that he gives us we don't embrace and say thank god for your grace thank god that i'm still living this morning thank god that i'm still breathing this morning thank god that my family is healthy this morning thank god that i have a desire to serve god thank god that i love this message you think you gave yourself the love for this message in this word you didn't even give that to yourself god created that love within you people say well he didn't give grace in this area he didn't give me this and he didn't give me that and he didn't spare my child why when do we start navigating navigating god's grace we should be grateful for the grace he gives us and when he offers judgment in the rest of the situation we should be thankful for that too but why i don't understand a god like that we don't have to understand all of it why did this happen why did this happen we got some we got some spiritual heroes in this church that it's the grace of god they're sitting here after losing a loved one after losing to either cancer or some other situation it's the grace of god they're even sitting here believing this word anymore because if they went the direction of everybody else their mind would say there's no god but because there's something rooted on the inside that says i'm not going to sit around and try to interpret god i'm going to love him with all my heart and any grace he gives me any unanswered questions blessed be the name of the lord any unanswered questions if i don't get the answers today i'm going to a heaven and i'm going to get all the answers someday every question will be answered and probably most of them you will say oh god thank you that you didn't give me what i was asking for isn't there a song by the isaacs that says something somebody says thank you lord for the things you didn't give me that's maturity thank you lord for the things you didn't give me because when you get to the end of the road you see he's in control he knows the reasons why i just feel like just sitting and crying a while this morning the glory of the lord is filling me so much i don't feel like preaching i just feel like saying thank you lord i don't deserve any of this i don't deserve that my children would love god i don't deserve it could go another direction if it does i pray i have the grace to go through it i don't know but i am so thankful for the grace he's given me lord let me let you know this morning if i've ever was arrogant or proud which i have been and i take things for granted i want to let you know and i'm not doing this for a show this morning i'm telling god forgive me for not being more thankful for your grace because grace is unmerited favor and we might not get all the things we want in life god never promised that he never promised that the cross would not be heavy but if he gives me any of his grace i'll take it i'll embrace it i'm thankful for it and one of the grace that he'll give the bride is rapturing grace to get out of this world because you won't do it by your good works you won't do it by being a better message believer you won't do it by how many quotes you know you won't make this rapture because you're got a a a good attendance record to all the camps it's rapturing grace that will make it to the other side that's why we'll be shouting so much because we know we couldn't have got there except for the grace of god i got to get back up here and preach let's say praise the lord let's rejoice let's give god glory thank you lord for your grace [Applause] hallelujah and so internal trouble trouble in the house of david now because of his sin family trouble sexual sins and many other troubles came to the house of david not just with david's sexual sin but sexual sin became a part of the house of david and i'm not blaming david for that but it has to the commentators and the different ones who write about it they're careful sometimes to attach amnon's sin to david but you can't do that but there's something to be learned about sexual sin that sexual sin no matter how private and undisclosed or it doesn't get out sexual sin has a way of affecting the household down the road and this scripture proves that you don't have to raise your hand say amen to that yes i just want you to chew on it sexual sin in particular has a way of causing residual troubles especially secret sins i can talk of this openly today because i'm not 50 years ago in a generation i'm in 2022 and i deal with families that have sexual abuse i deal with families that have been abused uncles and aunts that have molested children at five years old we're not in a we're not in we're not in kansas anymore we're we're not into we're not in 1965. god didn't call me to preach in 1965 god called me for such a time as this and if satan can glorify sin and hide sin i can get up in your talk openly respectfully about how sexual sin and pornography can kill a family i'm so mad at the devil that the lord willing i didn't want to announce this today but this winter i'm going to have a night here and i'm inviting any brother who wants to come any brother any brother even from the community and we're going to sit with our bibles and we're going to sit and we're going to study it because to me sons of god do not need to be ignorant of satan's devices in this hour we're going to expose it with the knowledge of god and keep exposing it until we see some sons of god stronger can you say amen by the holy ghost and conscious conscious of what the littlest thing can do to our families when we dabble in it listen friends i got a phone and i get apps and stuff like this like like i told you last sunday i can't wait till i can throw my phone away i hate my phone in the rapture it'll stay here and i'll go there i love it i got a weather app because you know when you get older you're concerned every moment about the weather i don't know why it becomes so important it's just like it helps you function in your day for us old people if it's raining praise the lord i'm staying in bed today praise the lord i don't want to go john and these slack to dudes and go to work all day i don't have to go do it it's raining boys we're not working today it's raining you know i got that app and every there's ads that come underneath the weather app for women's intimates women's underwear the new bikinis that are coming out there's hardly anything else advertised but underneath my weather app what does that have to do with weather well it's it's satan and i'm a son of god and that satan that now takes that uses it so you got i don't even know if there's any tech guys here that can help me take it off i'm sure there's a way but i don't know how to do it i can't stand it it's and you know the temptation is there it can't be wrong just to tap on that thing and just see what's going on my one brother was at communion here and testified that he wanted to buy something for his wife and so he looked in the magazine of jcpenney looking through the the women's stuff and so that's how it started looking for the looking for something for his wife and then all of a sudden now you're looking at everything else it always has a place to start i should have a lot more amens from the sisters right now all right i guess you don't want to sit there and say by your husband amen preach it brother just kick him under the chair or something i don't know i i'm just saying that like like god said to esther mark i said sir could it be that god's raised you up for such a time as this i'm going to put that in my office on a big big sign could it be god's raised you up the ministry for this time not for 1965 for such a time as this so if if satan has glorified sexual sin and made it so accessible i'm going to talk about it to you brothers and sisters and you young people openly plainly respectfully but openly play you're going to hear me talk about it because i'm on an all-out attack against the enemy praise god so now years now years of trouble is going to come sexual sins in david's house and he started it now all these things you heard of the heathen nations some of the same incidences happened in their own camp in our own camp for years we heard it in the heathens but now we hear it in our own camp we hear it david it's in it's in the royal family many years of trouble in david's house came from it so i don't want the story to end there i'm just going to quickly say and go back to david here but i'm going to quickly say to you in the story it ends in a victory because many years after a lot of trouble in david's house if it's a type of the bride today and i believe it is then praise the lord jesus that wasn't the end because the next generation raised up under solomon restoration came a temple was built and guess what god came down and responded back and filled the temple so much with his glory that the minister couldn't even speak i'm telling you people being defeated people under a cloud people underneath uh habits and things god is going to deliver this bride from every one of them and god's got your victory in mind can you say amen and this bride god's going to fill his temples with his glory at the end of this thing and take him in a rapture that's how the story ends is it ended in the glory of god coming down in the temple i don't care how much troubles david's house has solomon raised up and then our prophet proclaims a greater than solomon is here somebody say praise the lord a greater than solomon he was proclaiming don't worry about your troubles don't worry about being in satan's eden a greater than solomon is here now and that means god's going to fill his temples with the glory of god praise the lord god's going to send revival again how many believe revival it's not a national revival but it's the bride's revival can you say amen amen after all that happened and they didn't deserve the glory of god come they didn't deserve all after all the sexual sin they didn't deserve the glory of god coming down in solomon's day they didn't deserve it none of us deserve any of it but god has victory in mind for his people and he will come and we know that the people will reap some bad harvest because of decisions they make but how god says they're reaping because i have a law of sowing and reaping god says in my people today they're reaping there's a law of harvest they're reaping a harvest from bad decisions that they made but god doesn't stay there he says i know they're reaping a harvest but how can i get them to a final victory i love it now and there's some pretty difficult things that happen sometimes within our ranks more things that i would probably like to see troubles internally but god somebody sang a song in the night of worship called god gets the final say in your trials in your mistakes god gets the final saying and i would rather hem him have the final say in my life god will get the final say but anyone who says we ignore certain stories uh we don't preach on those certain stories that when the people of god were in trouble or uh that happens in the ranks of god we're we're gonna ignore that that's going on the that story doesn't apply to us the bride we're the bride those stories don't apply to us well that's a message pride i say it's a message pride to ignore certain things and say that never happens among us the same devil that came in the house of david is working against us today so let's quit pretending let's quit pretending and let's be filled with the spirit and go against this enemy individually and collectively let's stand full of the holy ghost and go against this enemy that's what i say can you say amen so you can be in denial and you can cover up but we learn all this from the bible we learn from all the bible we learn from the whole story of david's trouble and i will call this david's sin the kind of the back story of amnon and the back story is events that led up to amnon events that led up and so we know as i've been speaking about amnon there's several reasons that he got where he was at that he could become so possessed of the enemy so possessed of devils and lustful demons that he actually uh raped a girl and took him in the bible now it's it's amazing and so there's several reasons he got there i spoke about the mind a mind his mind must have been turned over to other thoughts so much he couldn't have got there amnon couldn't have got there with his mind being completely uh controlled by another spirit and then there's another message i want to get into lord willing he the next scripture in ammon says he had a friend amnon had a friend it was a bad friend it was a bad friend so he had the wrong friend if you have the wrong friend it's going to influence your life i don't know why we even call some people friends when they keep weakening us spiritually that's not your friends your friends are the ones that draw you closer to god i got this online friend and oh we have a nice relationship and they're a complete unbeliever that's really not your friend it might be your enemy but admin had a friend and that's how he got there too so all the events leading up to it but there's several reasons that amnon got there but you see now but the one i want to talk about today is the king's sin because we might not say it's not say it's not related but the dad the king what david did what david did and you can disagree with me that's fine but i believe what david did set a tone in the family and in the kingdom because nobody knew about this before and now god says i'm going to blast it all over that our king that our king took a woman that wasn't his and had sexual relations with her and then killed the husband all of this word got out and so if you don't think that has an effect on people's minds our king our god called king our man that's in leadership our leader you see we think it's the sin is bad and the sin is terrible it was terrible but what satan does with the sin is sometimes worth because it's a lack of trust in the people again and not only that if it's not dealt with then we realize it sets a precedence kind of like with esther and the king and the the king said go tell vashtai to did i want her to come and do something in the banquet and bashed i said no i refuse to come and so now the king says if we let that go and all the rulers said if we let that go then all the women of the land are going to say say no to their husbands when they ask them to do something when they ask for a sandwich and all the women are saying no it it has a trickle-down effect fathers husbands young men listen to me today sometimes your little decisions can have a trickle-down effect to children for many generations now listen i believe god has the power to break curses in families and i could preach another sermon on that and you'd probably be more excited about it than what i'm preaching today but god can break curses in families but i can still preach if that curse isn't broke then little decisions that david made and different ones make you think you can do it privately but it's going to have an effect it's going to trickle down it will spill over and then you look at your sons and daughters sometimes you say why are they that way well you don't just say well it's because they don't have the holy ghost it's all on them it's not always on all of them it's poor decisions that we made and trust me friends you don't have to say amended with all this as long as you chew on it that's fine it's nice to get amens but i know these subjects are tedious to talk about i'm not wanting to bring you brothers down or your sisters down but i want to speak openly and honestly that we life is life and when you make decisions privately sometimes sexual temptation decisions and you fall and you do things like that you think you're hiding it but it has a trickle-down effect in sexual things in the family i'm not wanting you to take all the blame but i want you to do what david did and he took the blame and brought it to god and god forgave him but he had trouble in his house because of it so david set the tone for the family a little bit here sexual sin and passions sexual sin and passions for those things with david we're lifted way too high in importance i'm going to read a quote from the prophet in a minute that will show brother ram speaks of his pace his passions and his passions david's passions were all of a sudden placed more important than his family the kingdom at a moment's time he placed his sexual temptation and his passions the most important thing in that private moment and i'm here to say when the devil in satan's eden starts to get us doing that it's only destruction coming from it you see that's the thing is that god made us the way we are i tell young people this you shouldn't feel that you've sinned because you have an attraction to the opposite sex god gave you that it's normal it's natural in the message thirst brother abraham said it's normal for us to want to fellowship with a mate and have fellowship and to be married and things like this god gave you a natural thirst within you to be married and all those things he puts within our body to fulfill our fulfill ourselves with another person with the right person after we're married it's all natural there's no sin in that the marriage bed is undefiled and maybe because satan knows that scripture because how many knows he knows the scripture too maybe because he knows the scripture and i'm going to teach it as a pastor and our youth leaders are going to teach it and everybody's going to teach it he knows that the marriage is undefiled so satan says well then i need to defile their minds and defile them before they would get married that they even hardly can have a natural normal marriage because their mind's been so defiled by porganography and romantic books their minds have been messed with satan does that can you say amen to take the purity and innocence of a young child even at five years old teaching about lesbians in our public school system god have mercy on this nation what are we doing to our children never should see things you should never see it at 16 years old you should keep your life under the grace of god god i'll help me to preserve my mind my not my mind is not a garbage can help me to not look help me to turn my head and keep myself from my wife or my husband as best i can lord when i make a mistake god forgive me never let me look at that again because you blessed the marriage bed undefiled there's no sin in that and there's no sin that you have an attraction to the opposite sex you get about 12 11 12 13 years old and you start thinking about them when you were eight years old guys never think of girls they don't need girls girls are not necessary they wish it was a whole earth full of guys not girls we don't need them and then their bodies change and at 13 they become aware of the opposite sex and they and then you ask them do we need girls yeah we need girls everything changes what happened to you even the voice changes dad your whole body changes and now and everything about that every young people you listen everything about that change in your body is not sin it's normal and god says i know about that i know and i'm going to bless them with a a godly husband and wife someday and they'll be able to according first corinthians 7 have their own wife and they'll be able to fulfill that sexual desire so if you'll give yourself to my word i'll prepare a husband for you and you can fulfill that properly instead of cheapening it like the world does instead of playing around with it on your own in the backseat of a car you got yourself out of the will of god trying to think of the thought that i was bringing up just now god gave you these things naturally so in romans 1 a couple weeks ago romans 1 all of a sudden when they begin to turn to sin then all of a sudden this thing came in that was beyond natural affection and women turned in lust towards one another and men that's the final result of sexual things not being put under the holy ghost that's the fun and we're there we are there we are at the full manifestation of sodom and gomorrah where there's not too much time left we're there we're living in sodom can you say amen that's why i said a few weeks ago when i talked about what the ladies should wear why in the world are you bucking up against something when god gave us those things because of this sodom spirit he gave you sisters what to wear and what was modest to counter the sodom spirit coming to your children but normal natural desires get changed can you say amen and david david kind of started this because the natural things and sexual sins and passions for those things were lifted way too of importance so i'm going to expose some things here this morning that were the beginning of david's trouble you speed ahead three chapters and you got a young boy in his kingdom his his son one of his sons so possessed that he would rape his own half-sister how do you get there it's when your passions and your sexual temptations get lifted above family get lifted above everything else sometimes an addiction is lifted above eating because it is an addiction it's lifted above everything and that night that's what david did you may not want me to hear king david talked about like this that's exactly what happened that night here's a man who stood in the palaces of god as king and gave himself over to a private secret thought that said no one will find out and he lifted the passions he felt so high that he did not think about family he didn't think of the repercussions he didn't know tamar was i think 13 years old he had no idea that his decision could affect tamar just a few years later i'll tell you brothers we better be conscious of the decisions we make it's not just going to affect you it's going to affect your wife it's going to affect your family brother paul why don't you be bold quit beating around the bush i say that sarcastically why don't you just come right out and say it well i'm gonna come right out and say it two things in our satan's eden things done in secret while we're relaxing and unnatural passions and affections those two things are the things that we fight against more than anything else both are big traps in the time we live in but even worse you can have unnatural passions lifted up above important things in life you can have things done secretly while you're relaxing but they're worse today because these two things are magnified and fueled in other words the gas is poured on them a hundred times by media and by the devices that we have so you may have the problem that you lift up sexual temptation and you lift up your passions high above every other normal thing in life you might start to get unnatural affections and and start to believe in ideas you might lift it up but now if you feed on any of things of the devices of this age it multiplies it by a hundred times no wonder we have this problem because you could have 200 years ago a boy that has a problem it was very rare but he has a problem with the spirit of homosexuality you have a problem with someone raping somebody or something like that 200 years ago but you didn't have the social media and you didn't have the the sex saturated media that we have today so you take a spirit of lust and put it and you're going to feed on that stuff too i'll tell you without the holy ghost your chances are overcoming almost nothing in this hour i'm trying to make you awake to it that we have to realize that if we didn't have the fourth dimension so easily accessible in our hands it would not be as bad but we do have the fourth dimension brought to us in the last hundred years more than we've ever had and the fifth dimension you got to realize that now the fourth dimension how many would agree until tv came out it wasn't until this last generation that the fourth it was always there but now we have the fourth dimension brought into a tube brought into whatever it is brought into our phones satan in the last days used technology to bring the fourth dimension so we can see it that's your generation now on your phone you can see anything so now as i said whenever it was in the last few services is that now satan says from the fifth dimension of demonic realms he takes the fifth dimension and it spills over into the fourth dimension of television then if we feed on it that all those demons spill over from the fourth dimension into the first three dimensions that we live on and mostly it fills your mind i'm not getting satan compliments but he certainly knows what he's doing and he's smarter than some believers i'm so glad this isn't based upon smarts because i couldn't go up against the devil but it is based upon a revelation the lord gives the bride when that drops in your heart some of the things this morning if it would drop in your heart by revelation i'll tell you it'll affect your life and say i'm not a statistic i'm not to fall like the rest of the world i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god i'm 16 years old and i'm not going to feed on that trash i'm gonna stand as a son of god when i make a mistake i'm gonna ask god's forgiveness and i'm gonna stand against this god give us men and girls and women that'll stand with the truth in this hour full of the holy ghost if it didn't now so now i've got to move on here so our world is fashioned to two things our world and our social media and our television it's fashion you say well i don't watch any television i don't watch i don't watch that stuff on my phone well you better keep your eyes off the billboards there's not anywhere you can go without it look at what people are wearing at walmart in the checkout line so i never watch all that stuff well you better turn your head in walmart it's very interesting outfits in walmart i don't know why that is interesting people this is a statement i wanted to make our world right now is fashion to teach us to hide sin and it also exploits sexual lust that's the world you live in it's not just sexual lust is there and you heightened people did that before david did it but now it's heightened in its fashion to increase and pour gas on a fire because sexual passions is a fire in the book of proverbs how many knows it's a fire can a man touch fire and not be burnt and he's talking about the strange woman he's talking about prostitutes he's talking about looking at the wrong woman and he says can a man touch bring fire into his bosom which is a reference to by the way to sex can a man bring fire and not be burnt by it no we learned that lesson when we were two years old i thought if you touch fire you get burnt now a controlled fire is a wonderful thing in marriage a controlled fire this fall when we have a bonfire and have the young people over and it's controlled and not burning down my woods it's a beautiful thing you got that you got you got your sweatshirt on you got the s'mores going the chocolate the hershey chocolate with the marshmallow i like to burn them quite a bit you stuff that on a graham cracker you put that together it's just it's and it's all done by a controlled fire controlled fires a fireplace sitting by a fireplace in your house it's relaxing it's peaceful there's nothing wrong with the fire it's just when it gets out of control there's nothing wrong with your passions it's just when they're put in the wrong place a fire a fire uncontrolled can destroy everything precious to you you do know that right if if your home catches something and you don't catch it it'll destroy everything precious to you and i'm saying that today that sexual sin and temptation that's not put under the control of the holy ghost will eventually destroy your entire life take your family away from i get a greater amen this morning it's not easy to talk about these things but i give the glory to god and the outcome to god you know what i want to see i want to see young men rise young husbands rise to the occasion you know i'd like to see it's no service if there's no repentance i'd like to see young people go home and take the trash off their phones i'd like to see fathers that are privately sitting repent to their wives and say hun i've got to confess something to you i'd like to see more confession i'll tell you if we have confession in bringing it on the table no matter what the outcome bring it on the table i'd love to see that it doesn't have to be in this service but i pray it would be because if we have that kind of confession we've got the devil on the run and victory is on the way that's what burns me is we have all these great services and wonder woman shout and dance and i i'm for every bit of it but listen if there's no substance to that if there's no repentance if there's no change in our lives it doesn't mean anything we need repentance to say god i'm wrong you're right set me on the right track lord so all this fourth dimension has moved us into a mindset and lifestyle hiding private worlds and heightened emphasis on sex excuse me older ones if if i just say that too blatantly i know 60 years ago we used the term family relations brother branham used that but they hear this term all the time this generation moves us into a mindset and lifestyle to hide in our private worlds and also to heighten the emphasis on sex unnatural and normal taking something that's a normal part of life a normal part of our bodies but making it everything our world is fashioned to hide sin and to exploit sexual lust and that's not good and the house begins to be invaded by the enemy if we open the doors to this can i get an amen even girls today privately looking at things that they shouldn't look at used to be more guys but girls are doing it i can't come into your home young girls and look at what you're doing look at what you're watching i can't do that some of you are too old for me to do that i wouldn't want to do that anyway because i don't want to be your holy ghost i'm not here to be your holy ghost i'm here to guide you and say that thing's going to destroy your life it's going to destroy your mind our house the last few months has been invaded by moths is that the way you say it moths moth a moth hundreds thousands of them coming out and they just are everywhere and we're asking in but the thing is they're they're breeding somewhere but they're breeding in secret they're hiding we don't know where they're breeding do we get in we have looked we have climbed places and we do not know where these moths are bringing but they're irritating but i've realized through this sermon this morning those little nasty things are doing this in private and when you can't find where they're privately breeding you're going to keep having a problem of them buzzing around your house that's what we deal with is buzzing buzzing around the house and so if you come into my house you're often going to see me going i did it in front of solomon the other night he thought i was praising him for something he did he said i was clapping for him i guess you don't get enough praise [Laughter] and and we can do that for a week and we still have them coming out in droves thousands of them if anybody can help us matter of fact me saying that we're going to get help when i talked about crab grass a few weeks ago i got response how to deal with my crab grass what mixture to put in i say praise the lord thank you for the help now i'm going to get all kinds of things how to deal with moths in the house tell you me and my wife we need all the help we can get we might have to move out the moth take over but it's all happening here's my point where nobody sees it's in the dark turn turn let's see where this starts second samuel 11 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged reba but david tarried still at jerusalem now we have this the whole household is of david's going to be affected the sword would never depart from his house family killing family members and this is where it all starts to preach another hour just on this and preachers have when kings are supposed to be engaging in battle they choose to let everybody else battle and they take a vacation and they stay home privately to relax i fought every year david was a warrior he knew how to fight he knew how to battle but the one one year he decided when it's time it's time to go it's like we don't know why he decided but he decided you guys you go this year i'm gonna relax i'm gonna take a little break from all this and it says to all of us friends that in the hour we live in especially every christian boy girl whoever you are we are never ever to take a break from this battle there are no vacations from this battle you say well i'm going on vacation to florida don't take a vacation from god don't take a vacation from the devil you'll probably fight hunter down there i'm taking a vacation from wearing anything modest i'm going to florida don't take a vacation from what you believe [Applause] there are no vacations to a christian every day we must be engaged in this battle and it's a battle of the mind and if we don't stay engaged in this battle the satan will take advantage of us can you say amen david decided for some reason i'm staying home this year i just need to relax i got me a new hot tub i've got my stuff set up here and i this is great i got a i've got a a a a deck out here built and i got a patio and i'm going out and so he's there all of the men are fighting all the other believers around the world are fighting in the battle and he decides to stay back with his computer so he's on his computer and nobody's around he sends his servants away nobody's around so he reads and then with all that in his mind all of a sudden now he's i'm just relaxing i'm just relaxing walks out on his new patio on his new deck this is nice this is composite this is the new stuff that'll last forever everybody's gone and he and so now he he looks over and bathsheba is taking a bath on the other deck in a moment's time he doesn't think about family he's not thinking of tamar he's not thinking of his position he's not thinking of the blessing of the lord he's not thinking of how good he has it he's not thinking that the lord said i'll fight your battle so when he went and fought battles and destroyed the enemy it really wasn't david's power it was god's power and he's ready in a moment's time to jeopardize all of that anointing in battle for his passions so now i don't have to tell the rest story you know how it is she's she's not she's scantily dressed if not we're not wearing anything and the prophet said she's just as guilty as david was she shouldn't have been out doing that takes her then she gets pregnant then he tries to hide it then he has her husband killed what was his name uriah and brother rem says when i get to the other side there's one fella i want to shake his hand it wasn't david i want to shake david's hand too he said i want to shake brother uriah's hand a gentile warrior who fought that was not fair what happened to him but if brother branham says he's gonna be on the other side i don't care if things happen in life that are unfair to us god's going to correct it all on the other side and i believe that man will be rewarded big time by another believer's mistake by another believer's passions out of control it affected uriah and said i'd like to shake his hand saying god bless you brother he was a hero in brother branham's eyes verse two that's only verse one but he took a break relaxed what time is it here and it came to pass in the evening tide you notice it wasn't in the morning or the afternoon it was in the dark it was in the evening if you don't think that says something about today that most and even the prophet referred to demon power coming out in the evenings creatures like spiders and all these things come out they thrive on darkness that's why i appreciate the song this morning because we're living in darkness but god has sent us the light can you say man i'm preaching light to you this morning we have deliverance from darkness but it's the evening that most of this dabbling on the computer takes place it's private it's in the evening evening time david rose office bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful and it was very beautiful to look upon it's amazing now all of a sudden everything gets trashed and then so you you know the story most preachers preach on that but now now in chapter 12 is where grace steps in god sends him a prophet he tells a story about the the little uh if you go to chapter 12 i won't read the whole thing but he gives them a parable the rich man and exceeding many flocks and herds he had a rich man verse three but the poor man had nothing saved one little you lamb which he had brought and nourished up and grew it up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank his own cup and laying his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spare to take of his own flock in his own herd to dress for the wafering man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb dressed it for the man that was come to him and david's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die the bread says he pronounced his own judgment so i'd like to make a comment about anger sometimes anger is innocent we get angry at things anger is an emotion within us it's it's not that you have anger that it's but it's what you do with your anger i know none of you have ever you hardly ever get angry but this anger to me is tied to condemnation and to the sexual sin that he did because in my short 35 years of pastoring in my short years i have watched some man that's bound by sexual addiction become more angry become more defensive when he's corrected he becomes more prideful and he becomes more critical of other people's sins i'm just telling you that's what i've learned the characteristics of anger and defensiveness and pride and being very critical of others pops up when someone's hiding sexual sin sometimes they become a legalist and they're requiring the law by everybody else it's because they're hiding something and they're the harshest at somebody else's sexual sin isn't that amazing so he's angry he's defensive he's and he's pride and he's being critical of others related to someone's sinning so this guy this guy took the other ewe lamb and he shouldn't have done that and so now david's pointing out this is wrong this is wrong for people to do and he's critical of others and these are the characteristics that come many times from sexual sin when the judgments come down is everybody still listening this morning i was just checking i'll be done here in just a minute but too many times when someone else sins they're the quickest to bring out the quotes when their wife makes a mistake they got all the quotes for it and they're going to hold them to the quotes and it's because there's condemnation already there in david and he's going to be exposed by the prophet and so now he comes down harsh the harshest judgment what he didn't realize is that judgment he gave was going to be his own judgment so now my text when all the judgments start coming down now he will be the all the judgments and i got to get to these final points because i got my time here he will be forgiven of god thanks be to god for the grace of god that he will be forgiven of this terrible sin how many is grateful for the grace of god david would be forgiven and his life would be spared but his house will have trouble for many years down the road there'll be a sword in his home there'll be trouble in his families there'll be sexual troubles pop up in his families and grace says though you will not die that's grace you will not die you know i think we should learn from this this morning saints of god that that there should be a sensitivity to sin sexual sin has consequences like no other and it should make us say lord cover me with your blood in this generation keep me pure why because it can have a devastating impact on those that i love in my family and my life here's what the prophet said about it when david did that evil thing his own judgment should have killed him when that prophet came up there he thought he was it was hid david thought it was hid when that prophet come up there and stood before him he said david is everything going right said everything's fine i'm fine i'm fine prophet said a lot of people say this and they're bound by habits and bound by addictions and if you're asking how you doing everything's good the first step is to start being honest don't say you're doing good when you're doing bad you're bound by something then say i know the lord can help me say positive things but don't you dare hide and say when the prophet nathan said david how you doing i'm fine i'm fine the kingdom's glorious praise be to god when the prophet came david's everything's going right said everything is fine david in his high robes and his big crown and he had job out there his great general and all the fighting going on he was keeping all the enemies off the bore lines and things somebody else was doing his battle for him everything was going right he had a baby by this bathsheba and the poor little uriah go out there and had joab to stand by his side until he withdrew from him and the boy died when the sun went down with the battle knife and his hand blood on his shield where he had stood for israel yet a proselyte he was a proselyte to the children he was he he was to their religion then when joab come back and told him that david uriah died david thought everything's all right now i've got his wife and everything will be all right got a baby but the baby took sick the baby started dying and he'd done everything he could to save that baby's life perhaps every doctor come no good finally the baby died they was afraid to tell david and the baby was dead and he died and then he thought everything was hid so he comforted bathsheba he had already taken her for his wife after all those other wives i wanted to stop there making him he's got all kinds of wives god's blessed them with all kinds of wives that's why i say having all those wives to be be fulfilled in in all the ways he lifts his passions all that's not good enough i want this woman that's on the computer you can't that's not a right mental mind that's thinking that's the devil that's entered in can i get an amen because brother branham says he says god he's taken for his he had already taken for his wife after all those wives now he wants bathsheba this old prophet old ball-headed fellow stomped in old nathan out of the wilderness sat down said david how's everything going said fine fine o prophet of god live forever hallelujah oh he was just he thought everything was fine he thought he could hide it but you can't hide from god he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's god that that holy spirit that's in the building this morning how many believe the holy spirit's in the building this morning it's in the buildings and knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you've done for jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god had revealed to that old that prophet he said david there's a rich man lived on the side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep oh he was very rich and a man lived on the side of the road was poor he had one lamb he treated it like a daughter he fed it out of the same spoon he fed with he ate with he slept with the lamb everything was just it was just a daughter like a daughter to him god had revealed and one day a visitor came so instead of the rich man taking one of his own sheep and making feasts with the visitor well instead of that he went over and took the poor man's lamb and by force took the lamb and slayed it and made a feast now that was david's now that was david's passions now notice he takes the story of the man taking the ulam that didn't belong to him and brother brahms.com that was david's passions because he's taking a wife that's not his in the name of his passions i'm king i can do it in the name of his pride in the name of his passions he had 500 wives when he's seen you i his wife instead of taking one of the 500 wives to ops and satisfy his passions he went took took this other man's wife then killed uriah when she became a mother david didn't know what he was doing why david was ready to pronounce judgment that's the way we are we can always oh boy i need another hour to preach we can always judge the other fellow but when it comes to us oh that's different stay right there we are professionals at finding the quotes for everybody else we are fruit inspectors and we are so good at inspecting everybody else's fruit from their lives but god didn't make us fruit inspectors he said you shall know them by their fruits but he didn't say you are my fruit inspectors he didn't say that and brother branham is right we always are so easy to judge someone else but we need to look in the mirror that's what david did and david not only said you know what that guy gets killed that's it and he by doing that he was the man he pronounced his own judgment i want to say to you this morning sometimes we pronounce our judgment and i thank god for the grace of god because when we pronounce it on ourselves because we do that i deserve to die i'm going to do this i'm going to quit doing this i'm going to i'm going to in my life i'm going to do this that's our own judgment but thank god for his grace his judgment is sufficient can you say amen his grace is sufficient his whatever he comes as a conclusion i'll take it even over my own judgment even what i think of myself and what i've concluded in myself i'll take god's any day david said the man will pay for his life that old prophet then eyes narrowed down said david sure you'll not die watch grace there go to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet saved david's life grace notice the the title of the sermon up there the message of grace and here he's talking about it the spirit struck the servant david's life grace surely you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house till it's thoroughly purged your heart for you are that rich man oh it was different then wasn't it i want you to notice what he said just go back just you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house till it's thoroughly purged your heart when i read that i said that's my life i'm going to end this now is there another let me read the rest of it i'm going to end this because i know what saved david when his own judgment said the man will die he'll he'll pay to the uttermost he'll pay for his life and the prophet said surely grace shall not die you'll not die david grace has saved you it was grace to david that saved him oh my if it hadn't been for grace where would we all be it's just it it's nothing complicated about it it's unmerited favor and i believe everyone under the sound of my voice i believe is under that grace and you should lift your hand and say i didn't deserve it grace is something you don't deserve but he gave me it anyhow he gave me it anyhow and he's he's he's he's saying there about david the sword's going to be in your house there's going to be sexual problems come up but you're i'm giving grace to you you deserve to die but i'm giving you your life you know what david i believe he was grateful you know friends i'm going to speak from my heart now just about 10 minutes there's a lot of troubles that can come in our life and some of them we can't ever correct if king david had a a word from god that said you're going to have trouble in certain areas in your house throughout generations then how do we get off with that we're going to have things happen that we won't be able to correct even when we ask god you say well i don't want to live with all those things well you created most of them don't blame someone else but there are certain things i learned from the scriptures that there's trouble sometimes and you reap what you sow but that doesn't mean god didn't give me his grace and so we shouldn't say but i thought his grace would just fix all of these things and sometimes he does but sometimes he doesn't but it's not our interpretation of god's grace give me this lord and give me that and seal it up over here and give me that give me correct this and it's all your problems you're wanting him to correct do this do this and sometimes god says here's here's my judgment i'm giving you grace and i'm leaving things in your life that should have been taken from you but i'm giving you those things by my grace but there's some other things that are going to always be with you how many knows when you get a wound you get a scar and the scar's there for life that works physically it works emotionally too but god gives us grace to heal our wounds though the scars are always there but i want to close this by saying that we shouldn't interpret to god what his grace should be we should be satisfied with what grace he gives us and if you you think well david's life was spared by the grace of god and i know david was very grateful that because he knew he was a dead man he should have died for what he did should have been taken out he should have been taken out of his position he should have died but if we take it spiritually now all that you've been through all that you've done all the mistakes that you've made and some of you even still paying for it a bit just by the fruit that's come from it and yet if we're talking about a spiritual life there's some reason you're here this morning and something in you has not been killed because god could have killed for the things you've done could have killed your spiritual life that you'd never want to say amen never want to dock in the door of the church never want to be in my own gospel preaching never have anything in here to say man or desire god or hunger for god he could have killed that in you because god gave that to you but let's lift our hands and say thank you lord it's still here his graces is still here so god that god gave him grace in that and i'm closing i promise you i'm closing i'm closing to say that he may not have fixed all the trouble that would come but he changed david he took david's anger he took away david's defensiveness and he took away his critical spirit because a few chapters later he's with his soldiers and shimayi comes up and starts to cuss at him and his soldiers though you can't just respect the king like that i'll take your head off right now let me add them david and dave said no no no god told him to do that did anybody notice the defensiveness is gone the anger is gone the critical spirit is gone and that was god's grace too he not only spared his life and his spiritual life because he still loved to go to the house of god he still had a passion for god he not only got rid of that excuse me nobody who kept that but he got rid of his anger a story there's stories that come later you can see david's been changed and it looks like in the bible he doesn't deal with things but it's not that he doesn't deal with things you could say that but it's that he has more grace in his heart and i will say to you when you've had a revelation of the grace that's been given to you it kills your criticalness of other people when grace floods your heart and you see what he's done you're not a legalistic critical person to criticize and be a fruit inspector for everybody else shimmy ice is cursing them you're not nothing just going at him joab says let me adam like a good deacon david said no he's a changed man he's lost his defenses he's lost his criticalness he's lost a lot of his anger it doesn't mean he probably don't get angry enough but towards someone else like that god softened him and so he lost some things but through it all he didn't lose some other things doesn't the song say that brother kenny i lost a lot of things but i never lost my hope i never lost my joy i never lost my praise [Applause] he fasted he sought god please save this child please lord and god come says and then he struck the child and they come and told him david besought the lord the child david fasted went in and lay all night god please kind of like with paul seeking god about his his problem that he had i think it was a blindness problem he saw god three times about it god did not answer god did not give him that and it was to keep him humble lest he should be exalted god allows some things in our life to keep us humble i'm not talking about spirits binding us god delivers from spirits but sometimes he leaves things in our lives to keep us humble sometimes he gives us children to keep us humble raya i love you i love to tell this story they're taking me to the airport and they're all little they hated when i go on a trip for a few weeks to preach somewhere and she's crying again they're in the car they dropped me off the airport said daddy daddy why do you have to go please don't know daddy please don't go i don't want you to go so i gotta go honey and so i get out i had she's still crying and she says mommy why does daddy have to leave us why did

and mom says honey they they like him to come and preach they like his preaching and they like his singing there's some people that still like my singing you know even gideon even though gideon's around there's a few left in this world i don't even get invited to kenny to sing at weddings this guy these guys get invited to sing at weddings i used to get all the ways i don't get any invitations to sing anymore my wife says her favorite singer used to be me and now it's gideon my wife you don't think i have complexes now she said amarillo daddy daddy clothes because they like him to sing and they like and emory goes well he ain't that good if you have pride just have kids they'll humble you this is my last scripture when he finds out that god did not answer his prayer and the child died and the elders of his house rose and went with him to raise up from the earth but he would not neither would he eat bread with him so while he's fasting he wouldn't even rise up to eat anything he fasted he was in he was seeking god about this baby i want this baby came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken to our voice now will he then how will he then decks himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that this certain servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said it's dead then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of lord and worshipped oh i don't know how to bring this last thought god i hope you can they can catch it you have that you know at that point he's willing in his attitude to say i'm thankful for the grace you've given me and i'm accepting i'm accepting the trouble and my heart being hurt you've taken this child i'm accepting the trouble but i'm embracing your grace you know what i'm going to do with the trouble now that you haven't answered my prayer you know what i'm going to do it's not this i quit going to that place to church quit hanging around all those message people i'm tired of this i'm finished it's not david it shows something's happened to him god made something happen to us because when he found out god didn't answer his prayer he washed himself he got anointed he put on the right music he changed the atmosphere in that home and he went to the house of god and he worships reminds me of another guy job job job i'm ending the sermon but you're getting baptized i'm ending the sermon on you the same fellow with the same character of christ in him after all of his family was taken from him you know what his response was i'm going to i'm going to wash myself and i'm going to worship god he just worshipped god we need something deep in our lives friends because we complain too much we fuss too much we try to figure things out to him why didn't god do that why didn't do god why didn't god do why didn't god and we all say it i'm not preaching to anybody in particular we all do it sometimes lord let me have this response that baby dying let me have this response he washed himself he got anointed and he said lord i'm going to your house and i'm going to shout and dance and because you know david danced i'm going to worship god more fervently than i ever have in my life nobody else shows up it didn't bother david we had 15 people here a couple wednesday nights ago 15 people i don't know everybody was on vacation or something didn't bother me a bit i preached like there was 2 000. and we need some davids to come to say i don't care what's going on in my life i'm putting in a full day's worship i'm giving my whole heart right now because why we don't deserve any of this thing that god has given us and if he gives us his grace i'm going to worship god for it friends i'm going to embrace his grace and i'm going to accept the trouble you might not hear some preachers preaching that but i'm going to preach it from this story we need to accept the trouble
