========================================

in the scripture this morning take this section of scripture and read it about our lord's resurrection and just before that and we trust the anointing will come this morning and bring us something that will be beneficial for everyone here and everyone listening and streaming we give glory to god for the things that he is doing and the things that he has done and that's why we come and worship because we have so much to be thankful for so many things that he has done for us and we appreciate his grace in our lives amen john chapter 19 and verse 20 28 after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst now there was a set vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for the sabbath day was a high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first remember there were three crosses they break the legs the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but when one of the soldiers with the spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water if you know the word and the study of the word that's where the bride came out that's where your part was we were in christ and he that saw it bear record and his record is true and he knoweth that the that he saith true that he might believe for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they that look on him whom they pierced chapter 20 chapter 20 if you skip with me chapter 20 over then when simon peter and the others begin to find the open tomb the empty tomb verse six will pick it up then come simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and see if the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head no not lying with the linen cloth but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulcher and he saw and believe for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead amen heavenly father thank you lord for this time to worship you and to share our hearts and lord when you came from the tomb 2000 years ago lord jesus we've celebrated as christians from that day forward it says in the bible they gathered upon the first day of the week we know the jews gathered on friday and then saturday for the sabbath but lord when we come to the great gospel the truth lord when you rose again the third day on the first day of the week then christians begin to celebrate that not only on easter but on every sunday lord we give that time to worship you for lord we don't have any victory this morning unless you come up the third day and rose again and lord the old hymn says you ask me how i know he lives it's because he lives within my heart the resurrection is more than just a story 2000 years ago to us but lord it's a living thing we know that you're alive and well because you're living and moving in our lives each day and you're causing us to rise as well thank you for your resurrection power this morning and we pray that you'll speak through these few words that i have and you minister to every life whatever place that they're at in their life wherever whatever past lord you're not afraid of the past no matter what it is because lord when you look at us you have our destiny in mind you have our future in mind and so lord when you speak to us today may all of us listen as if you had our future in mind and that the past be washed away lord jesus we commit this service to you i commit myself as a minister that you would anoint our words and we commit the service completely to you in the day of fellowship with our families and different ones wherever we should go we pray you'll bless that as well and bless the bride and the churches the christian churches around the world and christians who worship lord from a pure heart wherever they worship at i pray you'll receive their worship today and i pray there'll be a great great revival in the hearts of your people lord we commit the service to you laying everything else aside accept this attention to you and your word in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you may be seated i'd like to speak this morning on uh the subject of it was finished but he rose again it was finished but he rose again and um we're not finished with the uh message that we brought last sunday in fact we have some testimonies to share from that service and we'll get to that maybe another time but the lord just directed us and was nice blessed enough that god blessed me with the easter message this morning and i want to share that with you i trust not to be too long i know you have your family's fellowships and different things and meals and the ham is on and so we want to be mindful for all those things cooking but this is probably the most important time we spend not be not because i'm speaking but because the word of god everything else will pass away but the word will last forever amen and so now it was finished but he rose again and i could work that just maybe a little bit different so that you could understand it a bit more uh when jesus proclaimed it is finished uh there was there was some powerful words that he said and what he meant by that is that not that he was finished and i want to preach that to you it was finished but he was not finished can you say man something was finished he did a work but it was finished but he certainly wasn't finished and we're going to find that true today but those are powerful words because the sin question and the fall in the garden and all the things that most of you know about that took place and why jesus had to go to calvary that that the sin question had to be settled something had to be done uh that was trouble when we fell in the garden it brought trouble for all of us and you can't have worse trouble than sin sin was ingrained in us can you say amen every man born from that time in had sin in them can you say amen and god had to deal with that his own way and so when he said it is finished it meant that sin was finished god took care of the penalty for sin god paid the price for sin that you didn't have to pay the price of death he paid the price for sin it meant that it was finished that redemption price was completely paid and paid in full and that's why he could say that question of sin that has been completely finished and your victory in jesus christ has been purchased that you no longer have to work to pay back for your sins but he took care of that can i get an amen this morning that's why he could say it is finished is that sin question has been settled it is finished and you don't have to work to be saved he purchased your salvation and he says your salvation is finished if you'll believe in me hallelujah redemption price is paid and there's nothing you could add to it and that's why he could call it finished so what was finished was the problem of the great fall from the word of god bringing man to his lowest point of death and trouble and and that day he began to die but when he said it is finished but notice it was finished that work was finished and i could say a lot more about that that powerful phrase it is finished because the prophet even talked so much about it but what a powerful statement he made here as they gave him vinegar to drink and he gave up the ghost and he uttered those words it is finished what a powerful word but it was finished it was finished but he was not finished can you say amen you know and when jesus uttered those words if you didn't have a revelation standing there when he uttered the words it is finished we human beings we have a certain way about us that if something's finished it's finished it's over so the roman soldiers that were there the people that were watching everybody was listening to what he said remember he said several things but this is the final thing that he said when he gave up the ghost and so any of us would hear the words it's finished then his ministry's done he's done the romans were glad to see it finished because they had that he had to deal with this the jews were glad to see it finished to see him done because to us human beings when someone dies it's finished right when someone dies it's finished you can't get any more permanent than dying and so when they heard those words they probably soon assumed that he was finished but i'm here to tell you he was not finished he was just beginning something with his people what was finished is sin what was finished is your sin was laid on the cross he paid the price that part that problem was finished but he was going to rise again and what i want to get to this morning is that god has the power to finish problems in your life but if you've got resurrection power you're not finished the trouble is finished and you're going to rise again out of it i trust the lord can help me to bring it this morning but you see now when he gave up they thought he gave up the ghost they could see he was dead he took his last breath and then he himself said it is finished so the problem is over everything's done and not only is the problems over with this man he's done himself we'll get him in the grave well this this will be over this has been a struggle for three and a half years it's been attention to the jews it's been attention to the romans pilate didn't know what to do with him he was caught in between the jews and jesus and and this was just a fiasco it was a mess it was a political mess and so they're glad to see he's finished but the thing was friends he wasn't finished reminds me of a statement that was made uh it ain't over till it's over in jesus christ in the kingdom of god friends it ain't over till it's till god says it's over i hate to say this but then they got that term and then some newscaster in texas used that and he says it's not over to the fat lady sings there was some game that got really close and the next morning he wrote in the thing he says it's not over until the fat lady sings and that became a phrase i wonder what it means where did it come from it came from it's not over till it's over don't think that the game is over and and so it ain't and it said in the said in case you're wondering it ain't over to the fat lady sings uh is a phrase that means a person should not assume the outcome of a situation i'm still preaching to you it ain't over to the fat lady sings is a phrase that means a person should not assume the outcome of a situation until it reaches its end because the circumstances can change that's our gospel that's our large and you're saying man and i won't go on using the term lest i should offend people i mean you have to watch what you say today i would say that that's going to be part of the woke cancel culture is to cancel that statement because you offend some fat ladies but like maybe i might change it to the fat preacher this morning but i'm getting a point across to you that phrase me the person should not assume the outcome of a situation until i can say to you until god says it's over you can say it's over but it's not over until god says it's over and man in his pride say well that's done that's finished that's over you can even leave the message and leave christ and walk away from him and you say it's over for my life but i'll tell you if you're a son and daughter of god it's not over until it's over [Applause] his grip on your life and his pulse of your life is not over especially if you're seed of god you can go to the ends of the earth but you're not done unless god says you're done oh praise the lord i'm going to get excited this morning can you say man so it is finished but he is not finished the problem is finished but he was just getting started we think of death as being finished it's done but not in god even death is not done in god we prove that with the resurrection if quickening power is laying there it starts to rise no matter how dead anything is no matter how deep it is no matter how far in the grave it is no matter how how much mud it's under it's like the lily no matter how much mud is on top of that if there's life in that living lily it's going to come up anyway that's god's resurrection power you can't say it's over because if so there's something in there to rise then god's gonna cause it to rise hallelujah and so this applies to us too we how many know the bible says we are risen in christ we rise when we have the life of christ in us when we have a quickening power within us we raise as jesus wrote the bible actually says we were dead we were dead i'll read it to you in ephesians 2 if they have the scripture back there ephesians 2 1 says and you hath he quickened made alive you had the quickened ephesians 2 1 who were dead in trespasses and sins so spiritually you were dead and you can't get any more permanent than death you were dead you said no i was alive no you were dead you in christ hadn't come alive yet so and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin wherein in time past she walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and power of the air and the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had in our conversation with your manner of life in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ can you say amen by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ this is still happening in believers lives what happened in the tomb is still happening today and you can't get any more permanent than someone is dead to us humans you know we can have hope they can be sick they can have cancer they've even been on breathing machines to keep them alive i heard a guy the other day been six years and they kept him on it and he come back to life and he's living today so as long as there's breath there we as humans we say there's still hope we hold on to it and some people hope in christ for healing but some people just hope in medicine i hope the doctors some people get mad at the doctors what can you do what more can you be done i remember when we were in the hospital with my dad and we had to make decisions it was rough decisions we had to make last year and it was difficult but i know what my dad had told us about you know being too long on the breathing machines and stuff like that but we had god just gave us a real peace we've always had that peace but it's not the last time we'll see our dad but the nurses and doctors they want to do another search room we just said would he survive it and he said no he probably wouldn't and we just said to him listen we we we know that this is not the end for seeing our dad and we we feel we're going to make this decision and we're going to let him go because that's what he would have wanted and and and i hope i'm not saying too much for my family's sake here but but we did that but they come back later and says we have never seen such a rest and peace in a family usually they're mad at us they're getting angry and coarse people would they're emotional someone's dying their loved one and if there's no hope there death is a permanent thing but i'm telling you in this power of the resurrection a person can be dead and there's still hope that's the gospel that i preach that's the gospel that's the christ i serve can you say amen so we don't think like the world because we look at it in this quickening power that god has restored to us even in this end time god has restored his quickening power to us and so we you can't get much more permanent than someone is dead in our life without him you can have hope you can you know something's going to happen but we we tend to fear death because death is the biggie death is the permanent thing death means that's it it's permanent it's finished never get to see them again but not so in jesus christ somebody ought to shout praise the lord i've said enough already we ought to be shouting and thanking god can you say man we've heard this stuff so much all of our life we lose the reality of it but i'm here to proclaim to you again and echo to you again this morning that if you have life within you no matter how low that you go and no matter how much mud you get underneath no matter how much trouble you get can you say man you may look like everything is finished but it's not finished if you've got quickening power in you you're going to rise above it you've got a habit that you've had for 30 years and you can't but if you get the life of christ in you it's going to see a finish to that habit and new life in jesus christ he knows how to finish trouble but when the trouble's finished he's just begun in your life hallelujah so death comes to jesus body and but he's getting to ready to rise they didn't know that they said it's finished it's finished it's okay it's finished good it's done but you see they but when when jesus body was laying there and they said it's true it's finished jesus was just getting ready to rise hallelujah when you think something is finished and there's no hope for something i've watched this in my parents or i've watched this and this person and i've i've seen this for years it's finished it's never going to change there's no hope it's over it's over don't you dare ever say that don't you dare put somebody out there that's left us or left the truth or whatever don't you dare you don't have any right to say and put them in hell you don't have any right to do that because there's while there's breathing life wow there's grace and i'm still preaching grace here this morning i'm still preaching that the lamb there's still blood on the mercy seat can you say man i don't know when that will be over but listen it fires me a gospel i'm going to keep preaching like it's not older you know one of the reasons i know this is not over yet because i'm still here and if i'm still here in this body i know there's a seed to come back somewhere and come to this truth you don't have a right to write somebody off you don't have a right say it's done it's over he's crossed the line and some people i'll tell you it makes you wonder internally i look at it and think i think wow i said on judgment day unless that guy repents he's in a real bad spot on judgment day because he doesn't just have to respectfully leave christ he's standing as a voice to try to bring down the message of christ that's a that's a predicament but you know what i don't have a personal right to judge anybody because i've watched them borderline blaspheme but it wasn't over it wasn't over i got a child brother paul that's grew up in the church and they're gone and it's just but it's not over until it's over praise the lord brothers and sisters do you believe that this morning and they're laying there they're looking at the dead he said it's finished there's the dead body jesus body was dead there and they could confirm this is over this is done but he is just getting ready to rise and in our text i want you to notice something we have to pay attention to something here that is very important and that's why it's maybe a unique set of scriptures to read for easter sunday but this is part of the easter story and when we read in our text then that they gave permission got permission from the roman gender and all them and through the romans the romans are hired the roman soldiers are hired now or sent to finish these men off and the jews had a reason for doing it passover was coming everybody had their reasons and so if someone was still breathing you had to go finish them off and one of the ways they finished them off is to break their legs to break their bones that's how they finish that was that brought it and so so the romans are hired now and sent to go finish all three of these men off to fit to finish the job to make sure the job was finished we know he said it is finished but we're going to make sure that he's finished we're going to finish the job roman soldiers the the jews have asked and i've given you permission now you got to go make sure especially with jesus that you finished the job i wonder how many meetings in the demonic realm is having meetings about you and that comes up and says i got them so weak and so wondering where they're at and mentally messed up and all these other things but i want you to finish the job i want you to do something even greater i want you to break their bones i want to i want you to really really break them i wonder how many meetings are against you every week i want you to go finish them off they just barely believe in now but go the extra mile and break their bones and their legs and finish the job finish them off by breaking let me say to you in the name of the lord this morning you don't ever finish jesus off man can never finish jesus off or revealing of christ that's come under this message of the last days people ask what i think the message is the message is not a dress code the message it's part of all that but that's not what the message is the message of the hour for the last days is the greatest revealing of jesus christ that's ever hit planet earth that's why i love it with all my heart because it didn't reveal william branham to me it revealed jesus christ more to me that's what the message it's it's not psychology it's the resurrected jesus christ come back to life again and when that ministry went around the world and the dead were raised and there was seven truckloads of crutches and all these other things god just did that to show he's alive and expressing himself again not so that we could have a bunch of healing campaigns but that you would believe he's alive again and he came out of the tube and he's able to do anything and if a dead man can come out of the tomb what is the problem you got any issue how does that relate can you say man how does that balance what you're dealing with right now when there's a power to raise a dead body out of the tube i say there's nothing impossible to god you can't finish jesus off this message reveals the resurrected christ you can never finish it off you can't stop it it's not going to go away there's only one thing that's going away someday and that's me the bride we're going away but the truth stands men have bill gather has a song man has tried to squelch this church out he's tried to kill it through the dark ages maybe we can kill him all off grab every christian you can find let's just kill him kill him by the thousands millions we'll squelch this thing we'll get rid of the never been able to get rid of it here we are in the year 2021 and this gospel still lives this christ is still being preached around the world you're not going to get rid of this thing you can't finish off christ or stop it it's not going to go away unless you push it out of your life can you say man so now i want you to notice something here before i talk about them breaking the legs of these men i want you to notice where the scripture says here that the scripture might be fulfilled i want to make a note here about in the last few hours the last few hours of jesus life prophecies were being fulfilled i forget how many now but you know we had all those prophecies of when he was born virgin born and all those but then the last hours is when the prophecies accumulated bang bang bang bang wonder if that's happening again in the last few hours in the last bit of time before there's a rapture and it's tribulation sets in a lot of things are happening so that's why we need to be aware because these men we're not aware that they're walking up to a dead body says well we won't break his legs you know they're walking right in the prophecy it says not a single bone will be broken they look at that dead body say it's finished like you said it's over we're not going to break his bone because he's not breathing we took his pulse he's not breathing they think that they didn't break the bones because they thought he was dead but they didn't break the bones because jesus has a prophecy a word over his life and i don't care how many attempts they make to break his legs they would not be able to break one bone in that body [Applause] hallelujah doesn't that give us strength in our lives you see i want to get to across you today that there might be a lot of trouble in your life but satan is only allowed to go so far for a believer they're walking up saying he's dead he's not bringing us we're just going to leave those no and so now scriptures are being fulfilled prophecies are happening and then they beheld him and there was a prophecy about that they looked they pierced aside they did and there are acting of this word that's over jesus life these things are being fulfilled right up until even after he was dead prophecy is being fulfilled so don't underestimate how low you get in your life don't underestimate that god [Applause] is fulfilling his word in your life not too many amens to that but i'm here to tell you after jesus was dead he couldn't do nothing but after he was dead the word is still fulfilling things over his life it's interesting isn't it and brother paul can i share that about marcus from last sunday you say no if you want now i won't be offended so i struggled with last sunday's sermon and i struggled a lot and this week i get confirmations that it was it should have been said but i i had already struggled with it as a pastor i'm telling you it was a rough sermon to preach i did not want to preach it so brother paul comes in the office suddenly after the church you know i'm just i'm ready to go home and go to bed and just get away from everybody i hate to say that but sometimes you feel that way he comes in he says marcus said to us saturday night he said what do you think brother paul's going to preach on tomorrow and they say of course we don't know you know and he said i think he's going to talk about david being anointed by the prophet and saul and and then he mentioned david and goliath so out of all the scriptures in the bible i got up and read oh just those scriptures that wasn't a little kid thinking of david goliath out of the mouth of babes i say praise god what a confirmation but you see it's in those low times that we think god's not doing anything we don't know what he's doing we better trust the lord prophecy could be being fulfilled right there and i'm not talking about my life i'm talking about yours and i'm so dumb sometimes did not trust god to realize in those times of trials i need to hold steady trust the lord conduct myself with joy in the midst of my trials can you say man slap myself in the face that's a quote i've learned for years when am i going to learn to conduct myself with joy in the midst of my trials and one of the reasons that we should is because realize that god's got a word over our life and it doesn't change in the midst of our trials somebody say pray for it doesn't change and you could be walking right in his word and not realize it jesus is dead he's dead and there's still word hanging over his life oh praise the lord hallelujah and so you know uh they they went and broke the other guy's legs the two thieves and their bones were broke and they walk up to jesus to do the same thing but he was different he was different there was a prophecy on his life there was a word on his life and it held against them breaking his bones let me say the word is stronger in your life than what the enemy can do the covenant over your life that god made over your life is stronger the covenant is always stronger than what you're going through the word that hangs over your life is waiting to be fulfilled and it's stronger than what the enemy can do and so you look at all the things that they've done to make jesus ready and excuse me not make them ready but all they did to jesus i was speaking short in the youth meeting friday night with brother boaz and i mentioned it was good friday and they mistreated jesus but they just didn't mistreat jesus they tore his body you look at the things they did to that body tore his body to shreds started with 39 stripes that tore his flesh from his back he crushed a crown of thorns into his skull they pierced his side with a sword i want you to think of what damage and what kind of cruelty happened to that body they put nails in his feet in his hands he was slapped he was blindfolded tell us who hit you he was cursed at he was mistreated brings new meaning to the word and he mistreated because sometimes we can feel mistreated this vessel on earth was mistreated and not only that if you look at his body it was tore his body was tore to shreds just tore to shreds in every way and yet think about it there's a word or a prophecy that held all the damage they were doing to his body that held them only to a certain point of damage to that body because there was a limit by the word of god of how far they could go with him now with everybody else they could break the bones with everybody else they could do but in jesus body there was a limit to how far they could go is anybody listening to me this morning that's not for the world but that's for the elected of god i'm here to tell you there was a limit to how far they could go in the damage to that body tore his flesh it's been said that he died of a broken heart so his spirit was torn it's been said that he died as a man there the spirit left him in the garden so he went from the garden to the cross as a man crying out to the father can you say man there was no supernatural thing there that was just going to take over he had to go as a lamb because you can't kill god you couldn't put god on the cross you can't kill his spirit so he had to go as a man just trusting and believing and when he was in the garden he was a struggle of his will am i going to choose as i preached last sunday the choices we make sometimes we chew god choose god's choice sometimes it's our own choice and god lets us make our own choice sometime and brings us back around says that wasn't my choice when are you going to take my choice in the garden jesus had to make the biggest choice and i told the young people friday night he could have chose to stay on earth to get married to have a regular life to have a normal life he by freemore agency had jesus had the choice to do that because god doesn't override our choice he had to choose in the garden and that great battle with great sweat blood drops of sweat and here he makes that choice not my will but thine be done so that battle had to be won first but he goes from the garden then as a man believing and so there was no thing the bible says when he was in bible says when he was in the garden that the disciples were saying can't you get help here you know can't you can't you do something about it they're taking us away and all this and he says think not that i could call 12 legions of angels you see and they would deliver them and so now there's still that word there he would ask the father but he didn't ask the father to deliver him from that situation because that wouldn't be the father's will he could have exercised it could have called on something supernatural can you say that you see this is the deep christian life that god's calling believers to today it's not surface it's not a warm and fuzzy jesus it's not a judging jesus as well as far as god took your judgment at the cross can you say amen it's a convicting jesus but it's not a condemning jesus you got to make these distinctions today because people have created their own jesus the christian world as a whole has created their own jesus but you better read your bible and get all of jesus but he doesn't condem he convicts and that's a wonderful thing but it's not this warm fuzzy loving jesus that you see he he went through he went through the garden and there was a struggle his own will and he could have chose to say i want to have but he but he died to his own will and he made god's choice to it but he could have called that's my point he could have called 12 legions of angels but see now that that that was not what the will of god was and he had to make a choice to go as a lamb and it's been said that he went there without and so you know if he's not going to call on any help and he's going there as a man they had free reign to do what they wanted to to that body and thank god he let it happen because it was all somehow related to you what he took on that body was related to you and that's why he did it nobody likes pain jesus didn't like pain but everything related including the stripes on his back was purchased when we get a cold when we get covered the same atonement that i believe for when i get the flu is the same atonement we believe for covet i don't know why people think it's a different thing oh not getting too amens i say praise the lord brother josiah is here he had covert a couple weeks ago did his quarantine did everything he could but guess what i want to praise god brother brother brother copeland brother josiah and his wife have been healed of covet i've been healed of colon 80 of this congregation has been healed of covenant [Applause] so look what they did to that body the stripes were for you for your healing even even that pressure just crushed in the place that our greatest battle ever fought just crushed in stores just crushing into his his skull and i wonder i wonder if that was for you in your mind battles pierced his side nails in his head there was free reign to do what they could to that body and yet we have a real kernel of something that should make us rejoice here this morning whatever they plan to do there was a limit whatever you've been through or whatever you think you're going to go through if you're a son and daughter of god there's a limit satan is limited i'm ready to run around this room friends glory be to god hallelujah that those men could think they'd come there with their stick and think that they could i'm just going to finish him off like i did the other two men a few minutes ago and there was a word there that held over that body not the other bodies but that body that says no i'm not going to do that and they thought they did it because their own choice but it was god's choice not a single bone will be broken can you say amen i'm going to skip a bunch of this not only was it a prophecy but it was in line with the law because the lamb had to be spotless and guess what they couldn't break any bones of a lamb when they brought it in the old testament they they had to be spotless but they couldn't break any bones you can't bring a sacrifice like that so now this whole thing is exercised by the word of god because he's our lamb that is our lamb going to calvary and dying for us it's our lamb so if it's our lamb not a single bone can be broken in our sacrifice it's all the word can you say man proving this was our land the other the other guys had their bones broken but they were not the other guys weren't the lamb you listen to this now god knows who's his elect are that's right don't ever compare yourself with other people the reason they couldn't break his bones and broke the other ones is he was our lamb they was they weren't our lamb he was our lamb and when that lamb emerged in revelations 5 it says he was a bloody lamb as he had been slain he arrives takes the seven sealed book tears the seals off the book that's his action in the last days but he was a lamb as it had been slain tore up body tore up a lamb slain killed but guess what don't touch those bones hallelujah the friends with all the damage god said the bones are going to stay intact the structure will stay intact the substance that's there for that body i say it's gonna stay intact god will only allow what damage he will allow if there's a word over our lives can you say amen and like job when they came before and said who can we go get and god suggests job and says you can take everything from him but you can't touch his soul you can't touch his life you can't do it and so there was a part that was a limitation to the devil can you say man because he said that's my elected and you can go take his family take his goods everything you want but i've got you on limitations can you say amen his soul is going to still be intact i'll tell you friends i've been through things in my life you've been through things but i've been through things and i can tell you by the glory of god somehow i came through them but i may have lost a lot but my soul is still intact the holy ghost is still intact and like jesus bones we're still going to stay intact my soul is not going anywhere can you say amen hallelujah satan could take all those parts but he couldn't take job's soul the structure of who i am is still intact no matter what i go through i'm not believing this word because mommy and daddy forced it down my throat i i would have been gone a long time ago if i was believing it because of that it has to be something deeper in me now because after all i've been through and all the damage and all the things that's been said and done against me against the message whatever it is god's prophet my soul is still intact it still believes hallelujah satan you can take what you want but there's a certain limit to it the structure is going to stay intact brother paul's got to find a place to end because this is like the never-ending story this morning i'll do my best i'm excited may do a lot he has a lot he has done a lot to me people have done a lot to me done a lot to you but there's a part that can't be messed with i may go through the worst trial than i've ever been but the structure of who i am is still there it's intact it can't ever finish me off completely there's a word that says you can't ever finish him off you can't break the bones and finish him off can you say amen because there's a resurrection power in there i'm going to rise and if the victory belongs to jesus as the choir saying to us this morning if the victory how many believe the victory belongs to jesus if the victory belongs to jesus then the same victory belongs to you bible says we are crucified with christ we have risen with christ we're part of this thing can you say amen first corinthians 15 57 but thanks be to god first corinthians 15 57 if you haven't you can read it thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ we have the victory can you say man satan can't finish us off because we have the victory in jesus romans 6 and 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ therefore we are buried with him in baptism unto death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life there's an effect of the resurrection there's effect of the crucifixion it's a spiritual effect on our lives if you're not walking in newness of life you don't have the power of the resurrection yet but i'm telling you when you're baptized into the death of christ when you're raised up with him you will walk in newness of life and guess what you'll rise like jesus rose out of the tomb there's only one direction the bride is going and that's upward out of your habits out of your delivered can you say man notice where this bones shall be broken anybody saying well where's that prophecy at i tell you i looked it up this week and i i was surprised turn with me to if you would psalms 34. i was surprised to find where this prophecy laid that not a single bone will be broken i was surprised i thought there was a distinct thing talking just about jesus but as i just said it's not just about jesus it's about his body it's about us and if he rises we're rising blessed be his name and so psalms 34 verse 17 17-22 psalms 34 verse 17 the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles praise the lord the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit now stop right there leave that up so now we got the lord the people in trouble god delivering them now we've got the people with a broken heart god's saving them anybody catch a theme here it doesn't matter what you go through there's something there causing you to rise god's gonna deliver you god's gonna raise you god's going to save you next first many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all i'm hearing resurrection power and there's a there's a group that will go through afflictions and they have troubles we're just like other people that way but this is a different group because the lord will deliver us out of those troubles in other words it is finished but we're not finished our troubles don't finish us off with others troubles come and it finishes them off i'm finished i'm through i'm done but with resurrection power and then the next scripture says and he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken that's the prophecy and he's not just talking about jesus he's talking about all of us not a single bone here's that protection now you're looking at a broken heart broken spirit you look at troubles these are all the words that's mentioned here just hold that up there i'm not done with bones yet you look at the troubles the broken heart mind battles all the things that other human beings go through believers go through it too so you got all these things going on can i take my coat off can i tie my shoe this is crazy it keeps bothering me can we edit that part out so look at our experience as human beings now how many has ever had a broken heart you may not raise your hand well there's just like three people anyway but okay um how many has had troubles there's a little bit more people um mia says how many knows what it is to have a a locked up heart a heart that's hard we still have people in our congregation their hearts are locked locked up sealed tight they don't many of them don't even realize it i've been a pastor for a long time i can tell when people's hearts are locked up they're not free coming to church not free but i love you anyway god loves you anyway and if you stick with me through the holy ghost the trust will come and you your heart will be freed up i love you i'm glad you're here some of you got locked up targeted you had them for years people done you wrong preacher's done you wrong the message certain message circles have just been crazy i understand i've seen a lot of it but if it causes you to lock your heart or you've got walls and limitations that's where the devil's got you but there's a victory for you you can never make those excuses on the day of judgment you can't ever say well this happened and this preacher did this it ain't gonna work what god wants is your heart free so you got locked hearts you got all these conditions you got troubles and all these other things but it's all the spirit realm mostly when you talk about he keepeth or protects the bones if we're talking about our spiritual walk it's the same thing satan has limitations how far he can go with your mind and your spirit and just like with jesus they thought they could finish him off you can't finish off a believer either and no matter how many heart struggles we go through and our spirit is damaged by other people and our mind battles and our troubles if he says he's watching the bones there's something going to stay intact and it's never going to finish a believer off you know the bones are the strength that's the substance of the strength to be able to stand up amen so god says you might have a lot of this but i'm going to raise you up and guess what he's only going to go so far in your spirit the bones will never be broken i got people sitting here saying amen to me and i'm not going to point them out but i'll tell you they're veterans of this the things that they've been through the things that they've seen for them to sit here this morning and just purely be just enjoying christ the word of god is a miracle they're even sitting here it's a miracle hearts free worship free i say praise god when we get to this thing that's what it's all about that's what it's about what's the next verse esther evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous soul shall be desolate that means to be alone it means out in the field the land is definite it's barren so he that go back to the other one he that he evil shall slay the wicked and they shall hate the righteous so how many many's ever been hated before okay so that's another group what's going to happen to them they hate the righteous they're going to be desolate they're going to be left alone god probably will forsake them but here's our promise the next verse it says the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate i'm holding on to that promise this morning he's promised to hold my hand i'm holding on to this promise amen none of them you if you need to read that this week go back it's in psalms 34 he says no matter how far they go and hated the righteous you will never ever be completely lonely you will never be desolate and even when you think you're lonely and don't have many friends he says i will be with you even in you to the end you'll never be lonely because you have him with you he says i'll never leave thee or forsake thing your lord will never leave you or forsake you you're never going to be desolate so i see in these scriptures so many wonderful things about the resurrection because troubles broken hearts hearts that are messed up those that are being crucified as the words being crucified all these scenarios but there's a group in the middle of this that's going to rise above it the bones will stay intact i'd like to put that in the face of the devil today do you you've done so much satan if you're listening you've done so much to us but not a single bone has been broken i'm still here [Applause] proverbs 24 16 one one more scripture i think proverbs 24 16. look at this one for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief so this is his troubles this is when you fall and my dad used to like the joe palucca bag it was one of those you know balloon things you blow up he had one as a kid and then i think last year they found some for emmaus and uh israel and that's when you take that thing i did it as a kid give that the hardest thing just go weebles wobble but they don't fall down joe paluca you know just punch that thing just all the way to the floor and it pops back up the kid hit him boom thing goes down way down pops back up that's a believer and notice there's a difference there's two groups in psalms 34 there's two groups there's two groups here there was jesus legs and there was the thieves legs their bones got broken jesus bones didn't get broken amen here here's here's a man falling falling to mischief the wicked are falling here's a just man he's falling but resurrection power makes him rise seven times satan hauls off dude boy this feels good i'm tired today satan hauls off and gives you a big a big one and you may lay here this long i don't know but if you got resurrection power you back up again not a single bonus poker hey devil you hit me but not a single bone has been broken amen takes his punches takes his punches seven times the just man will fall somebody's ever fallen before made mistakes that's that's not the thing it says what's in you you're still kicking you're still getting up you're coming back again just been rises again seven times amen and then the devil says ah he's up again other than brother donnie describes living a believer's life so filled with the spirit that when a believer gets up in the morning the whole dimensions of hell is really upset they're going oh he's up again that's not just the story that's the way we want to live as believers the satan's kingdom is always slapping us around how about we get to the place that they actually get nervous when we get up in the morning devils get nervous they're not afraid of biden they're not afraid of trump they have no concern about that it's when a believer won't give up can you say amen it's what a believer stands and says i still believe in the word of god i believe my children will be saved i believe they'll be filled with the holy ghost i believe i'll be healed of this covenant i believe that i'm going to walk as a christian should walk i believe i'm going to come out of this habit that i have i believe that god's going to help me make the right choices i believe i'm going to stop making my own choices and choose god i believe in this thing and the devil goes oh she's up again lord i've got to deal with this the entire week again and we say praise god that's the way that it should be [Applause] i may get to a low time but i'm coming out of any tombs that satan puts me in i'm coming out of any tomb that he puts me because jesus came out of the tomb i'm coming out of the tomb you guys got that picture jesus came out of the tomb and guess what any tomb that i go in i'm coming out of as well i had to show that picture because the picture's worth a thousand words that's my sermon to you this morning because heroes i rise because he came out of the tomb i came out of the tomb looks like i'm running isn't it james is there jeannie's there sister becky they always taking pictures like she is i'm coming out of that place feeling privileged to be they say in the very place that jesus come out of there and guess what i can testify he wasn't there he's not in the tomb [Applause] he always rises can you say amen blessed be his name that's when we can say if the victory belongs to jesus then the victory belongs to us this morning it may be finished but the bride is not finished it may be over your trouble will be over someday but there's no end to true believers they have eternal life can you say amen that's why i can say god has given us the victory oh god has given us this victory by his word and by the power of his might oh god has given us the victory of g god has given us the victory oh god has given us the victory [Music] oh god has given us love let's worship the lord now oh [Music] god [Music] oh god has given us the victory yes he has god has given us the victory by the word i saw the lightness [Music] is victory where my god has given us [Music] [Music] this morning what else we got there's something else god has given us truth by the word overwhelming joy has given us overwhelming joy overwhelming joy all around amen amen brother way you would be crazy with me um this is resurrection sunday i know you do it for me just touch my back then we're going to do a victory lap this morning [Music] not to show off but i just want to do something safe i love this resurrection amen anybody wants to go with me but i know you're crazy enough to do it oh god has given us the victory i know god has given us the victory is oh victory oh god has given us yeah god has given up through that overwhelming joy overwhelming joy oh god has given us overwhelming joy oh god has given us an overwhelming job by the word i saw the light by the power of his mind has given us i will not come down [Music] i will not come is if see there's a scripture that says jesus said when you're persecuted you know after sunday i have to give a little victory lap before we go because i seen the victory that came out of that service so i just have to i just have to express myself say god i'm in love with you i love your word you're a mighty god but jesus said when they persecute you they did the same to the prophets okay and if if they're doing it to you you know whose team you're on so he said in that hour when they do that rejoice and leap for joy so how many people christians do you see leaping for joy that much when they get persecuted not very many so today is an exception i just want to say for the victory last sunday for the victory of calvary for the victory of the resurrection for the victory i'm not a perfect guy by any means but i'll tell you i got something down in me that the devil can't touch can you say man and i know you do too so i'm leaping for joy can you say man hallelujah i will [Music] i will not come down ground [Music] [Music] oh yeah he's promised to hold my head i'm gonna let you go here in a minute [Music] [Music] promised [Music] never let my feet [Music] one by one let's give him a hang type of phrase resurrected christ hallelujah father we thank you lord for the power of god that's in the cross and the power of god in your resurrection this morning may every heart lord examine the things that's been said and i pray if i preach the truth this morning that there be signs follow lord not that we ask the sign we don't follow signs but you said these signs shall follow them that believe may those that are sick be healed those that are homesick lord i pray that you'll touch them in their sickness and home raise them up lord by this power i pray and god those who are discouraged those that have their hearts locked up lord i pray they find a victory in you lord victory in jesus we commit the service to you and we pray you'll bless each heart that's heard lord this morning as we commit ourselves to you in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen god bless you we're going to dismiss those who want to go i'm going to have my
