========================================

our text this morning will be from philippians chapter 4 and it says in the king james be careful for nothing i like the english standard version it says do not be anxious about anything that's pretty all-encompassing don't be anxious about anything and tell you what now i think this is even more applicable in the time that we live in we live in an information age we have at our fingertips we know more than any other age did about things that are beyond our control there's things that we can worry about that nobody else would have known they could worry about them but because we've got all the notifications coming up i was in mcdonald's yesterday two days ago with my daughter and there's this man waiting because there's fear of people working at mcdonald's or any fast food restaurants nowadays he's chatty he's talking on the phone about something with somebody else about the russian potential invasion of ukraine since when are people on downtown lima concerned about the russians invading ukraine but that that's what that was the conversation going on and he wasn't a russian studies student i don't think um but you know we know more than any other age has had of what we could be worried about that paul says don't be anxious about anything instead in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto god there's nothing too big that god says you really should be worrying about and on the other side there's nothing too small that god says we shouldn't be able to pray about and if we do that we take those things the peace of god which surpasses all understanding and that it passes the the ability of our understanding to fathom how god's peace can work how we can a lot of times when we pray when we're in the midst of a trial god doesn't take the trial away from us just like that we pray for that but you sometimes he does but usually not but the miracle the miraculous thing is even when he doesn't change the trial he changes us so that even in the midst of the trial where nothing has really changed except our heart that we're able to keep on going and that's that that piece of god that passes all understanding how can you in this situation still have peace because my god's in me that's the answer and this peace of god that's beyond our comprehension but it will the king james says keep our hearts the english standard guard our hearts in other words it will garrison our hearts it'll fortify our hearts that peace it's our fortress behind which we can hide we we we we can hide behind the peace of god it'll guard our hearts and our minds in christ jesus so we just asked the lord to bless his word this morning father i just pray that you would be with us today lord and as we talk about cares concerns worries so we all have things that terrible things happen in life i was listening to the prayer requests today and just oh my just so such heart-rending things but lord i just pray that you still say even in all those things to take them all to you in prayer that you can we can have your peace even even in those things lord i pray you'll be with each one in jesus name amen there's a story told about a businessman who always seemed to find something to worry about and of course he could worry about this business because you're responsible for a lot of things as a businessman but of course there are other things he could worry about and he did he worried about his wife he could worry about his children if your children are married you can worry about your children's spouses you can worry about your grandchildren he had pets you can worry about your pet you know you can actually get health insurance policies on your pets nowadays you can you can get life insurance policies offer for your pets nowadays to cover all uh end of life expenses you can people worry about that there's a market um manipulating people's worries about their pets this businessman had those kinds of worries he could worry about his health his car his house his plants if he's retired he'll probably start worrying more and more about his neighbors or the neighborhood you can worry about criminals what's going on out when your vehicle is unoccupied worry about the weather there's a storm coming up this weekend this is this week wednesday thursday watching for you could be worrying about that i've got a teacher who watches the weather in china because in about two weeks time that's the weather we're gonna have here she and she's oftentimes dead on but we can worry about all these things and he had so many worries he had a hard time keeping track of them all which became another worry so he decided to grab an excel spreadsheet and he started tracking his worries and he was able to then to uh to categorize them and classify them into his worry chart he found that 40 of the things that he worried about never happened 40 of the things we can could worry about never happen we imagine the worst case scenarios they don't come to pass another 30 percent of the things he was worrying about were about things that had already happened and that he could do absolutely nothing about yet that's still something that hey been there done that you just maul over what if i had chosen something different what if i had done this differently and but you can't do it differently it just is just kind of completely draining your emotional battery and then another 12 were about people's criticisms of them or maybe it was what he thought people's criticisms were of him when maybe they weren't criticizing him at all been there done that as well sometimes we think people are thinking about this and they're actually not thinking about us at all that happens too then another 10 were just minor health concerns and if we add that up that's 92 of the things he really has very little control about that aren't that important or just eight percent of the worries that he had were legitimate concerns in the sense that they were something he could do about of those eight four percent or half of those they were important but he had little or no ability to really change the situation or impact the situation at all so you could worry about it but it would absolutely do no good because you can't change that person's life anyway they're just four percent left these are important concerns and i have a strong potential to impact them that's where you want to focus your attention but there are 96 of his worries or distracting him from the four percent so you can actually do something about i think there's a lesson for us in there paul's encouragement not to worry it's more applicable like we said i know of now with the information agent notifications i know of one one elderly gentleman who had a special app on his phone for real um let him know if there's an earthquake any place in the world so he would be ready in case california or the big one was coming it would would go off they have the earthquake sound there this this hip and he would know it didn't help his heart condition didn't help his nervous condition didn't help his wife's nervous condition but he would know there was an earthquake somewhere in the world but this is an all-inclusive command that paul gives be anxious for nothing and the devil's rigging our game with every single turn the notifications off he's rigging the game so that we can always have something to worry about but um his command touches every area of our lives natural things spiritual things our health relationship finances ourselves our parents our spouse everything the past the present the future everything and as we talk about things that could weigh us down and concern us today i wanna i wanna i mean for us to take seriously what paul says not to be anxious about anything without at the same time minimizing or diminishing the importance of any of the things that can happen in our lives because bad things happen in our lives and we would be very calloused if we had no feel for it god's not asking us to go forth and say everything's good in life nothing bad's happening i'm just going to keep on going that's not we're not we're not presenting a glib gospel jesus himself went through life he could see things he was moved with compassion his heart would be groaning as he saw things he was moved to tears he wept god gave us those emotions and we will feel with those emotions so we're not we're not asked to live an unfeeling life but we don't want our emotions to control us because when that happens we worry it said that worry is like a rocking chair because it takes you back and forth but it gets you absolutely nowhere tries to make you as comfortable as possible just staying right there staying in the rocking chair and do nothing about any situations just going back and forth that's what worry does it's like freeze tag you're you're frozen and you can't do a single thing about it well what is worry we could define worry as uh feeling uneasy or concerned about something to be troubled that's our our dictionary definition i've just kind of thought about it lately as i've noticed how the devil uses negativity in my own mind and i kind of developed my own little definition here so this is not the dictionary definition it's very free to be criticized but worry i call it the the action of our imagination when it's directed by negativity when you get those negative thoughts and then we just let our imagination go wild with them and run with them that's worry that's why i kind of feel it and i was thinking about doing an experiment here and a demonstration in church but there's so much room for after the picture would do just as well but think about it this glass of water is like like our minds and this one little negative thought that's that ink that can be dropped in there now if you just leave it alone that ink if it's a cold glass of water it will just settle right down to the bottom and you would be able if you had one of those things you have at the banquet you could put up your glass beneath it you could press the button and the water goes out the bottom right and you would be able to drain that naked that that blue ink out but when we get a negative thought the first thing that we're tempted to do it comes into our minds and we can't really control very well the thing the devil has the right to throw thoughts at us we can't be condemned for that but what do we do with them that that thought that that drop of black or or blue ink comes into our minds what we tend to do is we get to take our stirring stick we just get all stirred up about it you know what before the few seconds time that black ink is everywhere in that water if you you wouldn't be able to drain it if you tried it's not going to happen and that's what happens when that negative thought comes to our mind and then we give it a second thought the third thought and then we start getting ourselves stirred up and before long you're mad about things that have never happened you're mad and the situation hasn't hasn't happened yet but you know what your mother or father-in-law would say about it and then you would say this to that then you would just and you were all having this argument in your mind you're having hard feelings about something that has never happened and probably will never happen but that is what we do when we let our imagination be guided by the negative that's what it is and i can remember several years back i went to a teacher's convention it's been a really tough school year and this i go to this teacher's convention i i even forget what the title of it was but it was one of those things with yeah there's nothing really else interesting at this time period this i'll go to this session and i hope it's not going to be just another chapel message and i get in there and sound like yeah it's gonna be another chapel message but i listened and it was and this was a i i was like four or five years ago and it has stuck with me and the text to the uh this superintendent was but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself and what spoke to me in that session so much it was so eye-opening to me as i had let in the course of that school year so many negative thoughts into my mind stir up about dwell on them try to prevent things and all that and it had completely poisoned my spirit i couldn't be optimistic about anything i been dragging everybody down around me negative thinking defiles us it's a poison and if you start recognizing this this thought it's in my mind but i don't want to go down this way stop you can't you can't stop it it breaks a habit because sometimes we do feel sorry for ourselves and we start stirring that that stirring our emotional our with with that with that stirring stick we just do it everything goes around because we feel like i should be able to this isn't right but and we do that we indulge ourselves to our own detriment so when we have those negative thoughts come in we just go in with the next scripture that paul had in philippians what should we think about finally brothers whatever is true that actually is the devil gets our imagination going on things that might be but probably never will be that means it's not true we want to have our we want to base our thinking in god's reality so if it's true if it's honorable if it's just if it's pure how often in our thinking when we're stirred up do we impute to people bad motives maybe they are moved by bad moods maybe they are but sometimes maybe they aren't maybe this isn't an evil genius that we're up against maybe it's just another human being who's being motivated by a demon or we're right behind there fighting a battle of flesh and blood we should have a filter over our thoughts whatever is pure lovely commendable and then if if there's any excellence or virtue things worthy of praise think on those things because you've got to get the that poison out of our minds and replace it with something else sometimes if then if we've gotten straight up just empty your empty your mind of all those things do a mind just empty it out and fill up with god's thoughts again we we need that because you know what if we don't replace it we just kind of stir stir up our our imagination up with all the negativity what's the result worry is going to get us to die a thousand deaths by crossing bridges before we get to him think oh man this has happened if this happens i'll never be able to deal with this situation we're imagining how we'll deal with a situation that is not here yet we just think how it's going to be and we'll cross bridges before we get to him die multiple times go through the anxiety of things we might not ever actually have to come up against brother branham talks about this in different prayer lines i like like this when he's speaking to her sister how do you do sister you're the type of person once believing you believe kind of hard for you to see it but you also do a lot of worrying about things crossing bridges before you get to them build castles that never come to pass because that's your nature some of us are built that way but if you'll believe me as god's prophet you do all right the diabetes will leave you you can go home and be well can you believe that go ahead you have believed you can receive but she's got to live in the here and now in god's reality with god's promise instead of crossing some bridge that she may never even get to another message mr brother bands talking to somebody you're suffering with an extreme nervous condition you're very nervous it's a mental nervous somewhere else it talks about the person's personality you're the deep thinking kind says you're weary crossing bridges before you get to it always counting something that never happens stop doing it now if he says stop doing it we're able to stop doing it we're able to he wouldn't god wouldn't tell us do something that we're that's not in our power to do and yes we if we might be triggered by certain things but we look we can by god's grace we can learn to recognize it and stop going down that path and we'll be so much happier for it your family will be so much happier for it everybody in the body of christ will benefit because of it we can turn our bibles to matthew chapter six i don't have this on the uh on the uh slide but sometimes it's good to remember we bring our bibles to church sometimes to open them and look in the scriptures too matthew chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 25. and this is in the middle of jesus's sermon on the mount and i've been we've been teaching about the sermon on the mount a little bit in my bible classes at school and i just kind of is kind of getting into thinking about it and there are so many people who are following jesus's ministry especially at the beginning who had who were following with a particular expectation of where it was going to lead that this this is a person even john the baptist was thinking maybe he's going to thoroughly purge the floor get the romans out here there's a certain expectation um and people are this is one of jesus's perhaps early sermons we don't know exactly and people are listening what's he going to do with the the power of the people that are following him and they're expecting him to start building an earthly kingdom but jesus disappoints their expectations because he's not going to be looking at the kingdom around them he's going to be pointing to the kingdom of god that's within them and that's what um that's what this is kind of going to be pointing at in matthew 6 25 starting here jesus is going to be speaking about anxieties and cares it says therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body of enraiment hold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to your stature i think that verse just kind of illustrates worry changes nothing we can think think think i want to be as tall as somebody else i want to have the i want to have the build of somebody else i could say i wish my i wish my arms were as big as brother kyle i could think think think it's not going to happen it's not going to happen worry about that it's not going to i could do other things that might help me with that but worry won't so worry is not going to change anything in fact our worrying leaves little room or no room for the lord to provide look at uh you talked about that in verse 26 in verse 28 why do you think fought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin by worrying they have absolutely no uh by worrying we're removing god from our situation and i just want to i think compare worrying here we've got the picture of jesus here with the rich young ruler which is not from the sermon on the mount but later in jesus ministry this rich young ruler comes and approaches him and if you look at the picture there are lots of cares worries and concerns you can look at the the man you can see the the the the concern and the care in his face the anxiety that he's probably carrying you can look at the suffering there on the other side of the screen the the woman in black holding the uh caring for the uh i think that's lazarus they're at the door they're outside the rich man's gate that jesus told the story about there's lots of care here lots of things to worry about lots of lots of bad things in the world that we can that can affect us a worry it's like a pair of scissors and what the scissors do here the negative thoughts create a picture in our minds and worry snips christ out of the picture bit by bit and by worrying we get a picture like this there's no christ in this picture anymore there's no christ here who's able to change the the concerned young man's heart there's no christ here who's able to to touch and heal the person they're behind him all you get is a very very dark picture a man with concerns it's in this picture there is hopelessness there's angst there's fear because worries that parishes go snip snip snip snip taking christ completely out of our thoughts taking the very greatest help that we have so when you feel those worrying thoughts come put the scissors away put them away because yes we're going to get bad things to happen in their lives bad thing people are very very bad difficult things they will concern us that will weigh us down that's that's normal that is that's that's part of life but the devil wants to get christ out of our picture and when he does that we have nothing to keep our worry to keep our cares and concerns in proportion because christ yeah christ is great christ is the greater than any giant the devil can throw at us he's huge the devil can throw his his worst thing at us and next to god in this word the devil's giants a dwarf but if the devil can get by by worry to snip snip snip christ out of the picture we've lost our bases of comparison and the devil's bad guy is the worst bad guy there is we're all going to be running for cover because he's cut out christ from our own thoughts then the end of matthew chapter 6 he says take no thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink with all shall we be clothed my wife likes to remind me of that when i ask what's for supper tonight we shouldn't be thinking about that shall say for after all these things to the gentiles seek verse 32 then verse 33 says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you if you think about how many what kind of things do we fill our minds with in the sermon on the mountain jesus is trying to reorient our thinking away from the world right here this kingdom and this day we've got the jews and the romans and here we've got the kingdom got democrats and republicans neither one of them are building god's kingdom but we might very well be listening to all those things that are getting us worked up about those kingdoms but the kingdom that god's building he wants rebuilding is within us his holy spirit within us and if we're having our energy drained by everything else around us that kingdom of god within us just might be hungry the holy spirit might be wanting some more food some nutrients himself worry has no value in fact brother branham says he's talking again this is a prayer line people are coming to him in the prayer line because they have needs he's not diminishing the needs he says now go believing go rejoicing be happy now look lady if god almighty can reveal your life you before this audience he certainly if he knows what was he'll know what will be is that right now don't worry he says don't if he says don't worry we should be able to do that it's not easy but we can't stop that worry hasn't got one bit of value to it at all worry doesn't have one bit of value to it at all just what would worry do any good but faith does do good so have faith then the message unbelief doesn't hinder god he says so if you were going to be shot in the morning at sunrise it's a pretty bad situation you're sketching out it wouldn't help you any to worry about it not a bit i i think if you would be shot in the morning at sunrise you would they would give you a nice catered meal that you would you could order you have a nice good meal as your last meal but if you're consumed by worry you wouldn't even be able to enjoy that worry is no good at all to us it only makes everything worse you can't do that it's no good to do it but what could faith do for you if you were going to be shot in the morning it can deliver me it's done it many times all the value there is is in faith believing god's word taking god at his word worry saps our energy why because then we're always living in the future filled with worst case scenarios and um like i said we've got uh that's something that a lot of us struggle with and this last year was doing some i was at the garage sale and i found this book it's called the worst case scenario survival handbook i thought this is great for anybody who's going to be worrying about things because it's got stuff how do i like if you were going to be somebody's be worried if someone's chasing me on on this roof somewhere how could i escape there's this chapter how to jump from a building into a dumpster this one had to jump onto a moving train it's got you covered it's got you if you could but that's what worry does it imagines all the worst things that could happen to you and that's and you're just fighting finding all these bad guys off all night long maybe never coming wasn't due to us anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down when we're looking at all the bad things that could happen and responding to them stirring up those thoughts it's going to weigh us down but a good word makes you glad and the bible is full of those good words that's why we say think upon those things that are true most of our worries are not true because they're not based in reality if it's honorable if it's a good report if it's commendable if it's pure think on those things a good word will make your heart glad and it might feel very mechanical at first you got this worrying thought come in there and put it out but put something else in its place it might feel very mechanical at first but keep on doing it because you're you're building new neural pathways new ways to be habitually be thinking it's going to be mechanical at first but feed on the right thing and it will change it be anxious for nothing be prayerful about everything there are two days a week when we definitely shouldn't worry yesterday because we can't do anything about it and we shouldn't worry about tomorrow either because it's not here what worry does it removes us from the present and the only time that we have to do anything is the present where it puts us either in the past or in the future neither place we actually are where he separates us from the present and while we're busy thinking about what might be happening somewhere else or some other time we miss out on the things happening right around us and i could remember a time in my life i was in i was doing my senior year of college in moscow and i was thinking yeah you could do all kinds of neat things there and we did but a lot of my time was consumed with worrying what am i going to do when i get back home could i be done with college what am i going to do what kind of work am i going to do that really took up a lot of my time and energy and i've got this letter my dad wrote me and i've had it here i guess it's been in my bible for like probably my goodness 16 17 years and he says don't spend too much time worrying about what you do when you get back it'll just sap your strength and faith and distract you from enjoying full of the opportunities of the moment from the lord that's what worry does it removes us from the all the things that are happening right around us that god is doing for us now we think god's not with us but god promised i'll never leave you or forsake you so if the god the devil's putting thoughts your mind god's not what god was with me yesterday he won't be with me tomorrow but the bible says he's with you right now ask the lord god please send me some little reminder that you're with me and if you ask for that be ready to be ready to find a little reminder as little as a text message from somebody as little as a an email as little as something as a card in the mail because those are reminders not not from sister so-and-so or brother or someone who sent that that's god showing that he's with you and god is with us but worry tries to remove god out of the picture and get us to live in a place that isn't even here yet i like the song that uh gideon sang when he called me up and his strength is perfect when our strength is is is gone i've been uh i've picked up a book i'd read some years back and i'm rereading it it's by a norwegian pastor named ol hallisby and he was a he lived from 1879 to 1961 he protested the nazis spent several years in a concentration camp um did survive the war he wrote a book on prayer and his approach to prayer captures a certain paradox that our prayer life is at its strongest when we are most conscious of our helplessness he says i never grow weary of emphasizing our helplessness for it is the decisive factor not only in our prayer life in our whole relationship to god as long as we're conscious of our helplessness then we'll expect nothing of ourselves and therefore bring all of our difficulties and hindrances to god and prayer when we feel helpless we just see all the difficult the bad things around us we can that that's the prime time to worry i can do nothing everything bad's happening around me but and that he says another quote he says our prayer our helplessness becomes a new factor in our prayer life he says before our helplessness was the storm center of our prayer life it would either drive us to supplicatory cries of distress or it would stop our mouths so effectively that we could not find a single word with which to give utterance to our needs and the latter is often what happens when we feel so helpless that we can't even pray we say oh the situation's so bad all i can do is pray and we act like all we can do is pray that's the that's the last thing left in the toolbox it's not going to work anyway it's all we can do so let's just pray guys because we're getting ready to throw the white that's what it sounds like it's not like it's the hail mary right there's little chance of working but we do it anyway but that's completely reversed helplessness is the place it's perfect strength by perfect weakness old testament science out of weakness they were made strong god wants to get us to a place where we realize our weakness so then we can enjoy his strength that's the goal he never it's so good to emphasize our help helplessness is not a bad thing that's where god wants us to be very similar to what um brother brandon says in this message uh let his life story preach from here in toledo it says as that's the way it is as long as you're talking about fighting your own battles if someone talks about you and you talk back about them god can't fight your battle then because you're fighting it yourself but if you're helpless and you put your hands up then god didn't come on the scene that let loose let him do it just commit it to him the greatest weapon that i know of for a christian today is a committal to god that's the greatest weapon but it is so hard to let those needs come out of our hands oh lord i'll take care of lord please i'll do my best with a god god doesn't want us to do our best with our problems he wants us to give her problems to him because our best is never good enough for our problems our greatest strength our greatest weapon is a committal to god when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and god will take care of it the greatest weapon that i know of bears repeating of a christian today is committal to god when you can't do anything about it commit it to him don't worry about it commit it to him and god will take care of it and you know what there's always this thing there things sound great in theory but how does it go in in practice and i just want to remind you you know as you as as as your kids get older it's very you start coming to the i start coming to the realization that i can do less and less to to to change them at a certain when they're when they're little guys and gals you like to think you have a bit they still have the deck stacked in their hands and restaurants at the grocery store but other places you can do a lot to of cour you have control as they get older and older you don't have that lord i where we're going to go next lord we i need you lord and there's this theory in practice how do we go from one to the other but i was thinking about this you know what brother branham had a family too just kind of get some old uh pictures of him you know he had he was raising kids he was raising grant he didn't he didn't see his grandkids or did he i think he did yeah he had uh he was a grandpa he was a dad of little guys his dad of teenagers he had all that and here's a picture there when the brother george smith got in there but one of the the closer something is to your heart the harder it probably is to commit it completely to god to completely let let go of it and you know the the story that brother branham tells about how after they moved to arizona how hard that was on uh rebecca you know what this is this stuff to move from one place to another and brother he tells the story i'm just going to read a little bit here about how she's uh rebecca is there playing the piano playing uh he says she was sitting there playing a rock and roll boogly wiggly and um and sister mita see i guess she was learning this at a new friend's house but yeah you go to a new place you're gonna meet new friends and meet us i told her to stay away from over there see and she said well it's the only place rebecca is the only place i got to go to take music and then and i guess she just a few days after that her mother got after for something else and rebecca saster and that's not rebecca at all she just took off and slammed the door almost to knock the things off the hall that went to school and that's the situation that brother branham comes back to it back back home and he says becky never did that to me see when her mother said something about it she slammed the door and said you expect me to sit here and be a wall flower all my life and blame me she slammed the door and went out that was the devil and um brother brown just kind of goes on when she started that i said i took me to about an hour as i was kind of encouraged sometimes it does take about an hour to kind of process everything talk about things calm down and kind of talk about the issue at hand it took about an hour and it says mita take your hands off what that's my kid it's really hard to say the right things here but he's doing his best that's my kid it's my kid too he says if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to gone for her eternal destination why can't we commit her to god now for her earthly journey but that's my kid it's mine too now you can't take i can't i mean not say anything to her she says said i never said that we'll just quit scolding her and just advise her she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and me or her parents that wasn't easy you can kind of see he's preached this committal to god he's preaches all over the place this is the greatest weapon when the rubber meets the road that wasn't easy it was really really hard they said we just got down on our knees and committed it to god and said i know she's 18 years old we'll be that in a few days and she and a girl that age will think about boyfriends and we've kept her in i never wanted to see her get married i wanted to put her in the office here and do the work i want to see her filled with the spirit and live like that and we all wanted that and i said well wait a minute we've raised her all we can and now put her in the hands of god committer and then when she does anything say becky darling mother don't want you to do that but i'm your pal i'll stick by you let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman i said you be the woman that does the loving and we got down and committed to god and said we'd take our hands off it that afternoon she came in well i guess you're still saying i can't go over there and he said no i didn't say anything about that but you know mama wants you to go over there and i killed your daddy when you heard that boogie woogie music with that girl playing but we just committed to god you do what you want whatever you do will still love you and that's committal to god you know in his case he's able to tell the story pretty quickly afterwards that she came to the lord and experience with god god brought brother george smith their way and they got married but sometimes those things don't take don't happen so quickly but that doesn't change the principle that committal to god is the strongest power the greatest weapon that we have because when we put things in our own hands we're fighting the flesh-to-flesh battle a lot of times and it's not going to do any good whatsoever we just committed to god now sometimes i'm sure it's just we're all human sister me that might have gotten out brother branham somebody he had a hard time with uh with billy paul sometimes saying things it wasn't easy but just committed to god and yeah maybe if we try to take it back with your hands no we commit it to god it's god's that's um so it's this isn't a isn't it a glib thing of don't worry about things just just be happy and hopeful no it is it's very serious but take a look at the things are consuming our our worries our our cares our concerns take a look at them don't take a look at him too long because it just draws you right into him but take a look at him says whose hand is this best in this really good my hands am i doing a good job at this i'll look at your track record probably not look at it you know this is a really really big situation i'm really helpless to change the situation and when we can be conscious of our helplessness then we're most able to bring it to god and you know what prayer as soon as we can be so consumed by worry and caring and certainly it is really hard to pray it is really hard to pray but i like one of the things that this all hallows be mentioned in his book on on prayer he says prayer is just opening your heart to let god in and he used the revelation three the message of allowed to see in church as an example no man seeks after god on their own god's knocking on the door of the heart god's seeking us first and if god's seeking you first prayer can be just as simple as more help that is a great prayer if we can't say anything else open the door of your heart give god access take it lord i i can't do it take it lord come in come in and help that is sometimes we we gauge a good prayer by how nice it sounds but that is so human because god god looks god looks on the heart he just wants a heart that's open so that he can come in and move in the circumstance a committal to god casting all your cares upon him for he careth for you he cares for us but not only does god care for us he wants to do the caring for us too we say yes thank god that you care for us but i'm still going to carry this burden on my own no he doesn't he wants us let me worry about it and there's a like an old testament scripture that he that keepeth israel either slumber nor sleep there's a story told during the battle of london when london was getting blitzed every night and one lady said yeah i actually had a good night's sleep last night how could you do that hey god said he's going to be up watching over me there's no reason for both of us to lose a good night's sleep if he's he's going to do the caring for us as well let him there's no reason for both of us to be worried about it a lot of times though when we cast we have to make sure we we cast the right way we don't want to cast like a fisherman because when a fisherman casts his worries on the lord he reels them back in right he's not still there and casts them back out and it's still there and he reels it back in though when we cast our burden upon the lord we cast like this we just cast and let it be gone and the promise is he will sustain us it's important to cast our cares upon the lord and let him do the caring for us we quoted first peter 5 7 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you the importance of this is demonstrated by verse 8 because he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour if we don't cast our cares upon him and let him do the caring for us the devil's going to be roaring all kinds of negative thoughts at us and we're going to get caught it's important to cast all our cares on him and the promise is that he will sustain us he will take care of us and we have a high priest who's touched by the feeling of our infirmities and jesus uh and he would he would see a multitude of compassion all the people have been there all day long and because they've been with them for so many days he had compassion his i won't send them away fast unless they faint in the way that's the heart of the god who looks at our needs today also who sees our cares our concerns we say lord i need your help today don't you didn't send those people away fainting give me a little bit of encouragement today because if we can see that god is with us what a huge huge blessing that is he understands and he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities and like i said he might not take the infirmity away sometimes he does often he doesn't but the fruit of prayer is peace we cast our burden of the lord he will sustain us he does sustain us the fruit of prayer is peace now we don't have to worry brother branham says and scuffle and act like the rest of the world just quiet down what's the matter with the christian the spirit of the world today is neurotic but that's not the spirit of christ did you ever see him get excited about something just as calm as could be he knew exactly where he was standing oh what a blessed assurance it is just like a baby to lay your trust upon him a little baby is the most helpless creature there is so helpless but that's how we should be relying upon the heart of god like the heart of a mother who's going to take care of that little child can you understand the baby's cry most of them no not dad isn't very good at it but that baby keeps crying is that baby is that maybe a good prayer warrior no but that baby can certainly express its helplessness and its need we might be we might feel like i'm such a terrible prayer but we can just cry like the baby cries and god's heart goes to listen and goes to hear and takes care of the need what a blessed assurance it is like a baby to lay your trust upon him let him take all of your cares for he cares for you don't try to do anything about it he'll do it already he promised you would do it it's his business as long as you're fooling with it well then he can't have it but when you turn it loose and let him have it he will take care of it for you yes sir i like that with a perfect calmness the christian ought to have i just want to ask us today what cares what concerns what worries do we have on our hearts what kind of cares and concerns did we bring to church with us this morning i remember one time as a teenager i was in high school and i don't remember what i was i was concerned and cared and discouraged but all kinds of things and i came across the scripture verse casting all your care upon him for he careth for you and i started writing down the things that were causing me to be discouraged and dismayed and down sort of writing them down you get a list after a while what what kind of list did we bring to the bring bring the church today well after you did that just a lobster clasp for myself prayed about it scrumped it up and threw it in the trash can because i can cast it upon the lord one of the things that we bring i just encourage us take it to the lord in prayer and i'm not not going to go any further here but just maybe the musicians could come and we could play what a friend do we have in jesus he's never going to come and say oh are you struggling with that again is that coming up again why are you worried about that again haven't i told you so many times he doesn't do that what a friend we have in jesus all our griefs our sins and pains to bear he wants he doesn't just care for us he wants to do the caring for us too let him do it the greatest weapon a christian has is a committal to god what kind of things are in our hands what kind of things do we have our fingerprints on turn it over to the lord because he is so much better able to take care of him the promise is then the peace of god which passes all understanding will garrison will guard will fortify your hearts and minds in christ jesus stick out those all those bad thoughts put the stirring stick away don't be stir getting yourself all struck with the negativity it'll come watch tomorrow something bad is going to happen get that drop ink put in your mind don't stir drain the cup whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are a good report think on those things our thoughts are like seeds what kind of thoughts do we usually begin the day with put the phone on right to the news feed put the phone on right to the family chat put the phone are those the seeds you want to start the day with i challenge you tomorrow morning keep the phone off open god's word this is reality everything else might be based upon something that might happen that might sell newspapers but this is reality let this be the first seed that's planted in your mind and i believe that'll affect us cast our burdens on him and he will sustain us let's pray lord jesus we just thank you for your word today oh god and father i i want to be very careful this morning not to diminish or minimize or demean any of the difficult things that we that can cause us to be burdened or troubled and concerned and i certainly hope i didn't do that today but lord whatever things that we might be carrying father i just pray that you would pass by each one of my brothers and sisters lord lord me you just be passing by with with your big bucket we just drop our concerns into each and e into that bucket go out of our hands into yours you're so much better able to carry it than we are lord i pray that you would take those things from us father lord i pray that you give courage and strength to each person father lord just the things i've heard about this past week the different have happened different ones and how oh such a difficult thing lord i pray for though that you would sustain and encourage lord even the situation might not be changed that we know that you're with us you'll never leave us you never forsake us of god but we just know and sense your spirit's presence and be strengthened by the lord and lord i just pray if anybody would like to commit something together to you lord be glad to pray with them lord i just pray oh god that we might be under burdened help us lord to establish new thought patterns thinking your thoughts of god let you do the caring for us oh lord i pray you bless and strengthen each one in jesus name amen [Music] let's sing that song what a friend [Music] um [Music]
