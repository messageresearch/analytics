in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity think of a Christian only talking to God when they need something think of a Christian only coming to God when there's an emergency that's a a childishness that's that's an emotional walk with God running to the Lord when there's an emergency in life running to God but see God wants fellowship and love from us even when there's not an emergency going on he wants relationship with you he wants Fellowship something that's an everyday love relationship with him not something that's I'm running back to you God I'm sorry I've been away from you so long I'm sorry but you see now now I need to get back with you because I got an emergency in my life somewhere the church has got to grow out of those immaturities that there's a consistent love for God no matter what's happening in our lives consider a Christian that says Lord I Need You Now it's emergency bail me out of this God bail me out living off of temporal blessings of God think about always living in the rush of a prophecy over your life that was from God how many's had a prophecy over your life and it come from God you knew it come from God I've had that and I appreciate those things but I can't live expecting just on a prophecy to live by I have to have a consistent love of God and passion for him if I never get another prophecy over my life if God never does another miracle for me if God never heals s the sick again I am here for the duration I stand and I want to let God know and I want to let the devil know this fellow is not moving from his stance in the word of God that's immaturity that's this love working no matter ups and downs blessing God blesses me God doesn't bless me doesn't matter that doesn't change it I'm right here ready to serve him and love him think about a Christian Living off the rush of a prophecy over your life or the pre or a healing that's come as I said you could receive healing a miracle from God you can receive but you might get sick again and need another healing see it's temporal listen we need that atonement that healing we will always need that and it's so powerful we appreciate those things or we love it when the presence of the Lord sweeps down and baptizes Us in his presence it's glorious isn't it but it's temporal here it's temporal and we can't just live on temporal things with our walk with God and that his love does not change when he doesn't we need to live that his love does not change when he doesn't answer like we thought he should answer it don't change if our healing doesn't come in a miracle form his love doesn't change that if I ever was able to be in another feeling the strong love of God keeps me no matter what I love Laura Story song She Wrote a few years ago I can't remember what year it was the lyrics says and this is the one that says says we pray for blessings we pray for peace and comfort for our family we pray for protection while we sleep we pray for healing for Prosperity we pray for your Mighty hand to ease our suffering and all the while you hear each spoken need yet love is way too much to give us lesser things cuz if you're and and the then the course says what if your blessings comes through raindrops what if your healing comes through tears what if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near and what if the trials of this life are your Mercies in Disguise Joseph even before Calvary Joseph was able to look at life this way at the end when he was completely mistreated by his brothers he had every right to be bitter and write them off and at the end of it he he he connected to the predestinated plan of God somehow and bitterness was gone and the past was gone and he was able to look at his brothers and say listen what you did God intended it you intended it for evil but God has done that for my good what an eternal perspective what a theophonic what a what a a deeper perspective that most of us live temporary affected by temporary things but he tapped into something else here to say listen what you meant an evil God's turned it around it's meant for good that was supposed to happen in my life that was I've been fighting it saying God why did you let that happen in my life but now that was supposed to happen because I wouldn't be here today somebody listening to me this morning my story is my story I can't change my story but I know some things I wouldn't be here today loving God this way unless my story would have been written the way that it was I won't get angry in the midst of my trials I don't conduct myself like a little child in hard times that doesn't get what he wants and Stomps his feet how many you ever seen little Little Johnny in the store stomp his feet cuz he's not getting what he wants we can see that in children but spiritual children spiritual children can live that way I don't come conduct myself like a child in hard times I don't get temporal temporal with my love for him I don't live on highs and then show a lack of passion for him when I'm in a low his love does not change and does not fail I want to give some faithfulness back to him I don't fade in and fade out with my love back towards the towards him can you say Amen Lord when I was a child and this is why Paul brings it up when I was a child I spake like a child I acted like a child I thought like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he's typing the childhood naturally with our spiritual walk and he's telling the Corinthians you're childish and how you're doing things you're depending on a prophecy but listen your love has to be tapped into the love of God to love me back and it's consistent it doesn't fade in and fade out with trials can you say Amen Lord when I I was a child I acted that way in my attitude but now I'm becoming a man put away this dependence on feeling temporal things put away childish things this is what Paul said here when I was a child I spake as a child you know the Corinthians were Christians with the Holy Ghost how many believe that the church that Paul wrote to in the book of Corinthians were a people that had the Holy Ghost yes they were but they were babies spiritually why why were they babies because they spoke and they understood and they thought in spiritually childish ways what were they I had this uh typed in years ago when I went through the whole book of Corinthians and I listed all the carnal babyhood of the Corinthian Church I couldn't find it so I went through and found them again last night here's the Corinthian Church outside of their services yeah don't look at me funny like that if you had attended a Corinthian Church service my goodness you say this is the most spiritual people on the face of the Earth remember when I read these what's happening in the Corinthian Church when I read it's all from my King James Version Bible said there's division among you there's contentions among you there's playing favorite preachers you say Amen if you've read this in the book of Corinthians he called them carnal babes I have to feed you with milk among you is envying Strife carnality you walk as men he said you are puffed up fornication is reported among you a man sleeping with his stepmom even worse a man sleeping with his stepmom coming to church taking communion even worse the church the Corinthian Church was covering it up not talking about it not dealing with it too scared to call out the sin I wonder if it was pressure from the family don't talk about the problems in my family they were going to court with one another cuz when the church should have handled it themselves because the church didn't deal with things maybe they had to go to court and that's what I feel sometimes is that the church should be able to deal with issues outside of worldly courts but sometimes when the church doesn't deal with it properly then sometimes you have to go to court but you see now the church should be dealing they were going to court with one another and Paul said you shouldn't have to do that you should be mature enough to handle matters amongst yourself but you're not mature enough praise the Lord he had to remind and teach the women that they shouldn't cut their hair and he had to remind the men that it's a shame for a man to have long hair it's a shame for a man to have long hair I don't know why he had to remind that generation of it I don't know I could go back into the history I've studied it have you i' go back to the history and say because the church world has written off that scripture and says that does not that's not relevant today let me say publicly you don't have a right to pick and choose what you want out of this Bible and say that belonged in this era that belonged to that if there's scriptural truth that's generational that's Timeless generation nobody no denomination no man no great preacher has a right to interpret those scriptures leave it alone leave it the way it is and for some reason Paul had to talk about hair that a woman's long hair is her glory it's in the Bible and that it's a shame for a man to have long hair women leave their hair long and uncut men cut their hair and then he says there's heresies among you you're getting they're get they were getting drunk at the communion table this Bible letting an unknown tongue manifest without anyone to interpret it Paul had to correct that you know want unbelievers coming in and think that you're mad and it was all a bunch of unknown tongues no interpretation Paul said you can't do that when you speak when you sing a song when there's a prophecy let there be an interpretation because we must be a people of understanding the unbeliever should understand what's going on sing with understanding speak with understanding it's not just about a a bunch of unknown stuff and everybody says oh it's such a spiritual thing going on but nobody understands what's being said from God God is not the author of confusion he wants everybody to understand what he said everyone has a song everyone has a tongue when they come together and then he says you're being unequally yolked together some must have been unequally Yol with unbelievers unequally yolk with it doesn't mean marriage you're forming a too close of a union with an unbeliever how can you fellowship with that how can you form such a close Union with an unbeliever uh it's he said uh that we we shouldn't do that you're unequally yolked when you give your offering he says when you give your offering don't give grudgingly give with a cheerful heart this is the Corinthian Church I'm not preaching at you this morning I'm preaching at the Corinthian Church not you Corinthian Church none of you ever do things like this so he says at the end of Corinthians examine yourself whether you're even in the faith he says I'm using sharpness with you that's the word I'm being sharp with you but I love you and I'm going to tell you the truth if you would have been in a servant in the Corinthians you might not have seen all this carnality a lot of good things were going on in the services but there's some childishness going on behind the scenes it's very quiet now and understand that people say we're a book of Acts Church we're book of Acts Church there's some environments but it looks like the book of Acts Church on the outward but where's the discernment to expose sin in the camp that's a book of Acts church too where's the discernment to to expose Brothers Bound by pornography and incest going on and rape going on and ananas and Sav were corrected for for lying to the Holy Ghost if you're a book of Acts Church where's all the other attributes of the book of Acts church so grow up and act like men and women of God where God knows where you stand not up and down doubting all the time and Satan and and and live so God knows where you stand every day there's no question about it how many would raise your hand and say I want to know and God wants go I want God to sense my spirit my soul my attitude I want God to sense he knows exactly where I stand 24/7 there's no question about it my mind is disciplined God knows where I stand but even better Satan knows where I stand I want the devil to know 24/7 where I stand and if I have to vocalize it I'm going to say it so he knows I love to preach about Hannah because Hannah uh her husband had two wives and and the one wife started to have a bunch of babies and Hannah couldn't have a child and the worst thing is it's bad for a woman not to be able to have one and got she loves that but she couldn't have it and so now you look at L you know all through the years she becomes bitter she had an adversary she had a tormental Tormentor so Hannah started to get bitter about God not answering her prayer uh to have a child and then she looks over and and she sees the other wife I can't remember her name and she's having babies and then she gets complexes you know the other wife is having and she's prospering and God you're hearing her prayer and not my prayer there's all this mental stuff going on they must be favored of you I'm not I'm I'm unworthy and and as this this grows it grows in a bad attitude towards God now it's one thing to not understand what God's doing it's another thing to have a bad attitude about it come on say amen and bitterness develops and and and things develop and what what was just a simple hurt by somebody years ago people can hold that Grudge for countless years ask God to help you get over it don't let it Tain your whole life let the forgiveness and blood of Jesus just wash it away from you but you see now she had this she be developed that and then then the Tormentor come it says the Tor she had a Tormentor that tormented she was in depression she was low but every year her and Alena her husband that was her husband's name brother Alena every year they went to the temple to worship God every year they went and they wanted to worship and so every year she went with the same prayer Lord I I don't understand why you're not giving me a child but she started to go towards her towards more bitterness towards it and her attitude and torment her she was depressed all the time and so now when you look at the promise and predestinated plan of God there was a predestinated plan of God for Hannah to have a baby she just didn't know it but her baby would be a special baby that's right amen she was not to produce just what the other wife was just a baby she was to Pro produce a Prophet this bride is not to produce another denominational thing we are meant to produce Christ coming out of us Mary didn't just have another baby she brought forth Christ don't look at everybody else don't even look at everybody else in the congregation what is God wanting to do in your life and I can tell you Hannah didn't know that she was not supposed to bring just another baby she was praying for a baby but it wasn't just there was a predestinated plan of God for her life and that's why God was just holding up everything but who was really holding up the promise I can tell you with from my study it wasn't just God holding up it was Hannah's attitude holding it up some of you heard me preach on this before and I'm going to keep preaching because I love this little story it's a type of the bride of Christ you're not called to be a denomination you're not called to be other churches you're not called you don't compare yourself with the other wife there's a foolish virgin don't compare yourself don't borrow can you say Amen praise the Lord so every year she came and I always say that Hannah probably sang the same special every year can sister Hannah sing a special and after so many years people just under their breath saying does she have to sing another special cuz she sings the same one every year and she's she's depressed she pours a wet blanket over that whole service every time she gets up for her special but every year it's the same one and she gets up Hannah comes up and everybody said do we have to hear Hannah sing again okay just let her sing and and the the priest Eli said can we have sister Hannah come up and sing her special please don't please don't have her sing there's other singers please don't get hand she gets up every year and she's got the same s song wo is me wo is [Music] me wo is me whoo is me I am sad because the Lord won't give me a [Music] bab whoo is me whoo is me every year it's the same thing every year she takes her depression home with her she takes everything and what was needed is for Hannah to tap into the mind of God because in the mind of God she was going to have a baby but it was her attitude about it and her depression about it and her prayer was tainted with her now her anger towards God why can't I have a baby I ask you and look at this woman prospering over here she even said to her husband I just and you know living with a wife like this every day must have been hard on brother Elena she's in constant depression and it's like honey please pull yourself out of this please this is terrible and she says you favor her more than me God favors her she's having okay I can't have a baby for you they just going on he said he said hone listen I love you with a double blessing I love you double more than her I love you anyway and you're you're better than a thousand Sons so just just love me you know what am I chop liver you're good but I want a son and then one year she comes she comes to church with a different prayer she Taps into the predestinated plan of God amen and her prayer now was aligned with the predestinated plan of God and she comes in that year different and she comes in and she raises her hand to almighty God and she said Lord I have prayed for years for a baby but I want to bring this prayer to you if you will bless me with a baby I will have that baby I will wean that baby and I'll give that baby completely back to you to the service of the Lord for the rest of its life that was a different prayer that was a humble prayer that was a sacrificial pray prayer see her prayer before was really selfish I want it for myself but when unselfishness came in her prayer that she was thinking of others instead of herself her attitude changed that here and she said God if you give it to me and and the thing is the Bible says she began to just get into the flow and the spirit of God so much that she looked drunken from the whole congregation and Eli the priest said what have you done have you been drinking what is going on what's the matter with you and she got a little tiff at him says I'm not a a child of B I'm not an m i don't drink and get myself drunk I'm drunk in the spirit of God I have released this thing read your Bible she got on the priest for saying that to her I'm not drunk with wine I'm not drunk I'm drunk in the spirit because I've release something to God I released a bad attitude towards God I got rid of my anger right now I got right of my bitterness and I'm releasing this to God and she's running around shouting and Eli saidwell why don't you sing a special and everybody goes no no please don't let her sing again but this year she got up and she had a different song she had a new song she had a different special everybody's expecting the woe is me hit she gets up she said I just want to testify and praise the Lord I've released something to the Lord this morning uh God bless you for praying for me God bless you for endur enduring my special every year but I got a new song today I just want to say I thank God for saving me filling me with the Holy Ghost God for changing my attitude I just want to give glory to God today in the service praise the Lord and now I'm going to sing
