water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit what I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh I want you to notice he hasn't said that said yet those words I will put my spirit in your spirit this is he's only dealing with your spirit he is only changing your spirit he's only um he's only making your spirit more compliable more get alongable as it were so that you can get along so you can get in a place that you'd receive his spirit so he gives you a new heart he takes away your Stony heart he gives you a new spirit and then after that then he says verse 27 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and ye shall keep my judgments and do them so on Sunday we were given the first part of redemption and just taking it in pieces so that even the children can understand it and the first part of redemption according to the law is that the wages of sin is death uh God said to Adam and Eve at the beginning if you eat of eat thereof of that fruit then you shall surely die so if you sin if there's unbelief in your sin and you eat of that you said you'll die so that's the wages of sin so if you sin that's that's that's you you can't get out of it that there has to be a punishment for it and and so now the only way that you can get out of it is someone paid the price for that sin someone paid the penalty a penalty has to be paid and so the only way that something can happen is you pay that penalty but you can't pay that penalty and say you can't deal with the problem so the only way is someone paying the penalty for your sin the first step is somebody paying the penalty you couldn't get out you you would finish this life you would die in your sins uh you would go to a sinner's hell you could not lift yourself up you could not pay your debt uh and you were helpless you couldn't lift yourself up and and and so then if we were wanting to begin to believe the word and start to come back to God we couldn't even start coming back until the penalty of our sin was paid you say do you want to come back to God I want to come back to God I want to come back to him but you see you couldn't until first your sin was dealt with because you never come in the presence of God with that sin so and you can't deal with your sin so you're actually you're doomed without the grace of God you're due without the grace of God and because of the penalty has to be paid that's the first step and praise the Lord tonight can you say praise the Lord he paid the debt for our sins he paid the full debt the debt of sin was paid at Calvary you don't have to pay it he paid it in full Ezekiel 36 look at this verse 16 moreover the word Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore I poured my Fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their Idols were what they had polluted it and I scattered them among the Heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings I judged them and when they entered into the Heathen under the Heathen whether they went they profane my holy name so it's it's bad enough that Israel left God and began to serve Idols then when God scattered them to all the Heathen Nations they get amongst those Heathen and they start profaning the name of God when they said to them these are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land so these people in the heathens were saying this is the people of the Lord this is supposed to be the ones that are blessed of God these are the Jews and they're so far away from God they're actually profaning his name and they're saying but these are the people of God these were supposed to be the people of God that's how far backslid they were that's how far backsled you were with sin in your life amen this is all about the individual now because remember at the End of the Road God saved Israel as a nation but he saves Gentiles as individuals so everything that applies to Israel as a nation applies to you as an individual and you by yourself born in sin shaped iniquity you're in a land you rebelled against the god you're out amongst the world amongst the Heathen you start acting like them you take on the nature you just you do what they do you smoke you drink you into all the kinds of things the worldly music and everything because you by Nature you have that nature so you're out there amongst the Heathen and a lot of times they're looking at saying hey didn't you have a better upbringing than that didn't you say this didn't you say that and they're kind of looking at you saying my weren't you weren't you you used to grow up in a Christian church or something I can't believe you're acting like that but I had a he's God says I had a Pity let's notice now I had a pity for my Holy Name which is the house of Israel had profaned among the Heathen whether they went therefore saying to the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do not this this next thing I'm going to do Redemption I do not this for your sakes o House of Israel but for my holy namesake which ye have profaned among the Heathen whether you went there's one thing we got to know about Redemption it's not just about you can you say man but it's about God said I made a promise that I'm going to manifest myself through human beings he comes in that his name could be glorified in your life and he does that through flesh the plan of God is for the word to be manifest in your flesh In the Flesh of Sons and Daughters of God but it's not about you it's about him in you and he's saying to Israel when I redeem you don't think that even that is about you I'm doing it to protect and restore my name you're going to read it he's going to say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I'm going to do that and we could interrupt and say where do I come along how do I contribute there's none of us in it and guess what I'm glad there's none of us in it I'm gonna do this I'm Gonna Change you I'm gonna do that because when we inject into it that's what he said about the children of Israel when they chose law over Grace they should have chose Grace and they said to Moses give us a law tell us the Commandments tell us what to do and we will do it they should have never said that that's not a good deal they should have said we surrender Lord you do what you want to do in US 23 and I will sanctify my great name which is profaned among the Heathen which he have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I see he never lets the devil get the last word I will not let the last word be my name being profaned to the Heathen God said I will not let my name continue thy thing so now I'm going to take my people I'm going to redeem them because I'm going to get the last word Satan don't have the last laugh verse 24 says I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land he hasn't filled him with the spirit yet he hasn't changed their heart yet he said I just need to gather you out of all those Heathen lands and bring you into your own land and when your Christian Life Starts you don't know that God is beginning to call you and work on you even on some job maybe you were working in a bar maybe you're in a factory and cussing with all the other guys and and so but if you're a Son of God he's he's already hunting for you God is hunting for you because he's going to find his sons and daughters wherever they're at and he's going to say I need to get you separated from that atmosphere a bit and bring you into your own land first so I can start to deal with you he took Israel by the power of redemption out of all those he's in Heathen lands and gathered them all by something that was in heart we got to get back to Jerusalem we got to get back to Jerusalem they came from all the countries and he gathered them back hadn't even dealt with them yet hadn't even restored them yet but the first thing is I'm going to bring him out of all those lands I will gather them to their own land verse 25 then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness because you're too filthy to come before the Lord and you're certainly too filthy to receive his holy spirit God's got to deal with that old nature first I will sprinkle you clean water you should be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you you see this is why I preach to people in different stages of their Christian Journey I preach every service and everybody's at different stages and some people think that they're in they're in another stage than what they really are but the word reveals where you really are you're still all filthy from the idols of the world walking in this church well then you you can't just act like that you're a holy ghost Phil Christian your life needs to be cleansed of the idols you shall be clean from your filthiness from your Idols why cleanse you I a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh your heart we want to allow God in this Redemptive process to be able to change our spirit and and see what do you do brother Paul you say Lord wherever I'm at be it unto me Lord if I'm not getting along with you Lord change my spirit if I've got a Stony heart that's just cold towards God and maybe everybody else God you got to deal with that Stony heart it's not just that you get the Holy Ghost but in this Redemptive work of God for Israel it wasn't just getting his spirit it's him changing your spirit first it's him dealing with your broken heart and some Sundays not everybody might get the Holy Ghost but somebody might get their broken heart their heart broken and soft before the Lord and then the next Sunday or even Monday they can be filled with the Holy Ghost so he says I then verse 20 said I will put my spirit within you and cause you so he's he's dealt with a Stony heart he's dealt with he's given you a new spirit that will get along and then I will put my spirit within you to cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God I will also he's not done this is so powerful friends this is so such a deep work God wants to do a deeper work in your life it's such a powerful deep work it's a process and he does it all can you say Amen but when we look at this Redemption taking place then we we realize that in these scriptures in Ezekiel 36 the first thing that we have to know is that he he is doing it all it's almost like God responding to the all the eyes that Lucifer rose up in Isaiah way at the beginning Isaiah reveals he said I will lift my throne above the Throne of God I will set myself up I want to be worshiped by God I I I and he boasted and he boasted and actually went in caused the fall all these other things so it's almost like God is responding saying now all right you've had your time I will step in for my people now and you gotta imagine friends the devil he's the one that preaches no hope for this human being he's the one that takes somebody sometimes so far there's no hope for them there's no Redemption for that and then he tells you personally with your story I don't think there's I'm not sure this Redemption that is preached at the pulpit is for you everybody else seems to be getting it but I don't think it's for you and your family I think you're an exception to the rule that's the devil's voice that's the devil's voice I don't I don't I don't think and you know you you've got such you have been through so much and have such a Stony heart that I don't know you're a dick you're in a different category you're not in a different category and God wanted to tell Satan I don't care how deep the Stony heart I don't care how the spirit that won't get along with me I don't care they're scattered all over the Nations I don't care if they're defaming my name I don't know if they're care if they're cussing I don't care if they're swearing I don't care if the deepest pit that they're in if they're my sons and daughters I'm going to show Satan I'm gonna go get them I'm showing the devil that there isn't a dark pit black enough and deep enough there isn't a myri clay that is deep enough for me not to redeem my child somebody say praise the Lord he brought me out of the miraclee he set my foot notice he did it can you say Amen I'll bring them out I'll do this I got to finish before I sing I will also save you from your uncleanness I will call for corn I will increase it and lay no famine upon you I will multiply the fruit of the tree I will increase the field that ye shall receive no more no more reproach of famine among the Heathen I you know it's not you're not done after he puts a spirit in you it's still he's still telling Satan I'm gonna do this for my people I'm going to multiply your fruit of the tree then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your Abominations not for your sakes do I do this saith the Lord heckles it again be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways or House of Israel thus saith the Lord God in the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities and ways shall be building and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this lamb that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden glory be to God that's Redemption he's taken his sons and daughters back to the Garden of Eden and we're not stop stopping halfway this isn't a halfway Journey Redemption is not a halfway trip he's not wanting just to get you off your cigarettes he's not wanting you just to get you off of bad videos this is not a halfway trip God is going to take his people through Redemption all the way through the process all the way back to Eden again can you say about it this land was desolate and the people will say this land that was doesn't has become like the Garden of Eden in the waste into desolate ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited than the Heathen that are left round about shall know that I the Lord build ruined places and plant that that was desolate I the Lord have spoken it I will do it the devil is going to know that heathen's going to know I'm the god that builds ruined places I'm the god that restores and the world's going to say at the end he's the god that builds ruined things broken lives ruin families broken hearts heathen's going to say he's the Mighty God that heals ruined cities and ruined families and ruin hearts they're all going to know and I have spoken it I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would like to come and
