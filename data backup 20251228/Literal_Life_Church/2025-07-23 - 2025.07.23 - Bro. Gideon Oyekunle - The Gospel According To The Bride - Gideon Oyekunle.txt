If they were just in and out and up and down in different doctrines and you know, uh just maybe just three or four message years in the message and then gone. But you know when you talk about 25 30 years you see the faithful faithfulness and consistency and you appreciate there's so much in these brother's lives that ring out.

So there'll be no adult class and no children's class until the Sunday after that. So praise the Lord. Have you brought your plate up tonight to the Lord? Have you brought your cup open that he can fill you? I hope it's that way. Sometimes we have to shake off a little bit of the tiredness. I'm really tired myself, but there's something about being around the presence of God and being around the saints. There's something about the word that gives us time of refreshing. So you yield to the Lord and give him all your heart. Father, Father will bless you. Brother Gideon, God bless you. Come, brother. We welcome you in the name of the Lord. Amen.

Thank you, Father. Bless the reading of your word and the ministrations. Let it be, Father. We look away to you by faith and thanksgiving in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Second Kings chapter 5. Now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. He was also a mighty man in veil, but he was a leper. And the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel, a little maid. And she waited on Neon's wife. And she said unto her mistress, "Will God, my Lord, were with the prophet that is in Samaria, for he will recover him of his leprosy." Revelation chapter 10 I read from verse 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standed upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it and hear it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's end, and held it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." May the Lord bless the reading of his holy word. Amen. God bless me. Be seated. The gospel according to the bride. The gospel according to you. The gospel according to me. Amen. All right. So, uh I remember a good friend of mine, brother Shalas, you know that sent greetings to you. Amen. God bless you. You know so many of them. If I should stand here to give greetings, maybe that will be the service. God bless you all. All right. So tonight we want to speak on the gospel according to the bride. Amen. Is that brother Michael? Right. God bless you brother Mike. Thank you. And the family. Amen. So the gospel according to the bride basically you know the gospel means good news. &gt;&gt; That is the meaning of the word gospel. It means good news. Not bad news but good news. But when we look into the world today, all what you hear is bad news. &gt;&gt; Bad news everywhere. You tune in the radios, you read on the newspaper, on the media, social media, everywhere. Bad news. Because when we look into the world today, we can see how science is advancing. But yet in all those advancement, you can see you know the hazard. you know that are behind those things the dangers you know behind the labors and the effort of man on the planet earth. So he's bringing you know bad news into the world more and more and more &gt;&gt; and it has become as it was in the days of Sodom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The news in Sodom was fixing the righteous soul of Lot. But Lot has no grace, you know, to stand against it because the prophet of God said his wife will not allow him to speak against it. And he said, you know, that's the type of the church today because we have a lot of lot in Sodom whose righteous soul are being fed, you know, but the woman, the church will not allow them, you know, to speak against it. They don't have the grace. is the season is the time that we are living in. &gt;&gt; But brothers and sister there is difference between you and Lot. &gt;&gt; Difference between me and Lot &gt;&gt; because we are not in Sodom. &gt;&gt; We are outside Sodom. &gt;&gt; We are Abramite. Abraham never lived in Sodom. But Abraham said, you know why the reason why Lot's soul was being fixed was because Lot has been with it. Abraham before before he went down into Sodom. And brother, when you look into the war today, that's the type of Sodom. The word the prophet said is in sodom condition. And the whole world, not, you know, without an exception, the whole world is in sodom condition. I don't care you know how best you know they can try to produce or present anything before us in the world today is still Sodom and the bride of Jesus Christ a type of Abraham was is not in Sodom but we are living outside Sodom and that's the reason why tonight I can tell you that this bride is not living in America &gt;&gt; this bride is not living in England this bride is not living in Canada we are not living in Europe. We are not living in Nigeria. But where do we live? We are living, you know, in heaven on earth. That's where we live. We are seated, the Bible said, in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is an atmosphere that has been brought down and we are raptured into the atmosphere. And that is where we live. The Bible said in the book of Hebrews chapter 12 that we are gathered here. Hallelujah. Not in literal life church but we are gathered in here where in heaven Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; We are here in heaven in the presence of the angels. The Bible sayable companies of angels through the spirit of just men made perfect through Jesus Christ the mediator of the new testament. the new covenant to the sprinkling of the blood which speaketh better things than the blood of heaven. Hallelujah. That is where we live. That's where we gather. And we are not just only gather here tonight. We are there all the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are hearing from home because that is our homeland. And we are hearing from home from day to day. We are hearing from home tonight. We are hearing from home tomorrow. Whether there is church or no church, we are hearing from home. Hallelujah. Because you know our soul comes from there. And then brothers and sister, we are living by the word of God. And I want to ask you tonight, how long have you heard from whom? Since when have you heard from whom? Oh brother, there must be a pool within you. You know, every night, every day, every moment, every hour. Hallelujah. You know, we got to fill the pool all the time. Like our gracious brother Paul here, you know, sing the song, I feel the pull, I hear the call. Hallelujah. And you know the prophet said, if there's a deep in you calling, there will be a deep to respond to the call. Hallelujah. And then we got to feel that pool every day. Hallelujah. Remember that this earth, you know, we are pilgrims and we are strangers. We are not part of this earth. We don't belong in here. This earth is the land of our captivity. It is not our homeland. It is Satan's Eden. Hallelujah. But brothers, our ears is tuned and inclined to the things of heaven. And the brother of what we are hearing is good news from heaven all the time. Angels of God. Hallelujah. Whispering. Hallelujah. Blessed assurance. Oh my. No fixation of soul, no fixation of spirit because there's always a good news. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not confused. We are not disturbed. We are not moved. We are hearing good news. Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. But brothers, &gt;&gt; just as we go, do you know that good bad news started in Genesis? &gt;&gt; Bad news started in Genesis. Yes. Everything you know started in Genesis. It all that's why Genesis was called Genesis. That's the seed chapter. &gt;&gt; You know that's Genesis the beginning and the bad news started in Genesis after the fall because before the fall at the creation it was good news all the way. &gt;&gt; You know from the first day of creation, Amen. it was good news. The first day the Bible says and it was good. The second day and it was good. The third day and it was good. The fourth day and it was good. The fifth day and it was good. On the sixth day, the Bible say it was very good. Hallelujah. Good news all along the road. Oh my God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And on the sixth day and it was very good. Why? Because Adam, the son of God, the governor of the earth, has finally arrived. &gt;&gt; He was man in God's own image. He was created with the breath of life in him and was given dominion over everything to rule over them. That was his nature. Adam, you know, was not afraid of anything because there was no sin. There was no sickness. There was no evil. Hallelujah. All was good. Amen. And you know supernatural was the original nature of Adam. Supernatural to Adam was a regular routine. It seems supernatural every day. It was part of his life. It was his nature. It was his way of life. It's supernatural. That was the man that God made and gave the breath of life. Hallelujah. It doesn't need to study engineering in order to construct bridge over the waters of Michigan. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need, you know, to build bridges over the lake Michigan that we went yesterday, Pastor Paul and brother Tomball. Amen. You know, look at that. And we got to walk, you know, on the uh on the beach and then, you know, on those uh concrete steps and, you know, just walking on that. Adam doesn't need that. He didn't need all those things. Adam could walk on water &gt;&gt; like he would walk on the dry ground &gt;&gt; because that was his nature. There was no cause for alarm. He can be walking on water. He was not afraid. He was not scared. &gt;&gt; Adam does not need to go to any American embassy to obtain visa and then go, you know, to a line and buy ticket and fly plane down to America like brother Gideon has done from Nigeria. &gt;&gt; Adam taught it and is already there. &gt;&gt; He travels like a thought. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was the man in God's own image. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need those things. Oh brother, you look at that. What a great science and what a great scientist that Adam was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a civilization that was living by. It was faith civilization. And by the power of restoration tonight, I have this good news for you. Amen. that tonight we are getting into a perfect faith into a rapturing condition and that we are getting into an atmosphere again where all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That all Adam lost &gt;&gt; they are being restored back again. &gt;&gt; Oh what a glorious thing brothers. &gt;&gt; But look at it brother just before we go. Adam had all these things happening around him, happening to him and he was experiencing it. He was living by that. But one day while all these things were perfectly set, it was good news. &gt;&gt; But one day another scientist came that oh serpent the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he broke into Adam's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that he was a scientist? That was why he came and he preached wisdom versus faith. Are you hearing me now? Adam lived by faith. But here came another scientist, you know, by wisdom. You know, to do what? To break into Adam's house in his absence. And the brothers, I want you to remember tonight that the prophet of the Almighty God says that we are God's spiritual scientist. &gt;&gt; We are scientists. And the all the treasures and the resources that are in God's laboratory belong to us. &gt;&gt; All belongs to us. But brother look at the headless scientist. They broke into God's laboratory to perfect those things fooling around. The prophet said until they killed themsel. He said and the devil is a thief and the father of it. And a thief came to ruin and to destroy and he broke into what does not belong to him. And anybody that broke into what does not belong to him is a thief and robber. &gt;&gt; And that's the devil. He's a thief and robber. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And there's the father of all those artificials and science and the wisdom you know all came you know from the devil that was the tree of knowledge of good and evil. That scientist came and preached another gospel not to Adam but to the woman because Adam was made in the image of God. He was infallible. The Bible says that Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived. But Adam stepped down with his 2020 in order to save that woman. And the Adam doing those things was reflecting the second Adam. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He was showing grace. &gt;&gt; He was showing the restoration that we come. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Adam cannot restore himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But the second Adam says, I have power to lay down my life and to take it off again. Oh, brother. Because it was God from heaven. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Look at that, brothers. When the serpent preached another gospel and the woman believed it, Then what happened? &gt;&gt; They lost all what they had. &gt;&gt; Adam went into it 2020, right? In order to bring the woman back. The prophet of the Almighty God says that the angel went back home weeping. &gt;&gt; Yes. The angel went back home to heaven weeping. Oh, oh, your son is lost. And it became bad news ever since. And ever since that time we have more hospital, more death. There should be labor. There should be no labor pain. There should be no hospital built. But today we have bad news everywhere. More hospital, more death, more cars, more crisis. &gt;&gt; Wiser and weaker. Death, death, death, death. But thanks be to God for Calvary. Hallelujah. Thanks be to God for Calvary. Hallelujah. Thanks be to God. When the news got to heaven, God came down. Hallelujah. He came down and he heard a conference together with every one of them that were involved. And when God has concluded in his conference, he said Genesis 3:15 will be the key to the bad news. Hallelujah. Oh, Genesis 3:15, there will be the seed of the woman, and the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, and the seed of the serpent will bruise his heel. Hallelujah. And brothers and sisters, that was the conclusion of the conference in the Garden of Eden. And Genesis 3:15 produces Isaiah 7:14. &gt;&gt; Behold, the virgin shall conceive. There is the seed of the woman. And Isaiah 7:14 produces Matthew chapter 1 and two. Hallelujah. Oh, brother. And here we can see in the book of Luke how the angel came to the woman. Hallelujah. In the spirit of Genesis 3:15. &gt;&gt; And the angel came unto the woman and told the woman, "Hey, thou are highly faithful. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." And when she saw him, she was troubled as he is saying or is he saying, and cast in her mind, what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not Mary, for thou has found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus. &gt;&gt; He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be? Saying, I know not end. And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Hallelujah. also thy holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What a message from the angel of God. Hallelujah. And the angel means messenger. And tonight, brothers and sister, you have an angel in the church. You have the pastor in the church. You have the minister in the church. You have all this angel in the church. And I'm one of them tonight standing before you. And I'm telling you the same thing tonight that with God nothing shall be impossible. All things are possible. Hallelujah. And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. be hid unto me according to thy word. Hallelujah. Oh brother, this is the spoken word of God. Hallelujah. And the spoken word of God is trying to find a bedding ground. Hallelujah. And brothers, when the seed finds a bed ground, oh brother, the right place for the seed, it will quicken. &gt;&gt; It will grow. Amen. And tonight, brothers, if your heart is a right ground for the word of the living God, the word of God is a seed that the sow. Hallelujah. All the promises in the book is ours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All the promises in the books, they are ours. &gt;&gt; We can claim them. We can receive them tonight. Oh, brother. Simple faith. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And brothers, Mary contributed nothing. No, &gt;&gt; no, nothing. He didn't she didn't contribute ahead. It was a creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. only sinful faith to receive the spoken word. Hallelujah. And the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ was born apart from human male instrumentality. Is that right? And that is you know the virgin birth because Mary was just an incubator. The egg and the hemoglobin were the creation of God and Mary just carry it, you know, to the bath so that we can have a redeemer related to the human race. Hallelujah. Because he has to pass through the woman in order for you and I to call him our brother and in order for him to call us our brothers. Hallelujah. And that's why the Bible say he was not ashamed to call us brethren. Hallelujah. saying, I will make my thy name manifest unto my brethren. In the midst of the congregation, we like praise day. Hallelujah. And tonight, brothers, we have a relation. We have a brother in redemption. Jesus Christ is our brother in redemption. The devil has been stripped. &gt;&gt; He has lost his authority. He has lost his power because we have a brother in redemption tonight. Oh, praise be to God. No wonder the angel can come. You know right there at the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ in the book of Luke in chapter 2 from verse 8 to 14 the Bible says there were shepherd in the field. &gt;&gt; And when the shepherds were there in the field what were they doing? They were just wearing they don't know anything but brother the angel came down. Oh praise God. And the angel saluted the serpent. And then here come you know the light amen that surrounds them. The glory of the Lord shine around them. Oh praise God. And the angel said fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. It's always a wonderful time brother that whenever God sends angel angel will say fear not. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to be afraid of. You don't have to be fearful. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be fearful. The Bible says, "Do not be dismayed &gt;&gt; at the signs of heaven. For the heathens are dismayed at these things." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's only the heathens that are afraid. It's only the heathen that are dismayed. It's only the heathen that are perplexed. It's only the heathens that are troubled. Amen. We are believers of the word of God. We can rest upon the word of God. There's nothing to be afraid of. We can rest. Amen. Little bride. Rest. All is well. &gt;&gt; The angel said, "Fear not. I bring unto you glad tidings of great joy." &gt;&gt; Amen. Glad tidings of great joy. Oh, for lo unto you is born this day in the city of David. Oh, in Bethlehem. The word has been born into existence, vindicated in his full strength. It unto you this day. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Unto you. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Can I hear somebody say, "Unto me." &gt;&gt; Unto me. &gt;&gt; Great tiding of great joy. Glad tiden of great joy. Unto me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; Call it yours. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; The good tidings, that glad tidings of great joy is unto you and unto me. Amen. What is it, brothers? Good news is back on earth again. Hallelujah. Good news is back on earth again. Remember in Genesis there was good news. &gt;&gt; The old creation there was good news. Then this is the beginning of the new creation of God. I believe you understand. And then he brings back what? Good news to the earth. Oh, glory to God. Good news is back on earth again. But when he died, the prophet said, "And he rose again on the third day, it was the greatest news flash in his &gt;&gt; brother said when Jesus Christ was born, it was good news." Amen. In the message of the rising of the sun in Proverbs 60, he said, "No wonder the gospel is good news." The very word gospel means the good news. &gt;&gt; The good news. What? If a man die for our sake, that's good news. If Christ was born, that's good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. But never a news, never was there news like this, &gt;&gt; like this news that he who made a promise has confirmed the promise that is alive forever more. And now the keys of both death and hell in his end all the gloom was shook away. There was no more gloom to be seen. Oh, praise the Lord. He said, for the son was come out from the grave. There was no well he will come or he may come. He had already come. The gospel good news. Amen. Notice the very message of the gospel he said is to prove to the people that he is risen. God tell my disciples that I'm risen from the dead and I will meet them to confirm this to them. Oh God, how in this last day there shall be light again across the earth and I will prove to my disciples. God tell them that I am not dead and I'm not a tradition but I am a living Christ. I will meet them. Tell this message to my disciples that I'm risen from the dead. You say is that right? Hebrew 13:8 is the same yesterday, today and forever. We his beneficiaries are to prove his life in us. Now the beneficiary of this life. The life there never was a life live like it. He was the son of God and he died and that shut it out. But when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning, then we as his servant are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person &gt;&gt; that he is a gospel that he is a living rather. And how can we do it by word only? For it is written, the gospel came not by word only, but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what a glorious time that the good news is back on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through the birth of Christ, the good news is back through his death, burial, and resurrection. The good news is bad. Brother Brown said it was good news that Christ was born. Is that right? He said but when he died and he rose again. Hallelujah. He said never have we ever had a news like that. &gt;&gt; And but Abraham call it the greatest news flash in the history. &gt;&gt; Why? When you go into the book of Revelation in chapter 5, we find out that John was there when that book was taken. Hallelujah. Oh brothers, the book was in the hand of the eternal one. And there was a call for the worthy one and there was no one worthy to take the book or to lose the sevens thereof. Hallelujah somebody. But brothers, John said, I wept. Amen. Because why? That was a bad news. Oh, come on, somebody. John said, "I wept." But the prophet said he didn't weep for a long time. For one of the elders, he said, "Weep not, John, for the land of the tribe of Judah." Hallelujah. He has prevailed to take the book and to lose the seven thereof. Hallelujah. And the John said and I turned to say the lion of the tribe of Judah but lo in the midst of the truth was the bleeding lamb. Hallelujah. There he is stand the bleeding lamb. There he is tonight our mediator. There he is tonight our intercessor. There is it tonight our redeemer. There is it tonight our sacrifice. There is it tonight our pardon. Hallelujah. Oh my good news. &gt;&gt; And John said there was a jubilee thereafter. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Weep not John. Amen. And all of a sudden the weeping turned into joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Abraham told us in the message a man running away from the presence of God. He said, "I believe I am prophesying." &gt;&gt; He said, "Great joy &gt;&gt; lays ahead." That's right. &gt;&gt; And many saddened heart will be turned into joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brothers, I believe that God is unveiling his word in this last days. Great things will be happening in the midst of the church. But we are the beneficiary of the prophecy of the spoken word. Hallelujah. We are not just looking for it. It's already here with us. The word is here. The word is mighty even in thy mouth. Hallelujah. We have it right here to turn our sudden heart onto joy. Hallelujah. And no wonder there was a great jubilee in heaven. And they started, you know, to jubilate. They started to worship. Hallelujah. It was a great time. Oh brother and brothers, I want to tell you tonight, you have nothing to weep about. &gt;&gt; Whip not John. Whip not brother. Weep not sister. That doctor's report, hallelujah, is not your death certificate. Whip not brother. Whip not John. The doctor was only basing it upon what he study in the school and that was according to the medical book. But brother, we have the book of the great scientist, the book of the great physician that says by my stripes you were healed. Not that you shall be healed, you were healed already. Whip no brother, whip no sister. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. whip notep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I bring to you tonight &gt;&gt; the glad tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; Whip not at the doctor's report. &gt;&gt; Whip not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just got to take God at his word and only believe. &gt;&gt; Only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as we are closing tonight. Hallelujah. We have the four synotic gospel Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Now all these four gospel they are gospelers. They are not the gospel. They are synopsis. They are the abstract. The book written about the gospel itself. The gospel himself is the Lord Jesus Christ. They are writers. They are gospelers. And that's why you know they can present him the way they saw him for they were placed at different angle to look at the same object from different angle. And the Matthew can say he was the king and you know Mark can say he was the sacrifice. Then you know Luke and say he's the son of man the prophet. But brother when he comes you know to John John look at him and he said this is deity. This is God in human flesh. &gt;&gt; This is the word that was in the beginning with God which was God himself but now made flesh to dwell among us. Are you hearing me tonight? And brothers that was what they saw. And those are the four different anointing that went forth in every generation. And that anointing you know went forth down from the Hisian church to this Leician church. And then we are right here now in this Leician age. And the this Leician age there was an Exodus which was the bride. For the prophet of the almighty God says you know that the Leodian church they are the Pentecostals and the Pentecostal they do not live under the anointing of the age but they are living under the anointing are you hearing me now of the past age but brother we have the anointing of the eagle right here which worked upon John and that's why John was caught up and he can see so many thing amen because he was living under such an anointing and tonight Brother, we have the same anointing upon us that was upon them back then. Hallelujah. Is working right now in the midst of the church to bring Christ the gospel before us. Hallelujah. Deity. Brother Abraham said deity is not in heaven. He said deity is in you. It is Christ in you. Christ in me. The hope of glory. Hallelujah. That's the reason why the message of the hour is all about Christ. &gt;&gt; The message is not about the prophet. The message is not about bra tabernacle. The message is not about literal life church. The message is not about Shakana tabernacle in Nigeria. The message is about Christ. &gt;&gt; For hallelujah, when it shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished. And Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Hallelujah. And the Christ, amen, is not in heaven. His deity revealed. And that that deity is not in heaven. Brother, that deity is in your prophet said that deity will be revealed in man bringing to pass the thought of their heart. The thought of human flesh. Your thought, my thought. Hallelujah. It's not me bringing it to pass. It's not you bringing it to pass, but God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That endures you by the power of the Holy Spirit is bringing to pass what he had in his mind. Hallelujah. Before the foundation of the world. Oh brother, we are good messenger of good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Abraham said he said a messenger. He said you are a messenger this morning. You are a messenger. In the message Hebrews he said you are a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news. He said, "Isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors, that we are angels, the messenger of the resurrection, and we are God's messenger to the sinful world, that Christ lives." &gt;&gt; Amen. In our heart, he lives in our spirit. He lives and he bring us from the Lord the bachelor life of sin and exalt us up and gives us a hallelujah in our soul and make us a new creation. We are messenger angels of the covenant. How wonderful. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. And I ask you tonight, are you a messenger of good news or bad news? &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which messenger are you? &gt;&gt; A messenger of good news or bad news. Because brother Abraham said, you are either a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news. &gt;&gt; But brother, we are messengers of good news. Messenger of the covenant. the covenant, the new testament, which is Christ himself. Hallelujah. With all his power, with his redemptive blessing. Hallelujah. As Jehovah Rafa, as Jehovah jury, Jehovah, at Jehovah Rah. Hallelujah. Oh brother, it's Jesus Christ. Jehovah Shalom, our peace. Hallelujah. Our healing, our life, our redeemer, our shepherd. Hallelujah. Oh brother, we are good news of these things. Jesus Christ turned around to the disciples and says, "You are witnesses of these things." &gt;&gt; And that's what we should be tonight. &gt;&gt; Witnesses of his power, of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And how can you witness that unless you possess him in you? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you know when those 10 spies were sent forth to where to spy the land the land of promise &gt;&gt; 10 of them they came back &gt;&gt; with bad news &gt;&gt; bad report but two of them &gt;&gt; Caleb and Joshua they return with good news &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; g &gt;&gt; those 10 spies bad number they said we are like grasshopper. &gt;&gt; There are giants in the land. We are too small. We cannot take it. But Caleb and Joshua said, "We are more than able &gt;&gt; to take the land." &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us go all at once &gt;&gt; and possess the land for we are more than able." That was the testimony &gt;&gt; of the two witnesses which are the true witnesses. The true messenger, the messenger of good news. Hallelujah. And the length is ours. Are you hearing me tonight? That land is the land that God has promised which is ours. And how do we enter into the land? By one spirit. We are all baptized into the land of good news into Christ. Are you hearing me now? Oh brothers and there are two messenger Caleb and Joshua that made it brother with testimony before the people and they are the one that can say we are more than able. Are you hearing me tonight? And brother Abraham said that Caleb is a type of the believer and the Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. And brother it will be you and the Holy Ghost that will take the land tonight. It is you and the Holy Ghost that will possess the blessing tonight. It is you and the Holy Ghost that will receive, hallelujah, all the promises that are in the book tonight. Nobody will be able to do that. But it will take you and the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. For that is our message. Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you live in. &gt;&gt; Caleb and Joshua, the believer and the Holy Ghost is an atmosphere that you live in. Like that little lady in Syria, she was living in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She has seen it all. Amen. And she was living in there. The prophet said that lady probably you know she has never seen Elisha healed a leper. &gt;&gt; But friends she believed &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; that all things are possible. It's an atmosphere &gt;&gt; that she was living in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. Caleb and Joshua the atmosphere of possibility. Are you hearing me tonight? And we got to live under the atmosphere of possibility. And then you know all of a sudden in the land of our captivity where tonight we are living now in the land of our captivity. Is that right? That's where we live. This earth is not our home. Is a werness of is a wilderness of hallelujah. We are pilgrims and we are strangers. But brother, while we are here, we can live in heaven on earth with testimonies and of good news. Hallelujah. From head to glory. Amen. From this earth until rapture, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And brothers, she said, who my lord &gt;&gt; non were with the prophet in Samaria, &gt;&gt; he would have just recovered of his leprosy. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. And Nema was a great man. He was the captain of the Syrian army. Miracles or deliverance has been wrought through him. But the Bible says but he was a leper. And brother said leprosy is contacted through diet. I mean wrong diet. M &gt;&gt; is a wrong diet brings leprosy &gt;&gt; and that's the situation of the world today. The situation of the church today, the situation of Leician church tonight is leprosy. The Pentecostal church is dominated by the sin of leprosy, by sickness of leprosy. Everywhere leprosy, unbelief is a disease. And that's the reason why tonight you cannot carry Pentecostalism into this message because leprosy. Hallelujah. We don't want it brother. We have been given the word of God. When you don't have the right diet, you will have leprosy. But brother, the word has been open. &gt;&gt; The sins has been opened. The word has been born into existence, vindicated in his full strength. We have balanced diet revealed unto us is set on the table. For Jesus has a tablesp where we can all pay. Hallelujah. We can feed our soul. Tonight on Jesus table, he satisfied the hungry all the time. Hallelujah. No wonder the angel said, "John, go and take the little book and he the little book." Hallelujah. So that John can become the word for thou must prophesy again. And brother, the book that has been opened tonight has been revealed unto us is our diet. We are feasting upon the book. We are feasting upon the word. We are feasting upon the revelation. Hallelujah. Of the word of God. We are not feisting upon creed, upon dogmas, upon tradition. &gt;&gt; We are feasting upon the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; For where the cases, there are the eagles be gathered. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are feisting upon the word. &gt;&gt; No leprosy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are getting bigger all the time, getting stronger all the time. And that's why we can have testimonies, &gt;&gt; testimonies &gt;&gt; of possibilities. And when Neymar had it went to the king of Syria and the king of Syria wrote a letter, give it to the king of Israel when you get there. And brothers, he was taken a roundabout. But that lady, the prophet said, did not talk about the king, the political leader. But he only talked about the prophet. Amen. She was talking about the prophet. She was not talking about who? About the king, about political leader. And brothers and sister, this bride of Jesus Christ and the prophet and the spirit. The prophet said they will be saying the same thing. We are not preaching politics. We are not preaching economics. We are not preaching prosperity. We are not preaching worldly worldliness. We are not preaching materialism. We are preaching about Jesus Christ. He is our message. He is our gospel. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. That is our gospel. That is our message. And we are standing on that. Hallelujah. And he's changing not from glory to glory. Hallelujah. He's the same tonight. The same way he was then, he's the same right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are preaching. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the king took his garment when he read a letter and he tore it and he said, "Are my God that I should make leaf or that I should I should kill." Luke is seeking quarry. The king thought the days of miracles were over. But when the Elijah Elishah the prophet had said bring him here and he shall know that there's a king in Israel, there is a God in Israel. Hallelujah. And then when Nan got there, Elijah the prophet did not even come out. He has no business to come out because he was engaged in his presence. He told one of the messenger, one of the servant, he said, "Go and tell him to wash in Jordan seven times." And that's all. And the messenger came out and stood before Captain Neymar. I said, "Captain sir, the prophet said, the prophet said, the prophet said, &gt;&gt; the prophet said, &gt;&gt; the prophet said, the prophecy." Hallelujah. How many of you believe with me tonight? Amen. The prophet said, and that's why we are here tonight to tell you the prophecy. The prophecy. The prophecy. The prophecy. You believe the message? I don't have any message of my own, but the prophecy. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. The prophet said, the prophet said, the prophet said, but Abraham said in every age, he said God does not just only raise up messenger for the generation, he said, but God raise up wonderful helpers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said God will raise up young men that will carry this message and preach it in a more powerful way than it is now. Hallelujah. God's prophet ordained 5 &gt;&gt; to carry this message. Amen. Brother Abraham told us God raise up faithful men. Hallelujah. And Apostle Paul, he places those faithful men to pastor those churches. Hallelujah. And that's the work of the five tonight. The work of the five tonight, they can play, but they can preach as well because they will only say what the message say. They will only say what the prophet say. That is, you know, their job. They will enter into the realms of God. They will be anointed with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. And they will continue to say the same thing &gt;&gt; that the prophet has said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm here tonight, brother, to tell you the prophet said. The prophet said, the prophet said, Oh, praise the Lord. You believe the message tonight? Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; And non misunderstood supernatural and he was rot and he started to leave and he was going. But one of the boys said, "Captain sir, if you said habaner and and vaper are better than the waters of Damascus, You want to keep your leprosy and if you want to keep your leprosy you can go ahead captain sir if that prophet told you something higher &gt;&gt; or heavier you know something greater than what he told you wouldn't you do it then he thought let me give it a try and he went down to river Jordan. The prophet said he went down tiptoeing and when he got in the river, he ducked inside Jordan. The first time the prophet said seven times. &gt;&gt; Second time is dirty water. &gt;&gt; The third time some bubbles. It doesn't want it because it was daring &gt;&gt; but brother seven times &gt;&gt; seven times &gt;&gt; seven completion &gt;&gt; brothers and I want to tell you tonight full obedience &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; to the word &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; total obedience to the word complete obedience to the word Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will give you your blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jordan means death. Seven means completion. &gt;&gt; Perfect. You must perfectly die &gt;&gt; to that idea &gt;&gt; that there is something better. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Than the message of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Habana and vapa. The waters of Damascus are better. &gt;&gt; You must die to that idea. &gt;&gt; You must let that idea die. Perish. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Die to your superstitions. &gt;&gt; Die to your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Die to creed and dogmas. &gt;&gt; To whatever you have ever cherished in life. You got to die to it. &gt;&gt; You must submit yourself. Apostle Paul says I die daily. There are a lot of things brothers you know we God will die to them. That's why we don't see God is because we are misunderstanding supernatural. We are trying you know to you know to to to to to bring in things you know that are not part of the message. &gt;&gt; Things that are not what the prophet said. We are trying to esport them. press things into the revival into the gospel of the bride. But Abraham said the prophet, the spirit and the bride, they'll be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; And brother, we got to say it now. We got to die. &gt;&gt; And the when the man die completely to everything, are you hearing me in church? Then his flesh became like that of a little baby. Oh, praise the Lord. And we serve the same God tonight. If that God can give nan good earth, good body, new body. Amen. It's the same God that we are serving tonight. If we can die to unbelief, die to Christ and dogmas and our own ideas. Amen. Church, we can receive our desire tonight. Amen. That same God that gave n man good body flesh like that of a little baby. He can give you the healing. Hallelujah. God gave you know a boy one time in the ministry of the prophet a new set of lung. We are living we are serving the same God tonight. He can give you a new set of lung. He can give you a new set of kidney. It can give you a new set of pancrea. It can give you a new heart. He can give you a new body, a new fresh. Hallelujah. He can give you your sight. He's the same God that we are serving tonight. How many of you believe with me? God bless you. God bless you, pastor. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; I said I feel inspired by that story of non tonight and uh I could go ahead and preach on with it a little bit more, but I'll hold it till Sunday. I think I I got I think I got my service for Sunday. Praise be to God. How many can say amen? And if you didn't say it during the sermon, go ahead and say it now if you agree. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh to have a window into the word the way that we have it through our brother tonight and all the services we hear. It's a window to see what we were before the fall to see the the the what Adam was in the image of God, what he did, what he acted like. And we think, "Oh, that's just so far above us." But Calvar's to restore us back to everything that lost. Whether you feel like that tonight or not, it's what the word says. It's what Calvary did. It's to bring us back as sons of God back to that position again where things aren't controlling us, but we're controlling things. And I think it was a rich word tonight. We are blessed. You can't put a price tag on what you heard, your heart heard tonight. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And we should rejoice in the Lord. Praise be to God. And Gideon, both the Gideonss working under the Holy Ghost tonight, what did he sing? We can create an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And that's what he preached tonight. We create an atmosphere. We have the power to do it. Even living in that little servant girl, living there with non. And she's just she's in captivity. She's not in the right place, but she's being a light. She's being a testimony. And she's saying, "There's a prophet in the land. If you go see him, you can be healed of that leprosy. We're lights in this dark world." Can you say amen? And in captivity, she could create her own atmosphere by testifying in a bad job. In a Can you say amen? In a atmosphere work that's just perverted. It doesn't matter. Lord, help me to create my own atmosphere here. How many believe you can do it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what our sister Rebecca's song said, too. Praise the Lord that we can create that atmosphere. We believe it. Father, we thank you for this precious word tonight. Lord, we are grateful every time the word is broken, the bread is broken to us this way. And Lord, we find, how is it, Lord, that a brother across the other side of the world, Lord, can come and find a kindred spirit, find something that registers in our hearts and our souls, it's because Lord, the same message, the same Holy Ghost is teaching him is the same one that's teaching us. And Lord, we can say, "Amen. We can our hearts can rejoice in it at a revival because Lord, we know that Father, this isn't a work of man. This isn't a political work. This isn't a work of man at all. This is your word, Father. And we stand upon that foundation. Bless us and help us tonight, Lord, as we worship and sing together and just pour praises upon this word. That's what our prophet said. You just just water this word with our praise. And as we do that, Father, I pray it bring forth a crop in our lives. Bless and help and strengthen your people, we pray. And bless our brother and his journey and his ministry in Nigeria. He has blessed our church. He has put a blessing on our elders. He has put a blessing on this. He said so many things. Lord, may you bless brother Gideon's ministry back home.
