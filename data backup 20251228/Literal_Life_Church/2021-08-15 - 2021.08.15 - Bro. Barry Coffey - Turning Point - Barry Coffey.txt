========================================

going to head the men's meeting so if everything these days is lord willing lord willing takes on extra meaning these days and that's the way it should on september 24th to the 26th then everything you need to know is on the men's meeting dot org website so that's the registration still open there's still a few uh slots that are available there brother paul mentioned being busy uh this uh this season of our lives and i just wanted to share a little bit with you this morning about vision books and what we're doing there uh it's it's become something that is uh larger than we expected but uh it's been a blessing to many many people and uh there was nobody in the world who's uh doing large-scale printing of the message uh at the moment and so the lord laid it on our hearts to be able to uh take the message and to be able to print it we print it offshore uh and we're able to distribute in many many countries around the world these this is a picture of uh a series of six books we did in the bemba language in zambia and when i was there two years ago uh there's a whole section i think there's something like 20 million people who speak bimba in that part of the world and there's many many believers who are there they've never had books in their language before they've had some recordings with translations but they've never had books before and these are people who live in very very primitive conditions uh no electricity no water and they live in huts and caves and there's believers among them and they're just so excited there's kind of a revival going on just because now these evangelists can go and they can preach and they can witness and they can share materials and leave things with them we're in the process of waiting for the publishing of bibles in the bemba language we have sent english bibles to them but they've hardly ever seen a bimba bible you've got to understand that in your town you have very few christian bookstores left in in most third world countries there are none at all there never have been for years and so to have access to a bible for them is a really extraordinary thing and so uh by god's grace we've been able to supply bibles to many many nations around the world and uh it's uh it's just been very exciting so uh this is a one of on the left here is one of the missionaries we sponsor about 30 missionaries who travel in different parts of africa and when they're able to go they tell us that there's very few people who come out of denominations even who've been in denominational churches all their lives who've ever seen a bible they've never had one and so this is a a big issue for them and they're just excited to have their own their own materials here this is just a picture of some of the places where books are gone and and for instance we ship materials into malawi and malawi feeds about four or five other countries that uh that that they have access to because they're kind of stuck right in the middle of a bunch of other nations and so it's kind of an exponential thing for books to be traveling to that part of the world i like this picture here i wanted to show it to you because this is a lady here who's looking up some things in her bible the brother on the right yellow shirt he's an evangelist and a missionary and he's instructing this husband and wife in things in her bible i'm going to take the same picture and blow it up here's her bible so that bible's had a lot of use and they hang on to bibles like that because they can't replace them and uh it's just for them to let that bible go that would be a terrible thing they just they just want to hang on to it until they can't read it anymore so it's really exciting but these missionaries are traveling among uh these are messiah people in eastern africa and tanzania and they're just excited to have these materials brother anwar does a lot of translating still in in new york and we have because pakistan is a muslim country we cannot import christian materials into pakistan so we print within the country and right now they're at the last stages of printing the seven or seven seals book we've already done the seven church age book and you can see on his motorcycle there he's got bundles of books that he's bringing around to rural areas and a very dangerous part of the world but these missionaries are so excited to have uh you know books in their language that they're just excited so they've got supplies now that they can give out to all their converts and old and young people who are able to read they're able to have their own copy of the book and this is the church age book that they have here that's brother anwar's brother on the right uh octar and he's given out books to some of his folks there and actually teaching to read at the same time they have reading classes because 75 percent of pakistani people are illiterate and they can't read so this is exciting for them to be able to have their bibles and in the read as well this is a group from brother ron borthwick's church brother ron passed away a couple of years ago and uh this is a group from the church brother mekwee is the pastor there now and uh they're receiving books in great britain and english english language there i thought this was a great picture i mean uh you couldn't make this up these are horse riders going into the mountains in remote villages uh in an undisclosed area they didn't want us to say where this is but they've got their saddlebags full of church age books in spanish and they're bringing the the books around the people in honduras were so um zealous about spreading books that uh they've had several reprints of of books already once we establish a connection within the country and get the import straightened out we're able to reprint and reprint and so the people in honduras they travel all over the place and and get books out it's just really exciting to do that this is another place in uh in honduras and those people get the books they're just excited in their churches there to be able to have materials on their own and again this is uh east africa here messiah people i've got literally thousands and thousands of pictures like this and testimonies and stories of people receiving new bibles and materials like that and so it's just exciting for this for this part of the world to be receiving materials you can see the there's many many churches that we've got pictures of that look just like the building in the background there one of the most exciting places though where things are happening is in malawi and this is brother precious makatanji and he is the lead translator in malawi and uh malawi is just uh you know thanks to some believers we've got over a hundred thousand dollars worth of new bibles distributed among people in the backwoods part of malawi over the last two or three months and uh as we speak there are three different shipments coming from three different places in the world into malawi and one of the shipments contains sermons like this there's three sermons in this booklet here and uh these are uh these are are printed together in one little booklet to cut the cost down and a book like this costs 8.6 cents per booklet so we printed 480 000 of these for the believers in malawi in the chichewa language and they're on route now they're matter of fact just a couple of days away from uh from malawi and uh they're just let me tell you they're they're already have revivals have already broken out in the country uh for uh for the expectation that they have as they haven't had books since 2003 they haven't had any materials brought to them and so they're very excited about uh having their own uh materials and so brother uh precious has been instrumental in helping to establish things over there with some of the other older brothers that are there some of them uh brother paddington and uh brother jim has worked with malawi for a lot of years and done a fabulous work there and this is this is just renewing the hearts of the people over there and they're just very excited so these are some of the bibles that are going into the back parts of the country one pastor made a little video recording and he said for the last 10 years he said i never had any books and never had my own bible so i preached from my phone for the last 10 years that's what he would bring to the pulpit and he would preach from his phone two years ago he said his phone broke and it was no replacing so imagine now he's he's preaching to his congregation without a bible without any message books uh he came in he came in the message after books were available so he had he has nothing but he believes the message and preaches it every a couple of times every week and and has has no resources whatsoever and he was just so excited to be able to have his own bible and uh we you're all looking at me funny like you know what's the big deal about having a bible if you haven't ever had a bible and you're a preacher in this message to get your own bible is a really extraordinary thing and they're very excited let me tell you so uh this is this is just really neat but now like i say the the the effect of this the net effect of this is just uh you know rippling through these uh countries and uh people are blessed i brought along uh one of the copies this is the first copy of the book to be printed in india and it's in the shona language and we have a young minister in our church who's from zimbabwe and he speaks the shona language and so we re we printed the church age book for these believers there and this is this is just absolutely wonderful to be able to have this and the quality uh it's made so that it doesn't fall apart in the african heat uh if you just glue it it'll fall apart when it gets hot enough so they stitch it and glue it and um you know make it uh very durable so to print this book and we have printed in the millions of these not this particular language but of these books it costs us 86 cents per book so that's why we're able to do so many and and uh be able to distribute them so far so it's it's uh it's just a blessing you know for the uh for the saints over there and uh brother paul and and your mission group here has been very supportive and we appreciate that very much uh it's it's that's the way it operates and to me uh having the fivefold ministry in a particular country they're the ones who decide what's printed then they take the books when they arrive and they distribute them fairly among the churches over there there's a lot of work that's being done through the five-fold ministry in those nations there and i think that's the way it should happen i think that the ministry should have a say in how that's done so we're just a part of that process and uh at vision books and we just facilitate the need and uh we thank you for all the support uh that's been given uh so why don't we stand to our feet i don't want to take too much time here this morning and let's take our bibles if you don't mind let's go to jeremiah the 29th chapter we'll take a little study there this morning and i'd like to title this a turning point um just as we begin i just want to say there's a lot of folks that we haven't seen in a while it's great to see the hatfields here and the terries and good to see sister loretta uh here this morning may god bless you and uh all of our friends here it's it's just wonderful to be able to reconnect and may god bless you uh jeremiah chapter 29 this is a familiar passage of scripture to us and i wanted to read uh just beginning if you don't mind that let's begin at verse 10 for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place so this is literally a turning point this is this is not yet this is going to be in 70 years because they're moving out to babylon and then in 70 years things will take a turn and you will return back to this place for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place once i caused you to be carried away captive heavenly father we thank you lord for the reading of the word and now we pray you'd pour yourself out upon it and bless it to our hearts make it real make it personal in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this morning god bless you now let me just give you this little quotation i'm not going to rely too much on this here this morning but just to get us some key statements there but i just wanted to say this about brother paul uh this morning and uh like he said he and i we've not been together a great deal over the last little while but i appreciate his work and here's what brother branham said about a pastor he said what we need in our churches is a man that's got an absolute you should be thankful that you have a pastor that has an absolute today a man of god that will stand tied to the word and to christ and to bring that congregation under that condition of where each member walks in the condition of this word seeing that word manifested and follow them these signs shall follow them that believe i'll tell you what it's a blessing to be able to have a a man of god who stands with the word of god knows what the absolute is and doesn't vary from that but brings the congregation under the condition of that word in other words getting the people ready for the next series of events that are taking place and this was on my heart this morning and i i just uh i'm just gonna look to him i've never really dealt with this subject per se before but i just felt on my heart the last couple of days that we would talk a little bit about this idea of a turning point and i believe we're on the cusp or the edge of a reality shift in our world uh there are things that are imminent things that are going to happen every single in indicator uh in our world whether it's financial or political or social uh spiritual every indicator is pointing towards an imminent change that's taken place and uh turning corners is something that brother branham talked about uh over his ministry he talked about it in several different places and uh it was certainly an interesting thing for him to uh describe it the way that he did so uh brother branham he he uses this phrase uh all through his ministry but he refers to it this way only at the end of his ministry and i found in my research i've found this is the first place where he makes this statement in particular about our time watch what he says he says the trouble of it is today that the churches will speak and say well what did moody say and what did sankey say he said this is the way that people will do it they'll look backwards to see what other men who were used of god what they said they're looking backwards and he said but speak and say what god said let's go forward and not back. now you remember brother branham said it's he said it's it's uh common for people to look back at what god did and look ahead to what god's going to do and fail to realize what god's doing in the present right but he says now what we need to do is to speak speak the word of the hour and say what god has said and let's go forward and not look back he said go this way i think it's wonderful that we've had a prophet that pointed us in a definite direction to so that we could know exactly where we need to go he said it's hard on these turning corners church don't want to believe that they're always referring back from their educational standpoint he said of course that's a school and stuff that's what schools do they they learn a method or they learn a viewpoint they learn a way and they uh you know they they promote that way they teach that way and he said but that's what schools do that's what they're that's what their job is that's what their mandate is but now that's not us that's what schools do right so he says that's they they learn through their book learning they that's that's the the way that they learn but we know so he's talking about them but we know that's us now he's talking about we know that through experience of trusting god and knowing that he does this in other words we know by experience that god turns corners doesn't he even when it's not politically correct even when it's not popular god still turns corners god does the unexpected in the early church in in the book of acts chapter 13 when paul took the gospel from the jews and gave it to the gentiles it was a it was a turning point that there was not a jew in the in the world who would have appreciated what paul did they didn't even understand what paul did they thought they were the people of the covenant they thought they were the people who had a corner or a monopoly on on the on the promises and the prophets and the word of god and access to god they thought they had it and paul took it and turned it to the gentiles it was a major turning point in the history of the church but we know through experience god does this so it's not surprising to us that we see in the last day that god's doing the same thing and we're at a point where things are changing that things are turning and therefore your let me let me say it this way i believe there's a special type of grace that's given to the people that have to turn corners and to be able to go in a direction following the leadership of god even when it's not visible but there's a special type of grace that's given to people who have to turn corners and follow god into into a future like we're facing here because it is not logical it is not obvious we're actually walking to the change of our body we're walking to the marriage supper none of us have ever seen the marriage supper we're walking to a millennium none of us have ever seen the millennium but we believe it's there by faith don't we and so the this this exercise of your faith being being developed or grown to a place where you're actually going to walk out of this body and walk off the earth and join with our loved ones and take your seat at the marriage supper that is an exercise of faith that's going to require a step of faith and i believe that what god is doing is conditioning us or teaching teaching us to go through that transition even when the world speaks of other things and the world denies what you believe and the world is redefining everything that god has defined everything that's sacred is now seemingly up for redefinition in the eyes of the world but i will tell you something that's why i appreciate a man that has an absolute i appreciate god establishing an absolute in our day reestablishing the word of god as an absolute because without it we'd be floundering like everybody else out in there in the world wondering what is right wondering which way to go wondering what's next and having no clear idea or clear vision of what god is actually doing in the world around us and so brother bam said turning corners is hard and if you rely on education you're going to fall back on what other people have said about our time let me tell you i mean we know that nobody really got it right when it come to the opening of the word in the open book in the last day nobody really got it right brother bam said i studied all those writers and the you know the church fathers over those years and he said i had conclusions made when it came to the preaching on the seven seals and he said i was wrong about all of it the holy spirit had to come into the room and give him that understanding of the word of god personally and so therefore if we're relying on something that's back it's it's not going to be clear like god has made it clear in our time so i i think like i say i think there's a special kind of grace i believe that god don't tell me that god doesn't have a sense of humor he does have a sense of humor he chose us for the last and the greatest age on earth for the gentile people and you're looking around saying you know yeah i'm right and you look in the mirror and you think wow i'm just full of faults and failures i can't get my kids uh to pick up their socks in their bedroom and uh it's hard to make ends meet financially and all the other things that go on but yet god and his sovereignty chose you to live in the last day in the greatest of all of the ages to take the greatest of all the messages and embrace it in such a way that it would so quick in your body that your body your flesh would actually drop and you would elevate you would be elevated into a dimension that the world knows nothing about that the world doesn't see they don't they're not in tune with at all it's almost like the world is listening to am and we're tuned into fm right i mean they have a different priority they have a different way of of seeing things they have a different expectation about what tomorrow holds and it's almost like they're locked into am and god's got the bride tuned into fm over these years we may think we're a part of the slowest movement on the face of the earth you may be sitting there thinking well you know really nothing happens i remember brother brandon i'm talking to brother matson bozey in chicago and brother manhattan loved him and loved to go to that church there and he said about uh one time in a conversation brother bran and i don't have it on this screen here but brother branham said in a conversation with him he said brother brother branham uh his brother jose was telling him he said i i prayed and i fasted for years that god would shake chicago that god would send a revival here and you know that god would do something he said we've longed for that we've thirsted for that and we pray that god would do that and he said i'm an old man now and he said i i just am so disheartened that it's never happened in our time brother branham said brother jose he said you're a great smart man you're a theologian and he said you're learned it in the word he said i could never touch you uh in terms of learning and scholarship but he said one thing about you he said you have terrible discernment that's what he said you have terrible discernment he said because a lot of people he says can be in the middle of something that god is doing and fail to recognize the the the actual uh power that god has exercised in a place and people are looking over the top of that they're looking for something great they're looking for something uh fantastic by their own expectations and he said brother jose god has already shaken chicago god has already shaken this place by sending a message in this last day and by sending a word in this last time brother branham says that again he says in 1964 you're familiar with this idea he says now we're building a building not a wall and the builders want to take a line of blocks and go straight down any builder can do that but it takes a real master mechanic or real master builder to turn the corner and when you get to the corner it shows whether you're really a stone mason or not when you can bring turn the corner and keep the continuity of the rest of the building so that's important not just to turn it but to turn it in continuity with the rest of the of the building or the blueprint and he said it's on those corners when troubles come the builders want to keep on building on down but we're not building a wall we're building a building it's a change it's a change that god brings it's a change that god mandates if you don't mind take your bible i don't have this in your on the screen either in genesis the sixth chapter this is familiar you you know the story of noah obviously but just to take a couple of words here in genesis chapter 6 and verse 4 there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of daughters i i'm i'm reading genesis 6 and 4 came into the daughters in unto the daughters of men they bear children to them and the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth the word wickedness there is a is a powerful word in the hebrew it it means two things it means first of all arrogance they had an arrogance in that time and god saw the arrogance of the people the arrogance of people that will look in the face of god and look in the face of the history of the world it's only 2000 years old at this point but look in the face of it and say you know what it doesn't matter what god has said it doesn't matter what god requires it doesn't matter what god's conditions or god's standards are really it doesn't matter we're going to do our own thing and that attitude even carried over beyond the ark when nimrod said we're going to build a tower so that god won't be able to destroy us ever again right and there's an arrogance i mean in our world as an arrogance today there's lots of people that will shake their fist at god and say it doesn't matter there are people in the realms of government who will say hey the word of god has no place in the halls of government in our country this is a far cry from where we where we originated this is a a far cry from where we were but there's an arrogance in the hearts of the people and god identified that in genesis chapter 6 prior to the flood we know that obviously as it was in the days of noah so will it be today that's the first part of that word wickedness the second part is from where we get our word related to cancer which is malignant now if you take the word malignant and divide it into two ignorant is the the root word for fire like we ignite a fire and a fire a malignant tumor in your body is the wrong kind of fire that's growing mal means it's like malware it's a malady it is something that is negative and when you have a negative fire burning in your body we say that somebody who has cancer has a malignant tumor it means that it's a fire out of control it's going to destroy that's what that means when god identified the problem in the days of noah he saw the wickedness of men was great they had an arrogance and unchecked that's going to grow to the place where they would engulf the whole world if possible and god would have to destroy it all that's the way god viewed the days of noah as it was in the days of noah it's no stretch to believe that that's exactly where we find ourselves today isn't that right that if left to themselves men would change every law everything that's decent they would confuse every young person is born about their gender they would change the you know the boundaries of morality they would crush everything that is holy and righteous if time went on long enough let me tell you but as it was in the days of noah god's going to shut it down god's going to judge it and take the righteous elect off the face of the earth and i'm glad i can say i'm one of them [Applause] can i give you just a little example here and i i don't want to belabor this point but let me just say give you a couple of things here that i wanted to share with you this morning uh in relation to this about where we've come to because this is also a transition or turning point that we've come to and i i i do this i have uh i have sons who are a lot smarter than i am and they're good researchers and and they sent me some material protestants no longer make up a majority of the u.s adult population that's quite a that's quite a turning point that's quite a place we've come to that that there's less than 50 percent of of adults in the united states who uh you know identify as christians or believe the bible and this this also is corresponding to the rise of nuns i mentioned nuns last night nuns are people who want to have no connection with the bible no connection with god no affiliation with the church no kind of a moral standard uh presented to them they don't want to they won't hear anything about it they are they have none no religion whatsoever and there is a corresponding rise of nuns with the decline of of christians and protestants in our world and they did this huge study in 2007 it was called a religious landscape study and they found that 51.3 percent in 2007 identified as protestants that number is dropping so in every uh in every measure they find there are fewer christians in our country so therefore correspondingly our government's gonna change right if there are fewer people who respect the bible then obviously they're going to be fewer elected officials in the bible i'm just i'm just telling you how uh what i what i've noticed here and in the south those not affiliated with religion or nuns rose they're rising so it's not so much the bible belt anymore it's just a belt that's a we that's how we refer to it and lots and lots and lots of churches now are just becoming apartment complexes uh in the south it's it's constantly rising in the northeast it's climbed to 25 percent one-fourth of the population are considered nuns in the west nuns are larger than any religious group making up 28 to the public now watch non-religious americans have become increasingly organized since 2007 forming political groups designed to keep religion out of public life so a nun is not just a description and none is a verb as well it means that we have an agenda we are not just going to opt out a religion we're going to make sure everybody else opts out of religion in the same way that france made it a contrary to the law uh this this week to homeschool in their country it's against the law now so there there's an agenda that's ongoing here uh there's a you know there's a fuel on the fire here that uh turns everything blue well why don't we stay on our feet and sing of course and we'll go home but by every state you can go down through every state and you see the systematic decline by state of the number of christians in every part of the nation now i didn't have that i couldn't blow this up properly but the title of this little graphic here is america's views of the moral acceptability of issues it's the view of americans in general the whole population of the moral acceptability of things in other words do you find this morally acceptable now or not and this is what it says i don't know where we've gone here but for instance the first thing on that the first thing on that list is uh birth control divorce and fornication and you can see the numbers here that people would think that it's morally acceptable to practice these things gay relations gambling children born out of wedlock assisted suicide that's physician-assisted suicide and abortion you can see that the majority of americans believe that that's morally acceptable wow that's really an incredible thing they also did a survey to try to find out what what source do teenagers rely on when it comes to common sense and moral guidance who are teenagers in the country turning to now to get guidance and you can see that down the list is religious teachers and religious leaders and religious teachings and so forth so a lot of young people today are depending on either parents family members or their practical experience and common sense uh i'm sorry but a 16 year old doesn't have a lot of common sense a matter of fact no offense i don't think they have any i said no offense so they also don't have a lot of practical experience i got a little more practical experience than my sons do just by virtue of age and exposure and you know pastors and ministers we have a little bit of a little bit of an insight into how things are and and let me tell you if if young people today are relying on their peers and they're relying on their own insight to figure out the moral standard that they should live by our nation is in trouble and that's contrary to scripture here's what the bible says come me children and hearken unto me and i will teach you it's not meant for you to figure it out yourself you are to be faithfully taught by somebody who is in the faith and is able to impart wisdom unto you the bible also says in proverbs 13 he that walketh with the wise shall be wise and if you want to be wise you hang around with smart people and not people your own age but you find a wise person and learn from them but a companion of fools in other words contemporaries contemporaries share their lack of experience and their lack of insight and a companion of fools shall be destroyed so god knew that 16 18 year olds would not really be able to make solid life decisions about what's acceptable and what's right like you know to know the dangers of gambling to say that most people believe that gambling is okay let me tell you gambling is a spirit it's caused by a spirit hello it's not a good thing and it can get a hold of somebody and it can destroy families and marriages and cause great loss in the lives of people it's not a good thing but there's a lot of people now that feel like in our in our country and in our culture hey that you know it's it's acceptable it's okay so you got a brother barry why are you talking about this and where's this coming from well they did a massive survey a little while ago with 4 500 independent pastors and officials in churches and i asked them to define what the successful church is if you're wondering why the values and the morals of our nation are skewed you wonder why so many young people are messed up today and why we have the rise of nuns in our time and they asked these ministers currently how would you define a successful church what components are needed to have a successful church and they gave five top answers and here they are number one the amount of money you bring in is the number one indicator of how successful your church is number two the number of people in attendance well if that's your two top criteria and you're not going to say things that are going to offend people's lifestyle right you're not going to talk about trimming hair you're not going to talk about uh you know you know abstaining from things or you're not going to you're not going to offend the masses if the masses are are helping you to become numb the number one church in the state right you got to preach a generic feel-good gospel where everybody's you know feels user-friendly and uh you know leaves out feeling good and sung nice songs and kumbaya 50 times and we'll walk out and feel good about ourselves and now you know i'm glad i know jesus and all the rest of it right you're not gonna you're not gonna preach the gospel like brother branham preaches you're not gonna roll up your sleeves and lay it out and confront the spirit of the age and deal with the immorality of our time and deal with the consequences of sexual sin you're not going to you're not going to approach that uh in if if you need to have lots of people and lots of people bringing lots of money you're not going to do that matter of fact if you want to hold on to the people who are under 40 you got to do some entertaining you got to bring in the kind of music that they want and you got to find out what they want and and provide that instead of finding out what god wants and preaching the gospel and being instant in season and out of season it's a complete reversal of where we should be and you wonder why people are mixed up in our time you wonder why people don't know they've got the complete graph there that i just showed you upside down those things should be an abomination to our uh to our hearts in our nation here that's not about how our nation was founded that's not how we began that's not how we started out on a good moral foundation not at all but listen let's not just put it off to people out there in the world like brother branham didn't do it let's just say this that when stuff is around long enough it becomes normalized in everybody's eyes and there are things that you were offended with when they first came out but we watch it enough on our on our on our cable or whatever else our our netflix or whatever you know what we're not as grieved by it as we used to be and that's called a process of normalization it's become normalized in our time let's be honest folks and stop polishing your halo right there our children are exposed to all kinds of things that are immoral in their schools and you were grieved at it at the first but nobody said anything and now our kids become normalized well that's the way families are you know two dads and two moms and all the other things that are going on and there's no reapproach for divorce there's no reports for child reproach or childlessness there's none of that anymore and we as people we just kind of fall asleep because the supreme court said so well you know what that's not god's way that's not god's way when john the baptist rolled into town and herod was up to what he was up to john the baptist just didn't go to his own little corner and his own little group and preached to them he stood out in the in the marketplace and he said the woman you're living with now is not your lawful husband it cost him his head but he did not stop anyway he was a voice crying in the wilderness and i say the only voice for morality and reason today that's left is right here in this room the people who know better the people who understand the standards of god and the heart of god those are the people i'm preaching to this morning i don't believe we should just roll over and be passive i don't think you need to run for office i wouldn't advise you to do that but i'll tell you when you have an opportunity in the marketplace in which you operate i don't believe that it hurts for you to say i want you to know that i don't stand for that i stand for the things that are found in scripture i stand for the word of god and i'm not ashamed of it i'm not ashamed of the standards that god has raised in our time i'm not ashamed of backing down because god has said so in the world says something contrary that's the arrogance that we found back in the days before the flood and when god saw that there came a point where god says i cannot deal with that anymore i cannot reverse that i'm going to take the righteous and destroy the rest and we're living right at the same time and that's why i say i believe we're living on the cusp of a real reality change and there's a lot of people going to be looking to god to find an answer when the bride is gone because if i understand it right brother braham said there's lots of people in tribulation looking for a solution and saying wasn't there supposed to be a message come first and the world's been shaken and they missed it the third thing is the number of staff meetings the number four is square footage i mean you guys are up there on that one and then the number of programs offered those are the five things that churches use as a criteria or a measurement in terms of whether they're successful or not it's not anything about preaching the word and being in season or being sensitive to god or having access to god nothing like that these are the standards so therefore you're going to have your message tailored to be able to increase these numbers right here because it's all about measurement it's all about measurement but when it comes to the people of god it's not about measurement because it doesn't really matter how many people are here and it doesn't matter how new your carpet is it matters about the spiritual maturity and the spiritual growth of the people of god because god is preparing you for another kingdom not to live in this one this world's falling apart god's preparing you for another kingdom in another place so this carpet doesn't matter and the kind of car you drive doesn't matter and the amount of money you have in a bank really doesn't matter and how well you sing really doesn't matter i'll tell you what matters is that you're in tune with god and god has access to you that you have access to god and god has access to you it's a great thing for you to feel like you have access to god and you can pray to god and he hears you but i'll tell you what it's a more important thing that god has access to me that he can visit me anytime that he can change my body any time he can take me where he wants me to go anytime and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the world says what the world does enoch walked right through that time and was unscathed by that world and god took him for he was not hallelujah so i mentioned this last night and i don't want to dwell on it except to make a point this is an article about the equality act the equality act has changed quite a bit uh it's still lurking around uh different other bills that are going through uh the halls of congress right now but uh this was an article describing that but i wanted to this was this was actually in in the magazine christianity today which is the largest christian ministers magazine in the world and uh he was describing how that uh the the protestant evangelical community has wavered in their convictions about marriage and sexuality and you might as well say amen because we are looking at that wholesale even the methodist church and all the other groups out there that have wavered and said how do we hang on to the younger generation how do we be considered tolerant and how do we uh you know how do we be all inclusive and how do we get this younger generation in the church well the only way we're going to do that is to redefine the standards we're going to redefine uh what's right about uh same-sex relationships and so forth it's a bunch of malarkey it's a bunch of baloney but nonetheless this is what this person says so the pardon bold the headwinds against socially conservative positions that's us by the way if you're not clear that's us do you agree we have a socially conservative position we're really socially conservative if you haven't figured that out we're on we're on the on the you know the amish side almost the headwinds against us and people who take a socially conservative position i mean we really don't care what society says right in terms of the word of god our standards we don't care the headwinds against socially conservative positions on marriage and religious liberty are stronger than ever you can expect that they will get stronger all the time but now here's what the author wrote and this is an incredible statement i underlined it here he says where should today's evangelicals go from here this is the leading christian magazine in the world today and he's asking the question here where do we go from here can you imagine being a part of a mainline protestant denomination today and you feel like that your eternal destiny is based on what they believe and the leaders of that movement are saying well where do we go from here what do we do now all right you you don't you don't even know what i'm talking about because you know where you're going from here by god's grace we know where we're going we know where this is leading we know that there's only two destinies for the people of this earth right and one of them is the tribulation and the other one is the marriage supper and there's nothing in between we know where we're going but to be a part of a movement that that claims to be christian and protestant and bible believing and they're asking the question i'm not but they're asking the question where do we go from here in other words what do we do now the solutions we tried didn't work the changes we made did not work and everything about us seems to be falling apart my goodness where do we go from here and the government's hot on their heels changing laws squeezing them and squeezing them continually listen folks i'm not making this up this is the stuff that's happening this is the stuff that's going on right now there's a culture shift there has been a progressive culture shift in our time one of my sons sent me an article this morning and i didn't have time to put it on uh this right here but it was a very interesting article and i'll send it to brother paul so he can have it here but the article is in a mainstream media forum and it talks about why women are not having as many children as they used to and the article i i just kind of glanced at first and then i went back and looked at it closely and i just sent back one word to my son who sent me the article i just said wow because this is exactly what brother branham said would happen this is exactly what uh the mindset of the people would be here's here's a sentence or two out of that article this woman uh she's 35 years old now she's been married for four years and she's uh she's laying out her case as to why she doesn't have children all right and this is their choice and she says uh levy says that she and her husband have realized that they prefer their current lifestyle they own a condo and they are loving parents to their dog and though they both earn a comfortable living they'd rather spend their money on things that they love you know what that is that's a reflection of a mindset that is different than us can i go a little further hey they're out there asking the largest denomination protestant denomination in a nation is fracturing they're about to split and they're split over political issues i mean it's just incredible that they're so wound up on political issues and backing political candidates and political viewpoints that they've lost their way which is exactly what brother branham said would happen they would lose their way and they wander in darkness and without a vision the people perish how many believe that without a vision the people perish listen it's an understatement for me it's common your pastor says it all the time every minister says that how grateful we should be for the clear vision that god has given to us in the last day that lets us know exactly where we need to be and exactly where we're going you may feel like you're involved in the slowest process of in time but i'll tell you god knows exactly what he's given to you he knows exactly what you need he knows exactly what you need to hear he knows exactly your station in life he knows where to bring it to the next spot and he knows exactly how to prepare your heart for the change of your body and that's the thing you got to let god do it may not be apparent in the cosmos but i'll tell you in the hearts of god's people people who are hard after god they wait on god and they look to god and lord it may not be obvious or physical in my eyes it may not be something i can put my hand on but i believe by faith you're moving us closer to that kingdom and you've got to have that anchored in your heart you've got to believe that god is actually at work in the bride of christ whether getting the message out or you know bringing the last one in or however it works or god dealing with you about some of your issues and your complexes and your hey listen whether god's dealing with somebody in a village hot somewhere in africa or whether god's dealing in your inside of your car as you drive to work every morning god is still dealing with the hearts of his people and you've got to believe you're under his watchful eye so the world out there they might wonder what's next here's brother brandon telling us you know they're asking him well what's going to happen next and he says well the next thing is the rapture aren't you happy he says the next thing that happened is the gentile elected bride to be caught up with the rest of the gentile elected bride that's been down through the ages in the presence of christ in the heavens that means that one day god is moving us toward the place where our bodies will be changed we'll pick up brother john lafontaine and all the other people that have uh passed on a little bit ahead of us and we'll link arms together and we'll all enter into glory at the same time that's what's next for the people of god no question there no mystery there right right how long that's going to take between now and the change of our body i don't know and what's going to happen between now and that time that our bodies are changed i really don't know but that's up to god because he chose not to let us know the future day by day we get it one step at a time and i really believe that what god wants you to do is walk the rest of the journey rest of the distance by faith not by sight not by sight now i uh i just i just want to say this in the next little part here i just want to say this carefully and i just want you to hold with me here just for a moment here and say that we know that god he hides truth he hides things and he has done that all from the beginning of time there's certain things that he has said certain things that he's revealed we know for a fact that god does not hide things from us but he hides things for us there's a big big difference he hides things for us so that in a season they are revealed they are made known he hides things from the world right remember jesus prayed i thank you father that was hidden these things from the wise and prudent he hides things from the world from the unbeliever he hides things but he hides things for us that in season they become known to the people of god by revelation and when when god revives a promise when god revives something that pertains to a particular day he is really introducing or reintroducing to us a portion of the kingdom that we're moving into let me say it again when when god revives a promise we we know that uh we know that in in the days in the ministry of brother branham he had a gift of healing and we always knew that god was a healer because the bible said so but he came and demonstrated that he revived that if you like he he he made it live in a way that we had never thought was possible in our time right and and he's introducing something to us about the kingdom we're moving into he's introducing something to us because in that kingdom there's no sickness in that kingdom there's no death in that kingdom there's no cancer and no in that kingdom there's no malignancy on that side over there and so when god revives a promise to us over here he's actually introducing us to the way things are going to be in that kingdom over here now think about this that that in this message i believe that somehow or another in the mix god put rapturing faith do you believe that god put rapturing faith in this in this end time message that we have and i believe that he put that in there because that's what we're moving into we're moving into a cycle where our bodies are going to be changed and in order for that to happen god had to mix that into the word for our day just like he mixed a martyr's faith into the message that they got in the dark ages they didn't have a rapturing faith they had a martyr's faith and god mixed that in to the message they heard and the things that they believed so they could be they could endure they can move through that uh period and not compromise and not be overcome by fear and pain and all the other things that that existed in that time i was i stood my wife and i stood in downtown uh um not glasgow the other edinburgh in scotland and and we we stood in the place where they have a little tiny graveyard at the on one of the main streets there in in edinburgh and they they said that they told us stories of these martyrs who had died this is a place where john knox had lived and preached and it was amazing we stood there on the street where john knox's church was and his grave was actually paved over and used as a parking lot by the city because they had such disrespect for their uh founding fathers but on this tombstone they had little stories and testimonies of people that died in the martyr times because that history is recorded over there and they said that uh you know this is a spot where uh there were families and they would take uh the the roman church would take families and they would line them up on a beach and they would have them from the back of the church say up to here and they would put uh the oldest down here and they would stake them to the ground they would tie them with stakes to the ground back down there in the low tide and then they would line them up head to toe from the oldest to the babies on the on the shoreline and just let the tide come in gradually and drown them all and everyone behind would hear the screams of the ones who were drowning and dying being staked to the to the beach that was there and and the the whole idea was to get the younger generation to recant and to repent of their of their faith and their beliefs that they had let me tell you those people will be on the other side when you get there and you know sometimes our complaint is that you know hey somebody's sitting in my pew when i got to church it's almost it's almost laughable when you think about it and how we think well if the air conditioning goes out of my car you know what that's what that's tribulation for me but you think about what those people went through and they went through with a faith and a determination and something deep within them because god mixed that into the message that they heard because god was preparing them for what laid ahead and in our time i'm simply saying that now in our day god has mixed in rapturing faith because he's preparing us for the thing that lays ahead and the thing that lays ahead is simply the change of your body not the reformation of this world not the reformation of our government but the changing of your body because that's the only thing that god can do with this culture is destroy it and take the righteous out just like he did in the days of noah that's not popular that's not what everybody wants to hear but that's the turning point we've come to so god hides things for us and we inherit those things as we embrace the promises made real so in other words let me say it this way god says i'm going to give you a word and the word of god is not just statements it isn't just information it is not just a prospectus on what might happen or what will happen it's not just that it is all of that but it's not just that i believe that every true spoken word of god that comes from god has the power within itself to bring itself to pass i need you to think about this for a minute here if god said it even if it doesn't happen then that word has the power to bring itself to pass in god's season behold a virgin shall conceive he says it brother brahm said it just spun out there until it lodged in the womb of a certain virgin named mary and there can't become a certain time there had to come a certain season for that there had to come a certain hour but when that all those conditions were made right and and mary believed that word in other words it was it was uh watered it was fertilized by faith in that particular hour even though mary had never experienced that before but yet she believed somehow this was of god and when that happened because it was a true spoken word of god it came to pass and produce exactly what god had promised in the spoken word itself we read in jeremiah chapter 29 that god told the children of israel back then he said uh you know you will you will be here 70 years not three years as this joker says over here but you'll be here 70 years and in 70 years i will visit you and i will come and i will deliver you and bring you back we don't find anywhere after 70 years that god came down himself we don't see any place where god showed up on the scene himself and delivered the children of israel but you know what they got back because the word of god is capable of fulfilling itself every spoken word has the power within itself to bring the word of god to past as god said it because it is god's word god's word is not just history it's not just information it is a living word it is a power in itself to bring to pass exactly what god has said if that's true if that's true and god has made certain pronouncement pronouncements about our time hey listen don't let don't let the world or don't let what other people do define god for you because the world will the world would and other people will you know they'll react in different ways let me give you an example in luke chapter 10 you remember there were 10 lepers that came to jesus from afar off and they said jesus have mercy on us heal us and jesus does he speaks to them just by the spoken word from a distance all ten of them are healed we know in the rest of the story nine of them walk away one of them comes back and thanks jesus for the healing he received now if you look at that wrongly you could think wow that's not very good fruits of his ministry one out of ten but let's think about it this way the miracle was healing by the spoken word and he had 100 success in that but you don't want to let what other people do define god for you and by making sense we're all wired to react different ways but all of them were healed all of them went their way clean one of them came back and was thankful and it was i believe the right thing for them to do to come back and be thankful but the miracle the great thing and the power demonstrated was that there was no sickness that could stand before jesus there was no no illness that could stand there and he healed all 10 of them and they all walked away healed but if you let it sometimes if you listen if you don't have your eye fixed on the spiritual reality that exists that god has brought us into that god is moving us into if we don't have our hearts set on that you'll focus on an inferior reality which is the world around you the world around us is an inferior reality guess what it's going to pass away and right now it's falling apart it's crumbling and there's no amount of leadership and there's no amount of money and there's no amount of chinese investment that's going to keep the thing together it is falling apart how many of you would agree when we look at this it is an inferior reality compared to that one and god has given us a word that introduces that kingdom that we're moving into and that word shall not fail heavens and earth can pass away but my word shall never fail so when we come to the turning point and this is all i simply want to say took a while to get there we want to open our hearts to that world because if god truly meant what he said about our time and i believe that he did the word spoken about our time will come to pass it has the power within itself to make it come to pass and you need to make sure you don't fall into the trap of interpreting things ahead of time do you know what what we know is great what we don't know is also great you got to avoid the trap of interpreting things ahead of god your job is not to interpret god's word or to bring it to pass and if there are things we don't know which which that's very true there are things we don't know there are things we don't know that are coming that are that are prophesied scripture but we don't know how it's going to happen i mean we don't even know how to change our bodies right i don't even know how to lose five pounds i'm trying i don't even know it's hard there's a lot of things about this life that are mysteries that are hard and let me tell you there are things that what it's going to be like before our bodies are changed or how far up the road that is we really don't know but you know what i believe i believe that romans 8 is still true that all things work together for good and as long as we're here you know what i'm at rest because i know it's in god's hands he never let us slip from his hands he never put the steering wheel in our hands he's still in control he believed that god's still in control god still got god still he's still on the throne and i i believe that god's going to have his way i believe that his word is going to come to pass exactly as it said because the power to produce itself lays within it and that's why after 70 years those children of israel got out of the uh the the country of babylon they got out of that because god's word said that they would come back after 70 years and in season that's exactly what's going to happen nothing's going to stop it last scripture i want to give you if you don't mind just turn in your bible to exodus chapter 3 and you may not even need to turn to it because this is this is pretty uh common to us a matter of fact it's found right at the end of exodus chapter 2. this is the story of moses and how god meets moses moses in verse 21 of chapter exodus 2 21 and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter so moses is in the wilderness here and he's going along for 40 years benny bear him a son and call his name gershom he said i've been a stranger in a strange land and it came to pass in the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage i'm in exodus chapter 2 and reading verse 24 and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham and with isaac and with jacob if you're looking there watch this and god looked upon the children of israel and he had respect unto them god remembered his covenant i got to ask you a question did god forget does god forget like we humans forget no but god made a promise to abraham and he said to abraham your seed will sojourn in a land for a period of time he said they'll be down there he said but in in the appointed time i will come on the scene and we'll make sure that all of the children all the seed of abraham come back to the land that i gave abraham so it's not that god forgot but god had to leave it until everything was fulfilled in its season and the time was right we look at time running out that's true but god looks at how much time is actually left and that's a different perspective so god knows how far he can let this go god knows how far he can leave us here god knows let me tell you you wouldn't be here if it was unsuccess if it was possible for you to be overtaken by this age and uh there'd be no way up you you would not be still here if it was possible uh if it was impossible for you to be an overcomer in our time you wouldn't still be here because that would defeat god's purpose the re the fact that we are still here means that satan is actually defeated and he's he's still unable to overtake god's elect in this earth he's not unable to overtake those that are bought by the blood of christ the fact that you're still here means that satan does not have all the power he thinks he has and you're a living testimony you are a living representation of the fact that satan's not the powerful one in this world but that god is and it's christ in me that's the reason that we stand and that's the reason that we have victory and that's the reason why you still come time after time with all the things you people have been through and all the troubles you faced and you're still here it's because satan's not quite as powerful as what he thinks and so god made god looks at this a little differently than we do because we say hurry up hurry up hurry up and you know time's running out but god knows exactly how much time is left and so he looks at you and he says i got a little bit more work to do i got a little tweaking here to do and even with the young people i got a little bit of work to do and so i'm going to let it go a little bit longer a little bit until the uh the cup of the uh amorites is full the iniquity of the amorites is full and so god does not forget but god waits until the time is right but then it says then it says in in the passage that we read there in that last verse it says that god looked upon the children of israel and he had respect unto them that word respect there and i'm going to close with this but the word respect there is the word for intimacy it is the word for like adam knew his wife eve and they conceived and bore a son that's the same word the word respect here is the same word that was used in that case so in other words when god looked at the children of israel he looked at he looked at the the potential if you like he looked at the fact that i have more for this people i have something for them i have more for them than what they even would dream of i have something great in store for them just like adam uh you know he had uh he had you know a pleasure he had uh you know the means to bring forth a son uh when he knew eve his wife and so god is looking at the children of israel not in a natural sense now but in a spiritual sense he's he's looking and saying i i have i have respect for the children of israel i know they're suffering and i know what they're going through but i have great things in store for them i have something that's coming that they don't even know anything about they don't they don't know how they're going to get out of egypt they don't know how they're going to get back into promised land they don't know how i'm going to do it but i'm going to do it they don't know anything about manna they don't know anything about uh you know the parting of the red sea they don't know anything about the great exploits that i have that lays ahead but i have respect unto them i have something intimate for them and only them not anybody else but for them i have great things in store for them and as they walk in faith in the promise of the hour as god begins to release them from that land god pours out those things for them in their journey i believe it's no different than in our time i believe that god had great things in store for us in this last day and my expectation is is that no matter how far this journey takes us no matter how much longer we are walking in this journey i believe god's got great things in store for us i believe there's going to be somehow or another time is going to cease and the door is going to open and we're going to step into another dimension i believe there's going to be a body waiting over on the other side because the bible tells us that i believe that our loved ones are going to be on the other side i believe there's all kinds of great things in store for the bride of christ because we are the bride of christ and god respects the bride of christ he looks at her as his favored one that god is going to do great things for that the world knows nothing about don't think that you're in a process that god has forgotten about don't think that you're in a time when god is not aware of where you are and what you're going through i believe god has respect unto you and god has great things in store even if you can't see them and you can't even anticipate them i believe god has great things in store because your body as you know it is going to end one day and it will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and what god's going to do to get us there i really don't know but i have that expectation that god is going to bring it to pass let's stand on our feet let's stop there don't you worry about the conditions of our world don't you fear the conditions of our world and who's elected and what comes through our time let me tell you god god watches over his people very carefully god knew you where you needed to be god knew what kind of a pastor you needed to have god knew what kind of uh message we needed in the last day long before we prayed or knew anything about william branham god knew exactly what kind of message we'd need in the last day he was right wasn't he who knew god did he knew he knew even before jesus stood on the earth and he inspired malachi to write this and say before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord there will come an elijah that will turn the hearts of the children back and it's still happening in our time because god knew he could put within that message everything that we have need of and transfer from his kingdom to us what we need to have our bodies change that's what the spoken word is that's what the message is to me it is god transferring through the spoken word what we need of to get out of here it'll happen i believe it'll happen our expectations should be for nothing less our expectations should be uh you know for for exactly god to do what exactly god has said and that's where we find ourselves today jesus warns us in john chapter 13 he says you be careful about the cares of this world because he said they'll choke you there's a lot of people who are choked by fear today they are they are bound with fear they are consumed with criticism they'll criticize everybody they'll criticize the government they'll criticize everybody there's people criticizing people ahead to vaccine there's people who criticize them people who don't there's people who live to criticize your pastor because he makes a decision that's a tough place to be in when he makes a decision and he knows everybody's not going to like it i'm a pastor i know exactly what i'm talking about it is one of the most unenviable positions to be in at this particular point in this sense in this sense because we live in a world where everybody's got opinions and nobody's nobody's reluctant to get online and share those opinions and make them really big and spread them all over the place you know what at the end of the day it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter what the world does what the world inflames what the world uh considers important it really doesn't matter what matters is what god says because that's the word that has power within it that's the word we want to embrace that's the word that we want to fall in love with we're at a turning point i don't think he needed me to come and tell you we're at a turning point but sometimes it's interesting to kind of dig down a little bit and realize that the world is turned in a direction they're not going to turn back from the churches are looking for answers as to where do we go from here what do we do now you want to go back and be a part of that i mean it's amazing that somebody would leave the light that we enjoy and go back to that and have the leaders themselves say where do we go from here they're without an absolute because they're trying different things and they're they're opening up their systems to all kinds of immorality and all the rest of it and i mean it's just amazing that somebody would want to go back and say i i'm so glad i'm a part of the people who don't know what they're doing i'm so glad i'm with you all you people you have no idea where we're going to go from here this is really great to be a part of you that sounds funny but i'm grateful for the direction that this word provides for us it's an understatement to say let's pray gracious heavenly father we count it lord a privilege and that would be an understatement lord to say that we are a privileged people but you placed a perfect word in our land and you said it's going to be a perfect word to create a perfect people to inherit a perfect world and even though in ourselves in our flesh we don't always feel perfect we don't always feel right in our humanness but lord we're thankful that our destiny is not based on how we feel our destiny is based on election so our prayer today lord is that you just draw us close that lord we would always have access to you but more importantly lord that you would have access to us you would be able to speak to us at any time you would be able to draw us close to your presence until the day when you draw us out of these bodies bring us into that kingdom we're depending on you we're depending on you lord for the next steps we're depending on you for each day and all that it holds we live in a world where now we know the world can change very quickly that there are forces in the world that exist to destroy and to kill and those forces have become evident father god we believe with all of our heart the greater is he that's in us than he that's in this world and we are encouraged we are encouraged lord to know that we're resting on that we're not resting on some man's solution i pray lord you would minister to this church may this church always be a place where people can come and experience the peace presence of god people can come and begin to walk in the light of this hour the lord you would anoint brother paul and sister rebecca and all that labor with them this place may always be a lighthouse it might be lord a place where you can lead your elect and prepare us [Music] father we ask now that you would just bless the balance of our day and all that we do lord may our may our lives be shaped by the gospel may our hearts lord be in tune with you lord that involves a pushback of the culture a culture which is becoming increasingly aggressive the lord may we have the courage and the strength to stand like noah did in the face of all opposition but he held to the message that you gave him in that day we love you lord and we thank you we ask lord that you would enrich us continually by your presence in jesus christ's lovely name for those who are sick and needy lord i pray that you would bring healing to their bodies those are the maybe that are searching and asking questions maybe they've debated even the existence of god lord you know the hearts of each one that's here in your presence lord i pray you would deal with that soften us lord i pray bring the bring the very thing that's needed we think of brother soriano lord brother jim babb laying in the hospital and different ones lord that are reaching out to you and families that are praying and we commit them to you we thank you lord jesus that we have you to turn to and give you all the praise and the glory and the honor in jesus christ lovely name amen
