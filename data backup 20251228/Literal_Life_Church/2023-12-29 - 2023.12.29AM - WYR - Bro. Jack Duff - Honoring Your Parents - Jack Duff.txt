========================================

Something in My Heart Like a stream running down makes me feel so happy happy as can be when I think of Jesus what he's done for me gives me something more than jeel in my soul yes there's something more than gold oh yes oh yes yes there's something more than gold oh yes oh yes there is something more than gold in my soul yes there's something more than gold we are honored to have brother Jack Duff with us this morning he's going to be taken this morning and tonight's service brother Jack come on and we appreciate him taking the time to be here with his wife and uh blessing us this morning and may God bless you richly amen turn tting testing praise the Lord God bless you all this morning certainly good to be here um at winter youth retreat I've uh been coming for the past couple years and I've always enjoyed uh my time here and I don't know um brother Barry and brother Paul can certainly take the show on the road uh they do a really good job uh just bouncing off of each other but we we certainly thank the Lord uh for them I'm um going to just open in a word of prayer and we'll get started in our teaching on today just bow your heads with me Father we are grateful for for this privilege and this opportunity we have to come speak to um these young people we trust Lord that the things have already been said have been transformational God that you continue to speak Lord into uh their hearts and continue to change us from glory to glory take control over this little thought that will be presented and trust God that it'll be helpful to every heart and every ear that he years it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen um I'm going to read a scripture and you all can just read with me very very familiar scripture one of the things that I I really really appreciate about this winter youth retreat is that we can get into practical teaching and uh I think that is so necessary for not only for the young people but for for everybody and um a lot of times we go to church and we get a lot of the deep things and uh we Rejoice over that but sometimes we need to get things just right where we're living right and deal with those areas I I love uh what brother rap did on yesterday with the budget um I think some people got a wakeup call and and as as you know you you were you were putting numbers in some of those things are only representing you as an individual it did not represent you and a SP house right one car pavement was 430 but two car Pavements is 860 right so you know you start looking at things like that and you see just what the reality is and how we have to set certain goals in order to be able to just live in this world that we currently live in so I was very very appreciative of that and I'm happy that we get a chance to talk about uh some of these practical things so quickly turn to Ephesians 6 with me uh very familiar passage of scripture and we'll read just a few verses forward and backwards by that oh okay thank you all right if you can okay perfect yes all right uh Ephesians 6 and uh it is verse uh 1 through3 just says this children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth God bless you you can be seated we um simply want to talk on the subject today of honoring your parents and um we have some commandment here in scripture uh that that we see and uh we just want to kind of talk about practical ways that you can do this I mean what does this really look like from a practical perspective honoring your parents and um just this um just want to just kind of show this little diagram here and in in a family structure the head of the family is Christ and after that comes the husband or the father and then after that comes the wife or the mother and then underneath that umbrella are the children the problem that we have in today's world is that we have children trying to raise above their parents but that is not the order that God has placed Us in and we want to make sure that we are following uh what God's structure is Christ first husband or father next then the wife and then the children now um the other thing I want to point out here is the scripture says there children obey your parents in the Lord that's an underline that we need to make in our Bibles in the Lord I I want to uh just say that if you have a parent that is putting pressure on you to do something outside of what the word of God tells you what to do then that's something that you always honor God first amen you always honor God first uh however also in Colossians 3:20 it tells us children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord all right um as we go through this I'm going to bring in a a a number of scriptures I'm also going to bring in some uh quotes and then I'm going to bring in some material from you know other sources so just just want you to be aware of that some of the challenges that we have here it says in second Timothy 3: 1-4 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come dangerous times for men shall be lovers of their own selves and I think many of us have already heard this they can never be uh stated enough but in this day a new word was developed that was never in the dictionary before but it came out in this day and that new word was called Selfie men shall be lovers of themselves that's why they take selfies okay uh Covetous boasters proud blasphemers and look at this one why does Paul put this one here disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent incontinent uh Fierce despiser despisers of those that are good Traders hey high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God these are the spirits that we would find that we'll be fighting against in this evil day all right and I and I and I did a um uh I just underline that word incontinent there because what that means is uh it's no self-control so when it says that people are incontinent they have no self-control at all and this truly is a problem in our society right no self-control uh disobedient and and and one of the uh definitions that I got here out of the Greek Lexicon for uh disobedient is contumacious and what that means is stubbornly or willfully disobedient to Authority stubbornly or willfully disobedient to Authority this is what was promised for this day we're living in this time and and as young people uh you actually have to fight the negative advice of people in the world in order to honor the word of God you have to fight the negative advice of people in the world there are spirits out here that we're fighting against the Bible tells us plainly um disobedient to parents inconsonant Fierce despises those things that are good uh we got this we see the Spirit uh in in full operation here a statement is made by brother brandom it says um the teenage kids took over the world now you know that the Bible predicts that unth thankful Unholy without natural affections truth Breakers false accusers disobedient to parents uh Teenage taking over the world and it's done it it says I went into a place the other day that they was playing this one of these old dirty Juke boxes all that stuff I didn't even want to take my family I said that I said to that lady how much does them records cost 10 cents a piece how many will it play in an hour she told me I said said here's the money unplug it brother brandom didn't want to listen to the music didn't want his family listening to that music says well she said I couldn't do that them kids the kids come in here to play that he says the teenagers are taking over the world right the kids the kids come in here to play that then I couldn't spend no money there I went somewhere else see well that stuff would make you nervous is that a look at look at look at that statement the music that people listen to makes them nervous if we're if we're fighting a nervous condition or something like that something along those lines check the music that we're listening to and I'm going to be honest with you not all Christian music is good music to listen to amen amen he says I couldn't spend no money there I went somewhere else see well that stuff would make you nervous you'd have a have to go down and get a bunch of tranquilizers to take after hearing that crazy stuff that just IRS a Christian if you like that kind of stuff you know what's wrong with you you need to get saved cuz what's in you is feeding on something besides the word so brother brandom gives us very very clear um instruction here you know music something that that the devil can use against you be be aware of that the other thing here he says you know when when he told the lady just unplug the Jukebox I'll I'll I'll pay an hour worth of unplug and I and I just I I I like the way he uses the word unplugg the Jukebox because there are some things in our lives that we need to unplug from there's things in our lives if we want to draw closer to God we need to unplug unplug uh here you know the the prophet you know uh just just giving us the these things even in the music if we can see the spirits that's behind the music then we can see what might be hindering our walk with the Lord sometimes we might might need to unplug even from some of the music I want to go to a little uh thing that I found here on the internet and um we we know about uh uh children that's been abused by parents and certainly uh if anyone's gone through anything like that um uh I all I can say is that certainly we start to hear that you would go through something of that nature and uh we pray that God would bring the healing to your heart um because I know when you go through something like that it's very hard for you to honor your parents very hard for you to do that but we pray that God will bring you to Healing to your heart when you're honoring your parents what you're doing is honoring the word of God God gave you certain instructions and what you choose to do is I'm going to honor the word of God however we are living in a day where children that have gone through abusive situations in their home eventually they they grow up and they become abusive themselves and these children now turn their abuse back over to the parents we have we have stories in the news all the time where some some young man has rose up against his father and and he's abusing the father now you hear it all the time now I want to remind you of a couple scriptures Exodus 21:15 And1 17 it says this and he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death now this is God's law from the Old Testament we realize we cannot execute things like that in the society in which we live today however it's good for us to understand the thoughts of God when we do things like this we have to fight these spirits that are coming into the land he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death verse 17 says and he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death you could couldn't even speak ill of your parents in the Old Testament you couldn't even speak ill now we just released so much information over social media when we we have a disagreement we release all this information you were not supposed to do that in the Old Testament that was actually a death sentence think about it how God wants us to honor our parents some of the ways that children abuse their parents first is sometimes a child hitting is physical a child hitting or throwing things at a parent damaging property or harming family pets this is a way that children abuse their parents it's physical another one is verbal abuse taunting or calling their parents names this is a way that children abuse their parents another is emotional abuse which is threatening with harm to the parent or harm to themselves if you don't do what the child wants you to do also it's it's um intimidating the parent by following them around and relentlessly texting them this is considered emotional abuse relentlessly texting a fourth one is financial abuse stealing money from the parents or and we uh heard about this yesterday racking up credit card debt on your parents' accounts and children may demand at sometimes large sums of money if you don't do something something that they want this is how kids are abusing their parents they're holding parents hostage never God's intention for that to happen in a family amen here statement in the message leadership brother brandom says you know Jesus loves Little Children You know he does and there was a little boy one time named Moses we're going to talk about him just in a little bit and he was a very fine you know what made him help make him a fine boy he had a good mother to raise him that's see that's what she taught him about the Lord and you little boys and girls has got the same kind of mothers to raise you teach you about the Lord just mind them so important that we we get this just mind them you know what the first commandment is in the Bible the first commandment with promise with a promise says maybe a little hard for you to understand these Commandments the first commandment is is not to have any other God uh uh but him but the great commandment and the first commandment that has a promise to it see is to the children did you know he said children obey your parents which may lengthen the days upon the Earth that the Lord thy God has given thee to mind your parents do what you're doing it may give it may give you longer life upon the Earth that the Lord has given you more time to serve him I hope today that I'm looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelist of the day that is to come if there is a day after ours now brother brand speaking this way back in 1965 and certainly there is a there has been a day after his there has been a day but we have to go back to the basics and remind us what God expects of us and like I said I know there's some really hard and tough situations you might say brother Jack you just don't know what I'm going through I I I don't know but I do know what the word of God says and and and what you want to do is just humble yourself to what the word of God says and honor the word of God as you honor the word of God I am I am I'm assuring you God will honor you God will honor you I I wanted to just go back into just a very basic Sunday School uh slide he talked about the Ten Commandments let's just go back and briefly look at those we we we hear but sometimes we might forget what they say the first one is thou shall not have no other gods before me thou shall not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments amen we want God's mercy in order to get his Mercy we have to love him and keep his Commandments a lot of people say I love God but if you can't keep his word something's wrong somewhere let's go on Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain for the Lord Lord will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his name in vain uh verse 8 remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy Verse 9 six days shalt thou labor and do all thy Work the next slide uh it says but but the seventh day make sure I get that all right the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter order thy man's servant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallow hallowed it look at this verse 12 honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the Earth upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee another Thou shalt not kill verse 14 Thou shalt not commit adulter Thou shalt not steal we just talked about stealing from your parents Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor basic principles for living the life that we live on this Earth and sometimes for us all we need to do is go back to the basics if we want to see God's blessings upon our life let's go forward okay I put this quote here because um you as as you me as we saw yesterday brother uh brother brother rap used a a lot of lot of lot of content and I was just so blessed by it often times what I find especially amongst message churches um they are very very against people using things outside of the message I know y'all not going to say Amen but it's the truth anyway but I wanted to bring just a quote from brother brandom to help us when we when we look at practical things you know because in the message I'll be honest brother Brandon doesn't just go into a lot of details uh if if talking about you know children obey your parents it give you the basic scripture but then sometimes the ministry will come and just kind of take that a little deeper and give you some practical things that you can you can do now I want you to understand something that brother brandom said in the message why says you believe in taking medicine says I believe in anything that helps the human race is Godly you have some people that they refuse to take Med medicine just I believe God's going to heal me and I'm not knocking your faith I I have nothing against your nothing that's where your faith is praise God for that but if there's a brother or sister you next to you that wants to take some medicine for what they're what they're going through I I bless them for that to and what brother brandom tells us do anything that helps the human race anything that helps if this lesson today can help you then the lesson is Godly if if if if if you come here this weekend to The Retreat and somebody said something to you that can help you a budget brother Brandon probably never talked about budget I don't know if there's a quote that I could find on budget and and and put this money side and do I mean he talks about finances but budget might not be there but if if a budget can help you it is Godly I believe anything that helps the human race is Godly certainly it is exactly it is tell me what would we do today without these clinics and hospitals and so forth certainly I know there's some shut behind the door when I first started off but but where where did it all go see you've got to look at anything I just love the way the prophet puts that you have to look at anything sensible anything if medicine hospitals are not of God they're Antichrist burn them down get them out of the country sure but it's something to help you so since it's something to help you it's of God look at it sensible and see what you can GA gather from to help you in your daily walk here um the other thing I'll just mention here brother random taught us that when we're eating chicken if we run into a bone just put it to the side but look at it sensible don't don't don't don't don't get rid of the whole chicken just because there's a bone in the chicken no eat the chicken put the bone to the side but make sure it's a bone all right let's go forward I had to preface that that's my disclaimer as we go forward because there's six ways to honor your parents and we want to talk about that these six practical ways of honoring your parents and I and I found this you know this gentleman I have to give him credit his name is Tim Keller uh he wrote a a beautiful article on this and uh and I wanted to just uh just bringing he he made this statement it says it's respect for parents that is the basis for every other kind of respect and every other kind of authority let me just break that down if you cannot respect your parents it may be hard for you to respect your pastor if it's hard for you to respect your parents it may be hard for you to respect the police oh my it may be hard for you to respect your teachers the breakdown happens in the home and then it just oozes its we out into the rest of society amen so this respect and honoring parents is is something that kind of helps guide us in our life it says it's respect for parents that is the basis for every other kind of respect and every other kind of authority another statement that he makes here uh is we are to honor parents in childhood and adulthood for for we owe them a debt of Honor that never ends now one other things that you probably didn't uh know that would made at some point in time get into your budget is actually being able to take care of your parents when they're older paying for some of their care M I'm going to we're going to we're going to talk about some things I got some scriptures to show I think is going to be very helpful another statement that he makes here I understand that in some cases showing honor may be difficult but very nearly impossible we realize that that may happen however there are ways that we can honor one is speak well of them two is seek their wisdom three is esteem them publicly and privately four is support them five forgive them six provide for them we want to take these six and break them down just a little bit more now I said that we sometimes might use material from other people however I want to add one other thing to that when I see something that I might read online I always filter what I read through the message of the hour I always filter what I read so if you ever go out and you read something you you read a little article always filter what you read through what the prophet has already said when you filter it that way then you know you got something safe praise the Lord all right let's look at this let's go a little deeper speak well of them what is what is this uh we mentioned this earlier uh he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death you don't want to speak evil of your parents they they couldn't do that in the Old Testament and and I believe God wants us to honor this principle even when we're talking about our parents sometimes you have to speak truth brother brandom had to speak truth about his dad his dad was a drunk his dad was uh was a rough man his dad killed somebody he had to speak truth about him but he still spoke how he loved his father oh my my my my my M some might say my dad's a dead beat my dad is this he's never been there for me my dad this but you know what if your dad wasn't here you wouldn't be here so you have to find something positive that you can say about your parent speak well of them look at this Proverbs 311 says there is a generation that curseth their father and do not bless their mother you don't want to be a part of that generation uh here in Leviticus it says for everyone that Leviticus 29 for everyone that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death he that cursed his father's mother his blood shall be upon Him brother Brandon makes this statement in this sermon the resurrection and guess where he preaches it in the same city in which I live West Palm Beach Florida he says when I was just a little lad he met my mother my mother is from Paris Texas my father was from entucky and so my dad was there breaking horses when he and a rodeo when he met mother and so they were married and mama was only 15 years old when I was born so that she was just a kid and pop was 18 but I used to want to be like my daddy it says I just loved my daddy amen uh wasn't a Christian until a little bit before he died now can you imagine that let's let's let's think about that let's think about that it says his his dad was not a Christian till a little little bit before he died this means brother brandham lived not only in a household but in a family where the parent was not a Christian we got many young people that are in situations like that you live in a home where either the father's not a Christian or the mother's not a Christian or if you're not in the home you have to go to family gatherings and you're going around family that are not Christians how should we conduct ourselves well I can tell you one thing speak well of them when you're in their presence speak well of them right and look brother brandham you know he tells us this he says uh I just loved my daddy he he wasn't a Christian until a little bit before he died I led him to Christ but he was Irish through and through and a real Drinker see the truth coming out my dad's a real Drinker and no matter what he did I don't care what he did he's my daddy anyhow in public when he's talking about his dad he's telling the truth about him my dad this my that that but the my final statement that I want the public to hear no matter what my daddy did he still my daddy only God can give you this type of feeling for a parent only God can do that and and let me tell you something if God could do it for brother brandom he could do it for you this next one said seek their wisdom and you know I was just kind of looking at this in the Book of Proverbs because that's a that's a book that we go to to get wisdom um and what I found in the Book of Proverbs 24 times in the Book of Proverbs Solomon all uses the phrase my son my son my son my son my son 24 times but also in the Book of Proverbs he references daughters two times but 24 times my son my son here in Proverbs 18 says my son hear the instruction of thy father says seek their wisdom so hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother another one here in Proverbs 3 vers uh 1 and 2 my son it says uh forget not my law but thine heart keep my uh but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee another one here in in Proverbs chapter 31 The Virtuous Woman verse 29 and 30 many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord shall be praised and and I like I like I wanted to introduce this because in order for this young lady in the Book of Proverbs to be considered a virtuous woman it said many daughters have done virtuously many daughters she had to be somebody's child in order to be amen considered virtuous she learned something at home that she could take forward into her relationship her marriage she learned something at home many daughters have done virtu virtuously here brother Brandon makes a statement in leadership when we're talking about seeking your parents' wisdom there are things that your parents have gone through and and I just find it amazing we live in a day where the kids just because they read something on the Internet feel like they know more than their parents life's experiences give you a lot more more knowledge than what you learned on the internet and let me also just mention something to you about the internet I think brother brother rap said said this yesterday one of the one of the most dangerous two words the D the most dangerous two words in in our in our land today is studies show youve read something on the Internet now you are an expert because studies show I encourage you sit and talk things over with your parents before you just make a rash decision sit and talk things over with your pastor before you just make a rash decision you know I I I'll be the first to admit when I was a young man uh I almost made a very rash decision I was doing it simply out of uh anger and probably just to have my own way and one of those things that I wanted to do uh I was going to register for the Air Force and I told my mom that I'm going to register the Air Force and pretty in the way I was saying it I was like I'm going to register for the Air Force and I'm out of here this is my attitude I'm out of here I'm leaving here right and uh my mom was very very concerned about me going to register for the Air Force and um she she she she would come to me she's like please don't don't don't don't do it my mom is a former um marine and and and and and she knew how things went in the military she knew how bad it was for her and just like she's looking at you you're a young Christian this is not a good decision for you to go to the military it's not a good decision that was for me now somebody else it might be a different story but for me she says no what what God wants to do in your life and I wasn't a minister at that point in time she said but what God wants to do in your life I don't think this is the right decision well because mom was saying it I didn't want to listen I didn't want to listen so she set me up and one day I went to church and I knew I hadn't done anything wrong but the Pastor said uh says uh brother Jack I'd like to see you after service um you want to see me I mean I didn't do anything wrong what what do you want to need need to see me for I said okay I went into the office and he says I heard you want to go to the military oh yeah yeah yeah I'm going I'm I'm going to the Air Force and I'll be leaving uh I'm going to register as soon as I can and I'm getting out of here and uh he's like brother please just think about this think about this I said what I mean it's you know my I had family that served that everybody did this and everybody did that I want to go and he asked me one question that changed my mind about going to the military my pastor asked one question and the question was have you prayed about this and when he said that honestly I'd have to say no I didn't pray about it it's just something that I wanted to do and see sometimes it's not about what you want to do with your life it's about what God wants to do with your life he's the one that gave you life so you have to allow him to do what he wants to do with the life that he gave you even though I didn't join the Air Force I did get involved in another Army and I'm glad to be a soldier in the army of the Lord Brother Randon makes this statement he says the first is the mother's kindness then the father's word after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he's the head of the house now you know we might have some here that dad's not in the house anything could have happened where Dad's not in the house God's given you a pastor as well that you can go to and get advice from before you make rational decisions go and get advice amen it says because he's the head of the house he's just just made a leader of his family so we follow what our daddy says do when he says now son I would like for you to do a certain thing a certain certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom that we listen see he's learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by what he's learned he tells us now don't go and do this because I did that my father told me not to do it but I did it and it caused this to happened to me something bad so we are well it says daddy tells us how to do and what to do right seek their wisdom seek their wisdom sometimes you know my daughter she would come and talk to me about job situation and maybe wanting to leave the job and go somewhere else and and one of the things I'm I'm constantly telling I find this a lot in a lot of the young people nowadays in my day we would go to a job and try to stay 25 years 30 years we want to retire from that job and get a pension uh but things start shifting now people go to a job if they don't have the right VI VI forget about pension forget about you know Insurance like like that in in the budget they they had um they had the insurance there that you have to pay and and sometime the health insurance some jobs that you get will actually pay for your health insurance and that comes off your budget but we make decisions based on the vibe not the insurance sometimes you have to learn to just bear and what I've told my daughter I said you know what I'm going to be honest with you if you leave this job cuz all this is is a trial what you're going through is what we call a trial and no matter where you go you're going to have trials so when you leave this job and you go to the next job I can almost assure you Maybe not immediately maybe a year two years down the road you will find the exact same situation same scenario on that job because you didn't overcome the trial on the job before moving jobs does not eliminate the trial amen we have to learn to just absorb these things it's it's all part of life sometimes you're going through things so God can humble you amen God wants to teach you a lesson in the midst of that and you can't run from those lessons they will follow you seek their wisdom another statement here they told us in way ways that we can esteem uh we can honor our parents has esteem them publicly and and privately this man Tim Keller made this statement he says parents long to see how they have impacted their children how their children are a reflection of their strengths their values you don't realize how important it is to give them credit where you you can how important it is to give your parents credit where you can one of the simple things that I do and I've done it in in the past now I don't know if young men still do this I hope they do but if a young lady is approaching a door if a young lady is approaching the door it's it's being a gentleman by actually opening the door for the young lady not you see her coming you you you actually look back you saw she was only few steps behind you you walk out and you actually only open the door slightly so you can squeeze out and it closes right after you leave but no a gentleman would actually stopping I saw you coming no long no matter how long you had to hold that door open the other night that I got caught that way it was it was a string of people coming but what what what encouraged me there was another brother I can't I don't know I don't know if it was him but there was another brother that opened the door and I he had the first door I said oh I see you open I got to open the second one so I opened the second one and we just let a string of people come through and that and now this is for brothers and sisters is that we had the door open amen and at the end he says hey you've been holding it long enough go ahead you go on through and and I'll go behind you and I I appreciate that but we need gentlemen like that and anytime I would happen to me and somebody say you know what thank you for being a gentleman I said you know my parents taught me this they taught me to respect women they taught me to do this they taught me to do that so I just it's I'm just I'm a reflection of what my parents taught me when I say yes ma'am or yes sir we don't use those words anymore yes ma'am and yes sir we always respected our elders amen we always respected our elders we we we we we we we we we admired them so we spoke differently to them in my day we didn't call our elders by first name Mr M brother sister we use we use terms like that it was honor and respect for those that are a little older than us amen but anytime I would do that and someone would compliment me I say my parents are the ones that instill these things in me and um and and I know that uh because of the way they instilled this in me this is just who I am in the public you we we we esteem our parents publicly and privately there was um an opportunity that me and my brothers and sisters had when um my father was passing away um I I I I was raised in what we call a Brady Bunch family and some of y'all that might not you don't know what that is but there used to be a show years ago on television called The Brady Bunch and what it was it was one man that had three sons married a lady that had three daughters and they became a family well that's what happened in my family my my my dad had two kids my stepdad had two kids my mom had two kids and married made a family so I've only known my stepdad as Dad for all of my life and and I like to I like to say this I like to say this because I know that I'm living or I'm speaking to young people that could be in a situation where you are in a step parent home sometimes the relationships are a little challenged sometimes things that happen in homes like that it's a little challenging but I I I stand as a testimony that you can make it through a home like that you can make it through a home like that it's not hopeless because you're in that situation sometimes God has orchestrated for you to be in that situation in order to provide blessings to you later on that you have no idea coming your way we all gathered around my my dad's bad bed he was sick and we knew that he wouldn't be with us long and I told my brothers and sisters I said you know what while he can still see us while he can still hear us we're going to all Speak Life over him we're going to tell him how much we appreciate him for what he did for us as individuals each one take your turn take your time and take your turn to say something positive to dad before he leaves us and we went from the oldest to the youngest five of us and we gathered around his sick bed and we all begin to speak dad you did this and we just appreciate you you did that you instilled this and you instilled that Dad that's why we love you so much and when my dad left here he could leave with a smile on his face that his children blessed him esteem them publicly and privately I want to esteem my mom in front of you today if I can my mom I remember one time when when she first came to the Lord and we didn't understand about being saved we didn't we grew up in church but we didn't understand salvation but when my mom given her heart to the Lord I remember there was a time that uh we were we were in the house and and um man we were hungry we were hungry and and that that stage in life we didn't realize uh that maybe we should be the ones going in the kitchen and get something to eat for ourselves if we're hungry what we did was we relied solely on Mom Mom's here we know Mom just finished working but Mom's here she'll prepare a special meal for us and we'll eat tonight well this night we could not find mom like her car is here but where's Mom Mom I'm hungry and we went to Dad Dad where's Mom we're hungry oh she'll be back she'll be back I'm like well what where is she he never told us where she was we finally stumbled and found where Mom was she was in we had a a conversion van at the time and mom was locked inside the conversion van praying for her family I appreciate my mom stealing away and praying like that even though I was hungry but I appreciate her stealing away and praying for me who knows where I would be today if I didn't have a mom that was willing to pray brother Brandon makes this statement in the message Mother's Day says but I might pass this on to the young people do you know Abraham Lincoln never owned the book in his life until he was after 21 years old but the Bibles and the fox book of Martyrs see what you read molds the character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today neurotics today that would be related to mental health and brother brandom just told us a secret what we read affects our Mental Health what you read molds the character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines and vulgar and nonsense is placed upon our news stance he own the Bible and the fox book of Martyrs look what it made him but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this he said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a Godly mother that reared him to serve the Lord he esteemed his mother publicly we want to encourage you esteem your parents publicly and privately let's go forward here it says another way that you could honor them is to support them support them now I want to just uh uh mention this this support is not necessarily financial support we'll talk about that a little bit later but when we're talk about support in this area is it's it's assuring your mom assuring your dad that even when you get older I'm not going to forsake you my my primary job as pastor but on the side I run a little business and I have an opportunity to go into many homes it's a home health business and I have a opportunity to go into many homes and I watch many families that when the parents get ill can't take care of themselves there are many families that leave their parents to fend for themselves but then I see other families where the children are all actively involved in making sure that they have the care and everything like that and anytime I find a family where all the kids are actively involved I always make it my business to say I appreciate what you're doing for your mom and for your dad when when when when they get in their old age we have a responsibility support them support them promise them I'm not going to leave you I'm not going to forsake you I'm going to be right there for you you were there for me now it's my turn to be there for you here the scripture says in John 21:1 17-18 says he saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said un him feed my sheep verily verily I said unto thee when thou was young thou Gest thyself and walst with thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand and another shall GTH thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not Peter is being warned you're going to get old and you're going to need help and let me tell you something young people you might be young today but every day you wake up and see the sun you're moving in a different direction you're going to get older and older and older the seeds that you sow now are the ones that will come up amen when you get that age here uh another little uh scripture here Isaiah 6:46 and4 and this is for the parents I I I I just leave this one here because sometimes we have kids that no matter what you say they're going to do it their way however I like this promise even to your old age to the parents I am he and even to uh uh wh hairs will carry uh and and I am he and and and even to wh hairs will I carry you I have made you and I will bear even I will carry and will deliver you if the children fail God has made a promise that he's going to carry so somehow some way it's going to work out but as children I want you to step into your role in honoring your parents as young people as mature adult people right as old people middle-aged people honor your parents brother brandom makes this statement in the message indictment and I tell you some night not all of you together just but just a little trip down they set up with her day and night and a little little trip down there from this Tabernacle in the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here some of you people go down and see the right family I'm sure they would appreciate it now I want you to catch what the prophet is telling us here not just supporting our our loved ones but what about some of the other older Saints in the church what about the brother that can't cut his grass anymore what about the sister that can't clean the house anymore and maybe one of the young sisters can go down there and support her or a group of young sisters can go and support her a group of young Brothers can go down and support and not just leave it up to the pastor to go do it you want the pastor to preach bring Heaven down but you also want to do all the work why not get involved in things like this that's right I told you practical teaching brother random and and and notice notice what he says here it this wasn't even just for his Tabernacle the people in his church if it was a surrounding Church church and you know that brother sister's down you can go help oh my we have often many times where maybe a person might live in one city but they go to a church in another city but there are saints that go to another church in that city which they live rather than say well hey if you were part of our church then we'd be there supporting you no brother brandom didn't say that it's a sister Tabernacle you see they need help as a Christian just jump in and help look at what he says he says this is support right he says this some people go down and see the right family I'm sure they would appreciate it just go down sit with them a little while and talk to them shake their hand and if no more than a little friendly visit we forget that so easy you know and when it comes to our own home then we appreciate it and we must remember others appreciate it too and the right family I'm sure would appreciate that and supporting the right family is not just brother brandom going down and paying a visit but the Saints Gathering and going to pay a visit you don't have to cook tonight sister I'll bring a meal brother you don't have to worry about this I'll be there to cut the grass we're going to take care of that support them another way to honor your parents and I know we have some situations here that might probably blow my mind if I heard them but I tell you the word of God is still true no matter what situation you find yourself in and one of the things that I want to encourage you is if you have a broken relationship and maybe your parents have done something against you um you still have to come to a spot where you can forgive that parent maybe they didn't show you love the way that you wanted to be loved right and and I believe um brother brother rat was talking about that how we have the the A and C and and then the B you know it's the belief system there's a consequence and you know there's belief system that kind of drives that consequence right but he was saying he was saying um you know there are things that happen that produ these con consequences there are things that happen but it's what we believe about it it's what we believe about it you know um I've talked to people in the past like you know my mom never never hugged me so it's hard for me to hug other people my my dad never did this so it's hard for me to do that you can't blame it all on on everybody else you can't do that that's your belief system you can't do that God gives you something different where you can go beyond where Mom and Dad went you sometimes the environment that your parents were raised in created their personality but the environment that you're raised in creates a different personality and the other thing that creates a different personality is the holy spirit itself forgive them here the scripture tells us in Mark 11:25 and 26 when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses there's a story that brother brandom told about the Harlot Rahab in scripture and um thank God for a prophet being able to kind of go into the depths of this how how did rehab become a harlot he tells us the answer how did she become a harlot did did she just make this decision one day that I'm going to be a harlot that's not what happened to Rahab what happened to Rahab is that her father and her mother because of her beauty began to sell her on the streets I thought about this Rahab in this condition as a harlot was the one that received the two spies into her home when she got the spies in her home uh she told them said we know that they're going to come and destroy the city they're going to take it down the people in this city already talking about it we know what's getting ready to happen we know but she said you know what because of this favor of me hiding you all I need a favor from you promise me that you won't destroy me when I come when you guys come when you come don't don't do that you want to he says okay this Scarlet thread that you let out let us down out of your window everyone that you can get into the house will be spared and and and the beauty beautiful part of this is that rahab's house was on the wall and when the walls of Jericho came down there was only one place on the wall that didn't come down and that's where rahab's house was but Rahab says I want not just you to spare me but spare my father my mother all of my family I want you to spare them now now now here's the thing I want to say if anyone had a Justified reason to not love their parents Rahab had that reason Rahab forfeited that Rahab forfeited that feeling Rahab forfeited that emotion rehab for forfeited all of that I want my my family to be saved she told him a story she got them in the house they were spared if there was anyone that was justified and not honoring their parents Rahab would have been that one and I hope that no no one here is in this in a bad situation as Rahab was but if you were you have an example in scripture as to how she conducted herself and I want to I want to let you know something Rahab did that without the Holy Ghost this little statement here we're coming to a close here in a second I got one more slide that I want to bring to you uh brother brandom no actually this gentleman uh uh Mr kellerer says perhaps the most important way we can honor our parents is to forgive them the fact is there is no perfect parents all parents have fallen far short of their children's expectations and in all likelihood even their their own expectations our parents have sinned against us they have made unwise decisions they have made unrealistic expectations they have said and done things that have left us deeply wounded for that reason many children enter adulthood controlled by anger and bitterness they find themselves unable to move past their parents' mistakes or their parents sin don't allow some mistake I mean brother brother brother rap was my just uh so transparent with us when he said he just went running into the house and saw his daughter sitting on the ground and just didn't even ask questions just swack now he apologized for that but she if she wanted to she could take that and hold of my dad did this and you know what the devil will do the devil only show what Dad did but it won't show her that dad also washed dishes with you dad also apologized to you Dad also did all these other things in order to try to make that right but if if she wanted to she could hold on to the negative part of what Dad did and not the positive I want to encourage you find something positive find something positive that you can hold on that your parents did forgive them this last one we talked about six ways that you can honor your parents this one says provide for them and um I want you to notice the scripture especially you Brothers honor widows that are widows indeed maybe a family goes through the loss of a father and and and and here the the the the the the scripture is telling us honor widows that are widows indeed look at the next verse but if any widow have children let's stop there first they have children then it's the children's responsibility to help support the family the children's responsibility it's not the church's responsibility it becomes the children's responsibility if these children are working children see this goes this just blows your budget right out of the water there are other things that can come and out your life that you have to find a way to make it work I want to tell you another thing that the scripture says there I want you to see the other thing if the W if any widow have children or nephews it didn't say nieces Brothers what a responsibility lies on our shoulders what a responsibility and we have to we this is what the scripture calls us too if if if if there's a if it's a widowed situation and you know your uncle just passed and oh you know I got to step up but you ought to feel the weight of responsibility I got to step up this is certainly a house that I need to be at cutting the grass this is certainly a house where I need to be at doing some of the the the odds and ends around this I I need to step up and you're not doing it just because you're being nice you're doing it because of scripture right if any widow have children or nephews let them first show piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God verse seven and 8 in the same chapter and these things give in charge that they may be blameless but if any provide not for his own spe and especially for those of his own house he have denied the faith and it's worse than an Infidel you're worse than an unbeliever when you don't just do these basic things see I say you know sometimes it's good for us just to kind of go back to the basics see what the scriptures actually calling for us and and and and for the young lady that might be thinking about getting married to that young man you heard this scripture you know what and uh something happens in the house you're married into that family you can't now get jealous but why are you spending so much time at your auntie house because the scripture told me to do it you ought to jump in there too and try to help out because he has a responsibility he has if she if if she doesn't have children he has a be there to help out the scripture tells him to do it this is what honor looks like this this is this is you know when you just um uh impr providing for them we also realize financially this this is this is this is big we have to be there to help out now you know I know that there's sometimes there's some situations that come up you might not be able to do it all but do what you can I want to encourage you here brother Brandon makes a statement here for a young man had a question about his dad says what can I do for him should I continue to care for dad on the farm what can I do make a living for and he signs his name says yes my brother he it's wrote here I don't know says brother brandom just starts out what can I do for him now probably some boy for his dad look my dear brother blessed are you when you will take care of your dad for your dad took care of you when you could not take for yourself take care of yourself I like that blessed are you when you will take care of your dad I'm going just add mom there too when you'll take care of your dad uh for your dad took care of you when you could not take care for yourself the First Command with promise the First Command with promise honor thy father and thy mother which may lengthen the days upon the Earth that the Lord thy God giveth thee see yeah take care of that any way that you can and look at what it says here see that he gets the very best when you were coming up you don't know what your parents went through and the sacrifices that they made to make sure you had the best when your parents get of age you have a responsibility to take care of them provide for them support them speak well of them esting them publicly and privately you have a responsibility take care of them do the best you can for them because they did the best for you the best they could this is what honoring our parents looks like just practical ways practical things that you can put in practice in order to honor your parents honor thy father and thy mother it's what our first scripture there and um in Ephesians and I just encourage you with that just read it to you again children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment with with promise that it may be well with thee th th th may live long on the earth let's pray father we've read your word heard this Commandment that was given to us Lord through Paul Paul just repeating what Moses said and Lord we we live in a in in a in a day in a time where these things are being challenged but it's good that we can come back and just have a little refresher this morning to look at this unpack it look at a little deeper to see Lord what you're calling us to father if you have called us to these responsibilities you would give us what it takes in order to uphold our call I pray oh God that you would bless these young people Lord uh you know that next year may look different for many of them and next few years may look different but Lord let them have the the platform and the things that are needed to be very successful as they go forward in life we trust oh God that you would just continue to minister to our hearts through your word it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you God bless you [Applause] you have just been pastored that's a pastor talking all the way through and I'll tell you what you may think H well huh it doesn't matter it matters because a lot of what God will bless you with will depend on how you you conduct yourself in relation to your parents you're all going to go back home and you're all going to run into one or two of parents you ought to you ought to go to them and say appreciate you it's what you ought to do they ask you what' you learn at Retreat appreciate you that's all you need to say because you just been pastored you just had a pastor talk to you today and that is good Sound Advice you say it doesn't matter hey I'm 55 years old and holding my father-in-law just blew out 97 candles on his birthday 97 and we still care for him 247 my wife and I part of the reason my wife is not here is because of her father and my my my parents and her mom have passed away but we care for her father uh d day and night and have caregivers that help us to do that and uh we we have to monitor everything from his medicines to what he eats and how much salt he gets and it's a constant thing my wife asked me one day she said what would happen if I died how would you treat my father she asked me that and I said there's two things I want to tell you number one I love you and because of you I would honor him and number two the Bible says to honor your father and your mother and he is a part of me through the Covenant of marriage and I said so that's my obligation she said I feel better about them but I said don't die at least not until we save more money you know so uh let me tell you it it is a powerful thing and you may not think it is but when you think about you know getting married and uh looking at a uh you know a girl or a guy you need to you need to think about this because you're not just marrying that girl and take extracting her into your little uh into your fairy tale world you are be going to become a part of that family and you're going to be affected by that family you're going to be affected by their upbringing and there's a lot of things that lap over when it comes to this issue brother Jack I think he could do a series on that but I'll tell you what now I feel like I wish I was here with brother R preach cuz uh man sounds like that would have put us all in the Rapture if I had been here with rap can you preach it again this afternoon hey I there's a lot of sound wisdom that that we've heard and and uh don't just take that lightly uh because you just been you just heard from your pastor this week and there's some really good sound advice that's there I took down lots of notes on that brother Jack and I appreciate uh appreciate that very much and uh God God sees how you act toward your appearance and I know that like brother Jack said I know that there are lots of different situations here and there's lots of different troubling situations where there's been abuse and terrible things that have happened here but you know what that doesn't change the word of God and I know that that's not easy and some of you uh you know may may need a little personal help one-onone with your pastor or something else but let me just share this with you when I grew up and when I grew up we came in the message uh my dad was an alcoholic and uh I remember when Mom came in the message at 55 years old and Dad uh was still an alcoholic still a Catholic uh I remember going into the dining room and watching them and Mom would be at one end of the table for having dinner and dad would be on the other end of the table and the dad would put a TV in the middle of the table so he could watch TV uh while he was eating his dinner and in every way our house was affected by uh the fact that he was not a Believer how how they paid tithes where they spent their free time vacations everything was affected by the fact that they were two different beliefs and I developed an attitude I developed a real attitude about my father because I didn't think he was being fair to my mother I didn't I thought it was bordered on abuse he never physically abused her but uh you know I didn't think it was fair at all and I I'll tell you what when I was married dad was gone and I was married and raising my boys I had to get down on my knees one day and asked God to deliver me from the habits that I had inherited from my father that I knew I was going to pass on to my boys because I'm an acoa an adult child of an alcoholic so was brother brandham brother brandham said he was an ACA an ad old child of an alcoholic and I knew that if I didn't correct this I would pass those habits on to my boys and they would be the adult grandchildren of an alcoholic that's a real thing that's a real thing and brother brandham was that and he told Billy Paul the same thing there's a quote where brother Bram was walking through the bowy in Chicago the ghetto and he saw these drunks laying on the side of the street remember that and he said to Billy Paul he said Billy take a look he said but for the grace of God this is where I would be and then he turned to him and he said and but for the grace of God here's where you'd eventually be what what happened God intervened right so it's just a Grace of godone so uh let me we all have a story we all have a past and it's a it's a real thing brother Jack thank you for uh ministering that that sensitive subject and a lot of really good stuff there so we appreciate that very much
