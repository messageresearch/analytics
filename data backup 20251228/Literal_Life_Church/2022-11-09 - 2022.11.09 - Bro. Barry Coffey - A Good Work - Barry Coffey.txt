========================================

the Lord I was just thinking I was listening all these events and all these things going on I was saying to myself I'm going to move here and then I found out we had to pay 500 for you for a banquet I thought I'll stay where I am [Music] God is good to us and he sure loves us and we're blessed more than we deserve that's for sure agreed to the name of the Lord Jesus this evening and I bring you greetings from my family and the sister Becky she sends all of her all the LaFontaine ladies special greetings and from my church and May I trust that the Lord will bless you all tonight I'm not going to say anything about Ike because he was down in our area and didn't come see me and but it's an honor to be here it's unexpected but it's an honor to be here tonight if you don't mind let's take your Bible let's go to Philippians chapter one and this song was just so fitting as we want to look in this little text tonight and I will tell you I don't want to Preamble very much at all thank you musicians I appreciate that and the atmosphere that's set so I just want to jump right in if that's okay brother Paul asked me to say a couple of words about Ukraine and I we may have a a little clip here to show you but uh let's begin in Philippians chapter 1 just while you're standing here verse 3 we'll start there I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ He's Able isn't he Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity we have to be able to come in your presence tonight and to be able to study your word Lord in peace and in the sanctuary sanctity of this assembly Lord this evening and to be able to uh just Lord step out of the way and let you speak to our hearts and father I know how you have dealt with me and Lord I just pray tonight that you would just take me as a vessel and a microphone Lord and just speak to the hearts of your people as you have spoken to me already and I ask now Lord that you would just take complete control forgive us of anything Lord that would hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit and Lord me when we leave here we are able to say it's been good for us to be in your house with your people father have your way Among Us now we pray in Jesus lovely name amen and amen you may be seated this evening there are lots of different things that are being said about Ukraine and Russia and so forth over the over the airwaves some of it is true we had one of the folks in our assembly who was just over there in Ukraine serving uh they're in the medical capacity and uh I will tell you that uh you know we hear about uh statements about the Russian forces retreating back from different places in Ukraine the shock is is that when the ukrainians go back into those areas where the Russians had control they generally find nothing there there's hardly anything that they recognize in relation to their Villages and their towns or homes sometimes they'll find foundations there but there's much of it that is absolutely totally unrecognizable many of them who left left with only their possessions closed on their back maybe a bag of clothes a couple of important documents and and left in a hurry because there was bombs in the air and uh when they come back there's absolutely nothing there so it's a really sad scenario and there are many many stories but I thought you know sometimes a picture's worth a thousand words and the video clips are worth about ten thousand so I thought I'd just show you if you can click to the next one now I don't have my here it is now I I'm not sure we can play this well let's just try this can we get sound device [Music] was if you want if we can play it again if you got sound oh let's go back anyway and not letting the circumstances affect them and uh they're just a very hardy people and I will tell you that they really do appreciate every cent that's sent over we still continue to do that we have to trickle funds over uh just a little at a time so we do not raise any Flags over there and the money reaches those those families there and they they every now and then and then when they can they send back little video clips that acknowledge the fact that they've received the funds we have the names and addresses and phone numbers of everybody who's received anything and from people over here and we have a wonderful team of brothers that uh supernaturally when all the banking systems are down and all the other governmental workers come to a halt there practically no medical facilities of any kind and yet these team of Three Brothers in different parts of the world they're able to get money into the country there through cryptocurrency and through wiring and through different telephone apps that they use uh it's just incredible how they do it and uh we're able to supply those brothers and those Brothers Supply those families over there so there's about uh we believe around 400 450 individuals over there about 130 families that are still in that area and uh let me tell you they uh they really have to work hard to be able to get basic necessities medicines and food and so forth there was a brother over there and I don't have a picture of it but he was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that was all on the side of his face it was a large tumor that had grown out and he was taking therapy before the war started once the war started the government took over all the hospitals for the war effort and so he couldn't take any more uh any more chemotherapy treatments at all and had no money to do with that and as a result of that you know he was left uh you know to his own resources and uh the brothers over there the sisters and when it was safe they came out on the cover of night got together laid hands on that brother and he's still with us and we're very thankful for that so uh it's uh it's just a wonderful uh you know group of people to help and to work with and we're very thankful for all the support and funds that have been given all right now I want to tell you this that um I had it on my heart to come and brother Paul and I were in contact and uh the Lord laid it on my heart to come and uh just figured I would probably be here on a Wednesday night and had something that I was going to speak about and then two nights ago uh around four o'clock in the morning it was the night of the eclipse whenever that was um the Lord I believe stirred me and I was I woke up and I was just go all of a sudden going through these scriptures and things that I'd never ministered on before I never I never saw I never thought about and uh I thought to myself well I'll wait until the eclipse starts and then I'll get up and I'll look for those scriptures in the Bible and uh lo and behold just as the eclipse started I fell back to sleep so I never got to see the eclipse but I did remember the scriptures and uh so I'm going to jump right in and this is Wednesday night so it's all right if it's all right take your Bible we're going to look in some scriptures here and I realize you know that there are many ways to talk about the scripture and many ways to go at it my way some ways sometimes is a little bit different I think really what's important is that we may not all be preaching the same way but what is important is that we're all preaching the same thing and we have the same motive in preaching and that is to prepare a people for the change of our bodies so that you know we can make it into the kingdom and that's what's important the way we preach is really incidental as long as God will take the vessel and use the message that's what's important now uh the flip the book of Philippians here is a book that I've started to study and I begin to minister on but I haven't been able to get past the first 11 verses here it's one of the positive books that Paul writes it's written after a second journey and he really encourages the people uh in their own personal experience and their own personal walk with God there's no mention here much of ministry there's no mention a church order no mention here of gifts and prophecy hardly he's really encouraging the people to become aware not so much of the circumstances around you but what God is doing within you he wants them to understand that he wants them to realize that the most important thing is not what's happening around but what's happening within and so he's uh he's dealing with the uh you know with the Believers in this personal way and he's encouraging them uh in in the way that only Paul can now as we as we look at this and I wanted to read just a couple of scriptures for you there's a really powerful word that's embedded in here and that is the word perform where Paul says that uh being confident that this very thing that he has he that began the good work will perform it and that word perform it's found in various places in the Bible very specific and it means to bring something to it end it's not going to be stopped along the way but it's going to be completed it speaks of accomplishing something that is tied to the original purpose so what's going to be done is going to be exactly what God had in mind that's the idea and not only is it uh is it pre-planned but he's on hand to execute that he's he's on hand to make sure that that happens and he's got it just like we often say he's got a will for you he's got a plan and a purpose for you you wouldn't be here don't tell me that God doesn't have a sense of humor hey he left us here for the very end right all the great people and Believers and saints that went before us but God chose you and I to be here in the last of the last to bring it across the Finish Line don't tell me God doesn't have a sense of humor and yet he promises us and this is what Paul is telling the Believers there that you need to be confident of this thing you need to believe in this and hang on to this because God's going to shake your world and you need to hang on to this very fact that if God began it in you he's going to execute it he's going to see it all the way through he's going to bring it to pass he's going to he's going to complete it it's going to be done exactly the way that God intended and nothing's going to be left out nothing's going to be missing do you believe that and and that's that's how he's encouraging the people now how God does that is a really interesting story because how God deals with all of you is unique and interesting it's specific to you it's very personal and what God is doing in your life and how God is dealing with you uh those things are are really really uh really really important uh in the accomplishment of God's purpose in your life and so this word perform if I could expand on it just a little bit more and say that uh just like uh in the Old Testament in Jeremiah chapter 29 you remember that story where Jeremiah tells the people he says you're going to be down there for 70 years and in in the appointed time he says I will perform my my word uh concerning you I will perform my thought concerning you and we find the same Hebrew word uh basically and and it literally means this that the word can lay dormant for a long time I've spoken it but it doesn't necessarily come to pass exactly when I speak it but when the time comes I'm going to breathe into it and when I breathe into it man it's going to happen there's going to be something go on during that time and and you need you need to be ready during that time at 70 years and I'm giving you the warning in advance because when God sets this word on fire and God breathes into it you better be ready to go because it's going to happen and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring it to life in the same way that Martin Luther or sorry in the same way that Malachi 4 laid there for hundreds and thousands of years and uh nothing nothing can make that happen until God's time but when God's time comes man we're all we're all very sure of what Malachi 4 means aren't we there are other people in other ages who believe that that might have applied to them like Martin Luther Martin Luther I read in a book where he said I believe that may be a description of my Ministry to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers well that made sense to a Catholic especially if you were living in the season of the Reformation but it was not for Martin Luther he could know it but he could not make it live but when God made it live in the 1900s let me tell you it leaves no doubt as to what that verse actually means god brings it to pass God executed it God completed it how many believe that God completed what he wanted to complete in brother Brown's Ministry it's not listen we're not waiting around for somebody to come along and finish that we're not waiting around for somebody to come along and put finishing touches on brother braham's Ministry we don't need to go in and edit those sermons let me tell you rapturing Faith lays in that everything God wanted wanted him to say I believe he said and everything that God wanted us to have I believe we have and we're still printing it and sending it out all over the world and uh it still works I believe the message is true God knew exactly what he was doing he didn't make any mistakes and all the controversy Hunters you know they're still out there hunting but you know what God's bride still moves right on God's bride still presses on because you know what we believe hey we believe this is God's word now let me tell you something it was a brother who uh uh oh well I'll just say this I heard a minister he was in Jeffersonville uh there and and he made a really profound statement uh one time a little while ago and I I'll just I'll just leave this with you as we go on but he he said that uh you know a lot of people he said they uh they stop at that Prophet they stop at brother Branham and and he said they really limit themselves when they do that and he said but I'll tell you what brother Branham did for me he said brother random led me to Christ and once I got to Christ he said you know what everything was okay he said I could look back when in Christ looking through those glasses he said I could look back and see all of humankind and realize that you know what we're all capable of mistakes we're all capable of doing and saying and feeling things wrong and interpreting things wrong he said you know what and we're all human and God made us that way but he said but what brother Branham did and the most significant thing that brother Brandon did was to bring me to Christ and once I was in Christ he said there was a security there and a permanence there and a peace there that you never get by following some man and he said I'm thankful for the ministry of brother Branham for doing that and I thought that was just a nice way of saying that now it's really interesting I don't know how we got here uh in my church but uh there is a sister in our church who had some connection with the Chinese culture and she was explaining to me and gave me a document about how the ancient Chinese people made their words and their words are obviously made of pictures and symbols that mean very little to us until you go to a Chinese restaurant and they they are very meaningful to Chinese people and so she gave me an example of this and I I use this at home that the word for lamb is the first symbol on the on your left the the word for me is this symbol over on the right when you put two of these symbols together you come up with another word that seemingly would be unrelated righteousness now look at the construction of righteousness the lamb is on the top I'm on the bottom so in other words when God looks down at me he sees the lamb first they're in that position I am righteous before him does that make sense Hey listen that's only the example let me give you another one and this is what I want to get to that in our lives we have opportunities to do things and we have uh you know there there are lots of experiences that come our way I found this interesting that the word crisis is made up again of two symbols right here and the first one is danger that's the symbol on the top and the bottom one is opportunity so when you take danger and opportunity it it is it is a crisis but a crisis really affords us very often an opportunity to change isn't that right pain is a great teacher and and it is one of the best teachers actually and so when Crisis occur in our lives and we should not begrudge uh you know the the path of life that brings us to a place of Crisis because very often those are the things that drive us to the Cross they drive us back to God and they're a crises that really are wake-up calls and they are nothing but good for us in our lives it's really interesting we have a couple of Neighbors in our uh live right next door to us and our young couple uh real nice people but they're not churchgoers at all have no connection with the church every Sunday they're home uh you know they're just they're just good normal type people who uh happen to live next door to us and a couple of months ago uh the the lady of the house she was expecting she's about 38 years old somewhere around there 40 years old somewhere I would guess and they already had one child and she was expecting her second child 28 weeks along and all of a sudden uh one day she knew something happened and that child died in her womb and she was devastated I mean there was no the doctors never gave her reason as to why that happened but uh you know it uh it was it was Final and uh you know she had to go through all of the processes when something like that happens and uh they they uh they asked me they because we were helping them and we were you know kind of putting our arms around them and doing what we could and and uh trying to be comforting and supportive of them uh because of what their what you know what a crush that was and um they asked me if I would speak at the funeral they said we want to give it a regular funeral and coffin's this big and uh you know David I took a a quote a section out of Psalms where David said my life is as a hand breath and hand breath is this distance from from the end of your thumb to the end of your pinky and I said that's probably the size of this little uh child Clover who had passed away and I said you know David said that that's our life that's he said in terms of the comparison with eternity he said that's kind of how how long it really is and I had the chance to be able to go to the Grave sign there was just the three of us there and uh they sat in the chairs and I pulled up a chair and sat down and talked to them about uh you know life and how God is the author of life and there's things that we don't always understand and all the things that were said and they were they were really uh comforted by that they told me and and uh you know they were they were happy with that and you know sometimes you don't realize the impression that you're making on people and then today us preparing for service and I had a a text from him the husband and and he said are you home and I said no I'm not home I'm in I'm at Brother Paul's oh you know and everybody knows where Brother Paul's is and he said he said well I don't want to interrupt your vacation I said back when you come to brother Paul you're never really on vacation you're always working and I said uh I said what what's happening and he said well he said I just had a situation happen at work and he said I'll probably lose my job and he said we're really concerned about it and you know it's kind of been a year of bad news for them and he's he said now these are people that don't believe in God at all and he said I just wanted to ask you if it'd be all right he said if he would pray for me and all I'm saying to you is this is that you know a crisis happens and sometimes we think oh it's just a bad day or I'm having bad luck or something else that really can be an opportunity for something really good to happen so you're better off not shaking your fist at God but rather just to to realize that there's probably something I can learn through the crises that happen in my life and we should not turn our back from turn our back on them now Peter says and I just want to give you some principles here tonight and we'll we'll move into an area that I've never spoken about before and in second Peter chapter three Peter says this is all familiar to you the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slowness and that's what that Greek word means there uh that people would say well God is slow doing things you know I mean uh brother Branham talked about 1977 and then every 2000 years something happened well you know God's kind of slow well you should not count God slow because that's not the way that God operates but he's long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and this idea that uh you know without understanding if you're looking at sometimes you're looking at the timeline of God it's not always clear exactly what God's doing and it can appear like God is doing nothing During certain seasons and I want to tell you here tonight I don't believe that that's true I don't believe there's ever a time when God's doing nothing God is always doing something in our lives God's always doing something in the world now in the church age book hold on to that thought brother Brandon says now we come to the last stage in the laodicean age he said this is our age and we know it is the last stage of the uh because the Jews are back in Palestine and this is Harvest Time and he said but before there can be a harvest there has to be a ripening a maturing of everything both the vines right it's got to come and this is what that word means there it's got to come to full development if you look up the word uh ripening it means that it's got to come to full development now I was using this illustration I'm not going to use it tonight the way I did in my own church but uh for instance uh how many of you young people are here tonight that are not 25 years old yet but have your driver's license huh let me I got a little bit of news for you you may not appreciate this but I got I got to tell you this that nobody really wants you to drive there ain't nobody who wants you to drive I'll guarantee you that your mothers don't want you to drive because they worry every time you pull out of the driveway even if they don't say anything they're worried anyway because that's what mothers do I will tell you something else that your pastor doesn't want you to drive and be rolling around that parking lot out there the state troopers don't want you to drive uh the judges in this community don't want you to drive uh they know they know something about you before you turn 25 and that is that your brain is not fully developed insurance companies will change the rate of your insurance when you turn 25 if you're single now they'll change it earlier if you get married because the insurance companies will turn it over to your wife to get your brain to grow up but if if you're single your insurance rate stays High until you're 25. not because you're stupid but because you haven't come to full development yet so you figure that hey it's all right if I go backwards on the interstate or it's okay if I drive at 80 miles an hour and use the phone oh somebody's texting me at the same time there's a there's a lack of full development it's not it's not that there's no development it's just that it's not full development yet so we got to wait until that happens all right we got to wait until this this whole process is complete and that's the idea that we're trying to convey tonight before there can be a harvest there has to be a completion of the process there has to be a full execution of the whole uh maturing process here of both of these Vines that's what brother Bam's telling us all right now we find that in show us the father brother bam said now Jesus said the word was a seed and the seed that the sower sowed now he says now you people out here in Oregon you don't have to go out every morning and dig up the plan he says you plant a crop of corn every morning to go out and dig it up and look at it and say what's in that I don't see a thing going on it'll never grow if you do that you have to commit It To The Ground you have to commit it and let it grow he says don't dig it up you've got to commit It To The Ground that's the place for it and every time you dig it up you delay it when you get involved in that process you can delay the whole thing so therefore the nature itself tells you that there are seasons where something is physically happening or you're involved in doing something but then there are seasons where the work in a sense is not always visible but is still going on it's getting you to where you need to be right and you may not even be fully aware of that you might you might react to that kind of differently but in God's plan God is always in the process of getting you somewhere he's always bringing you to something and that something is something better something higher something more uh more profound and more perfect God is doing that and he's moving the bride towards the kingdom how many would agree he's moving things back to the way that they should be and so this is the principle that brother Brandon was telling us about here that uh you you can actually get involved in this process and delay it if you're not careful now let me give you an example here you remember when brother Branham uh prophesied and said I'm going to have a son son and he said that son's name is going to be Joseph remember that that story and then uh here's brother Branham in 1955 and he's in his own church and he's saying this to the people some some things said uh you're going to have a boy and you'll call his name Joseph and about a month after that we found out uh we were pregnant and this was Sarah Branham who came and uh brother bam said it was a Josephine well immediately immediately as he says here uh some people said so many thought that I said that that was Joseph and I said no no I didn't say that was Joseph some said didn't you see a vision of this he said you know how people get things mixed up and I said I got tapes on it listen now he's telling this to his own church sounds like he's under defensive here and he said I never said it was Joseph the Lord put it on my heart that I'm going to have a son by the name of Joseph I don't know how I don't know when but there's obviously a space of time here now God gave us a daughter and we're thankful for the daughter but uh let me tell you what was going on behind the scenes here that you may not know there was a fellow who was in the church at that time in Branham Tabernacle who made it a point to get on the phone and call everybody in the church and say brother Branham said there was going to be a boy brother Brandon told us that was going to be a boy and cause that unrest among the people there and that's why he had to get up several times and say things like this because he said you want to listen to him go back on the tapes find out what I said he said I'm going to have a son and this was because that there was a person in there and here's what I want you to understand I want you to get a hold of this that in the season where there's a delay the enemy goes right to work whenever there's a delay and it looks like something is not happening here or you know it's not visible at least the enemy jumps right in and causes upset right in the middle of that delay he always does and we can take a lot of time and look in different scriptures here here's one Luke chapter eight this is a story where Jesus is on one side over in Israel and it says that they get into the ship with his disciples and he went over and they launched the boat and as they sailed he fell asleep and what brother random told us here is that he's actually resting between revivals because he gets over on the other side to gadera and there's a great miracle that takes place over there right a great great thing that happens over there and if you look at the previous parts of Luke chapter eight all the Miracles take place over on this side and then he leaves that Revival gets in the boat goes over on the other side but he takes a risk during that time here's brother bam said he was resting between revivals well you know what happens during the delay the enemy comes right in and causes a storm right then he arose and rebuked the wind and the Raging in the water and they ceased and there was a calm I will tell you that whenever you get into a space like that the enemy comes in and tries to cause some sort of an upset that nobody's expecting but all of a sudden he's right there are we okay Awakening Jesus I'm going somewhere with this and he said and these disciples were doing the same thing they were rejoicing and living on what they had done probably the day before the week before the year before and they were testifying about and giving a testimony of it and he says and how do we know that as Jesus in the in their day was resting between revivals how do we know maybe he's resting now between the revivals Now understand it doesn't mean that there's nothing happening but I will tell you it's a season or an opportunity for the enemy to come in and cause upset because we're here and it seems like you know you may be sitting there thinking well God's God's certainly pretty slow at getting the bride all together and uh you know it's Wednesday night again here we are 2022. who knew we'd be here in 2022 right we're still having to deal with elections and still having to I mean you know goodness you wonder how long we're going to be here you know people are everyone's praying that we get out of here except for the young people who are not married yet they kind of want to hang on just a little bit longer just a shade longer right but for the rest of us we're all ready to go and when you get into that season of delay let me tell you something the enemy moves right in very quickly and moves in very subtly you remember Esther right you remember Esther and you know she's she's in there and uh you know preparing meals for the king and all the rest of it well while all of that's going on there and this law has been passed nothing's happening at the moment here but Haman comes in and he's trying to cause a stir but let's just go a little bit further here because I want to deal with this little part here you know the story of Esther and you've you've been taught that uh regularly but this is the the scripture the the beginning of the story here in chapter two and it says that the maiden Esther pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification so this is the the head honcho who was preparing these women for uh possible marriage to the King right you know the story and she finds favor with him and he's giving her everything that she needs and uh she's given seven maidens and they were meat to be given to her out of the King's house and he preferred her and her Maids unto the best place of the House of the women now what's interesting is that it says that uh Esther had not showed her people nor her Kindred she never revealed her genealogy that she was a Jew for Mordecai had charged her that she should not do it and every day every day Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her now I want to tell you that this is not an overnight process every day he walks past the palace and he's trying to look in he's got his phone ready and Casey sees her and he's going to snap a picture of her and send it back to the folks and every day he's just kind of looking to see and you know how long he does that he does that for over a year because that's how long it took for them to go through the process of purification I want you to think about this now nothing happens here Esther's she's bathing she's preparing she's going through the rituals that they have here and she's got seven maidens to help her out but this is a long process before she actually gets to go in and see the king nothing's going on here let's finish the verses here and now when every maid's turn must come to go into king of hazarus after she had been 12 months according to the manner of women look at that after she had been 12 months according to the manner of women for so were the days of purification accomplished to it six months with oil and murder six months sweet odors and so forth this is the way that the women were purified I wondered about why it took so long because I mean she's going through this process here and to us it just looks like a bunch of perfume I mean that's a lot of stuff right that's a lot of myrrh a lot of sweet odors and everything else and when I went back and saw that that verse 12 again she had been there 12 months according to the manner of women I will tell you something that if a woman Waits 12 months before going into the king we can be certain as to whether she's received the seed of another man after the manner of women so we know that if she becomes expecting it's got to be the king now because she's sat there for 12 months into delay and nothing's happened if she had received seed from another man guess what it's going to show up within 12 months no fooling this process so God uses the delay to manifest things God uses the delay for his own purpose to bring out things that activity does not bring out does that make sense wow I was so happy when I saw that because I will tell you something you may sit there again you may sit there and think well until tonight that you know not much has happened you know not much is going on and so forth I will tell you this that God God has a purpose in all of it and God will let things go on to manifest what's in the heart of every believer in this world today to find out whether you're going to stay true to the word or what are you going to run after this or run after that or whether you've actually received the seed of another teaching or another movement hello because you know what give it a couple of years we're going to find out where everybody stands but you know what with the bride at the end of the delay doesn't matter how long at the end of the delay the bride is still standing there saying I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them and they believe the word they're just waiting for the uh for that uh you know taking away of the Bride they talk about the Rapture they talk about the change of the body and you know what things come things go things come things go and they've got one thing on their mind I gotta stay with the word I gotta stay with the word I gotta stay with the word I gotta stay pure I gotta stay purified I got to go through this process doesn't matter how long delay doesn't bother me because if I'm a Child of God it's only going to manifest more of the character of Christ than me they're not afraid of delay they're not worried about delay matter of fact you know bring it on that's their attitude Bring It On delay is a good thing if you're pure delay is a good thing because if you've received a seed of somebody else it's going to manifest itself and sometimes it doesn't take 12 months let me give you an example here Exodus chapter 32 remember where Moses is he's on top of the mountain and God is writing out Commandments on the stones and when Moses comes down God says you better get down because I'll blow the whole thing wide open Moses goes down and he said what did this people do to you and that was brought so great a sin upon them you know the story they had made a golden calf right because you know what you can take the boy out of Egypt but you can't always take Egypt out of the boy I said you can take the boy out of Egypt but you can't always take Egypt out of the boy and they still have the seeds of their former way of worship in them and it went right back to it in the delay because they said you know what Moses is not coming back my goodness he's been up there that long and they said uh you know I mean he's probably never coming back so you know they're in the delay and they're kind of thinking well my goodness what's happening nothing happening and Aaron we ought to make something happen here and they put their put all their metal together and they made themselves a golden calf and Aaron says hey it wasn't me it was the people people forced me to do it and Moses stood in the gate of the camp and he said who's on the Lord's Side come unto me the delay manifests everything can I go a little further now what's really interesting what's really interesting here is that there are all kinds of things about the message that we really still haven't seen there's we know that God is the author of Revelation isn't he and he's the one that knows how to reveal things in season and we Hey listen it's just like the Bible we've we've had the Bible since Martin Luther's time and the Bible's everywhere there's there's all kinds of versions of the Bible bibles are everywhere I mean you can't check into a hotel room but there's one in your room there right I mean bibles are everywhere but I will say this and I'll be willing to say this for most of you that you never really understood what was in the Bible until God opened your eyes to what was in there he always had it but you never really saw it like you see it now and it's no different with the message God is the author of Revelation and Jesus even thank God he said I thank God that these things are hidden from the wise and prudent but revealing the babes such as would learn and you know what we're still learning things about the message we're still learning things about the Bible isn't that right we probably didn't know that about Esther Queen Esther there and you know I mean it's just that and don't give me don't give me credit for that hey that's him and uh it's kind of like you know the well let me let me say it this way it's important for ministers to surrender and submit to God so that he can give us things for you but really at the end of the day it's his grace that he wants to bring things to you to help you right and I I realize my position I'm a carrier not a source but you know what when that woman in the days of Jesus when she knelt before Jesus in Simon's house remember and poured the oil over his feet and washed and and rubbed his feet and took her hair and rubbed his feet you know what she was a she was a carrier she was doing something and Jesus even said we want you to remember this wherever the gospels preach we want you to remember what this woman did but when she left the house she smelled just like Jesus did because what she gave out some of it got on her as well it's in her hair it's on her hands and you know she he she's carrying a little bit of that because she was obedient to what God told her to do and even if you're a carrier there's some of that stuff that gets on you and I'll tell you what I'm thankful for that I'm I'm thankful for the blessing of being able to minister to God's people but I'll say this that you know when Revelation comes it comes because God's open your eyes and God there's a season where God's reveal things to you and I was talking about this and somebody said to me well it's just like the arrow on the FedEx logo really there's an arrow in the FedEx logo do you know there's an arrow in the FedEx or are you just saying that you're just saying that because okay all right he knows and then one day I got a I got a shot of the I got a shot of this logo and I realized there's an arrow in there and they made that logo with that arrow pointing right because that's the right way to ship something that's why they put that Arrow there everybody see the arrow let's be honest how many of you don't need to show your hands but how many of you never knew there was an arrow in there before but you know what how how many times have you seen the FedEx truck roll up to your house and rolling down the street we've looked at it all the time but it takes somebody who's who who knows it's there to point that out to you even though you've had it with you all all the years that you've lived in North America hey that's really not any different than how God deals with us because there are things that are laying in the word of God that are Mysteries that God any season he reveals those things to us and it's not because we are worthy but because God loves you and God places a Ministry to be able to bring those things out and we all have a role and a purpose in doing that and there are there are things that we see and I'll guarantee you that whenever you go down the road now and you look and see the FedEx truck that's all you're going to see is the arrow every time you see one you're going to be looking at that and realizing wow that's that's there it really is there all right now let's be specific for a few minutes here that's all right I think I mentioned this to you before when I was here last and by the way now we're two to nothing just saying job is a book that's unusual to me it's unusual I don't mean that disrespectfully but there are things about the book of job that I don't fully understand and it's the oldest book and there's lots of great truths that are in there this is one that puzzled me for a long time and forgive me if I've said this to you before but just to refresh your memory and I just want you to take note of how God deals with us because remember now as I said to you already that it is it is God who's going to perform the work it's God who's going to bring it to completion isn't that right even when you feel like quitting and even when you feel like giving up and I want to say this to you that just because you're a Believer it doesn't mean that you always automatically have to feel right right and be right it's okay to not feel okay I said it's okay not to feel okay because there are lots of things going on around us that can be discouraging and can cause you to be anxious and cause you to wonder about things and you know what you're human and you're gonna have to blame God for that he made you that way but I will tell you that you know there are things happen there are things that you counted on that didn't turn out the way you thought dreams you had that didn't come to pass ministers that didn't really didn't really they didn't really get it and church situations and health situations married situations children situations all of us are subject to those things and there are things that happen to us that you know in in reality there's there's times when If we're honest and we showed our show of hands many of us would probably feel like turning back and just saying hey I'm just going to sit by the sidelines until I can make sense out of this and just back away for a little while and I'm not saying that that's a good thing for all of us to feel but in reality we probably all do at different times well I want you to know this that your Eternal Destiny was never put in your hands the way for you to get from here to there was never given to you he said I'll be with you and I'll be in you and I'll I'll I'll bring you to my house I've got a place prepared for you and I I'm going to come and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and any and he said that I know how to get you there I know the way to my own house and I'll get you there so let me tell you he he never he never gave us in my and I've looked at my job description a lot of times as a Christian a minister and I've never found on there where God said you need to find that place you need to get there he doesn't say that he says you need to submit you need to obey you need to open your heart and mind and let me guide you and let me be that continual presence in your life and let me let you get to get there I remember one time brother Charlie Cox he had a conversation with brother Brandon and uh you know he as a young Christian he always wanted to have the experience of the baptism of the holy spirit that was a big thing for him he really wanted to have that and he said he would get out by himself in the field and he'd pray and he'd go in the woods and he said I'd have these times where he said it was like all the Angels were around me and they surrounded me and he said I felt that presence and there was other times I didn't feel anything and he said there was times when I was in church and it was like God was right there sitting next to me and he said I just wanted to have baptism of the Holy Spirit he yearn for that finally brother Branham one day comes up to him and he says Hey Brother Charlie he says I understand you've been seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he never told brother Brandon that but he said I understand you've been seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he said yes I have and he said well let me tell you something he said said next time you feel that presence like you have in the past he says just give in to it Just Surrender to it that's all you need to do I thought wow what a great answer because a lot of times we have a preconceived idea about what something's got to be we have a preconceived idea about what God's got to do God does not have to do anything that we think he's got to do God is Sovereign and he does what he wants right we can make a lot of assumptions about things and we can be flat wrong but we can be sincere but we can be flat wrong but you know what you're still wrong it's kind of like the fellow who every day he was a plant foreman and in this little town in England and every day he went past uh the watchmaker shop in the morning first thing in the morning he'd walk past the watchmaker shop pull out his stopwatch and he'd look at the clocks in the window and he would set his clock make sure it was exactly matched with this because he thought my goodness everyone if anyone in town is going to have the right time is going to be the watchmaker right duh so he sets his clock every day when he goes past the watchmaker sets that and he was the guy who blew the horn every day at the factory at noon so right at noon he would blow that that horn and you know what happened at noon every day the watchmaker got in the window and fixed all of his clocks to noon because he figured that that Horn's not going to be wrong if you didn't get that I'll see you after church all right we can make assumptions about things that that nobody sees now remember now God's dedicated to you right because he said and this is what Paul told the Philippians that he that has begun a good work in you he'll complete that work right so God's not quitting somewhere in the middle God is not leaving you because you mess up so often thank God for that but I want you to notice just just as an example here in the days of job his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sinned and called for their three sisters to eat and drink with them I mean we never having a great time and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about a job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all so there was a bunch of sons there was at least three daughters so he counted out the offerings every day probably so many turtle doves or whatever else and he made those offerings probably seven or eight he made those every day made sure everybody had an offering made for them he offered burnt offerings according to the number of them of them all for job said this is what he's thinking it may be that my sons of sinned and curse God in their hearts this thus did job continually now we have no evidence at all that his son sinned but job is offering an offering early every day for every one of them it says continually for how long we don't know and I began to wonder about that verse and I was looking at it and looking at the Hebrew because I have some help help set help me understand what the actual language of the Biblical Hebrew is and what I found out was something that you'd be able to relate to when I tell you and that is this thing called a spirit of entitlement we don't know that these guys sinned but job was afraid that his children would have a spirit of entitlement that would make them say something like this hey you know what our Dad's job and you know what our house has been blessed for a long time God's done a lot of great things for us and we are essentially I mean we live with the most righteous man on the Earth we've done pretty good in terms of the message of the hour we're kind of on the upper half matter of fact we're pretty close to the top because we're job sons and you know what God's got to bless me because I'm job's son God's gotta God's got to do things for me and you know what I can I can make the edges of the law a little soft here and a little soft there you know why because my dad is job my dad's a prophet my dad's got communion with God and we know that God visits my dad he's got Revelations and he's got he's got a communion with a walk with God so you know what it says they're having a great time they're living they're living the message dream they're going everywhere to camps and they're looking at all the girls and the girls are looking at the boys and you know what we don't need to get too serious with God because you know after all my dad's a prophet so you know if it ever knee we ever need to get serious we can always go to Dad God's got to bless us because we're you know for me and my house we'll serve the Lord and my dad's brother Paul so you know sure should I not have said that oh my dad's brother Barry so you know what I've kind of got a seniority slash immunity slash protection slash a little bit of a LAX code for my sons because they're brother Barry's Sons and you know what that is that's a spirit of entitlement and job is afraid they may have that and that's why he's offering offerings just in case it doesn't say they have sinned but just in case they develop an attitude you know why because your attitude speaks just as loud as your words and your attitude and your your inner thoughts they speak often loud or louder than anything you may say or do are you with me job's not offering offerings for their sins he's offering offerings in case because he knows how God operates he knows how God's laws work he knows that God is a respecter of nobody in the delay everything is manifested I'm just saying can I take this one step further now if you have your Bible I'd like you to go to a place over here in the book of second Samuel second Samuel if you have a Bible if you have a phone you can dial it I think I have the first couple of verses here on the screen but if you don't mind on the screen went away now in second Samuel chapter 11 it starts out and says that this was the season of the battle of the Kings in other words kings were supposed to be out on the battlefield during this season and this is the story of the chapter that deals with David taking Bathsheba just a few minutes longer okay if you'll just give me a couple more minutes here David is supposed to be on that Battleground because he's trained to battle that way that's what David's done all his life he's been trained that way but he exempts himself God does not tell him to avoid the battle he exempts himself and guess what now he's faced with a battle he's not prepared for now he's got a battle of the mind he's got a Temptation here and he's not trained to deal with this he's supposed to be somewhere else because he's trained for that and I would just say this to you that sometimes when God tells you to do something and you say well no I'm not going to do that I'm going to do this over here you can wind up in a battlefield that you're not prepared for at all and you'll run into enemies and you'll run into problems over here that you never counted on because you're not trained for that but if you're in the place where God wants you to be and whether it's a housewife whether it's a wife whether it's a student or whether it's a minister or whatever it is God's trained you and brother man I'm talk to those Full Gospel businessmen you remember that and they were they were successful in business so they figured ah you know what I can go over here and be a minister and they were moving into an area of battle that they were not trained for at all and they preached prosperity and they preach all these other things that had no relation to the gospel at all so then we know the story how David Falls in that Temptation and then he's got all of his bases covered except one that's the vertical one you understand what I'm saying you rise dead buried everybody's kind of gone their own way because the battle's over they're all going back home and David is sitting on the throne Bathsheba is over here just having delivered a child and David thinks you know what God hasn't said a thing to me so this is okay and all of a sudden Nathan shows up and when Nathan comes to David he tells him this story and the story down to verse six years kind of heartbreaking really you know it gives you the doesn't it there were two men in the city one was rich the other poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and his children and did eat of his meat and drink of his own cup lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a man rich man he speared the take of his own flock and of his own hurt you know what he did he took that little lamb from that man and he dressed it for the wayfaring man it was coming to his house and he took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for that man that was come to it well you know I want to say this that David is capable of seeing the hurt that someone else did but didn't see the hurt that he had caused himself he's capable of judging this correctly because he sees what someone else has done he doesn't know that this is not true he's giving a true judgment here based on the law of what this should happen in a case like this he's capable of feeling compassion for this man and the loss of that little lamb who was like a daughter to him but he can't see what he just did and feel the same way he can't feel what he's just done to Uriah in uriah's family and what he's just committed and all of the associated hurt that goes with that and he's not repenting he's not lamenting that he's not going to God he's not spending time after church in the sanctuary by himself he's not seeking God here he's pretending it didn't happen what is it that's going on in David that he's willing listen that he's willing to risk it all for an affair when he has lived through everything God has done for him to get him to to that throne he's lived through it he knew what it was like to act like a crazy man in front of the Philistines he knew what it was like to be chased by King Saul he knew what it was like to feel the conviction of God he knew what it was like you know to be out there in front of Goliath and trusting God with just a stone in his hand he knew what it was like to depend on God in the fields to kill the bear in the line he knew what it was like they had to deal with the wrath of King Saul who threw a javelin at him he knew what it was like how many times God had spirited his life he knew his origin he knew where he came from what is it in David that's willing to risk it all for this affair with Bathsheba now that's a good question because this is not just this is not just a sin this is a betrayal of a covenant he's a married man and he has he has committed this relationship betrayal now look folks historically if somebody betrayed their relationship they generally had a child out of wedlock everybody knew that they had betrayed their marriage vows right but isn't it true today that the lines have gotten a lot softer because now what is a betrayal now is pornography a betrayal is dating apps on your phone if you're a married man or woman is that a betrayal is flirting with somebody of betrayal should I not have said this is looking up your old flames on Facebook is that a kind of betrayal the boundaries are blurred but I will tell you what in every case an affair is organized around a secret it's always organized around a secret because you can't bring it out in the open and this energy that a person has like David this energy for the thing that is forbidden I will tell you something is as powerful as the real thing and it drives people to commit things that are outside of their boundaries because all of a sudden they're feeling something that they haven't felt in a while now let me tell you something and I want you to remember this that when an attraction happens like this it's not necessarily because you want to leave your spouse but because you want to leave the person you are becoming you're really wanting more to leave the person you're becoming than to leave your spouse and when David listen now when Nathan goes to David he's telling David something very personal he's he's giving him this example right here and he says David look where you've come to you've come to the place where you can't feel compassion over what you're doing but you can feel compassion for someone else think about this and God says to him right in the next verse verse 5. if you have it open here in the next verse David or sorry David's anger sorry I'm I'm in the wrong chapter here verse 6. I'm sorry verse seven the parable is over and Nathan says to David Thou Art the man thus saith the Lord God of Israel I Anointed The King over Israel and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul and I gave thee to the in thy Master's house wives and so forth he says wherefore verse 9 thou Hast despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight and not only that but he said you brought reproach against the kingdom of God so that his enemies would be able to blaspheme the kingdom God's not even able to hold his Kings with all the blessings that he's bestowed upon them now therefore he says in verse 10 the sword shall never leave the house and thus saith the Lord I will raise up evil against thee and thy known house and David in verse 12 he says to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord this was different now than King Saul but David now when he's confronted with the reality of what he's done and how far he's gone not overnight but he's gone to this place where he's willing to risk everything that God has done for him and everything that God's given to him everything that God's bestowed upon him he's willing to risk that because he wants to leave the person he has become and he's become that in a season where he doesn't have the fight and the pressure in a sense it's kind of like a delay season and the delay manifests everything wow if a man after God's Own Heart can come to the place where he can lose the feeling for somebody and not acknowledge it and not recognize it and the hurt he's caused and the reproach he's brought to the kingdom and he's sitting on the throne like he nothing's happened and nothing's gone wrong and Nathan has to come and bring that to him and here is David let me tell you sometimes a person who's in this place like David they're looking at themselves and they're looking at their spouse and they're saying you know what there's got to be something wrong with this relationship and there's probably something wrong with you and they're willing to put the blame on everybody else and they're moving away from the boundaries that they never thought that would cross because they really want wanting they're really wanting to escape who they are becoming all I'm saying is that I'm glad for Philippians 1 and 6. where God says through Paul you need to be confident of this one thing that he who hath begun a good work in you will complete it because in your darkest days in your times of Temptation in your times when things get rough and tight and and it seems like nobody cares and you're not feeling what you should be feeling and you've got other thoughts and you've got your head you're up to your eyeballs in Temptation let me tell you God is not going to let you go halfway through the process he's going to execute this he's going to bring it right to the end and God knows exactly how to pull the rug out it's going to turn your world upside down he's going to do whatever it takes he's going to do what he needs to do he's going to make you aware of things because you know what he's not way off there in a fog he's now in us and will be in us and with us until the very end that's why Paul is encouraging the Philippians and saying he has begun a good work he's going to see it through all the way to the end aren't you glad you got that kind of a holy spirit he's the same yesterday today and forever and if that was true in the early church it's still true today and it doesn't matter saying to God it doesn't matter how long this thing goes I'm glad with Christ in me we'll be able to rise over every wave in every situation and every circumstance because we're not trusting in brother Barry and we're not trusting in brother Paul and we're certainly not trusting in you or you or you let me tell you we're trusting in Him to see it through to the very end of the way let's stand to our feet God is good to us I'm thankful if our musicians will come I'm thankful that we have a God who shows mercy and even even in the middle of David David's trouble uh you know Nathan tells him he says listen he says you've done this and God saw it all because you're able to cover up everything except the vertical but God has spared you there's going to be troubles in your house there's going to be a sword in your house for the rest of your days but you know what God has spared you he's going to save your life he's going to take that baby but he's going to save your life because God knew he could deal with David God knew David had the kind of a heart that he could deal with and he could confront David he could bring truth to David and David would respond to that I pray God would give all of us that kind of a heart that whenever we're confronted with truth and sometimes you know a minister will get right in your face and preach the thing that you need to hear may God always give us a heart that's not hardened by circumstances or our own neglect but rather we'll we'll respond to that and say Lord have mercy upon me Lord do whatever it takes move me where I need to be moved bring people into my life that need to be brought into my life change the circumstances but Lord may I never bring a reproach against this message may I never bring a reproach against you may I Stand For Truth all the days of my life let's sing that little course brother Kennedy that we we ended with we are your house let's sing that this evening here I'll turn it to brother Paul here sorry to keep you so long we are his house we are his people be encouraged saying to God he's watching over you because if he chose you he's gonna he's got a plan he's got all the details worked out to get you to the very end and he sees you just as much in the wedding supper as he sees you tonight he sees you in glory as much as he sees the mistake you made today he sees you in a new body as much as he saw the things you said to your your significant other people in your life he saw all of us he's all of our mistakes he knows all those weaknesses that we have let me tell you we are his the best thing you can say is that we are his and Lord no matter how long this thing goes on no matter how long we wait upon this Earth
