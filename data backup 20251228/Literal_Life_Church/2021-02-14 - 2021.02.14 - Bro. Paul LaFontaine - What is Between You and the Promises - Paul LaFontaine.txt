========================================

reading joshua but we'll just skip right to second corinthians chapter six but this will be along the lines of our joshua commission series that we've been in on for quite a while but we want to read in second corinthians chapter six if you would coming here in verse 14 towards the end second corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14. be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness what concord hath christ with baal and what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for we are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in i just want to stop here if you have discernment you know that paul is talking about a separation that a believer must have from unhealthy fellowship and he makes it so clear that it's difficult for there to be levels of fellowship with the the unrighteousness and righteous and difficult to have concort with christ and baal hath he that one that believes with an infidel there's only a certain level that you can go to and fellowship with these and after a while it'll become a hindrance to you who you fellowship with and that's what he's trying to say but i the next the next verse tells the reason why you know you could separate from people but or from influences that are not right or fellowship that's not right but if you don't know the reason why you're just going to see it as another rule why do we have to do that and here to me is the reason why it says here at the end towards verse 16 and what agreement at the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so what's the purpose of separation god wants relationship with you god it's about relationship it's about god wanting to be and when you talk about sons and daughters and the father that's that's a relationship and so now if he talks about separation it could cause a break in our relationship with the lord if we don't separate from unrighteousness can you say amen so this is the importance but here's the last verse i want to add chapter 7 and verse 1. having therefore these promises dearly beloved what promises he just talked about a promise now which is what i'm going to preach a little bit about today the promise what promise do we have a promise of god that he wants fellowship with us he wants relationship with us and he says if you'll do these things i'll have i'll dwell with my people i will be in them i will have relationship with them and he says having that kind of promise of relationship which should be so important to us having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god i want to just begin a little series here this sunday and next sunday and i won't be able to get it all done today but i want to talk about what is between you and the promises what is between you and the promises because this is what we have in joshua in the joshua commission the fight and the battle was destroying anything between them and the promised land anything that was between them and the promised land but today i trust i can build some value into what the promise is because if you don't see what you have and the promises you have and the value of them you won't fight for them but when you see how great the promises god has given you you'll fight for and you'll ask yourself yourself the question what is between me and my promises father we pray you'll bless the word today bless those who have gathered and those that are listening on streaming we pray the holy ghost will speak through your ministers not only here but around the world lord i pray that your bride your chosen people wherever they may be i pray they would be ministered to the lord they find that faith in the word of god lord jesus that we would see an end to this pandemic and an end to these viruses and different things i pray father that you will bless and heal your people lord god we stand with the blood of jesus christ against any sickness that would try to take someone's life lord we don't stand in fear but we stand in faith lord jesus i pray today your spirit would sweep through this place god i pray that would take hard hearts and humble them father heart hearts and soften them before your presence lord i yield my vessel to you that lives can be changed not because of paul lafontaine but lord because there's a substance of your spirit here that loves us enough lord to draw us close to you i pray that everyone that's not in a relationship today with you would come into a close relationship with you i pray they'd be able to see to remove in their lives what it is that keeps them back lord from a total relationship with you lord they may pray to you and many people pray sometimes unbelievers pray lord god let it be a closer relationship than just praying when we're in trouble but let there be a a holy ghost relationship between god and his people sons and daughters of god rising to the hour that we're living in and living in relationship with you i pray father that you'll bless everyone who's gathered today and bless your word anoint it father take me out of the way now that your word can go forth in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen everybody said amen god bless you amen you may be seated so we find from these scriptures that we read that there is the promise and the promise is a relationship with god and the relationship is even deeper than a sons and daughter relationship with god it's even deeper than that it's a husband and wife it's christ and his bride that's a more intimate relationship and that's the relationship that we're coming into it's about relationship the message itself is about restoring relationship can you say man the the the message itself is about restoring relationship that had been broken by creeds and dogmas and different ideas and the world and so the promise is the relationship the battle is removing anything between you and that relationship and so the question today is what is between you and the promises of god only you can know that only you can ask that question if the promise is so great and they belong to you what is it that's between you and the promises and are you willing to remove those things now i just want to uh this morning step back and just be real practical uh and real simple and the reason sometimes we just have to lay out a foundational thing and this will be what the message is or the motive of god sending the message and the motive of william branham who we preach here as being a fulfillment of malachi 4 to bring us back to the faith the original faith that was delivered to the saints because there are things that float around to de-establish the value of that then sometimes the waters get a little bit muddy as far as what this is and it becomes complicated our beautiful message that god sent over resurrection at the last days that message becomes complicated in people's eyes because of what they read many times on the post and the different uh people things people are saying the waters get muddy and the the term the message gets clouded by so many different ideas and complications but i want to read something right from the prophet who said his motive this morning and i always tie back to this to to show us that the enemy's work has been great to cloud people's view and the value of the message but let the prophet answer in his own words what his motives are and the purpose of him coming and the purpose of what the message is and this is a personal motive so we're going to get real basic here and like i said the reason that we have to say this is because there's such damage from the enemy to damage the name of the message to complicate and confuse people that that even that term people run from it and are afraid from it that's the enemy's work something so wonderful that god has blessed you with to bring you back to a relationship to jesus christ and satan attacks it to make you hesitant of it and so this in his own words if you guys have that first quote in his own words i'd really like to have it up not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they might follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization let's hear in his own words not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church you say well aren't we supposed to follow the prophet like we did paul he was the prophet he said follow me as i follow christ how are we following william bradham the christ that's in william branham that led us into a relationship with jesus christ but the man we don't follow the man because brother adam told us not to here not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization i have never done that and will not do that you say well my this sure seems a lot of orgasm organizational things started that wasn't brother branham's doings that was somebody else trying to build off of it i have never done that and will not do that now i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and people and if i can accomplish just the next quote if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between god and men there's a motive of a prophet i don't care what you've heard people say about him this is his motive not to build his own kingdom not to build some new denomination he preached against that and so anybody who does that is not from the motive of this man or the holy ghost his motive is to see whatever he can do to point people to the word to see a true look at we're talking about it again relationship that's what it's about a true relationship between god and men that god could use this message that you come into a greater relationship with jesus christ can you say amen that i could see a true rep a spiritual relationship between god and men wherein men become new creations in christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word i think that's a good desire i think it's good for us to see that desire i think it's good for us to desire that desire i want to be that new creation that's filled with the spirit and lives according to the word i believe the message that's brought us back to the true bible doctrine and through by back to the word i believe the message has brought me to that in jesus christ to be a new creation filled with the spirit and live according to his word i would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield yourselves completely to him even as i trust in my heart that i have given my all to him god bless you and may his coming rejoice your heart every few years i read this because i feel like this is the last paragraph in the church age book every few years i like to read this because it brings us back to perspective why do i have to do that because satan does his work to just distort and a bunch of things come under the name of message that to me aren't the original motive an idolizing a deifying of the man and so if you feel that i've that way of course you you've misread me because that's not true why do we read so much from him here because he was the spirit of elijah to bring us back but if you stay here long enough you realize it is certainly not about a man it's about christ you're not going to catch that maybe in one service but you're going to catch it and realize we're not about a man around here we're about christ and so i like to read that because it brings us back to the perspective of what his motive was i and you know what it was i want to see a relationship between you and christ now i'm going to take this a little bit further this morning but i want to establish that is that that's what he came to do that's what the message was sent to do is to see a relationship now if you've come to a religion through it and everything is just do's and doubts to you and it's just become some other code to live by that just shows something's missing in your life because it's not meant to do that he never was meant for you to come in some routine and code to live by and i've got to do this out of fear he never his motive was is that you come into relationship with jesus christ you take a hold of the promises of jesus christ and when you take a hold of the promises and you come into union with him you'll never see this thing as rituals and do's and don'ts and so the next quote is just taking it a bit a little bit further i'd like them to pull it up and this is what he says now later on in the prophet's ministry he come to a transition and that transition was moving from all of the the miracles and signs and things that took place in his life all you have to do is get on the internet and check this out is that there was a lot of there was a big healing campaign that took place brother brano's ministry was kind of the spearhead of that many of the healing ministers say that but many ministers oral roberts and all of them spirit had a great healing revival of the 1940s 1950s and went around the world and was many ministers that we could talk about but you see now something begin to change as we realize that god when he catches the people's attention by great signs it's not just that we say in signs and wonders but that we come into relationship deeper with jesus christ god could heal you and you never come into a deeper relationship with him you could be healed of cancer you could be blind eyes open and you never come into the relationship so when god flashes and shows that i'm powerful i'm able to do this i can raise the dead i can open up the blinded eyes it's not just you can sit there and say well praise god he can do it it's so that it draws your attention in and now the prophet begins to show you the word jesus christ so you come into relationship with him and if it doesn't accomplish that it's not accomplished anything so as he come into a transition in his ministry now if you read the books which i have many of them that read given their diagnosis of william branham okay i don't know why i'm being so plain on this this morning but we're just taking our time being plain on it if you've read the books you're going to find the conclusion brother branham was a great prophet or he was a great man of god he had great healing revivals as a matter of fact most of them say nobody had the accuracy in speaking of speaking someone uh what the problem they had in the prayer lines no one had the accuracy it was from all of them it was 100 accurate and there wasn't any flaws in it it wasn't just guessing saying i think somebody out there in tv land has heart trouble i'm seeing they have heart trouble of course somebody out in tv land has heart trouble that wasn't what this is about this is about christ working through someone that by vision he could see what the person had he could give their house number and that's beyond just human that's god showing i'm alive again and i can i know your house number did you know god knows your house number this morning he still knows your house number he knows where you live but you see now as he come into a transition he begin to see that it wasn't just going to stay all the healing and these books will say he was a great man of god but he got off at the end of his ministry every one of them was saying he was a great man as far as miracles and we'll follow him matter of fact i don't know if you've seen it recently on the internet all these ministers now a lot of them have picked up this little thing about him speaking the seven visions and all of them have come to pass and the sixth one was i see a great woman rising to become president or vice president and i see her dressed in a purple outfit and then the seventh so all six visions have been fulfilled since 1933 he's seen mussolini he's seen hitler come to a mysterious end he's seen the cars in the advancement of science he's seen women get the vote he's seen all and it's all happened and now we have a woman that's standing taking the oath who's in a purple outfit they're all jumping onto it and they're reading it could this be my it's so accurate this is amazing interesting though they won't read the rest of the message and pentecostals they tend to jump to the visions part of it all the visions and the profit and all that they jump to those things but they don't want to look at the resume they never accept the rest of this you see so so so you you see then when they say he he did find until he got off to the end what they mean is is that god was bringing them deeper into something to bring the people into relationship with the word because you could be in a healing revival and see the greatest miracles and still not be in relationship with jesus christ still not come to oneness with him and so that's their conclusion but as he come to this transition now i'm ready for the quote as he come to this transition he explained it many ways this is one way he said it in one place that goes along with our series on joshua 1961 he says about three o'clock in the morning i suppose i had gotten up and i looked where in front of me and i was coming down to the jordan there's a vision now our dream looked like i was standing on the map of palestine and i was coming down to the jordan and it seemed like i could hear the song i'm going down to jordan and somebody was singing it and as i drew near the river i looked back and seen which away i had come and i was two-thirds of the way there to the jordan and i looked across so all these visions speak up a furthering of his ministry and what this was be is that we're coming out of the wilderness as moses brought the people out of the wilderness and said joshua it's time to take the people into the promised land this same thing is happening in the last days that the prophet brought the people out of egypt which means the world or denominational systems coming out of egypt to the promised land to all the promises of god that lay in the word for us and this is the transition and so he'll move out of just moses in the wilderness showing mighty signs of opening up the red sea and and uh providing manner for the people who were hungry and providing water to the people who got thirsty my was so wonderful and great and yet the people stayed immature in their complaining by seeing miracles there wasn't enough there was never enough there was never enough miracles now moses said i'm going to go joshua you're going to come finally to the commission and that's there and so was brother brahms come into this and i looked across jordan and i said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land this is the transition of his ministry what's next what's next well it's it hasn't gone off his motive of a relationship but all the promises of god are laying before us and i'll bring the people by the grace of god into all of their promises that lay in this book ties together with revelations 5 when he takes the book the lamb takes the book and the book of redemption is sealed in other words it can't be it can't be seen in the way it should be seen to bring all the redemption and all the promises of god back to the people again and we find the book open in revelations 10 and when it's open that means oh we're in a land of all of his promises being given back to all of his believers somebody say praise the lord he said praise god i'm looking across right now and i'm seeing all the promises of god laying ahead of me i think that's wonderful and when the transition and ministry took place it was bringing the bride into all the promises of god so that to me is a simple explanation of the message as well looking and seeing all the promises of god the joshua commission and i'm just going to say that everything that the prophet preached everything that you have heard everything that you feed on the purpose of it goes back to these two things and that is to bring you into relationship with christ can you say amen and for you to take all the promises that are yours amen to bring us to those promises to get us to see those things also that's between us and the promise because when we feed on the message and read it when we hear preachers today true gospel ministers you know what they're preaching they're preaching the same motive to bring you into relationship and into the promises of god but also if you're under a holy ghost minister you're going to hear the holy ghost tell you of things that are in between you and your promises and sometimes it gets very convicting because all of you have a soul all of you have something within you i'm trusting everybody in this building has somebody everybody listening has something within them or you wouldn't be listening to me there's something within you to that that's responding and that's hungry for something not me not me i'm just here because dad mom told me to be here i'm just here because it's time to go to church i don't believe that i believe there's something within you maybe it's dormant maybe it's hidden maybe it's covered over with a bunch of whatever but i'm going to believe that there's a hunger within you and when you hear holy ghost preaching sometimes it's going to preach things that you didn't realize wow there's something standing between me and the promises of god everybody listening there's something in between me and taking all of his promises because these promises are yours they're not just brother paul's they're not just for the branhams they're not just gideons they're not just for the kinney they're not just no these are your promises this is your inheritance you see well i'm kind of a different bird you know no you're not you have a soul i'm kind of in a different category will you put yourself in a different category these promises are not to just a selective thing it's for the bride of jesus christ and if there's a hunger on the inside which i believe there is in you there the only reason that you are not enjoying and taking all of it in a real filling of the spirit is because there's something in between you and the promise can you say man and so to remove all those things if someone gets an inheritance and a dad or a grandpa promised an inheritance to somebody but they lived in texas okay you'd be looking at what's the hindrances to me going and getting my money what's the hindrances to that because the you have the inheritance it is yours but you've got to remove the hindrances you've got to remove the distance between it so you'll probably have to purchase a plane ticket you'll probably have to sacrifice and put some money in the car to make the trip to texas but are you willing to do it because it's yours can you say man you've got to remove all the encumbrances and hindrances and all the stuff in between you and the promise to take your promise and this sunday excuse me not this sunday but next sunday the holy spirit just through this this time of being locked into my house for almost three weeks had really begun to open some practical things that get un between us and the promise and i probably won't get to until next sunday but if you'll come we're going to talk about simple things that the devil uses keeping you from the promises they're in the bible they're in the message they show us they're simple things but if we could just remove them say god take that out of the way you'd be a different person you'd live a different life can you say math it's something personally to you that's in between you sometimes people get in a way i found a wonderful scripture in joshua that says actually god hardened the heart i'm going to give you this one god hardened the heart of the enemy god hardened their hearts and made them even more vicious so that it would drive israel to go for their promise even more i said can you imagine god is working on the other end of people to make those people mad at you anybody ever had anybody mad at you just okay one all right two three of us four and you're wondering why have they changed what is going on they're treating me so bad what has taken place in these people's life and according to that scripture god could be working on the other side to drive you to say i'm going to fight for my promises and you get mad at the people but it could be god making other people gossip at you and say things about you or come down in you and say lies about you and you get mad at them all you want to but if god's working on them to make you rise up and get some grit and say i'm going to take my promise anyway can i get an amen this morning i want you to see what's in between you and the promise because on the other side of this over jordan is a great great spiritual awakening for you a great life of freedom from people's opinions how many like to be free from people's opinions how many like to destroy the enemy in your life and so through this time i i wrote down a bunch of things and trust me i hope i can end this because i got a lot after three weeks in the house i got a lot of hay on my fork friends i got a lot of sermons something open to me about jonah that i'd never seen before i got to do a whole series on jonah would anybody like to come out the next seven nights and hear it i got a lot you know this is the only bad thing about being closed in the house for me that long for you is that i got a lot of hay on my floor a lot of things to preach i thank god for them this is one is to break down what is it between you and the promise what is it between you and the promises because that's everything can you say amen so if the if you read things in the message and you read things and you hear gospel ministers just remember if it has this motive of bringing you into relationship and bringing to you into promises you shouldn't quickly jumped to say he's out to get me because to me the way i see the message is everything that he was saying was for the purpose of removing the obstacles and for me to take all the promises of god everything everything right down to what we call dress code everything is what's the hindrance to you coming into the promises of god so and the preaching is still today even though the prophet's gone the holy ghost how many believe holy ghost still preaching is still going on and if that's happening if there's a holy ghost in that preacher he is not your enemy he's actually your best friend oh praise the lord that's not your enemy he's actually one of your best friends if he gets under the anointing of the holy ghost and says what your promises are and says what's in between you and the promises that is your greatest friend you say god thank you lord today for encouraging me thank you lord today for using that man to show me another promise of mine thank you lord today that guy today he took the very height off of my back but thank you lord because i see my promises lay it ahead and i want to take my promises praise the lord it's how you look at it can you say amen praise the lord and so we see that he's your best friend and because under the holy ghost he will pinpoint whatever it is between you and the promises of god is that okay with everybody so what's the message about connecting you and god's promises in this hour that's it that's what the message is all about i don't care what somebody has told you what the message is and the people of the message get that out of your mind the message is you being connected to your promises that's what this message was set to do you you no not brother paul you this morning the message came so that you could connect with relationship with christ and come to all the promises he's given you that's what the message is for that's why i sent it don't let anybody complicate it in your mind can you say man it's about you it's about the promises it's not about people it's you and the promises of god and what is in between you and that and it has to be about you and him only you got to come in that secret place with you and him only one day for everybody's life it can't be about you god and your wife or you god and your husband or you god and your pastor it's got to be about you and god where do you where are you are you in relationship with him you can't get you can't come because an emotional decision just i no you have to say lord if all of my family and everybody was removed what do i have with you if my wife quit coming to church where do i stand in my relationship with you if ten thousand fall by my right hand and twenty thousand by my left as david quoted it there it shall not come nigh unto me i'm in a relationship with him and i'm going forward i'm not going back as the song said this morning we won't go back to the way it used to be if no one goes forward i want to go forward with the promises of god i want to move on many people i want my family to go with me i want my daughter to be saved i want my family to keep praying for them but don't let them hold you back can i get an amen this morning don't let a girlfriend hold you back don't let a boyfriend hold you back don't let the things you're looking at on your phone stop letting it hold you back can you say a man kill that thing and say lord i don't want anything to come between you and ours relationship i want to be close to the lord i want to stay close to him and i won't go back to the way it used to be everybody else in the family can go back everybody if if if everybody leaves this thing i'm not going anywhere praise the lord so i want to say something this morning about the promises of god a little bit because if you don't see what the promises are and the value of them and that they're yours you won't fight for them you won't remove things that's in the way because you don't see the value of the promise of god his promises are his word his promises they are they have their beginnings in the thoughts of god before the foundation of the world i'm being real basic again not assuming that everybody understands all this that i'm assuming you might not understand it if you don't understand the promises of god then you won't fight for him valued they are what god has given you in the promises that lay in this bible you can't just believe them you have to possess them you can't just profess them you have to possess them and possessing is taking them you can't just say i believe that's the promise of god you say but is it am i taking it is it mine or is it just my mom and dads or is it just my uncles or is it just the pastors are these promises mine or am i a spectator am i a arms link christian am i just keeping one foot in because i know that it's the truth and so i don't want but i'm just keeping one foot in to be safe you're not really safe if you're stretching your foot like that you could fall why are you putting just one foot in find out what you believe fi this is not a profession it's a possession it's taking it for yourself it's having the grit to say i don't care if any and not no other young people in this church get a hold of it i'm going to grab a hold of this thing not waiting for someone else to take the promises they're my promises i'm taking them for myself so promises are what he established in his thoughts before the foundation of the world not making them up as he goes along god doesn't make up his promises as he goes along and god doesn't break his promises all the mistrust today we live in a land everybody breaks trust everybody's misread you can't trust anybody from car dealers all the way through the government you can't trust any of them can't trust the president you can't you can't trust any of them to follow through promises are broken over and over again that's why it's hard for people to believe god's promises but i want to establish this morning that they are promises of god are just not being made up as he goes along and he hopes to keep them they were in his mind before the foundation of the world established for every age he made a promise for every age and he promised and then when it came to that age he spoke it through a prophet and when he spoke it it had a power within it and it's as good as done can you say man and so that's the part i want to get to but we're just number one it's his word unfailing but number two it's unfailing promises of god are unfailing there is no chance that the promises of god can fail they have never failed the bible says heavens and earth will pass away but his word can never fail his word will never pass away how secure is that find anything else in your life that that's it's that secure fi i i challenge you to find any almost any relationship that's as secure as this one that his promises if he makes him will never has never will never fail there's no element of failure in god's promise when he says he will do something in a generation he will fulfill it he'll follow through wasn't it john the baptist that says if if these don't or jesus said if these hold their peace the very rocks will cry out if you don't praise the lord god's going to raise up something to praise him he's going to fulfill his word promises of god do not fail there is no element of failure in them can you say amen promises of god have a power in them when they are believed and they are possessed they have a power in them to make the promise live and that's what we find in the message is that he gave us promise to every generation because i just seen a video a couple days of somebody who was just trying to knock that out the the message taught us that he gave his word to every generation he allotted a certain word to every generation he allotted a promise to every generation believers come in that generation and they believe the promise for the hour but it's not them that live it as much as there's a power within the promise that if they'll possess that promise there's power within it to cause that to be lived out i'm proof of that here this morning i'm walking in all kinds of word just by being here at church this morning i'm walking in the scriptures just by being here i'm the bible says for ministers to feed the flock guess what i'm feeding the flock i'm walking right in the promise of god i'm assembled together i've come together and and and so you know the the the the promises of god have the power in them to fulfill the promise of that day by the holy ghost in other words the strength of the promise does not rely on you but god to fulfill it the promises of god is like a covenant of god and a covenant of god when god makes a covenant and it doesn't fail unless he makes a covenant with you in other words if you're the other side of the deal every time god did that it never worked because there was an element of failure in it with the covenant i'm talking about this morning he makes a covenant by himself if you turn with me to hebrews chapter six this is how sure it is this is the covenant of god hebrews 6 and i knew i wouldn't get too far this morning but hopefully i'm getting far enough that you can see my heart and see where we're going with this hebrews 6 and verse 13 says for when god made a promise to abraham made promised abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee and so now look at this abraham is given the promise for his day god says it and god swears by himself so somebody makes a promise i swear by it because he could swear by no greater god swore by himself okay he didn't make a covenant with you and make a deal with you he didn't make a deal with me he just said this is your promise and i swear by it it will come to pass that's pretty strong blessing i will bless thee multiplying and multiply the and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise that's one of the scriptures we'll talk about next sunday that's something in between you and the promise impatience because when abraham patiently endured he obtained the promise so if you got an impatient problem with the promises of god you've got to say lord remove this impatient problem i know nobody in here at all has any problem like that that's only me verse 16 for men verily swear by the greater an oath for confirmation is to them and end of all strife so when they swear by something to make a promise they swear by someone greater than them wherein god willing more abundantly to show unto the ears of promise the immutability of his counsel in other words the unchangingness of his counsel the impossibility for it to fail confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope center before why would you lay hold upon the hope side of fourth why would you lay hold of the promise of god why would you get the grit to say these promises are mine and i'm taking them up because you understand that this promise he swore by himself number one two immutable things number one he swore by himself there was no greater story sword by himself he didn't make a deal with you he swore by himself that's strong in itself but the second thing it's impossible for god to lie he's never lied and this provides a strong consolation to those who have fled to refuge to lay hold upon the hope that set before us the promise of god the covenant of god stands sure within itself can you say amen it will be done but it needs to be believed and it needs to be embraced and everything keeping you from it needs to be removed everything has got to be removed you've got to embrace it yourself so they have a pow let me say it in our terms here the promise of god is airtight it can't fail and they are enforced by god this is not a deal with you and god and hopefully your failure part will not ruin the deal it's not a deal with you and god he swore by himself i will fulfill it i will bless you abraham i will make you a father of many nations here's a man that's a grandpa already but he hasn't had any children or grandchildren but he's as old as a grandpa and he says i'm going to bless you with thousands of generations and thousands as the seeds as the sand of the sea and as the stars of heaven i'm giving you a promise talk about a promise to blow a grandpa's mind would it seem impossible to the human mind i'm sure abraham said me and my wife have tried to have children you know we can't help children why did you even choose us because we're not able to have children this has got to be somebody else's promise that's able to have kids god likes to make it as impossible as he can so to blow our minds so you see this doesn't depend on you you realize abraham standing said i can't contribute at all i don't know how this promise is going to happen but that's what i want you to see today i can't contribute to this at all i just need to believe it take it confess it possess it it's mine it's not this brothers it's another abraham said this is my promise and i don't know how he's going to do it but i'm taking it and i'm possessing it he started confessing it started saying to his wife you know the stories that brother brad says you know every day he said do you feel any different dear do you feel any different no sarah says i don't feel any different praise god abraham's praise out we're going to have a baby anyway sarah goes uh you know you're getting a little senile you're getting a little strange with this thing the next day you asked and saying you feel any different sarah you feel is there anything going on down there at all just a little twinge no i don't feel any different today abraham sorry he goes praise god we're going to have it anyhow it's coming and he prepared for it this is my promise i don't care if everything in science says and every doctor says we can't have children this promise is mine and it doesn't hinge upon my contribution to it he swore by himself it's going to happen and it's going to happen in me and sarah not any other couple it's for me and sarah you see how you got to believe it see how you got to possess it and brother brahma says he he bought the little rattlers or the little toys and he he you know painted the tint walls blue had a gender reveal blew up something it all spilled out blue everywhere i mean he believed this and he didn't just believe it this is my promise it's gonna happen he's 75 she's 75 he's 85 they're getting close to 100. he's still believing it because the bible says he staggered not at the promise of god he didn't stumble over his own mind that was saying you know there's no way for this to happen he staggered not at the promise because the promise strength of the promise stood alone with god to fulfill it it wasn't anything that he would inject and when he injected and made a deal it was wrong and it had failure in it if you inject with god it's going to have failure in it these promises that i'm preaching to you and this message has preached to you they are your promises but the strength of them is not to be fulfilled by anything that you necessarily contribute it's when you possess it say it's mine then the power of it begins to work in you and the impossibility of it happening starts to blow your mind and you realize this is happening in me this is happening now there's something happening to me there's something changing in me god's doing something in my life and it's because you remove the hindrances i don't care about other people i don't care what's been said it's just me and the lord and we got our thing going here together in a relationship going together and i'm starting to see the results of things that never could be changed in my life and now they're being changed not on your strength but on the strength of the promise somebody say amen this morning the strength of the covenant does not rely if you would turn with me to psalms 105. and i told you i would i'll be just a little longer but i just want to get to some of these look what this says about the covenant i've preached on this before a little bit but in psalms chapter 105 it says 105 in verse 9. it says which covenant he made verse 8 he hath remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded two thousand generations don't forget god never don't forget that god never forgets his promise he has remembered his covenant forever the word which he commanded a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan and a lot of your heritage when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it when we went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yet he reproved kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm how did they have that kind of protection a small number of people holding the promise and possessing it going forward how do they have their protection because there's a protection that goes with the promise in the covenant god's going to watch over it to see it gets done and every time there was an interruption or it appeared like an interruption to it wasn't going to happen then the strength of the covenant and god stepped in to say no no it's still going to happen when abraham went with hagar with abraham backslid and went down into gorier says there's a famine in the land and so he started to get hungry and started to realize well he should have just stayed there in his land but he said and we that part of abraham we see in our lives is that we tend to get a little shaky sticking with the promise of god when we have troubles come our way there's a famine we get low financially whatever happens in our life we tend to be emotionally driven and there is the thing that says abraham went down into guerrilla we don't know all the reasons why but he left the land that god gave him went down into grier i like to say he went down to career maybe for a new career because it wasn't working out where he was or at least he thought it wasn't working out one place he went to the king fell in love with his wife he says i'm going to marry her because abraham said it's my sister he lied he's getting himself all messed up and god's promise and his covenant is laying right there the whole time and abraham it looks like he's going to mess the whole thing up sounds like some of you sometimes but i'm here to preach to you the covenant over your life is stronger than your mistakes i said the covenant is stronger than your mistakes or we would have messed this thing up a long time ago and there's that covenant just laying there and the promise he made him and abraham's going down there he's lying telling me you're my sister he's this king's getting ready to marry it and it gets to the very last moment that it's going to interrupt the whole plan of god because he's supposed to have a baby with sarah some other king is going to put his seed in her this is abraham has made this thing an entire mess but i'm telling you when it looks like it gets to his last moment the covenant and the power of it god steps in and says no no no no no no no i've swore by this by myself this is going to happen so he meets the king during the night and says boy you touch her and i'll kill you king says what in the world lord you never talked to me the first time you talked to me you're going to kill me i'm an innocent guy i know you're innocent i know you don't have anything it's actually my son that's messing up abraham i know you're innocent but if you go with that woman she's got a covenant over her life and i'm ready to jerk her out of this situation because she's not meant to be yours she's meant to have seed and have children with abraham and i've got a covenant in her life and i'm here to protect him so you can correct this by doing this this and this and and you know turn this wedding off and just do all you need to do i know you're an innocent man you've served god you've done it that's great but give that woman back to her husband he lied to you he's in trouble he lied what kind of a son of god is that what kind of a guy is that i've never lied in my life and this guy's lying and i was supposed to yeah he lied i'll deal with him he's my son send the woman send him and his wife away and when he goes before he leaves ask abraham to pronounce a blessing on your kingdom talk about not understanding things abimelech is going this is really weird i've never understood a god like this but i'm telling you friends the promise and the covenant over a believer's life doesn't change there is no situation there is no thing there is no mistake that interrupts the strength of this covenant you may be away from the lord today and distant you've ever been before maybe you've never been into a relationship but you might be away from the lord god dealt with you and now you're you're you're in a backslidden condition but you won't admit it but i'm telling you if god's calling is on your life you'll come hard or you'll come easy but god's going to arrange things that you're going to get the holy ghost and you're going to be established in his kingdom he's going to love you back why because the love in this covenant is greater than your feelings going up and down and you're in and out of church and you're in and out of things and you can't get established there's something greater thankfully there's something greater than your emotions there's something greater than the people that have hurt you there's something greater than the people who have damaged you there's something greater than family members who've done you wrong can i get an amen there's a calling on your life there's a covenant on your life and it trumps everything that's happened to you when god looks at it it's kind of like i remember gideon coming and saying not this gideon but the getting in the bible says lord you know i come from a poor family i'm not this i'm you're saying i'm not this that's not me and he just kind of bows out and says the lord says no it's you he wouldn't listen to his complaints what he'd been through what family he come from you don't know how my parents raised me lord you don't know what my parents did to me yeah he does yes he does and none of those excuses were good enough when there's a covenant over somebody's life and i guarantee you they're not going to be good enough at judgment day you're going to give a little puny answer on judgment day to the lord that this happened and this happened this is why i didn't serve the lord really no i think it's going to be all together different where you're going to realize the magnitude and you're going to see is that god's calling on your life and what he did to you through calvary stands alone by itself and all the other stuff on this side can never be used as an excuse for not embracing this it's a separate issue that's your first birth that's your firstborn life that's the trouble that came with your first birth but in your second birth there is no trouble there is no falls to it there is no failures john even said he that's born of god does not commit sin wow now can you still make a mistake in the flesh yes but that birth is secured it's sealed into the day of redemption it's sealed it's it's it's firm it's there's no failure to it praise the lord well i might end up shouting this morning and maybe doing it alone but praise the lord the covenant is sure the promises of god are yea and amen he says here be mindful of the covenant because god remembers his covenant we need to be mindful of his covenant don't forget his covenant the word he sends is tied to the covenant both things the covenant in his word because he said the word to these generations that's my covenant with the people they're given by god he is the original i'm going to try to find a place to end here but he is the originator of it he's the orchestrator of it god is the enforcer of the covenant god is the protector of the covenant god is the completer of the covenant how many know the scripture he who has began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it he doesn't say i'll begin the work in you and you work hard to complete it no this covenant says i'll begin it i'll end it i'll i'll complete this work in you if you'll just yield to me if you'll just embrace my promises the promise will do the work you don't complete it he completes it he's the originator he's the enforcer he's the protector he's the completer he's the author he's the finisher in this journey it is crucial that remember that we remember this is the covenant that god swore by himself over your life can you say amen this is not a human thing at all in its origination if it had humanness in it then it would have flaws in it there's no humanness in this be mindful that there's no humanness it must be the things that will happen if we forget it sometimes we forget and we tend to humanize this relationship with god or we tend to humanize the the covenant god made what do you mean by that brother paul it's possible we humanize this and it's easy to humanize because it's the promise of the word made flesh in us so the word is becoming flesh in us so it's it's possible for people to humanize it so with humanity blending with deity it has the potential to stumble at times because the humanity is stumbling and that's why we're instructed to keep always in our heart remember the covenant remember the strength of the covenant the original plan was a covenant that god made and the strength of this covenant and promise lies with him the proving of it lies with him you ever had people say prove it prove it prove what you got prove that here's this person here's this person pray for them let me see if they get well all these people prove it listen we don't have to prove anything we have faith in his word and god will prove his word keep that mindset of how you look at this lest we look at it from a human standpoint now i wish i had another hour to preach because that's what we do is we tend to start looking at the church the message one another from a human standpoint instead of the covenant that's over the people of god you tend to come to church looking at the humanness of people even my humanness as a preacher you're looking for the flaws or you're looking for the mistakes you look into the lack of things that maybe you disagree with and things like that but you see don't let humanness cloud your vision of what's happening here the promises of god are being preached to the people and those who will take a hold of them will live in the strength of those promises that's what church is about if you humanize it how many knows that the people humanize the prophet how many know the people did deify the prophet either one is in balance can you say man you see god was blending with humanity just like he's blending with you the word becoming flesh that's what's happening in you so when it's blending with flesh and we only look at the flesh we say there's a problem with the covenant there's a problem with the promise because you're looking at the humanness you look at people within the church sometimes you look at people within our own church or whatever church you go to you look at the flesh and humanness you're gonna stumble you're gonna stumble sometimes you might look at me in decision to make you stumble sometimes i pray not but you're looking at the flesh you're looking at the human side i wish people would have grace for me like they have for themselves because they get a free pass for all the stuff they've done and stud and gossiped about and yet when i say one little thing out of place oh my goodness that's not a christian i wish i had grace for me like they have for themselves they get a free pass for everything listen we don't get a free pass for our humanness if we make a mistake we got to apologize for it but people get to looking at the human size and they humanize the promise the covenant the work of don't put humanness in it it's separate in the humanness now i'm not justifying a bunch of just sin going on in people i'm not justifying that i think if we make a mistake in sin we should repent quickly before god but the covenant the promise stands alone in its strength without you to keep it together the strength of the covenant does not finally lie with you it's with god and he says he'll protect you from the nations you go through he'll remove kings if he has to he'll move the world if he has to everything will move according to the word that's over your life everything that becomes a hindrance will be removed and god will fulfill his word in your lives we must approach this what it is it's a covenant that means it's stronger than our mistakes it's stronger than anything to stop it it will step in and rebuke anything that gets in the way there's way too many scriptures that we can read right now of human mistakes of people in the bible who were carrying this covenant and i tell you the people were not perfect but the covenant was let's give the lord a hand [Applause] the people many in the bible the people weren't perfect but the covenant was perfect it had no failure in it abraham oh we could talk his mistakes uh isaac jacob my you could go on and jacob here he is he's coming and here he is coming back to his brother and he had to come back to his land and he's scared of his brother and he's got fears and then he's got his own trouble within him he meets god face to face the night before he meets god face to face god changes him because he held on to the angel said god i cannot go another day without you changing me can you say man so he was a deceiver he did him he deceived his father-in-law he deceived he had this trouble in his life but yet yet there was a covenant over jacob's life that that carried with him no matter what he was doing and finally it came to a head god finally changed him and when god changed him then he could look at his brother correctly and had no fear of him when god changes you you look at people different when me when you are face to face with god then you can look at other people different and not humanize them so much but have more love for them the people you're afraid of the people that have done you wrong the people have to get a hold of god and get close to him you'll look at him different i can't forgive that person i can't they you don't know what they did brother paul if you get in the presence of god and see him face to face you see yourself different and when you see yourself different you look at other people different amen praise the lord these are the problems this is i could preach so much more but we'll bring this to an end the promises of god are yea and amen the promises of god don't have failure in them the promises of god are worth fighting for these are your promise these are your promises that god gave you to take a hold of to fight for can you say man and when they're fought for and when they're embraced and when you remove everything that's around then you realize that the strength of them will carry you and it's not you carrying yourself it's the strength of the covenant and the promise carrying you that's why we want to fight for these things when you see the value of living in the promises of god holding on to your hand guiding you through each situation then you hold to those promises with all your heart and it guides you it helps you there's a strength in it can you say amen oh yeah you'll want to remove anything between you and the promises when i get done with this you'll want to remove what's in between you and the promise are you with me today when i get done next sunday and hopefully you'll come out here brother andrew wednesday night and us next sunday when we talk about what you want to remove when you see how great it is on the other side you'll want to remove all these things between you and the covenant you'll want to do it yourself you want to remove them say that's not as important to me anymore that's not as a big a deal to me anymore the promise of god you see that's the problem is the promises of god are so cluttered down here in people's life and everything else up here is more important and i'd have to give this up i have to give that up but when the promises of god are lifted so much greater than all that then it's easy to give this up that's a walk with the lord right there he's promised to hold my hand he's promised to help me stand musicians can come if you don't come i'm going to keep preaching because i'm having a good time today you'll oh yeah you'll want to remove what is in between you and the promises when you realize how great it is to live in the promises of god amen there's a song here he's promised to hold my hand he's promised to help me stand when the valley's too low and the river's too wide he's promised he would lead me to the other side his promises light my way never let my feet to stray living in his word i will overcome standing on his promises one by one he's promised to hold my hand he's promised to help me stand when the valley's too low and the river's too wide his promised he would lead me to the other side his promise is a light my way never let my feet too straight living in his word i will overcome standing on his promises go up a little bit

somebody say glory somebody say his promises are true his promises will get me through can you say amen there's no failure in his promise there's no flaw on his promise it doesn't hinge upon your mistakes can you say about it he's going to walk you through he's going to see us through because that's just how strong his promises are i trust this morning whatever it is that's in between you and these promises get rid of it and say lord i'm going to take a hold of this thing it's mine can you say amen oh yeah i gotta sing it one more time before we go i think we ought to praise the lord saints he's promised to hold my he promised to help
