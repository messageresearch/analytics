if you start reading with me at verse 6 seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered in be entered not in because of unbelief so seeing there was a generation that did not enter into the land and enter into rest seeing therefore it remaineth somewhat uh some must there enter therein he says in verse 7 again he limith a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your hearts so you can see here that he's given the Next Generation a chance because as they failed in the past to enter into the full land he says here's another day that I have set for a chance for the new generation and if you'll hear his voice and you won't Harden your heart you have a chance to enter in verse eight for if Jesus which is Joshua there if Joshua had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief there's a small section here of some practical examples um I have not got to in the last few services on Sunday and talking about the new generation talking about what they have to leave from the old generation and there's certain examples in scripture I haven't got to so I had left this and I hope that we can get to some of it and speak a little bit about it uh I have been using some of the places in Scripture that refer to the new generation and to specifically their fathers there's a term in the Bible we've been using and reading from different places and that's called your fathers they say your fathers did this in the wilderness your even Jesus said it your fathers did this in the Wilder your fathers uh had this your fathers did this so when when he refers to the fathers he's looking at past generations and I discovered that it it it covers a a much bigger meaning when he says your fathers it doesn't just mean a certain generation but it can cover a lot of meaning Not only would that apply to our personal fathers and I been dropping a few things in here because To Me the Meaning can be applied to our personal fathers that we receive in life because a lot of times we don't receive well in all cases we don't have perfect fathers and uh some better than others and maybe some worse than others but there's only one perfect heavenly father and we come into a world that has imperfect fathers and so when you refer to that that's the first thing you can talk about it is that that when you go back and look at your father then you can go back and look at what he's done but I I we we learn tonight that we can learn from our father's mistakes how many know that you can learn from your father mistakes this is actually the only victory that you get out of some things sometimes is that you can learn from things if you're if you're defeated for your life if Satan has pronounced doom on you because you didn't have the right domestic life and you didn't have the right father then the devil's going to defeat you the rest of your life but there is a victory for a Believer and that is that we can learn many times and even people of the world can do this even without Christ they can learn what they come from and they can assess the situation and they can take the good and they can dump out the bad and somehow they can have a better life because they just simply say I won't be doomed by the image that I looked at of an imperfect father and so even worldly people can do that but I'm sure there's a much greater victory for a Believer who would recognize that once we make contact with the heavenly father all the things that we're missing the gaps that we're missing the the voids that we missed for by our Earthly father can be filled by our heavenly father how many believe that blessed be his name so but now when he says our fathers it's not just our personal father but it represents when he says it the generations before us it can also take on a meaning of anything that has been an influence on you in your past in your years of Beginnings when he says your fathers it can mean and that's why this is such an important subject because when it refers to your fathers it can mean your history and your Beginnings as a child or your Beginnings as a new Christian these are such formative years your Beginnings are such formative years that if you didn't have the right leadership you didn't have the right mentorship you didn't have the right daddy in your formative years that's a terrible situation sometimes because you're supposed to have the right type of guidance in your very impressionable innocent form of years you're supposed to have the right kind of leadership a lot of times we don't get it and that's why in scripture sometimes it refers to your fathers it's not just physical fathers not just patriarch fathers like like we talked about Sunday uh he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children well that's a positive thing about fathers because this Elijah will turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers and the faith of Pentecost so that's a good thing can you say Amen but fathers can represent our past Beginnings anything that represents our influence that was on our lives in our years of of our formative years and let me take it even deeper than that your fathers means your religious background or your past and other words if you had a religious background then when it refers to the fathers then you realize that that had a a a spiritual meaning to you whether good or bad it's your spiritual Beginnings it's your formative years and it means your religious background so how many knows that Paul had to take everything he had learned in the theological schools and he had to basically said I had to forget it all I had to consider it as dung because I couldn't properly receive Christ until I forgot all those things and left all of that that was his religious Beginnings that he had to leave and exit all of that because if he tried to mix it together it was a hindrance to him so these are things to think about because uh there's a lot of people and most people have a religious background of some kind most people have some type of religious upbringing of some kind and sometimes that's not altogether great so when when it refers to the fathers and coming out uh because I want to talk about learning from the mistakes of our fathers we all can relate to this because there's things in the beginning in our formative years maybe even as a new Christian that didn't go quite well and so we will need to overcome we will need to look at that and say Lord I want to learn from the mistakes of my past but I don't want to be bound by those things I don't want to live in defeat because of those things can you say Amen so most places in Scripture it means your fathers they knew God in some way when Jesus referred to the Pharisees your fathers well they knew Jehovah God these weren't unbelieving fathers their fathers were not unbelieving he's not referring to Earthly fathers or worldly fathers that were just outright heathens we know Abraham was a heathen so I guess uh Isaac could say his father was a heathen in his past life and he came to the Lord but a lot of times it says your fathers it's they believe Jehovah God they grew up knowing the law and yet God has to warn them your fathers didn't have it all right right and whatever they did was wrong you're going to have to come out of it we have to be honest to realize when he refers to your fathers when the the new generation in Deuteronomy was looking at the promised land in front of them he referred to their fathers and he says he says I'm not even going to bring your fathers into the land except Joshua and Caleb they're not even going in those old Fighters are not even going to go in but listen you're going to go in and you're going to have to stop circling in the mountain with all their stuff you're going to have to rise to the occasion and move past these fathers in order for you to get to the full impact of the land and you're going to need courage to do it amen so you know there's a call to learn from the examples of the fathers whether human or whether spiritual fathers or whatever it is there's a call to learn from their example and I'm going to read a few scriptures related to that tonight he says look at the example and that you shouldn't follow I read to the scripture he says that we should not follow the same example of unbelief so everything is about example everything is about the example that you got fathers are supposed to be examples but if you had the example that wasn't right then he says you don't want to follow the fall it says lest any man should fall after the same example of unbelief that's the that's the risk of it all is that you would fall too that you would unbelieve too that you would you would not believe that you would miss the mark yourself that you wouldn't get a hold of the high calling in Christ the risk is that you fall after the same example of unbelief God does not want us to do that he's got something better for us he's got something greater for us he's got something better for our families he's got something better for our lives you can't let the past smother over the future praise be to God you can't let it do do that can you say amen and so when God says learn from the examples there's there's a chance that God gives to learn from that and we we we take the good and we purge the bad that's what we do we take the good but we have to purge the bad and make something better out of it you know God's really the author of making lemonade out of lemons he's the one that can do that he can take the worst things he can take a es and make Beauty out of it can you say amen he can take something that's uh defeated and bring Victory out of it can you say Amen Beauty out of it as is Trials turn into testimonies with God can I get an amen he can turn the past into a power the future becomes powerful when there's forgiveness when there's mature understanding and when there's reconciliation of the past he can turn power into your future by the power of forgiveness by the power of a mature understanding you can't keep a childish understanding you can't stay in that mode you must understand what took place you must see this is what happened and bad or good this is what took place but I'm looking at it a mature standpoint can you remember Joseph in the Bible who got a revelation of what happened in his life and he was able to tell his brothers that I have no ill intentions towards you I have no ill fears feelings towards you there's nothing in my heart because I Know What You Did in evil has turned out to my good it's turned out to be the will of God for my life now you're looking from a predestinated point of view now you're looking for a power in your future now you're seeing things from God's perspective but if you stay down here you'll be childish in how you look at it just like everybody else is praise be to God so the future becomes powerful whether it's forgiveness mature understanding and Reconciliation I'm making that point because reconciliation is deeper than forgiveness reconciliation is deeper than forgiveness it's not just forgiveness but if something can be reconciled that's even better God tells us to learn from what is wrong but don't ever let it Doom you to Fair failure can you say Amen I'd like you to turn back to my uh text in Hebrews chapter 3 and we start there it starts here in verse uh 7 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when everybody say your fathers this is the term your fathers tempted me God said they tempted me they proved me and they saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always he in there where did they he at in their heart they were possibly doing everything right A lot of the times by the law but the problem was in their heart they had unbelief in their heart their lips might have been saying the right things but their heart wasn't in it you got to get that together this is the generation that was under Moses now okay they're they're all in as far as the law okay yeah we're on they said we're all in yeah we'll do it but you see there was a problem in the faith of their heart remember he says Harden not your hearts and you'll find this term three times in the text I'm reading now three times he says this is the biggest thing don't Harden your hearts how did their hearts become hard because of their unbelief when you don't fully believe with all your heart you do all the things on the outside maybe but you're not fully in that has a way of wearing on you and you get harder and harder and harder towards the Lord and so when we get harder towards the lord it's even harder to come back to him that's why I talk to people in the world they come from a religious background but their hearts have become hard towards it they don't want to talk about it anymore because something happened in their belief they didn't trust it anymore they didn't believe it anymore the more you disbelieve the more you become Harden your heart this what the Bible's saying Harden not your hearts as they did in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me verse 9 saw my works for 40 years wherefore uh I was grieved with that generation said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways I made the point a couple weeks ago here's a big point they knew my works but they didn't know my ways they celebrated my works but they didn't know my character they didn't know who I was they didn't know the reason why I was doing things they didn't understand my heart and if you don't understand God's heart then you're not going to you're going to enjoy the works that he does of course with them when he' do a great work it was great but when he didn't show up quick enough they started to complain so you get used to God showing up quickly and meeting all your needs that's a childish spiritual walk they had always air in their heart they have not known my ways they knew his works but not his ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest that's in your Bible take heed Brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief so here's the core of it it's a heart of unbelief they're airing in their heart what is it's a heart of unbelief it's not so much the actions on the outside but it's the heart of UN believe in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened there it is again second time through the deceitfulness of sin which is unbelief for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if we will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses but with whom was he grieved for 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into the rest but to them that believe not they didn't get to go into the land because they kept disbelieving so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief it's pretty important that we trust and we believe with all of our hearts because it's so severe that he actually said you can't go in because you can't get over this unbelief you can't go into the final climax of this which is why he brought him out of Egypt to start with you can't go in that's pretty serious I mean getting in is everything coming into our promis it's everything can you it's why he sends the message and to lose that come short of it and even Moses did because of his temper it's pretty serious cuz that's the most important thing so something happens when there's a lack of believing and trusting in the Heart It produces more hardness I wish I had another sermon to talk about hardness because hardness is uh so much a part it we can becom hard so quickly but why does it come from well it happened because of bad things happening in life not really it's because the trust issue it's trusting it's trusting God it's having faith and having courage to believe his word even when it looks like he's not going to answer we stand there with courage in face of fear and say I believe it with all my heart it's like Abraham saying it's going to happen I'm going to have a child do you feel any different Sarah today and she said Abraham I don't feel any different he said we're going to have it anyhow how about today well she said you asked me yesterday it's another day do you feel any different I don't feel any different praise God we're going to have it anyhow God needs a heart that's all on board can you say amen God needs one that believes his word and Trust his word despite the fear that's ahead of you that's what he needed and when there's a lack of believing and trusting that way when there's a lack of Courage that way then it produces hardness and you become harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and we we we don't want that so don't forget unbelief if you hold on to it makes you more hard all the time believing and having faith and having courage with the voice will bring you into rest now he promised another day in chapter 4 and verse 7 he says this is and this is the the the blessing of the Next Generation again he limith a certain day verse 7 a certain day saying to David today so he actually presents he prophesies of another day to the new generation he sets another day for the new generation that they will have a chance to enter into rest and into the land even though their fathers diff uh didn't Redemption has no limitations to it can you say Amen you can be as low as ever and your fathers could have been low to you but Redemption says I'll give you another I'll give the generation I'll set another day that you have an opportunity to enter into my rest how many say praise the Lord God says I'll I'm going to set another day that they'll have an entrance they can enter into my rest even though the fathers messed up the fathers got it wrong they didn't do it so so he goes on to say here seeing therefore it remaineth verse six that must some must enter therein and they do who they to whom it is first preach entered not in because of unbelief again he limith he set a certain day saying to David today after so long a time as it is said today if ye what is this saying to you I'm gonna give another chance just one more chance today if you hear his voice once again it's the fourth time in there Harden not your hearts was why because that was the problem I'm going to give you a chance again you're going to hear my voice again but when you hear it don't disbelieve and don't let your heart become hard towards it amen for if Jesus Joshua had given them rest then would he have not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore rest to the people of God Amen for he that has entered into rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest he's telling the new generation especially now that the Holy Ghost has come which is our rest by the way let us labor therefore our Holy Ghost Promised Land is Our the brother bisco used to say this what is the our land it's not heaven some types are it's about heaven but we need something before Heaven our our our promised land is our life every day in the Holy Ghost and overcoming life every day in the Holy Ghost defeating the enemies of unbelief and then he says this don't fall by the same example learn from their example and you hear this voice so if if you have hear the voice and you have unbelief with it it turns into Hardness of Heart if you hear the voice and you have faith to believe it it turns into you entering into rest it's only two things you got the faith to believe and step out on God's word you enter into that rest not into more Hardness of Heart fathers of this world and in Christianity turn to these things as well because of their lack of full faith in God it has an effect on the family A negative dad will hurt the family a dad that's not is is constantly negative I mean his daddy negative Norton he's constantly negative he's constantly sarcastic he's smard delic kids that are around that that's going to destroy your family and hurt your family a negative dad will over time hurt the family a father who does not sanctify his life from the fornication and adultery of the world will hurt his family and hurt his marriage a father who's not sanctify his life especially privately will hurt his family in marriage a disrespect to God and God's servants and the body of Christ will hurt the family a father that does that will hurt the family A fleshly driven example of full of worldly ideas will hurt the family temporal V values instead of Eternal values will hurt the family watch where your children go this is not the image of a true Godly father and so naturally as fathers we should learn to come out of these things as well thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like to come and visit
