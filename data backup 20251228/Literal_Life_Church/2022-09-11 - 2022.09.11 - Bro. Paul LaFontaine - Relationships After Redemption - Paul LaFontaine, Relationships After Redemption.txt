========================================

acts chapter 4 we'll read our scripture this morning and we'll be mindful of the time as well as we have two services today but we want to get into the word here acts chapter 4 and verse 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of what things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was any of them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and joseph who was by who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite of the country of cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet i want to emphasize verse 32 today as under my text and subject i want to emphasize that this is where the people of god were after uh the redemption and the holy ghost had come this is the state of mind this is the state of heart is that they were of one heart and of one soul this is what the holy ghost does if you go back to acts 2 i'll go ahead and read this i'll refer to it later acts 2 it says a lot of the same thing after right in acts 2 after the holy ghost fell then he peter directs the people and then it comes down and it says verse 41 acts 2 41 then they gladly they that gladly received his word how many want to gladly receive his word today them that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there was added unto them three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common heavenly father we pray you will bless and anoint your word today we're glad that you have come father for any of us who have known you for years we know that your presence is near this morning we know that you've chosen to come and visit us wherever two or three are gathered in your name you promise father to show up and lord god angels are encamped around those that fear the lord and respect his word so father we ask that you would break every fetter we asked lord that you would break down every stronghold of the enemy we bro we ask lord that every wrong would be made right we ask that every mistake would be put under the blood of jesus christ lord we ask that every offense lord would be forgiven and we commit ourselves to listening to you and sitting at your feet today as lord we look to you in this time in this hour for such a time as this is what was told of esser perhaps god raised you up for such a time as this you didn't call us lord to live back in jesus day you didn't call us to live in luther's day but lord you predestinated us to this age that we live in so no matter the trials no matter the the satan's eden that we live in if you put us here then you've put us here for such a time as this and that is to be overcomers we believe that lord give us the strength anoint the people's faith and we'll put our trust completely in you this morning as we commit it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you're seated this morning just a few weeks ago we were on a subject of relationships after the fall relationships after the fall and we were delving into after everything fell when mankind fell then we know that it wasn't just that they'd fallen in sin but everything in relationships began to fall number one their relationship with god was broken and their oneness with god was broken and that was the worst tragedy but not just their their relationship with god was broken and became strained and there was a wall between them and god not only their relationship with god but also their relationship with one another in their marriage and from that point on relationships were broken because of the fall of sin and so we elaborated on that talked about the relationships that took place in some of the attributes of fallen relationships and fallen things when man is away from god and when man is broken from god and away from god then we realize that he can't be right he can't be what he should be life is never correct life is never what it should be when we're not in relationship with god and so we elaborate on that but today i want to pick up the series again as i have just a little unfinished business to talk about because we don't want to leave man after the fall but we want to call talk about relationships after redemption relationships after redemption and we want to pick this up again relationships and what they look like and what they are and we're working out of the theme of the message oneness that the prophet preached the message oneness and we want to explore some windows in the scripture of after calvary and after resurrection we know the prophet said that this was the answer to fallen man is that he provided the only way for man to come back to him and the only way for our relationships to be right again and that is he would come and provide a sacrifice and he would deal with sin the reason he had to deal with sin is because we could not deal with our sin we there was nothing we could do there was no class there was no there was no uh bettering ourselves there was you could not deal with this this sin was so deeply rooted in us that only god himself could provide a way and praise the lord friends god provided a way through calvary and the resurrection for us to come back into relationship with god and so as as as the prophet was speaking on these things then we we jump to after the the calvary and resurrection and then when this great power began to come upon the people and he began to redeem his people by the holy ghost putting his spirit within them then we want to look at what happened right after that throughout the new testament because we want to see what relationships look like after a person has been redeemed because from what i understand everything that was lost in the garden god's power of redemption is powerful enough to redeem it all back and bring it all back not just half of it but all of it again uh and i'm glad it's that way so there's some windows in the scripture that talk about not only our relationship with god after we've been redeemed but our relationship with one another as well there's some windows in the scripture we want to look at as friday was the launching of the the homeschool co-op if you're a homeschooler it's a great group to be a part of and they asked me to do the devotion so we're just kicking that off on friday and we had a nice little time and in that little devotion i read some windows in the scripture of what jesus was doing when he was young we don't have a lot of picture of what he was doing when he was young but the scripture gave us a couple of windows to look at of what he was doing and we're thankful for that there's not a lot on it but there's enough there to we can see to give instruction i was telling the kids that god in his grace came down and lived out every age that we would live so that he would know how it feels to live in those ages and when we go to him in prayer he understands every age teenage eight years old five years old he was a baby can you say amen that's our god and so just taking that window but today we we do have some things to look at with what this was looking like of the power of god in people's lives after calvary after the resurrection and after they were filled with the holy ghost and that that we can praise the lord this morning that the oneness that was broken at eden was completely redeemed and restored and begin to express itself after they begin to come out of the upper room everything that was lost in eden was restored and they come out of that upper room with all the power laying within them that had been lost in the garden of eden can you say amen this is the way the prophet says that he said now then came it is this is in the message oneness if you just bring that microphone up here down just a little bit there's a bit of feedback now then came pentecost god made them one again then came pentecost god made them one again oh my then they had oneness with god god was in them now acts if you're putting it down acts 4 32 and this is the scripture i read as a text this morning the bible said that they were with one heart one soul one mind oh brother why they had been restored back to the original again can you say amen so all the oneness that they lost with god all the potential for oneness with one another that was lost in the garden pentecost got gave them the power to come back into oneness with god again they didn't have that before 400 years of the pharisees and sadducees developing all kinds of rules all kinds of regulations all the law everything was wonderful we appreciate the law we appreciate all that people have done but there was no true oneness with god until after they were filled with the holy ghost he said now then he said the only thing that they had left to be disposed of was an old city or they lived in there the old body called a senior temple that they lived in here that they had that had to rot because it had to die and corrupt but in listen to this now in spirit and life in purpose and in vision and everything they were one with god again i don't think there was enough amens on there i'm going to read it again in spirit when they come out of the upper room in spirit and life in purpose in vision and everything they were one with god just back just like back in the garden of eden can you say praise the lord if i'm hearing that right can you imagine now what kind of union this is that human beings had come back into such a union with god and with one another like eden again that the only thing missing was their theophany body in other words there wasn't anything else missing there wasn't anything else lacking when they come out of that upper room all the potential was with him everything was with everything that was lost in the garden of eden was all there and in purpose in vision in spirit in life everything was restored back praise the lord that's quite a powerful work of the lord that's why every one of us need to make sure lord fill me with the holy ghost not psychology can you say man not my own selfishness not my own plan to make myself better the holy ghost is we die out to him god let me make sure that i'm filled with the spirit of god because only through that path do we come back into oneness with god and only through that path do we find right marriages right relationships can you say family relationships can never be fully restored under psychology but only through the work of the holy ghost can i get a greater amen hallelujah so in in every way besides that theophany body that word body which is what they need we still need it but in every way they were one with god one with one another everything lost was put back into the believer again i'll tell you that's redemption everything was restored and those people coming down the stairs of that upper room had within them everything that adam and eve and eve had power dominion and that's the thing is that you couldn't you couldn't see any difference in them as far as their bodies except for they were a little drunk in the spirit how many knows they were drunk in the spirit but you couldn't see if if you're looking for the carnal eye you would watch them coming down on the upper room and you know something's changed because just the way they're acting shouting worshiping glorifying god and then god did a supernatural thing as they're shouting in their language the other people were hearing it in their own language so god could get the gospel out of what was taking place god did a supernatural thing but if you looked at them their eyes nose mouth their looks didn't change at all can you say man there was not a new body if they were old they were still old but i want to tell you when they come out of that upper room in every way they had come back into oneness as adam and eve again looking with the carnal eye didn't look like anything's different but i'll tell you it was different from that day on and they come down those people were coming down the stairs from the upper room with everything that adam and eve lost power dominion the only thing they still had that same body but in spirit all the potential was there they would not pray pray for it over time it was already in them but even those bodies as i said got so filled with god even those old bodies that were born in sin become drunk in the spirit how many has ever been drunk in the spirit of god just about six or seven of us it can happen we were here the night of worship and the lord came down in one of those songs the spirit was so strong just a few weeks ago and the reason i'm reliving it is brother kenny and i are doing some post-mixing to get the songs ready to put out and i i can't listen to them without still getting goosebumps and still feeling the presence of god and weeping in my truck and the lord came down there about the middle there and we just begin to sing that sing that course that we sang this morning hallelujah i'm telling you friends the lord showed up and we become so broken and so just awed by the presence of the lord just she just didn't want to speak it was wonderful how many has ever been in that presence and we're trying to mix the song that was after that and we can't hardly get it together because the singers didn't have it together they couldn't sing they couldn't sing a straight note because they were crying and broken and screaming in the presence of god and just could hardly pull themselves together for the next song that's being drunk in the spirit of god can you say a man he still does it friends [Applause] so all the potential was there and we see so many attributes that we had never seen before in the people of god in the book of acts begins to show this the book of acts begins to show uh what what god is doing now in oneness with his people and some of the attributes of it how many is thankful for the book of acts because we get it's the first account of what we begin to see what god looks like in this oneness back with his people again with power with dominion with signs with healing with wonders can you say amen so many things were happening and it's just like when the prophet said when the that tree of life christ he came two thousand years ago but he was the tree were the branches and when that tree of life put out his first branch it wrote a book of acts behind it that's why we have a book of acts because the branch came out from the tree and began to bring forth a fruit of what it would look like of god and his people again oneness in his people again when the the when the tree puts forth another branch he says it'll write another book of acts he says it'll write another book of acts so when this tree of life can you say amen in the last days because denominational creeds had destroyed it and ate away at it but when this pre tree puts out another branch in the end time it'll write another it's the way the prophet said it'll write another book of acts and guess what we're not waiting for that to come in the last 50 years this bride could write another book of acts they are healings there are wonders can you say amen there's restored relationships there's marriages restored can you say amen in the last 50 years since we received this word the the bride if we wrote it all down that's why i want your testimonies because we need to write it down and give the devil a black eye this bride could write another book of acts we can start from last week when our sister laura was prayed for had a lump worried about the lump laid a prayer cloth on her went this week there's nothing to it there's there's absolutely nothing to it whatsoever can you say man we can write another book of acts and then we just keep going back 50 years the dead raised can you say amen hallelujah so and so now i i i build our faith with that but remember now the supernatural is there the apostles doctrine is there that's a part of the book of acts because they continued in the apostles doctrine you can't have a church without having doctrine can you say amen there was no church order there put in place yet i want to say that that in the book of acts there really wasn't any church order in place yet and you know they were doing good we just needed the church order later paul said we're going to need this we're going to put stuff in order there was no modesty teaching in the book of acts that's awful quiet that came later had to talk about those things later and what's interesting friends is a lot of times with a denominational spirit we will reach to the church order part we will reach to the dress part and we'll make that the emphasis if we can just get everybody just right and all those things and if we can have church order just right that's the vindication that we're the bride that's not the vindication where the bride the book of acts is the vindication that we're the bride i'm not eliminating church order i'm not a living modesty but if we jump past the book of acts if we jump past the life of the holy ghost and we jump right to the other stuff we make a denomination out of it you can do that i can do that anybody's susceptible to do that and what we need first before any of that is we need the life of the book of acts the life of the holy ghost because when you got that you can move forward with the lord come on now i should be getting greater amen than that there was no church order but there but life was there oneness was there you know it was just a simple thing but it was powerful no church order set up yet but life i tell you when we have life and when we have what they had in the book of acts when we have oneness i'm happy i love church order but church order without life i don't want that that's getting something that's that's the cart before the horse you have to have the life of pentecost the life of god the oneness the relationship with the lord first it has to be a relationship with the lord amen i want the life of what happened in those people i want the oneness can you say amen i want the relationship that they had with god i want the relationship that they had with one another after redemption this is what it looks like and it starts right away in our text and says they are of one mind and one heart and brother braham says that's the oneness it was pure one mind and one heart and all of a sudden so i'm just going to start elaborating on these these attributes of what it looked like in in um in the days of the book of acts let me just say this just a minute we had the supernatural manifested we had the life of god and the people we had oneness we had all those things happening but quite often the supernatural gets emphasized more than the oneness and quite often i've heard preachers many times bring it down to where that's the full vindication of the bride if we have the supernatural working among us and we have prophecies and we have all this going on that's the vindication that we're the bride and i just want to remind everybody that that's not the full vindication of the bride we should always have that god should always be dealing with us our young people need to see the power of god in a supernatural god but it's not the final vindication of we the bride because people out there in charismatics and all that god can honor faith and they can have the supernatural happen out there you can't put god in a box i might lose some of you right here but i'm going to just plunge on ahead you cannot isolate that to being the only vindication of the bride it's part of it but it's not the final vindication [Applause] they have healings there they have prayer lines they have results because it's our god that does it and he honors faith prophecies some of them come to pass sometimes some of them don't but they have true prophecies that come to pass they say well that's the book of acts church that's what happened you know somebody walked in the shadow of peter and they were healed right in the first few chapters praise be to god can that happen again yes that can happen again but don't make that the only vindication that it's the bride of jesus christ and i want to remind us as well that before the oneness of pentecost came in the holy ghost jesus had already given his disciples power without the holy ghost in their soul to pray for the sick and to cast out devils you did remember that right that they had that power to cast out devils before they had the holy ghost but they had no power for oneness they had now power to come in oneness with god they had no power to come in oneness with one another there was nothing there they couldn't even become one with christ i'll read a quote in a minute they couldn't even become completely one with christ they couldn't get on the same page with them they didn't understand why he was leaving they didn't understand the word there was hardly any revelation there can you say amen but they could cast out devils because we know when they came back they rejoice that even the devils are subject to us without the holy ghost so don't make that the final vindication of the bride that this is the bride because she can cast out devils because they were doing that before and you remember the other incident when they come back rejoicing he said don't rejoice because the devils are subject to you don't just be shouting because devils are being cast out the reason for your worship should not only be prophecies and casting out the devil he said don't rejoice because the devils are subject rejoice because your names are written in the lamb's book of life that's our worship the lamb's book of life the seven seals has been taken off it and i'm in oneness with god i know who i am i know from the foundation of the world who i am i see my name in the book of life that ought to make somebody shout the aisles you see how we can get off track sometimes and i mean it very respectfully because i'm a man who believes in the supernatural god they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i'm a man who's cast out devils before i know what devils look like and i know how to cast them out and i'm going to keep doing it i do a lot of it while i'm preaching right now yes yeah yeah every sunday i cast out devils while i'm preaching but the power to do that stuff we got to be careful that we we don't make that the final vindication and so then what do we look at at the end time as the vindication they will write another book of acts okay so now even in the revival of the bride if we only look at the manifestation of miracles and signs and wonders you're only isolating one part of the book of acts but there's other parts in there i'll just say this is that if you're a book of acts church then it wasn't just the signs and miracles and wonders but when when the couple there lied about what they brought before the lord somebody help me out ananias friar which is just a few chapters in as well the holy ghost the book of acts church discerned that the holy ghost discerned it and didn't let it buy so how can we have just a lot of just a lot of casting out devils and yet i've watched in some churches where they can have a lot of that and a lot of prophecies and a sexual a pornography demon is binding somebody for 20 years and i think if it's a full back of a book of acts church i think it ought to be discerning those spirits as well how does it just sit there and miss the discernment of the holy spirit and that gets a free pass no when you're in the presence of the holy spirit nothing gets a free pass we stand open before him lord correct me lord change my life and lord deliver me from this devil it's not just devils of sickness and cancer and a lump and a little this no it's not just physical but it's mental healing can you say amen it's devils that plague our minds [Applause] and the book of acts church had it all can you say amen and they had oneness with god and one another and so if we're looking at the final vindication it's not just the supernatural i'd rather hear things like full adoption and when i say adoption we all come to an adoption the final age a bunch of intellectuals with our phones and our table on our phones and doctrinally we're intellectuals that's not the book of acts book of acts was life life of the holy ghost overcoming every day oneness with god fellowship with one another fellowship in the presence of god at the end time it's all changing and we get rid of all that pentecostal stuff and we become high intellectuals that's a that's not adoption to me but let me hear some sermons about the final vindication being adoption and being capstone love because i thought the final thing was this capstone of love coming down in the bride not mamsey pamsy love not a passive hate for one another but divine capstone love being poured into the bride and that brings it to a climax let's hear some sermons about the vindication of the bride being the only ones truly that can come to capstone love amen [Applause] praise the lord now that i got that off my chest we'll move on here's another thing that that happened it said what they owned all of a sudden something huge changed with the holy ghost and with oneness what they owned they did no longer say this is mine what's mine is mine and what's yours and yours yours is yours let me say that again what's mine is mine i own it what's yours is yours keep it separate leave me alone i have my life you have your life all that gets washed away now i might lose some of you i'm talking about what the book of acts did in the church to bring oneness and to bring relationship and it burned out this this is this is mine and you know uh my granddaughter just hit this stage the last six months where she begin to recognize what's hers you know we didn't teach her that in fact we teach her the other way right he said no share share with people and i'll tell you you can hear some real reactions out of them sometimes because there's certain things they are not going to share mine and then get oh this is mine you don't get it she won't even share her popsicle with me my popsicle nana gave it to me it's mine where's the salsa from a fallen nature and there's our divine this is my stuff and that's your stuff and then we can fight over it and then even siblings can say but that's mine and we bring it to the court of mom and dad to settle whose it really is it all comes from a fall in nature but we we might as well not laugh at my granddaughter or laugh at your children that do it as well we might not laugh because what does it speak up it speaks of children it speaks of immaturity so it speaks of immaturity say this is mine it speaks of immaturity that's in adults sometimes to act like children and say this is mine this is all mine so it's an attribute of children even if they're adults and i'm here to tell you the the change of the holy ghost and redemption begin to change this is mine thing this is mine and so now it's it's now that they begin to consider it common property in other words for the use of all i want to emphasize that this it's not just about property it's not just about what you own but it became common the word common is that you're and you remember as we elaborated on the fall in the beginning the first thing they did after the fall is begin to blame each other begin to brother brahm said pass the buck to one another they begin to act alone as separate entities eve begin to act alone adam begin to act alone and they begin fighting for themselves to protect their their own cells and blame somebody else and become very selfish they never were that way before but the fall brought in selfishness the fall broke relationships and you cannot have you cannot have decent relationship with selfishness involved you can't have a right marriage with selfishness you got it in your mind this i'm marrying this person they're going to meet all my needs all the needs that i want they're going to actually going to do it just this way and you're just on the wrong track buster you know it's to lay down your lives to one another it's saying i'm entering this marriage how can i make their life better how can i meet their needs that's a christian marriage amen because that came after redemption and we will get into that what marriage looks like after redemption we will get into that not today but they considered it common property for the use of all and and after the fall they were blaming one another standing alone as separate entities before they were one with one another adam was saying this is bone of my blown flesh of my flesh she's one with me if she does this i'm a part of her she's a part of me and it's all oneness after the fall he's saying the woman did this he did it he's protecting himself it came from the fall it comes in our fallen nature and and blaming one another and then he comes to the woman and she blames the serpent and and so but you see in this book of acts church friends it was no more it's whatever is mine is theirs whatever happens to them happens to me if there's a need if there's a burden then i have a need and i have a burden if there's a something that's happened to them then it's happened to me because i am one with them we are together in this we have all things common it wasn't just possessions but it was the whole spirit amongst the people that there was no big eyes or little yous or better people or better dressed people or rich or poor see that's the world we live in it's categories of people it's categories the rich the poor the preppies the the uglies the good-lookings it's it's separated us all none of that belongs in the body of christ it's all things are common and we're all saved by grace there is no people and anybody who gets a promotion becomes more of a servant anybody who gets more popular or becomes some we don't have idols and celebrities in this message i get so tired of it that doesn't belong in the in the message at all celebrity preachers and celebrity singers and and all these things it doesn't belong here at all if your gift gets better and better and effective to more people around the world that should make you more humble and you look at yourself less not a celebrity but less and you better stay humble before the lord because in that popularity you're a subject that can follow yourself stuff doesn't belong amongst the body of christ can you say amen they lost this whatever happens to them happens to me because they this other person next next if they didn't have churches yet so they met in houses this pretty person sitting on the couch next to my next to me now i'm not trying to look them look at them in the chair and examine where they came from and put them in a category and they're sitting there in that chair and we're sitting there in the same house and and so there no more were they looking back and say look at what he wears and looking about all this stuff and judging him by the outside i wonder where he comes from and then he starts to share and we prejudge them that was washed away friends washed away because they were together they had all things in common and if he has the holy spirit he's just as much a part of god as i'm a part of god i'm not above him because i'm the pastor this young man got baptized last year god is transforming his life i'm no better as a pastor i'm a brother in christ to this man and he has the same inheritance on the other side as i have the same inheritance is this okay with everybody so so life our life is shared our possessions it's strange that this is brought up uh they didn't view people as being rich and poor anymore whether they were or not it's kind of strange because you would think back in that time most of people were poor more likely they were but there were some rich people um different ones they were rich and it speaks here of of uh barnabas probably being a richer man selling some of his lands to go to the needs of the people and so there were some rich but more likely it was a lot of it poor so whether or not they were poor or not possessions must have a way of putting people in categories of better or worse possessions can possess us and i read a quote a couple weeks ago or maybe this last sunday i'm starting to forget from sunday to sunday but you know he said you have a family come into the lord and they're blessed and they're having family prayer together and they're excited they got life and i'm paraphrasing but he goes and they're doing fine and then god gives them a little money god blesses their business and they get this and they get that they get a new car they get a new house they move up he gets a promotion and so all of a sudden if they're not careful now all of a sudden the family prayer goes the life of god goes church goes everything gets to be laid aside and anybody could do it possessions have a way of possessing us maybe that's why they're mentioned in the book of acts whether you have a lot of them or whether you don't have a lot of them when the holy ghost came to these people possessions were not the most important things so much so they said i'm going to let go of this because there's a need over here i'm going to sell this and i'm going to give the money to help this need that's when it's sacrificial giving because sometimes when you're thinking of your retirement you think the book of acts church was thinking of retirement i don't have any hint of it in the book of acts except for this couple who kept back apart and who knows maybe they were saying but if we do this it's going to jeopardize our retirement right so they went and said it was this price it was they lied to the holy ghost it wasn't that they wasn't any problem keeping something back they lied about it they lied about what they were giving better be honest with your tithes and your offerings and what you give and if that's really the amount of your tithes 10 is holy to the lord and only you and god know that you better be honest about it listen i don't need your money i'm not preaching this for myself i don't need your money but god has a principle can you say amen don't be dishonest about it possessions have a way of putting people in categories of better or worse levels of success we live in a world of levels of success and degrees and and and we measure a person based upon degrees or houses or lands or the kind of car they drive or success that they've been we measure people based upon their gifts that they have we measure people upon their better looks that they have and this is not based upon looks or gifts or successes it's all washed away can you say man if this would have been based upon who was rich a lot of you would be out if it was based upon the good looking a lot of you would be out finished if this was based upon and i think i look pretty good but i know in comparison to the world if this kingdom of god was based upon good looks i wouldn't have made it in and i'm glad it wasn't based upon good luck i'm glad it wasn't based upon prestige or how many businesses i get or how successful i make it in life it's not based upon any of that none of it it's do you have the spirit of god within you and if you have the spirit of god guess what you're a millionaire spiritually so they let loose of relation they let loose of all relationships based upon status or position let loose a pride of selfishness they sold things sometimes you have to let go of something that you're holding on to so dearly they sold it maybe that's a good thing the holy ghost made them do that many times they just sold it got rid of it they're tied to something you ever seen somebody just so so obsessed and tied to something some possession that they have they're just that's it that's the ultimate that might be something you need to pray about and look at because you should never be that tied to something for status can you say amen supply someone else's needs sometimes so in conclusion in this part god purged the hearts in the book of acts he purged the hearts of self-focused self-pride true and brought true fellowship and love that could work amongst the people in relationships why because no one was better than the other they all had been promoted by the holy ghost they had all been promoted they had all received the promotion to sons of abraham can i get an amen they had all come to the sons of abraham and thus become spiritual millionaires they were all treated as the royalty of heaven every person should be treated as the royalty of heaven amen this is the son of king son of a king i'm talking to brother brown even brought it into your marriage and he says when you marry that person even when she gets old and have gray hair she said you should treat her right and you should treat her as a daughter of the king because she was a daughter of the king before she married you king well i'm king now well you're not the big king you're not the big king there's a king higher than you and that daughter of the king if she was serving the lord filled with the holy ghost she has someone higher than you and you better respect that daughter of a king and you girl better respect that son of a king that's the way we look at it after the book of acts after redemption we're to redeem to a royal family can you say amen don't buy into all these ideas from hollywood and how we treat one another and calling one another an old bag and all this other stuff take our cues from the word of god we're royalty friends we're royalty can you say amen our children are royalty we should treat one another in our homes like royalty praise the lord amen i'm rich this morning i'm rich in faith and how many is rich this morning you're spiritual billionaires this morning i like how trump says billionaires is bill billions he's got an emphasis on billions he likes to say that word because he's a billionaire billion you're a spiritual billionaire i'm rich in faith and hope and love i've gotten more than my share i've been moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightfully well i'm rich in faith and hope and love i got more than my share i'll be moving to a mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightfully my father owns a cattle on a thousand years i believe i own at least one well i stand amazed to see his grace knowing that i'm his son well i'm rich in faith and hope and love i've gotten more than my shed i'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where i'm a rightfully amen hallelujah [Applause] the rule is if nobody sings a special then i sing one and i just sing it for you look at that acts 2. look what it says they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine continued so this is this is a relationship with god after redemption they continued steadfastly consistently staying around the presence of god consistently staying around this wasn't a once in a cat meeting thing i'll make it to jerusalem once a year for the camp meeting it continued step this is the relationship they have with god it wasn't a one-nighter it wasn't every week at church this is a daily continued steadfast in the word in the apostles doctrine and why were they doing it because they had relations that they were connected with the lord in their souls can you say amen and when you're connected with the lord you're hungry i've got to hear more of the word i want to know more of the word i want to stay in fellowship with the word and i want to be steadfast i want to be consistent i want to continually be doing it today we have no consistency in things people are in and out they're up and down they're in and out of this and that they can't stay committed to something they can't stay committed to jobs many times they can't be consistent and some people can be ever committed to their jobs to be there every morning on time but you're not consistent with the lord in your relationship these people were so changed that they love the lord so much they continued steadfastly in a relationship with the lord doctrine's teachings and then it says they continued in the fellowship too it wasn't just it wasn't just the doctrine it wasn't just staying steadfast they were steadfast in their fellowship praise the lord they were steadfast in goes on to say uh in breaking a bread together the lord's supper and rather just i had a a message here a few months ago and i don't think i'm going to use myself i don't think we we applied it as much as we should that we are one and we should encourage times to be together i don't know what it is people are afraid of people today people have their walls up even to the body of christ sometimes people come from a lot people go through things and i understand that i want to understand it better but but when it comes to the book of acts is that they they encourage brother josiah was saying just make a phone call call and encourage that person invite him over for coffee get the families together they were together they were together i guess it comes back to priorities and people get discouraged sometimes because they go to a church and they don't know people because nobody opens up for fellowship it's not my notes i just i'm just feeling to say this go back and listen to brother josiah's message i think the lord was speaking to this congregation and we enjoy our sundays together but listen now you can't find any better friendships and fellowship to form than amongst the body of christ and i know the devil has told you they don't want it i'm scared of them and the devil's told you they might hurt me or whatever listen you always have the potential from hurt for hurt but listen we're the devil is robbing us of relationships do what you can to open up and reach out amen to your brothers and sisters maybe these testimonies will help when you read their testimony say man i didn't know that they did that i didn't know they had pierced ears and long hair like that i didn't know they were a biker you know i'm sitting next to them and god's changed them to transform them i didn't know he was involved in drugs and i was involved in drugs and you share your testimonies of what god's done in your life you make a connection there maybe the testimonies will help we're too isolated in our own worlds but a book of acts church says lord i'm going to let go of these things and the most important place i can be is around the word and around your people as we get ready for a rapture and we are going to go together that's right why don't we start worshiping like we're already there why don't we start fellowshipping like we're already there why don't we have oneness like we're already there can i get an amen this morning he's so together they had all things come there were signs let's finish it now and fear and so i didn't finish it doctrine and fellowship they continued steadfastly in doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers we're gonna have the lord's supper tonight and fear came upon every soul that was respect and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles can you say praise the lord never eliminate that and all that believed were together and had all things common the system of positions and great ones and little ones was all gone brother brahm says in oneness the disciples even walking with jesus in oneness the disciples even walking with jesus i mean that quote now says the disciples even walking with jesus they didn't have no oneness they didn't have any unity no you have that quote says i wanted them to see that the disciples even walking with jesus they didn't have no oneness they didn't have any unity no they argued here's the disciples around jesus all the time jesus around his ministry around the son of man ministry walking with jesus they didn't have no oneness they didn't have no unity no they argued who's going to be bishop after this man could i preach now how many ministries in this message have risen up and had arguments about who's gonna take over from here so i'm gonna call it what it is you don't have any oneness yet with this lord when you're arguing about who's the greatest preacher fussing and stewing i can i can read you a quote in the token where he says he says he says pentecost fussing and stewing with one another shows the token is not showing man still got fussing going on who's this and now there's a new term they're using the supreme ministry in the message they're using it among themselves the supreme who taught you that there's a supreme ministry in the message who taught you that we're supposed to follow and be childlike like you said to the corinthian children they were children you're carnal he says because i'm of cephas and i'm a paul and they were already dividing over that because the antichrist spirit was making them selfish again to say i'm of this preacher i only go to his cat meetings i'll go if he's preaching if somebody else is preaching i'm not going to go and all these divides and categories it doesn't belong in the message at all and any gift that rises in popularity they should become more humble and we should never lift them up too high we're guilty of it come on now we're guilty of it we see a ministry rise up and oh that's where everybody needs to go we follow after it and and i'm i'm weary of it i'm weary of it in my soul i i don't want a big church i don't want a big ministry i thank the lord for the testimonies but we've been there we've done that we've got the t-shirt and people gravitate towards that and sometimes when you lift a man up you set him up for a fall we don't want to do that may that be washed away in the body of christ and maybe we come humbly before him every gift among us that's of the lord we received it and i got pastors that i know that some of my personal friends got a church of about 12 15 people they'll never be at a convention they'll never preach a convention they're nobodies but they're not nobodies to me and they're not nobodies to god they'll receive the same reward on the other side because they're steadfast they're faithful they're preaching this message and you'll never know their names they're no names but god knows the no names they're in the lamb's book of life got all this struggle and these disciples can you imagine right in front of the lord arguing and he picks up on it what i know what you guys are arguing and then he says things like are you able to drink of the cup that i'm going to drink of well no they weren't ready to do that they were childish and selfish and looking for positions and they they they couldn't even believe jesus they couldn't understand it thou speakest and riddles tell us plainly what you mean there was no unity between jesus and disciples or disciples of jesus and disciples among one another but i want to emphasize this bishop part this this thing that keeps us in circles around our ranks that we keep following after and looking for the next big ministry and the next big thing we need to stop doing that serve the lord be filled with the spirit find out who your pastor is serve him humbly before the lord and leave it at that praise the lord who's going to be the greatest that shows no oneness was showing because when the book of acts came and redemption came all that was washed away how many years are we going to continue to look for the next big ministry disciples were around jesus but no relationship could it be they they come and say but lord in your name have we not cast out devils have we not prophesied have we not done many wonderful works and he says depart from me because why there was no relationship i never knew you in an intimate relationship you were in the message you were around jesus you're around the son of man just like disciples but you never knew me no oneness the baptism of the holy ghost that i'm closing now is more about life and relationship than even the supernatural as i close i want to refer back to brother landlands message wednesday night if you didn't hear it i encourage you about the priesthood about the maturity of the priesthood about the selflessness and the selfless lives of the priesthood see he referred back to the children of israel i thought of that when he preached wednesday night i wrote it in my notes i wrote several notes but did everybody ever think that why they were called the children of israel because they acted like children they only wanted to see the supernatural and if they didn't see it for a few days or a few services they got nervous is god among us or not if they didn't see somebody prophesy if they didn't see this and if they didn't see this happening is this okay we we need to work it out you don't need to work that out and god says in exodus 19 6 if you don't mind pulling the scripture up god says this at the very beginning before anything he says and ye he's speaking to all the children of israel and ye shall be exodus 19 6 ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of the children of israel they may be the children of israel but in the mind of god ye shall be a kingdom of priest something needs to happen to change you for the title from the children of israel to the priest of israel and there's another scripture that says i wish moses said god wishes all of israel we talk about priests and prophets and positions he said i wish all of you were priests unto the lord in the opening of the seals he hath made us kings and priests brother landland was great in showing the maturity that come and i really believe that joshua and caleb had come to that faith and had come to that maturity to take the land that they had to be encouragers to other ones the other 10 spies that were saying we can't do it we can't go there you know this is too much the walls are too great that was immaturity that was saying i want i want to go back to the wilderness where i'm dependent on god and he has to provide my water when i get thirsty and my food when i get hungry and i need to see a miracle and i need this i'll keep serving the lord and if you don't show me a miracle i'm just going to go back to egypt children of israel but a priest does not say that a priest comes to church whether he would see the supernatural not he prays for it but he's going to serve the lord whether he sees it or not a priest in maturity says i got faith to take my land and if i don't get any help i got the lord's help he'll help me fight my battles a priest said two priests chase joshua caleb said we're more than able to take the land and they were helping encourage the children of israel to become priests of israel to not just be a survivor to become an overcomer can you say amen we're not called to be survivors we're called to be overcomers and i loved it because he said they when they go in the promised land it's a battle and he said this is not a picnic and brother bryan said this is not a picnic that you came into this is not an association this is not a membership that sam's wholesale you you smile at me laugh but people make their message church even a membership an affiliation i pay my tithes there and i'm affiliated with the message i have an affiliation with them but this is not an affiliation this is not a membership this is a battle and i loved it when brother landlad said when we recognize who our enemy is which is not one another by the way he says we may he says he when he was watching some soldiers one place he said they were fussing a little bit in the barracks and they might have misunderstandings but when they put their armor on and they stepped into their position as a soldier all those misunderstandings were laid aside because they stood shoulder to shoulder stand up they had a position and they stood shoulder to shoulder because why that's the enemy out there he's not the enemy and we got an enemy to fight and we're going to stand together to fight the enemy can you say man oneness they were together one mind and one accord nobody was acting isolated to themselves they say we're going to stand together we're going to take our land and i'm going to help you take your land too if i can help you in any way ye that are strong bear the infirm the weakness of the hallelujah bring up that quote about i'll close on that last quote that i got rebecca it's the next one i know yeah it's the one just before that it's the one just before that when you're playing a ball game as it's football season oh boy it's football season now i won't say anything but don't make it your god amen all right you know we're very open in this church we've actually allowed ohio state people to come to this church and i feel that's very gracious we led unvaccinated people here it's amazing we have a very open door here when you're playing a ball game as it's football season the thing we want to do is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it he's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal and he said it wednesday night he says it's being a team player can you say amen the holy ghost book of acts church was team players not acting in their own thing they had everything common together they stood in battle together can you say a man laying down your misunderstandings and in a football game we're trying to have the same goal and get to the goal however we get there we'll do everything but you don't take the ball away from the quarterback can you say amen next one but you could could you imagine a team so untrained as to find one man their own man with the ball running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it every man trying to take the ball out of his hand while you're bound to lose and today we have the same thing when we see god come on the scene and going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's say praise god god's blessing that and let's fight the enemies away from him let's use our influences as tackles not runners tackles that protect the runner let's him pack the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running and we should be tackles when you're setting up your fantasy football league in your mind for the body of christ you're going to say lord i'll be a tackle i want to be the quarterback trust me if the quarterback is the pastor you don't want to be the quarterback lord have mercy you don't even what what you're dreaming about you do not want to be the quarterback he's the guy he really gets beat up sometimes when you're making out your fantasy football team when you're making it make it out they say lord let me humbly find my place in the body of christ you had to choose let me choose a tackle let me choose a tight end let me choose the defense because those positions are just important to getting to the goal as any other do you believe that this morning you know we need a deeper love for one another we truly need this book of acts holy ghost working among us to have a capstone divine deeper love talk about the vindication of the bride you can raise your hands and say god fill me with the divine capstone love let me live by it let me function by it let me manifest it let me lay down any differences or anything that doesn't contribute to every believer reaching the goal let me raise you and say i want to be a book of acts church and i want to have the relationships that they had with god and with one another i want that in my heart let's power heads bind us together lord bind us together with cords

gave us his grace amen the lord suffers at four o'clock this afternoon so we'll close the service so you can have enough time to get back god bless you in christian love blessing in my life lord be
