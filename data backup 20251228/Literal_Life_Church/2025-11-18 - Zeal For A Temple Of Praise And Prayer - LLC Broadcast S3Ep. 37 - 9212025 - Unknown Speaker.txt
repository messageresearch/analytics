Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. for. It's not what I wanted. It's not something I understand. My circumstances may be so confusing. I'm placing it all in your head. Your ways are higher than mine. I want mountains to move. You want me to climb. So I'm going to trust your work, your will, and your tongue. Your ways are higher than mine. [Music] One day I'm sure I will look back and marvel at how you knew best all along. you see from heaven. You know it's the hard times that make my face steady and strong. Your ways are higher than mine. I want mountains to move. You want me to climb. So I'm going to trust your work, your will, and your time. [Music] Your ways are higher than mine. When I start to doubt, help me believe somewhere so far above me. Your ways are higher than mine. I want mountains, too. You want me to climb, so I'm going to trust your word, your will, and your tongue. [Music] Ooh, your ways are so much higher than mine. [Music] Your ways are higher than mine. Matthew chap 21 and verse 12. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold, and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves." and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them. So this morning I want to go back into the attention that Jesus gave here to the temple and what was going on in the temple. The focus was in the temple and there were not good things going on in the temple and he was concerned about that. He was burdened. He's actually the Bible said he was zealous and had a zeal for the house of God. And instead of uh besides just uh beating the money changers out and cleaning the house, then he turned around and begin to use the house of God for what it was intended for. And they brought the lame and the the blind. And he began to do those things because I believe that's what the temple of God should be manifesting. The power of God to heal, to change lives. It should be the central location for that and it should not be a place that they they were using it for. So you can see the temple had lost its original purpose. Keep in mind that we'll be speaking about your temple because you're the temple today of the Holy Ghost. Let's read another place in John how he says it and he mentions it in all four gospels this incident where he goes into the temple. But here it's just worded just a little bit different. John 2 verse 12. After this he went down to Capernaum. He and his mother and his brethren and his disciples. And they continued there not many days. And the Jews Passover was at hand. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the money changers money and overthrew the tables. It doesn't look like he's asked acting like the Jesus that we know. This isn't a very gentle Jesus. And it's because he became very concerned and zealous over the house of God when it was being used for purposes that it wasn't supposed to be used for. I would say to you this morning that we should be just as zealous for the house of God as he was when there's something there that's not for the original purpose. &gt;&gt; He became very concerned and said unto them that sold doves, "Take these things hence. Make not my father's house a house of merchandise." And his disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." taken from the book of Psalms and prophecy and David saying this the zeal of thine house. So I'd like you to keep that uh as the disciples could attach the scripture. They couldn't do this in many things but this they could they could attach the Old Testament prophecy of David and attach it to the way Jesus was acting in his passion for the house of God that it be kept clean. Can you say amen? And that it be used for God's purpose. Other place he says, "My father's house shall be called the house of prayer." The temple of the Lord, the temples of the Lord is for purposes not for what they're doing, but for it's for uh it's for exuberant praise to the Lord. That's what the temple's for. It's for prayer. Can you say amen? And and so when we get the temples away from this purpose, then we are, I could say, backsliding from God's original purpose for him to fill you with the Holy Ghost. And so this zeal, this passion is what the disciples see. And I'd like to speak on the zeal for a temple of praise and prayer because we should be just as zealous over our temples and houses of God that it remains a house of praise and a house of prayer. the percentage of the kings of the Old Testament who sought God for a revival and they moved to change the lifestyle that they had become backsliden in. There was kings there was 42 kings that I put in front of you and there was a small percentage eight out of the 42 that actually uh had a call for revival to move to change the lifestyle and the lifestyle that they had developed in the Jews was a lifestyle of the heathen. They had taken on the heathen worship. They had taken on the heathen lifestyle. And these uh few kings, very small percentage of them, uh something rose in their heart to change. But one of the reasons that they wanted to change things and to purge the idols out of everything in the country and in the the tribes that they were over is that the main thing that was affected by this backsliding was the temple was affected. The temple praise was affected. the temple where God came down and brought his glory that was affected and we'll find that in our lives is that when we we we find that we be when we begin to look towards other motives and other things and look into the world too much it's what what gets what for a Christian what gets affected most is our temple because this temple is to be reserved for God it's to be dedicated for God and it's not just our souls but it's our minds it's our spirits it's our it's our emotions it's everything God wants wants to fill this whole temple. But when we get our eyes looking at the heathen ways and what they do and we get a little jealousy or whatever it is there, we start adapting to that. What gets affected? Our temple becomes affected. So that we can't worship freely. We can't pray freely. And even our prayers can be hindered &gt;&gt; because why? Our temple's not right. Our temple's not the way it should be. Even the Bible speaks of a man and how he treats his wife that his prayers could be hindered. The way he treats his wife, the Bible says that if you don't treat her as a an equal with God as co-airs together, she is a weaker vessel, but if you don't treat her right, your prayers can be hindered. None of us want to be in a place where our prayers are hindered. If there's any everything else that falls apart, we want our prayer to stay in the place that God can hear our prayer. And so it affected the temple. And so they would get a revival. The the temple had lost its purpose. It lost its praise. It's lost its freedom. It lost its sacrifice. And it lost its effective prayer. And there was a small percentage that had the zeal in their heart to restore the temple, to clean the temple, to bring back the praise and worship in the temple. I read to you uh about Hezekiah and the different ones, but some of them they said, "Let's bring everything back in. Let's bring the priest back in. Let's bring the sacrifice. Let's bring our atonement. Let's preach our atonement. Let's bring it back. Let's bring the musicians back in. Let's restore. There was only a few that had a zeal to say, "Let's get this temple back to to the place it should be in." &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to all of us this morning that those percentages are small. There's a lot of Christians in the world, but how many Christians have a passion and a zeal for their temples? Praise the Lord. So, let me just uh lay this out to you. The temple became the central point for everything in Israel. You remember that when they got the ark and then they put it in the tabernacle, which is a temporary place. They'd pull up the stakes of the tent of the tabernacle. When the pillar of fire moved, they move with it. And so, whatever the pillar of fire moved, then they put the stakes down. They'd build this temporary tabernacle. And it kept moving. It kept moving all the time. And God would come down in that the the word the ark was in there. Everything was in there. But then then God put it on David's heart to build a permanent temple, a permanent place. And when this happened and when it was dedicated, the glory of the Lord came down. And we realize it became the central I could safely say it became the central place or headquarters for everything, including the rest of the world. hearing about it. The rest of the world got wind of what was taking place in this central place. &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba heard about it and she traveled many, many days to go see what was going on in Jerusalem. And it what was it was what was what was she was intrigued by is this place. What was happening in the temple? What's going on in the temple? God's got a gift there that's working. Uh Solomon was working the gift of discernment. Can you say amen? They had a godly king. It was a revival. It was a millennium when it comes to the children of Israel. And this place, everybody wanted to come and see it around the world and see what was because it was just such a move of God and his glory came down. They heard in the newspapers about his glory filling that temple so much that the minister couldn't even speak. They heard it through the news and they were intrigued by this. But I just want to say it was the central location for everything God was doing. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, where's the headquarters today? Where's the central place that God wants to do most of his work? In you. All of the glory, all of the praise, all of the faith, all the faith to move mountains. It's not to come through just the preachers. It's not to come through just some movement or some special evangelist. Every believer in the kingdom of God is to be the central place for God to work. &gt;&gt; He wants to work in you. &gt;&gt; And that means you can be in a grocery store. You can be at home. Fathers, you can be there with your children. Can you say amen? And you don't have to wait to get to church. You don't have to say, "Well, I'll share that. I'll get my pastor with you." You become the central place to be able to witness to this. I'm telling you, they came from around the world. And in that temple, the ark was there, which means the word was there, the sacrifice was there, the place of unrestricted worship and praise was there. But mostly Solomon said this, when they pray, he prayed to God when he built the temple. says, "My prayer is that when the people pray, when the when the prayers go up from this place and when even they're in another country and they would, this is what Solomon asked, that they look towards this central place that their prayers their prayers would be heard." &gt;&gt; And this was a great desire, Solomon. And God said, "I'll do it. I'll do it." Even if they look out of a whale, Jonah's in the whale and I don't know if he had his GPS on his phone or how he figured out how to point towards the temple, but he did it in the belly of a big fish. He got on his knees amidst all of the whatever he's in and he brought his prayer towards the temple and God delivered him from the fish &gt;&gt; because this became the central place that God said my glory will come down there and if you look to this the prayer the prayer will be answered. That's the most important thing is that our prayer be heard and that we have effective prayer. It doesn't matter when it happens, brothers and sisters, but we know that when we pray, we have confidence and faith in our prayer. Every condemnation is under the blood. Every guilt trip that Satan's putting us on us, we're not living by guilt trip. We have faith and confidence that when we pray, whether it's now or 10 years from now, God has heard our prayer and the answers on his way. Sometimes it takes 21 days of fighting through demons. Can you say amen? Like he did with Daniel. But Daniel kept fasting and praying. And the angel kept fighting through the prince of Persia. And if you keep praying on this side, God is on his way on this side. &gt;&gt; Because he promised that kind of prayer. I'm going to get through to that prayer. Your temple is a temple of the Holy Ghost. You will have the zeal to say, "Now I better watch over that temple. I better keep it clean. I better not let habits get into it. I better not watch the wrong movies. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm going to take it further at the end of the sermon, but I'll mention to you, it's not just bad things of the world that we clean out of our temples and our minds, but it's bitterness. &gt;&gt; It's resentment. &gt;&gt; It's things that get lodged in our spirit against somebody. It's things that come in that are there in a small section of our life that we allow to stay there. And if we really had a zeal for the holy for the Holy Ghost being on us, then we would say, "Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've got a concern for this temple. I've got a zeal for this temple. I can't worry about everybody else." That's what they said about getting the oil. He says, "We have not enough for oursel. Let them go and buy. I can't worry about somebody else's Holy Ghost. I got to make sure I have it." &gt;&gt; You can pray for somebody. You can encourage somebody. But I think sometimes we worry too much about what's going on in other people's lives and we're not focused on our own temple. &gt;&gt; We're not focused on our own thoughts. Why am I feeling this way? Where did this come from? Uh Satan's using he's in my spirit here. Satan's getting a hold of me. And so when we have that type of fervor and zeal for our own temple of the Lord, then we're saying whatever it is that causes me to restrict my praise, to be limited in my praise, to be limited in my freedom, to be limited in my prayer, condemnation limits my prayer. Let's remove the condemnation. Let's get past the guilt that's in our mind, in our spirit. Let's let's leave those things alone. So why? My temple can be free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "Come and lay hands. I trust you. Lay your hands on me." We got confidence when we lay our hands on them. &gt;&gt; Something's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Dwelleth not in temples made with hands. And when you come to the New Testament, he said, "A body thou has prepared me." Then it says, "The Lord will suddenly come to his temple." That's the prophecy I think in Malachi. The Lord will suddenly come to his temple. And they thought, the Jews thought, "Oh, he's going to come to this physical Solomon's temple." No, he'll come to his real temple. And did he ever come to a temple, but he didn't come to a temple of a building? He took all of himself and poured himself into Jesus Christ. The Lord shall suddenly come to his temple. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? God, the fullness of everything that he was, would pour himself into a body &gt;&gt; because that's what his desire was. &gt;&gt; The Lord, &gt;&gt; temples, bodies to be filled. And so when Jesus came, he didn't pour the fullness of himself into a prophet. I said when Jesus came, God did not pour the fullness of himself in a prophet &gt;&gt; or else he would have done it in John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; He poured it into a son, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So he didn't pour the fullness of himself into a prophet. This was not his final emphasis. It was his son. The mystery continues to the end because in the last few chapters of the Bible when the new Jerusalem, it says when the new Jerusalem come down, it come down as a bride adorned for her husband. Who's the new Jerusalem spiritually? You're the new Jerusalem. You're the city of God. &gt;&gt; The bride is the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; When we go to a physical place, yes, but God's emphasis is not the physical place. He said, I go prepare a place for you. That's fine. But what's the final thing? New Jerusalem coming down as a bride adorned for her son for her husband. The final end is and then he says those words at the end. Behold, finally the tabernacle of God. This is the last few scriptures of your Bible. Behold the final goal has been met. Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men. &gt;&gt; That's right. You need to rejoice. Not a prophet, &gt;&gt; not a church, &gt;&gt; it's in men. &gt;&gt; The final resting place is in his people. And that's why why is the final thing in the last two or three scriptures? Who's speaking? Who's saying come if you're thirsty? Who's making the appeal to come? The spirit and the bride. the only ones that will take time to have a zeal to cleanse their temple and give attention to it. And I want to just give attention to saying give attention because sometimes it's not just cleansing your temple of dirty things, but it's always having attention to your temple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing. You can help a lot of other people, but you better not ignore attention to your own temple. What do you mean, brother Paul? your own thoughts, your own spirit, where your heart is. I preach a lot on these things. I'm sorry. That's just my bent. It's that where where is your temple? Where are you at right now? And people ignore it. It's like somebody ignoring their health. We we can't do that. I I I struggle in that area myself. I'll be honest with you. But we cannot ignore our health. You know, they say about teeth. If you ignore your teeth, they'll go away. The dentists tell us that. I made the mistake of walking into a dentist office when I was about 8 years old with a sucker in my mouth. I had those nurses and doctors all over me just attacking me. What are you doing in here with that? And they threw it out. Threw it in the trash. I just didn't think I walked into a dentist's office with a sucker. And doctors to say, you know, hey, you know, you you you you can't ignore things that are important in your own temple. You could be a doctor, a nurse, and a nurse trying to help everybody else and ignore your own temple. &gt;&gt; And you're thinking about this morning. I think there's a lot of Christians in this world that are maybe on the internet and they're constantly thinking about what's going on in the message and what's going on in other people's lives and everybody else's temple while ignoring their own their own read your Bible and pray every day, their own fellowship with the Lord, their own communication with him. They're caught up in what everybody else is doing. But I believe we need to give attention to our own temple. To some of you, that seems selfish. It's not selfish because when this is right, when this vessel is right, that's how we can be most effective to help other people. You can't ignore your temple. You can't ignore your mind. You can't ignore what's inside of you. And so I want to say, hey, you might even have to say, hey, push back a little bit. Say, I'm not able to do all of this. I'm not able to go and take all these invitations &gt;&gt; because attention first is my own temple. &gt;&gt; I'm not able to do what I was able to do to help the whole world because I got to make sure this temple is ready for a rapture. This temple is holy. This temple is free. Yes. &gt;&gt; The ones who cleanse it is the ones who know the potential of it. That it's not just church. I'm not just another human being. I'm not cheap. My vessel is not cheap. I teach this to the young people. Vessels of honor, vessels of dishonor. And you will dishonor your vessel if you don't have a value for yourself. &gt;&gt; You will commit fornication. Many times it's because you do not had a value in the word and in Christ of who you are as a human being. If you knew that value, then you protect it. Then you cleanse it. You keep your mind clear. You don't dabble and feed on all kinds of pornography. Why? Because you value this temple. You give attention to this mind. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And so your temple is a temple of the Holy Ghost. I'm not cheap. I'm not just another human being. If you go do the things of the world, then you value yourself as just another person of the world, just another human. You're not another human being. You're sitting here this morning and a lot of you shouldn't even be here, but you're still here. Even though you've sinned and you've messed up and you've had a hard past life, but guess what? You're still here because there's something in you that still wants God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; There's a reason you're here. You many of you shouldn't. I know your testimonies. There's people sitting here, I wish I could have the testimonies right now. You shouldn't be here. The things that you've been through, the deaths in your family that Satan should have taken you down and you give up on everything, but you didn't give up. You're still here. &gt;&gt; You're still growing. &gt;&gt; You have to begin to value. I must have value as my temple. &gt;&gt; Now, you God's given attention to it. He provides you preachers like this that are in your face. That'll tell you the truth even when I don't even want to do it. That will be honest with you, that'll encourage you, sometimes rebuke you, and I'm putting it in your face all the time. Here I am. And God is giving attention to your vessel. &gt;&gt; But there's something else. You have to give attention to your vessel. &gt;&gt; You have to value and see how much potential you have. say, "Well, I've really messed up." Put it bring it under the blood. &gt;&gt; Bring it under the blood. Come to the altar. &gt;&gt; Ask forgiveness from God. And it's time to move on to your full potential. &gt;&gt; I'm damaged goods. I'm finished. You're not finished. &gt;&gt; You're not finished. &gt;&gt; God still has potential for your life. &gt;&gt; Get a hold of it. Say, "Lord, forgive me of what I've done wrong. Let me never use my temple for that again. But now let it be used for the kingdom of God and for your glory. You must have value in the temple that God's given you in order for you to clean it and give attention to it. Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? It's a question. Don't you know you're the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwellth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. Let no man deceive himself. You know, hello Selfdeception is the worst kind. &gt;&gt; And that's biblical. Let no man deceive himself. Selfdeception is the worst kind. You can be deceived by somebody else. But you can be deceived yourself. &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive himself. For if any man among you seemth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world. I'm not going to continue on. That's the one place he says uh the temple is the Holy Ghost. Then over in chapter 6, real quickly with me, chapter 6, verse 12. All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient. In other words, I'm I'm able to do all things, but the other things are not a benefit to my temple. They're not a benefit to my Christian walk. I'm free to do whatever I want, but my wants have been changed. I don't not go to the bar today because I'm I the word tells me not to. I don't go because I don't have a desire to. It's true. I can do whatever I want, but my wants have been changed. &gt;&gt; And this is the temple of the Holy Ghost. I'm watching over where I go, &gt;&gt; what I do, what I watch, the music I listen to. &gt;&gt; All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient. They're not edifying to my body. &gt;&gt; That's the life of a Christian life. And then if you make a mistake, you see something you shouldn't see, which is very possible in the day we live in. You quickly say, "Lord, forgive me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to defile your temple." &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
