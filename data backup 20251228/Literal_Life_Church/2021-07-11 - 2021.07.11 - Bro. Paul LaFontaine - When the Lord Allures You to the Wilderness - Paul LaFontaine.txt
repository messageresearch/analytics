========================================

place of the wilderness which will speak about what that means but his purpose in alluring her away from all of that is that so he can speak to her god in our lives will allure us away from things and his purpose is to speak close to us and the reason he has to bring us in the wilderness sometimes is because we can't hear his voice we're not in fellowship with him and so he has to allure us away from things so that he could speak comfortably to us aren't you glad he knows how to speak to us how many has ever been spoken to by the lord it's a wonderful thing and he wants to continue that and have that fellowship with you and i'll just add in here verse 19 because we may get to this subject of faithfulness and i will betroth thee unto me forever yea i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness and in mercies i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness so we have righteousness judgment loving kindness mercies but he also draws us into a relationship of faithfulness and that's not only him being faithful to us but it's us being faithful to him heavenly father bless your word today as we just calmly sit at your feet and ask for you to give us those things that we're hungry for this morning we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated god was calling israel as we've been speaking about god was calling israel out of an unfaithful life that they had come to as a whole as it is the children of israel they had been unfaithful to him and in the book of hosea he keeps bringing scenarios of adulteress and a woman to the left he even has hosea marry a woman who would become a and be unfaithful to him as a symbol to israel this is how she was being unfaithful to god so the theme of hosea as we look at it is that theme that a woman a wife israel has has been unfaithful to him and served other gods and other idols and that's being unfaithful to the lord and so then it's not only the whoredom that we see in hosea but it's it's redemption it's it's how god draws her back that he would even draw her back is the mercies of god that he would even give them a chance after their whoredoms it's god's mercy it's god's grace can you say amen and so he didn't have to do that but because of election and because of grace and because god is rich in mercy he must find a way for her to come out of her adulterous spirit and come back to an exclusive relationship with him and if we would be honest with ourselves saints of god we we can we can we we we try to find our way back sometimes and the truth is most the time we can't find our way back god has to lead us back god has to show us the way back aren't you glad this morning when you were away from god he showed you the way back aren't you glad when you're distant from him he shows you the way back he actually is what i want to preach on he allures he allures you back he entices you back he draws you back and it's his grace and his mercy that because sometimes we find ourselves we don't know our way back to relationship with him and people today they get stuck in their habits and and something becomes a part of their life and it so much becomes a part of their life that it actually becomes normal to their life it becomes a normal routine and it begins to distract them from being close to the lord a lot of there are some people who micromanage god in their life they they like to do they micromanage everything else in their life they're controllers and so when god comes in the night they eventually micromanage god and that i need you when i need you and i need you on sundays or maybe not even that it's just whenever i have a emergency in my life but they're micromanaging i want god as much as i want them in my life there are some people like that but there are some who sincerely have got themselves in a habit and away from their fellowship with god and they don't know their way back but i'm here to tell you god can show you the way back and sometimes you don't even know the way back and god has to hold your hand and lead you out and show you the way back to him and in this case he's alluring israel back to him can you say amen hosea is a great study hosea i'm going to suggest to the congregation here that you i would gonna it's not a very long book but i'm gonna suggest this week that you read it if you haven't read it yet um it's it's a wonderful book i want you to read it and i would suggest also listening to invisible union of the bride of christ by brother branham that he spoke because what i'm finding is that what he preached there is actually also in the book of hosea and it links together so wonderfully and i'd like you to how many can maybe take the time this week to listen to that message and also read through the book of isaiah hosea how many would take the time to do that tell you what i'll give you two weeks just to take time with it but i'm encouraging you as a pastor as we've been in this study that's where you'll see some wonderful things take your time and read the book of hosea and listen to that message everything he says in that message invisible union is in the book of hosea and and it's it's a it exposes a spiritual adultery plainly but then redemption is there the threat of redemption is throughout the book of hosea he's going to show her way back and there's going to be invisible union and where when her old husband has been put away and dies and as as he brings out invisible union that's the only way that a woman can come to another marriage properly is if her whole husband is dead can you say amen that's scripture for the woman but especially for the bride of christ all the old affairs have to be gone and dead can you say man for you to have a proper union with jesus christ there cannot be a flirting or an affair with some other idol or some other thing like israel was doing it has to be an exclusive relationship and fellowship with your husband jesus christ amen so i have a lot of things on my heart and a lot of things to preach a lot of different subjects that's been coming out of the word of god but i've been directed of the lord to stay right here in this in this subject for another service because i got the gut feeling that some went home last week after last sunday and maybe went back right to the same life so filled with so many other things and media and maybe movies and music and apps and the gossip and the drama and you went right back to it and you didn't hear what i said that god's trying to draw you away from being so busy and so consumed that there's no time for fellowship with him don't feel offended but i just got that gut feeling i wonder if son didn't catch it and i even said to my my kids and my wife i said what are you going to preach i said i'm just going to preach the same notes from last sunday until we get it i want to move on to a lot of other subjects but listen we got to realize that when we term ourselves the bride of jesus christ it's not a movement it's not that you're a part of this church it speaks of a marriage relationship and in union every day with him it's a fellowship that nobody else is allowed to enjoy can you say amen and if you're not in that relationship if you're not in that fellowship with him then you're not catching what this message was sent for i said you don't know what it is it's not a movement it's not something i'm a part of the message but if you have the term bride then we are the closest people to jesus christ we're not just in a master-servant relationship we are in a relationship with him that's an intimate that we share with no one else and if you're not in fellowship that way with him every day that's why i'm here to preach and to encourage you and watch the holy spirit allure you out of all the things that are busy in life to a relationship with him and i'm determined to do that i'd like to see that i'm so burdened about this subject and i told you last sunday particularly for me i'm taking a self-examination i i'm just it's brought me into a serious thing to see the something greater and a closer relationship in the lives of the people with the lord we may be coming in joy and worship and we may be enjoy the benefits of the word being taught and all these other things that but this thing is about a relationship and i think in one service i i sat all my family down the other night and i said what i said in church a few weeks ago on a scale of one to ten where would you say your relationship with the lord is right now and so i wouldn't do that personally to everybody here unless you wanted to share it but i did it with my family because i said i don't want to know where you're at and i gave where i felt like i was and my children gave where they was my wife and and we just shared and then we went to prayer and i made a commitment to them that now that i know where you feel like you're at right now i'm gonna pray that god will take you closer to him that you're not out of five anymore by by but in the coming weeks that you'll grow closer that you'll be a nine or a ten closer to him and that's why i'm preaching you to to you this morning i have no other agenda it's not about money or position that was gone when i was a young minister i cared about who my name and the message or whatever these things i've grown out of all that i don't care if i get invited to any conventions and i'm not here for your money or anything i'm here because your soul and your relationship with god and if i can't encourage you to realize that this message is not just a movement or something that we say we're a part of but it's a relationship with jesus christ and i don't seek to get you closer to him than i've failed in my office i desire to see you closer to him can you say man i even caught myself monday morning after church i caught myself monday morning grabbing that phone and going right to the same things and clicking the same news buttons that i'd clicked before and i caught myself and said wait a minute boy you better you better live what you're preaching to the people but by habit we we turn because it's so part of our lives we turned everything else first that we're used to turning to and the lord's not number one our fellowship with him is not number one he gets the leftovers and i just feel in my heart if he had time for me if he had time for me throughout history and especially when he went to the cross he had time to go to the cross for me i've got time for him i got myself and i just corrected and i said no no i'm going to lay this aside and if i find out about that later it's not a big deal i want to read the news and the word of god and find out what god's doing i want to stay close to him we're distracted on the average in america about 5.4 hours a day on our phones 5.4 hours of our day on the average goes with a phone time that's about 40 hours a week it's about nine years of our lifespan and it's growing it's growing and the question is what what is it yet your what is it first of all what are you looking at what is it is it beneficial is it fruitful for you anybody listening this morning what is it that you're looking at so much is all of it fruitful is it dragging you down spiritually is it just just a bunch of fluff is it just mindless time that you're feeling to escape from all of your pressures i thought we were supposed to escape to the lord i thought we were supposed to bring our burdens to the lord i thought we were supposed to go in prayer when we had a hard time with our family i didn't think we're supposed to look up some psychology or something to fix family problems we got a god to go to and i thought we were supposed to go to him when we have problems i thought we were supposed to gather the children and go to the word of god and teach them the word and say we've got a mighty god here and we're going to call on him to answer in this problem financial problem sickness problem whatever it is what are we turning to all the time for our answers or for our escape or for our relaxation what are we looking at is it fruitful is it filth that you're looking at is it weakening you is it just mindless uh television on your phone or mindless things that are just a bunch of dirt and trash and dirty jokes and cussing is it that my take a look at your life take a look at the sanctifying grace of the lord jesus christ that needs to sanctify your life but if it's not either that if it's time filling mindless stuff i ask you to examine it because it's hurting your relationship with the lord is it replacing your time with the lord how much time a day is spent walking and talking with our christ most of us if not all this is the this is become way out of balance i raised the question has it replaced in you know remember brother branham was so straight with us about that instrument of the television taking us away from god he said it could have been used for the greatest uh here's where i hang my coat got my mind other things said the television could have been the greatest tool for the gospel to spread the gospel could have been a good instrument it shows that the instrument can be used for the right thing if it was if it was about the instrument we wouldn't be streaming this morning so people could be uh in distances listening this morning it's not about the instrument it's what's on the instrument and he blasted that thing and blasted the unfiltered television and he blasted it so i was asking the question has our and maybe you'd as has phones replace the whole television thing because he was so straight on that but he wouldn't speak against cell phones because we didn't have it back in that day i can speak against cell phones i'm not asking you to get rid of it i'm saying this thing is consuming our life five hours a day that much time in our life and is it going to keep growing and i got a little slide there that watch the transition as we see tv it's true that it has replaced the phones if you guys got that i don't know if you have that slide but tv and mobile devices the average time spent in the us and if you watch this graph 2014 we made the crossover and just look at just two or three years ago that now they're more on their phones than they're on television so i have to preach to you it's everything that we used to get on television now we're getting on our phones and now as satan was using that device now he's using the device that you have sitting in your hand today maybe i need to have a service and not expect any amens out of this but i'm telling you whatever he said about a distraction and the filth that comes across the television we can switch it now to our phones because we've made that transition this is where satan will take your time this is where young people will be exposed to all kinds of filth privately i wish i had never given my kids a phone at their whatever we gave them 13 14. i wish i'd have waited until 18. well it was way too late but they have to be taught the word of god they have to be taught that listen in this world we can't change sodom and gomorrah but we can have principles about us of lord sanctify me sanctify my mind sanctify my heart and if i have this tool oh god help me to keep it sanctified before you i need a closer walk with him you need a closer walk with him and this this this experience with jesus christ i'm trying to be as practical about this this morning as i can this is not a roller coaster this is not a carnival that you've come to it's not a park it's not your christian life is not a carnival where it's a roller coaster ride of up and down the reason i say that is because people are that way they're up and down they're real high and boy they're enjoying the convention and the meetings and shouting and everything and then you don't see them for weeks and they're low and out here doing all kinds of things and that's a roller coaster christian white life or in a carnival we have the twister and that's why i find sometimes with people's mind their minds are just spinning all the time god hasn't called us to to the arcades and all the booths that are set up that are just to actually deceive us and lose all of our money this is not what this is about this is about an everyday walk with the lord it's not a roller coaster it's not a twister can you say a man it's not the candy apples and the attractions that attract us temporarily and make us feel good this is a consistent relationship fellowship faithful to the lord every day he's faithful to us we're faithful to him we stay in fellowship with him and when we make a mistake we quickly bring it to the cross and say god help me never to do that again forgive me may your blood wash me from that this is a walk with the lord and not to let those things linger that distract us the carnival is distractions and candy apples and just to and that's what we live in in this world but sometimes a young person you know even a young person you watch them get close to god and then all of a sudden they get a girlfriend in their life or they get a boyfriend in their life there's nothing not a thing wrong with that but if it's a distraction from the lord it's not the right relationship so many things in this life for adults and young people and children can be distractions from what our walk with the lord maybe luther's day or maybe he wouldn't had to preach a sermon like this but today we got to talk about it we got to talk about phones we got to talk about the busy life we got to talk about the rat race and it's only you can make a decision wait a minute wait a minute the lord wants to be with me here and i make a choice today is he going to have the leftovers or not even get any time today and i sit and i just fellowship and talk with him and stay in the word of god there has to be time in a relationship and i've been preaching it if you didn't do that in a marriage the marriage is going to fall apart there has to be honesty there has to be open communication there has to be fellowship or there's going to be unfaithfulness there has to be more than something just that you're together raising children there has to be a relationship there has to be a oneness there has to be a connection made and when that begins to break that satan loves those breaks in the relationship in a marriage and he's in there to tear it apart even more because he hates oneness but that's when that couple rises and said wait a minute i love you i married you because i loved you something's missing here let's get back together let's let's come back and fellowship and there might have to be honesty and there might have to be all the essential elements that god has given us and if we don't have elements of forgiveness and honest repentance and that we we wouldn't even be able to see marriages restored but we do have the elements of repentance of forgiveness people look to psychology and all this stuff no what happened to the elements if someone repents honestly forgive god forgave you we can't even have a grounds through fellowship to come back unless there's repentance and forgiveness but marriage relationship can't survive without there being a restoration to come back together and fight to get back together with one another it can't happen unless there's a desire on both sides to be able to do that and fight for the oneness i remember singing that song for seth and steph's wedding love is not a fight but it's something worth fighting for love is not a fight but it's something worth fighting for if you had an original love then you fight for it christ had an original predestinated love for you and he had to go to calvary and fight for that love will you fight for your love for the lord will you fight for your fellowship with the lord will you fight to get back in oneness with him love is not a fight but it's something worth fighting for praise the lord i want to point out this morning because of the text of the scripture it will be more than a prayer we pray together with our family and i'm praying for my children that whatever level they feel that they will get closer to the lord but really it'll be more than a prayer and support to get you into more fellowship it's it's you pulling away from things and listening to him allure you back to himself allure means to draw it means to entice having the quality of attracting or inviting enticing or tempting even uses the word tempting and we're familiar with temptation and enticing because we're familiar with the enemy tempting us why does why does he use the same method because we don't just go out usually and just do something we are slowly alert and enticed into doing something and because satan knows how the human being works and you're all human beings he's watched you he knows how the human being ticks and so now he's learned this thing of enticing of alluring every man is drawn away of his own lust second peter said every man is drawn away of his own lust but every man is enticed as he's drawn away he's enticed to temptation but it doesn't happen quickly it happens by alluring and enticing over time and when you're learned by satan and then you fall into temptation then it becomes a habit you learn that's how satan you realize satan got me and it started way back here he alerted me he enticed me it didn't happen overnight can you say amen so we're familiar how the devil works because he knows us as human beings but i want to let you know god works the same way god does the same thing and because satan appeals to the flesh and not the soul satan appeals to the flesh first we gravitate towards fleshly things more easily to be tempted but god does the same alluring by his voice to allure us into the wilderness back to himself he uses the same enticement to allure us to attract us back to him sometimes the voices are so much in our lives we can't hear his voice of allurement but he does it the same way you may not get there overnight you may not get here just in the service today but if i can be a voice and a holy spirit-filled vessel to the lord to speak to me that he's alluring you back into the wilderness alone with him some of you have been distant because of family troubles because of deaths because of financial troubles because someone spoke to you wrong someone's done you wrong some of you got involved in some pretty bad things in your mind and nobody else knows about it but you and god and god knows you're there and his mercy just begins to allure you back draw you away to entice you back the lord uses it his voice is their calling but what's it doing it's it's the first step is to draw us away from everything to draw us away from it all to come away a while read it last sunday in the song of solomon as solomon uses the words come away little one come away beloved one come away little bride the first step is he calls you away we find jesus doing it with his disciples after they he was sent them out two by two and they were very wore out from the ministry they did and in in i believe it's in mark he says and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught so they're telling them of the wonderful meetings you know what jesus said after those wonderful meetings he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat they were very busy doing the work of the lord that he'd called him to do and yet he said at that moment it's time for you to come apart come yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while and they departed into a desert place by ship privately we cannot have a close relationship with the lord if we're not willing to come away from things this isn't turning out a shouting service but we cannot have a close relationship with the lord if we're not willing to come away from things to come apart jesus said come apart come apart so you don't come apart pull away and change how much time we're spending doing other things and that's why this is an alertment to the wilderness now the wilderness it's it's you know we all understand that because we understand that the wilderness represents it's as in other places in the bible it represents different things but for this thing when he allures us out in the wilderness he has to get us away from the city or away from things and all of us know what the wilderness means because that represents something of getting away when i'm going to go up north or i'm going to go to the wilderness it represents i'm going to get away from everything i'm going to get away from my responsibilities i'm going to get away from all the pressures and i'm going to go somewhere in the wilderness you know i've been a city boy my whole life but i have changed so much the last few years especially but you know when i married a wife that was from the smoky mountains i didn't know there was mountains that pretty and i love those mountains and i've seen a lot of the mountains around the world i love those the most the smoky mountains and but i was a city boy and she knew that and she still married me i was a city boy from toledo she left all those beautiful mountains for me because she loved me and she loved you as a congregation and she left it all to the con missionary work in the concrete jungles of toledo sister bess you grew up in it too she's one of the mission projects that come out of toledo that's why we're here yeah so i was a city boy but you know what i've grown to love because it represents getting away from everything now god didn't call us to get away and go up there like the whole rest of the world and get a place up north and drink beer the whole weekend how twisted have they become he calls us a way to get along with god to fellowship with him undistracted that's what the wilderness means and i was a city boy and i fell in love with those mountains i have a statement on my uh a wall one of the men said uh from new york he was a congressman i believe and he fell in love with the smoky mountains and he made this statement he every once in a while in his office in new york and he would say the mountains are calling and i must go and i have that in my office because every once in a while when it gets to be too much i say the mountains are calling and i must go what is that calling something get me away from everything get me undistracted get away so i can just hear god's voice and enjoy those streams those thousands of miles or hundreds of miles of streams coming down that mountain the smoky mountains now i'm discovering some beautiful places up here in michigan and i don't have to go so far sometimes but beautiful places that we can get away what does it represent to us it represents pulling away and when he says i want to allure you into the wilderness he wants to come and fellowship with you now don't think that the lord is calling you to take every weekend and take off now to the wilderness i'm preaching a spiritual wilderness we know what it means physically to get away and sometimes if you go away you don't get any rest because you got five grandchildren to take care of sometimes you go and you don't give yourself permission to relax and you can go to the greatest vacations in the world some people do and spend all the money but because they don't have fellowship with god and because it's all about money they don't get satisfaction when they're in the wilderness anyway it's about getting away but i'm talking to you spiritually what it means in your spiritual life that he allures you away and pulls you to a spiritual wilderness just with him which means you're pulled away from everything anybody understand what i'm saying and so we he's not talking about you taking off every weekend to up north michigan or traverse city he's talking about while you're in your life now he's alluring you away from things for a few hours away in a wilderness with your bible or with whatever and just fellowship and and communicate with him that you can be refreshed in his presence thank god we don't have to spend a lot of money to go again in his presence somewhere else up north but we can be in his presence right now that's why i'm happy finally for all these years to have a sanctuary and a place only set aside for people to come and worship and talk with the lord a lot of times we had to use the building for different things because we didn't have a facility thank god we can set this building completely aside for one purpose for us to hear from god and us to speak back to him and you can walk through those doors and it's one place in life you can shut everything else out now of course i still people see people on their phones while i'm preaching what a shame you can't even get rid of that thing while the lord is speaking but this building is you can shut all of that out and come in here and release it all and just worship and fellowship with god you say well i'm going to have my problems when i go home i know but at least you can communicate with him and it's a closer to be able to handle those problems you have to have time with the lord for him to correct you for him to encourage you for him to tell you give you direction people get scrambled in their minds what am i going to do what am i going to do have you talked about god i remember one time a minister rebuked me i was all nervous going into a meeting i was lost couldn't find the place i couldn't find the motel i was going to be late for the service and you know my family can tell you i can get that way just oh this is not happening as quick as it should happen and that guy looked me in the face and he says well i was just so frustrated i said i don't know about this i don't know where the motel is i don't know what he just looked and he says well settle down let's have a word of prayer and well let's let god figure it out here just said it real softly and you even get mad at that sometimes but it's a wake-up call you're way off track here you're way too caught up thing in things that don't matter most of the time what's going to happen is going to happen you're way too angry at stupid stuff am i preaching to anybody here this morning you're way too consumed with this problem what even if it's financial or whatever somebody said something an uncle said something against you or somebody in another church gossiped and you're way too consumed with it if you're losing sleep over it i'm preaching to you a place in the wilderness that that stuff you don't worry about that's between them and god what's most important is i fellowship with him and i can be confident and settled in my place in christ no matter what the world says about me no matter what pressures that i feel there's a place in the wilderness that we need to get to and stay there with him and it's a place away from the distractions and the noise where he can speak to you where it's in this case with israel is to pull them away from all their other lovers to get away from the city life sodom and gomorrah the busy life the filthiness of saturn gomorrah that we live in got a message come up coming up about it friends we're at another stage the gay choir in san francisco writes a song that is titled we're going after your children every day something in the news pops up and you know what the lord showed me this week you cannot change sodom and gomorrah i can preach it here you can say amen but you're not going to change lot tried to change sodom and gomorrah but you're not going to change that the answer is to be with abraham was up in the mountain interceding for the souls that are coming under judgment arrested settled and praying god save no you don't go down and try and change sodom can you say man it's knocking at our door but where is the position of abraham god save some souls god deliver them before judgment hits the only thing we can do and we have the power to be able to go to prayer for that distractions notice the nature of god for his prophets he drew them out in the wilderness how may remember that moses he actually could give them his word he couldn't give his word to moses or paul or the prophet of this day until he got them out of the city and away from all the voices and denominational voices moses wrote five books of the old testament and god called him on the back side of the desert to do it paul wrote writing the new testament he had to be pulled away from all his teaching and all of associates three and a half years on the arabian desert he had to be called away in the wilderness in order to get away from all the other voices to write the word of god our prophet under prophecy he couldn't just stay there in jeffersonville he was called to the desert away from everything to bring the word of god for this day notice the pattern god has to get you away for him to give you something it's in the bible god has to pull you away our prophet did the same thing john said that he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness did you ever think about that john said he was the voice of one crying in where the wilderness that meant that he was the one lone voice he was out there by himself it means no one else was speaking things that john the baptist was speaking nobody else was saying it that way as a matter of fact those who wanted to hear john's message they had to go out and find him he wasn't in jerusalem he wasn't around all the churches he wasn't around all the denominations can you say mine he wasn't around all that he says i'm the voice that's in the wilderness and in order to follow this voice you have to come out in the wilderness to me one lone voice in the wilderness he's saying things that nobody else is saying he's baptizing that nobody else is baptizing and they had to come out even if they were pharisees they had to come out to the wilderness with john away from all their stuff john was not amongst all the churches john the baptist was a voice in the wilderness this is the nature of god through the bible he said we want to find him we find him in the wilderness and i'm not talking about up north michigan i'm talking about spiritually you have to come away from things to hear the voice of god you have to pull away so i can't change some things there's some things we can't change but i happen to believe there's some things you can change you may not want to tell how much your boss makes you work you can't control that but that phone that you own and you pay 80 bucks a month for you can control that i can't control it i got to see what's going on i got it you know three in the morning four in the morning you're grabbing that phone you're checking everything it's controlling you and you own that you're paying 80 bucks a month for something that's controlling you you're obsessed with you're borderline addicted to that thing and it's taking you away from the voice of god how much time do you spend in the tapes how much time do you spend in the bible five hours a day on the average on your phone as a national average and i say is anybody spend five hours or even close with the lord in your life this past week excuse me for being so i'm preaching to myself like i'm preaching to you but if we're spending five hours on that phone a day how much time are we spending with the lord i'd say it's nowhere near five hours you forgive me for being so straightforward with you but i want to tell it like it is that we all need to come to a desert spiritually to hear his voice and that means coming away we have to make decisions to pull away from things some people got something scheduled every night of the week they don't schedule church in but they got everything else scheduled you can't make it to church because they're just a little bit tired can't make it the wednesday night because it's just a half hour away and that's just too long and i can't quite make it but it's amazing how you can be everywhere else how do we know because we see the pictures of you at kmart and walmart kmart's pretty old walmart and kroger and over at this guy's house and this woman's house and with the family in this birthday party and that and you've been going all week but wednesday you're too tired and some sundays you're too tired there's nothing left of your energy and if you were sick then you should have been home sick for all the other events you didn't miss any of your doctor appointments so why'd you miss church come on i got some of your number i know i do you wouldn't dare miss that doctor's appointment but don't you have an appointment with dr jesus here who set the appointment the pastor did we have church wednesday nights we have church on sundays it's an appointment put it on your schedule dr jesus wants to meet with you and guess what he may heal you by his stripes he already has held you by stripes you may talk call the doctor the next morning and say i don't need to come in i already seen another doctor last night go ahead that's right that's right yes [Applause] praise the lord feeble feeble excuses for missing being in the presence of god feeble and you can go do every other thing and work and every other appointment consumed with it i'm just staying right here a minute just consumed with projects and life and planning the next thing don't talk to me about projects i got unlimited projects all the time i got my wife's and mine on the list you get consumed with it my problem is that's not the problem as much as what gets pushed to the very bottom of the priority list and i'm talking to you some of you done it for two or three or four years now every feather possession and real estate project every new business venture has become the most important thing and you can schedule everything but you can't get a hold of your time to say lord i'm not going to go do that today i'm just going to spend time with you i got about an hour here i got two hours you know what i'm changing the plans today i'm not going to go do that lord i want to let you know i'm just going to talk to you a while this is so if this is in your life as a consistency god bless you god bless you but i know for the most part americans where they're at right now it's not a normal thing praise the lord you still love me thank you so the voice of the lord is a lone voice it can't be compared with anything else and you will have to come away from all former ideas all denominational ideas to hear the voice of the lord in the last days i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness you would have to come away from all the other religious voices to hear the voice of the lord because he's set apart and if god can allure you away from all the idols and get you to himself that he can really speak to you and the bible says in hosea i'm trying to allure you to the wilderness so i can speak to you comfortable things i'll tell you that's exactly what he'd do he's not bringing you out to rebuke you or tell you you're nothing you've crossed the line he's wanting to get fellowship with you and intimacy and closeness with you that he could speak he said comfortable words to you now i'm i'm in i'm in for hearing some comfort are you in he said when i draw you away i want to speak some comfortable words to you i we we americans should be all in for comfortable words because we get blasted by everybody else we got people gossiping against us we got bitter resentment in this world we got people angry we got betrayal jesus said in those days that many will betray one another we can't trust anybody that's the world we live in we're not getting any comfortable words from anybody but god says when i get you alone in the wilderness i'm prepared to speak some comfort to you i'm prepared to speak some comfortable words to you i'm prepared to speak rest to your soul but if you won't get alone with me you can't hear my comfortable words if you've got tons of voices going through you and you've got tons of busyness going through you that you can't even hear what i want to say to you he's got to get you in a wilderness spiritually can you say amen and there there are people that are walking close to god but there and they were close to him years ago but they're not willing to give up things that have filled their lives to get back closer to him so this wife had become unfaithful i just want to speak amended on unfaithfulness and faithfulness we know and we sing about and we preach and we are aware of god's faithfulness to us how many are thankful for god's faithfulness we sing and we speak of his faithfulness great is thy faithfulness he's faithful to us he is there always for us it means he's always there for us his love never ends for us it's not an up and down relationship with the lord he's consistent with us can you say amen he if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive our sins instantly why because he wants the fellowship back and even when he couldn't give the blood of the true lamb jesus christ back in the beginning when adam and eve were hiding in the and putting fig leaf religion over their private parts a fig leaf like a fig leaf religion trying to have their religion as a covering you know so when man fell in sin instead of looking to god he covered himself with his own religion and god comes over and says adam where are you he's looking for adam he's seeking them out adam wasn't seeking god eve wasn't seeking god you weren't seeking god he seeks you and they're in the bushes naked trying to cover themselves with some religion and he says where are you and he says i'm back here and this is what happened and he starts explaining they're all scared they're under condemnation and god draws them out and says come out here take off those fig leaves and he grabbed some animal skins and that an animal died with blood because it's always the way back is through the blood i said the way only way back is through the blood not religion grabs those animals strips and throws those animal skins on him what was god doing he was trying to find even though he didn't have the blood of the lamb yet he was trying to find a place so they can fellowship again and with their sin he couldn't fellowship with him so he has even a temporary throw this on you and the blood of that that goat or lamb that blood of that lamb being killed for you will give you a place for fellowship god is always trying to get back in to fellowship with you god is always trying to draw you away from some of your social media and your private things you're looking at your phone he's trying to draw you away from it even this morning because why he wants fellowship with you he wants time with you put away lesser things don't make lesser things as important they're not quite as important let me tell you something relationships i preached at tuesday at brother gary's funeral brother gary i appreciate i asked the church to come out some of you were here i appreciate you coming out it was a wonderful memorial brother ken the song i just want to say thank you to all who put such a wonderful memorial and i have a testimony of the family that came there was a healing that took place tuesday night between gary's family and our church they never knew us uh we never knew them but there was such a healing and they said we've been so healed because we didn't know the church that gary was a part of was like this if we'd have known we would have come around but but they just said it was such a wonderful time and you all said some wonderful things and and i thank the lord i thank the lord that we were able to do that but i was saying to the people what is value what is value value is your own soul and the souls of others and when we arrange a life that soul your soul and the souls of others are down on the bottom of the list we have lost the value of life making more money is not the value of life it's nice but it's not the ultimate value of life what shall a prophet of man if he gained the whole world and lose his soul this church is about souls we rarely have a financial report like that because i don't like to talk about money we got to pay for this place and it belongs to all of you we've got to pay for it but this church is not about money god will sustain us and take care of things this church is about your soul and the souls of others preaching the word and the blood of jesus christ and the message of christ for the last days why for your soul that you can be in fellowship with him i said value what is it its value is is about your soul and the souls of others and nothing else counts and brother branham's saying that i had an old model t ford or some type of ford and such a nice car i shined it up and i every day i was out there shining it you know 20 some years later says where's that ford today he said somebody put me a new cadillac in my in my garage it's over there at the house he says such a nice thing i never had that something that nice i take care of it but he says you know just another few years there'll be nothing to it it'll be gone so you ask yourself what is value what is value souls your soul where's your soul at where's it in fellowship well i got saved 30 years ago i was at the altar and my soul saved and sounds like a baptist i'm saved always saved i've talked to a baptist he's smoking a cigarette i was saved 20 years ago and god doesn't mind at all i smoke this cigarette there's something beyond just salvation there's a real changing of the desires of the soul that you no longer desire the things of the world and even with that your soul can be saved but you're not filled with the spirit every day a lot of christians are just cold formal starchy christians there's no life to them there's no joy to them there's no revival in their hearts that's the condition of the soul and i'll tell you when you really get baptized with the holy spirit and you stay in fellowship with him your soul is in a revival every day you may wake up monday morning and you don't feel saved but you know you're saved and i'm ready to go against the devil today there's a fervor there's a there's a revival in your heart when you come to church you want to stand up and sing like the song leader says let's stand and sing to the top of our voices there's a revival going on there's a spiritual life going on and nobody's pushed it nobody's pushed you to get up and worship to god it's already happening i'm in fellowship with him so i don't mind getting up with the song leader says let's raise our hands let's sing to the top of our voices some of them are some of you are like a bump in the log you can't get anything to move you it's because of where you are spiritually you're coming to church but there's no revival and fellowship in here it's a mechanical thing i'm here i scheduled church in but it's not a revival in the soul i'm talking about a condition of the soul you may not shout like the rest of them but something will move you and sometimes you're just moved to tears in the presence of god god i'm so glad to be here can i just tell you how much i love you today this week lord you blessed me so much i'm just so glad to be away from it all just to tell you how much i love you today god would you just come and speak through the minister today and give me those things that i have need of be personal with me today brother paul doesn't know who i am and what i'm going through but you know who i am and you can speak the direct word for me today because i'm in fellowship with you i love you so much lord i love you doesn't seem like enough but i just want to tell you how much i love you talking about fellowship and having a faithful spirit i can tell you now i'm gonna be able to finish this you love the lord this morning yes i'm going to have to close now it's quarter to one excuse me i'm just we just end on this faithfulness i know my lord is faithful to me there's no question that but i want to be faithful to him and this woman of israel had an unfaithful spirit and if i can just show you you may have a wife in this world that's unfaithful to you and she's sleeping around or you may have a husband who's dabbling in pornography or sleeping around that means he's unfaithful to the marriage bowel but there are marriages where they never physically been with someone else but they have an unfaithful spirit guiding them they have thoughts of unfaithfulness now we all have thoughts but i'm talking about they carry through with those thoughts and it leads them under things because they've taken on an adulterous spirit so unfaithfulness is not just physically having relations with someone else besides your wife or husband it has a spiritual it's an unfaithful spirit and that's what i've been feeling lord jesus lord jesus i may not go out here and join at the bar at some party or something like that i know better than to do that but lord i want my spirit to be faithful to you because only god knows right you don't know that i want my spirit to be that he's faithful that god has said he's faithful to me he's a faithful partner to me because i know he's faithful to me but i want to be faithful to him in your spirit you can have unfaithfulness and god in his grace alert her back out of her unfaithful life away from her lovers uh away away from what she was uh doing and you remember now eve eve eve in the garden was deceived into unfaithfulness eve was deceived by the serpent to an unfaithful life so every person is deceived in unfaithfulness you don't even sometimes do it will for the yourself you're slowly deceived into unfaithfulness you're alert into unfaithfulness so if you can be alert into that you can be alert back to a faithful life in a faithful walk with the lord and in my private world because remember character what's character character is who you are when nobody else is around character shows up and it's there when no one else is around that they trust you characters when you are when no one else is around so in your private i'm not preaching to what you do here at church today and what you look like and dresses and long hair and all that i'm preaching about your spirit you men with your hair just right and all these other and somebody even wore ties god bless you thank you but i'm not preaching to what you're wearing today i'm preaching where are you in your private world and is your spirit faithful to this christ that you claim are you offering to him an unfaithful relationship privately or is it your desire to say if i'm there lord will be back into faithfulness with you let me be a faithful partner there's a scripture at the end and let me let me end on this one revelation 17 14. and this is at the big war at the end when ten kings gather together with the antichrist who's become incarnate in the book of revelations the antichrist becomes incarnate of man i can tell you who he is but i'll just let you come and ask me about that but it'll be the antichrist spirit that's here now will become incarnated man it will be of a religious nature and ten kings will join together in a great war against the lamb it's going to happen you guys have that scripture but here's hear who is with christ the lamb here's who's with him do you have that revelations what was it again revelation 17 verse 14 can i get that revelation 17 14 these shall make war the ten kings and the antichrist more with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the lord of lords and king of kings amen it's not over and they that are with him are called are chosen and they're faithful i can read you a lot of scriptures about his faithfulness but at the end this is the people that's with the lamb christ if you notice the first two titles you didn't earn he gave you those titles you were called how many has been called how many has been chosen that's why i said about a bride that's been chosen out of the all the other women we feel so grateful that he's chosen us we want to live for him we want to be his wife can you say amen but it's can i have that scripture again called and chosen but the last title must be how we've lived right now that we i tell you friends it'll be by his grace but i want that title i want that title that's what the bride will be called someday called chosen and she's faithful to me she doesn't have an unfaithful spirit may this spill over into our marriages can i get an amen because we got a devil that fights marriages as well so bad they have an unfaithful spirit may it spill over our marriages but i'm wanting it to come into your spiritual life lord let me be faithful to you and when no one can see i have this life that i live musicians can come i have this life that i live if no one else seen the inside of the inside he can look at me and say he's faithful to me he doesn't flirt he doesn't dabble a bunch of stuff that's dirty he doesn't talk against me he wants fellowship with me and he's willing to pull away from other things you don't think the the love of the lord's going to just swell up when he say hears you say yeah you know what i've got to work today and tonight i'm not going to be able to do that tonight can we schedule it for next week or another time because i've decided i'm just going to be home tonight i'm just going to read my bible and pray a while and on the other line they go what you idiot you're not coming they make you make you feel guilty for not coming i just feel to do that i'm going to give tonight to the lord and i don't do it to be pious or anything but i just want some time with them i'm cancelling that their heart may not swell but i tell you christ's heart swells because you just made a decision that your fellowship is more important than anything falling in love with jesus fallen in love with jesus oh falling in love with jesus is the best thing i've ever young people children adults this is this is a relationship this is a love relationship with the lord falling in love let's stand together [Music] jesus oh in love with jesus [Music] is the best thing i've ever done [Music] in his love i [Music]

special prayer for the sick he's in the room this morning i know it's a quieter sunday and just pondering things and i appreciate you doing that i appreciate you taking what i say and praying about it and pondering you maybe it's been a bit corrective this morning but i appreciate you taking it before the lord how many just raise your hand and say i feel the alluring i feel my lord alluring me into the wilderness alone and i want to respond how are you responding to his voice of alert to entice you back into a close relationship with you i pray that we'd come back and just shut everything else shut in with god in that secret place the thing is friends is sometimes i can tell when people aren't as close to the lord my family can tell when i'm is not as close to the lord my family can tell but i can tell when some of you are you know what the most part of it is you're under fear you're living in fear fear of what your children might do fear of controlling their destiny fear of what they might get hurt fear you might lose your job fear this and so you're you're you're losing sleep at night because you're fearful what's the next thing coming but i can only tell you in this wilderness when he's speaking comfortable words all the fear goes away can i get an agreement i believe the fear is washed away and you can live in confidence so i'm going to pray this morning and after i want brother brandon to come who's been suffering with last week this terrible high blood pressure medicines can't help it but we're asking dr jesus to help it this morning and i want you to raise your hand again pray for me brother paul that i'll be drawn into that wilderness to him it's more important our fellowship with him than even physical healing this morning it's more important that we're close to him every teenager every child can come in a relationship every young man every young woman every no matter how old you are you can come into that fellowship today heavenly father pray with me if you would everyone pray heavenly father we give our souls and our spirits to you this morning learning from you that your voice would never try to speak amidst all of our busyness but you would be speaking from the wilderness to draw us away from all that lord we learn that you love us so much your mercies are new every morning god you've got to pull us away from our busy life and the conglomeration of all the things that's distracting us lord that's because you just want to have fellowship and in there we find peace and in there we find our fear has been released in there we find we move out of our depression in there we move out of our fear of the future lord we just trust in you as you speak comfortable words to us we love you lord we thank you bless these hearts lord that are reaching out today saying change me father may this week be different may i make the decisions lord that puts you number one the message you sent in the last days is to bring us back into relationship with jesus christ untainted not painted by denominational creeds not tainted by men's ideas not tainted by all kinds of agendas just a pure eden back to eden again no guilt no shame washed in the blood of the lamb bring us to it father bring us all closer to you someone's at a number five this morning i pray you'll bring them up to a number 10. i pray if they feel like they're at
