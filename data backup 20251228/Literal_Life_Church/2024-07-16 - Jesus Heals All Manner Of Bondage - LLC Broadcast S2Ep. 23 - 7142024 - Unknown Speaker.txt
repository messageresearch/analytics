room together hand in everywhere I go every time I call when I need you most you here and answer all and I am well aware you are always there everywhere way Matthew chapter 4 verse 23 Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people so it's not just the teaching that Jesus gives us us but he heals all manner of disease and sickness and notice it's all manner he covers all of it can you say amen and his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with many diseases diverse diseases and torments and those which were possessed with Devils how many believe that we still have people today that are tormented we still have people today that are depressed and under oppression probably even more so than it what it was in the days of Jesus and so if we still have that going on then we still need the same Christ to come in our midst to not only preach to us but to minister freedom to those that are bound and so those who were possessed with Devils those that were lunatic and those that had py and he healed them and there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee and from the other cities here Jerusalem de Judea and Beyond Jordan but I want you to remember that statement again entitled this this morning Jesus heals all manner of bondage the word says that Jesus is able to heal all manner of sickness all manner of torment and all manner of bondage you remember we've been speaking of freedom and this glorious Freedom that the children of God have in the truth because Jesus said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free this glorious freedom in truth can bring deliverance from all forms of bondage and I read a quote if they want to put it up in communion last week I read this quote and I thought thought it was so powerful in brother bram's prayer when I see the these blood grapes uh the blood of grapes in this communion service I know it represents the blood that came forth from the Lord Jesus body it's not his blood but it represents his blood May every who receives this have eternal life May sickness depart out of their bodies May weariness and feebleness oppression May the devil in every form leave them may the devil in every form leave these people how many believe that the blood of Jesus Christ is powerful enough to cause the devil to run in every form that he comes in the blood is more powerful than any disease the blood is more powerful than any form of Satan and we know that and he finishes it by saying that they might have great strength and health and so he's praying that the people that are oppressed the people that feel feeble the people that feel weary and they've got sickness in their body and even oppression he's praying that they would have great strength and health and eternal life to let their light shine before this wicked and adulterous generation we live in and to glorify God what a prayer and it's my prayer this morning that this people and any people we can minister to would go from oppression and weariness to strength to health to eternal life so that you can be your very best to let your light shine before men what a prayer can you say amen and that's just how how much I believe a human being can be set free that you can God never intended you to live in darkness and in the mully grubs your whole life and living under depression God never intended for you to live that way but to let your light shine before man and to be living free in the Lord Jesus Christ and in his word and so he sets free from every devil in every form a human being can when they when they believe can not only have power to become the sons of God how many know the Bible says that when you receive him they receive power to become Sons and Daughters of God it didn't say that we necessarily had to go through 10 years of Seminary to get to become a son when you receive receive the word you receive a power to become Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah but not only have a power to become sons of God but to move into a life of overcoming the devil's bondage in your life in any form and sometimes even Christians there's years before they're set free of the bondage that they have some nights it's just one moment he takes a habit away and they never go back to that cigarette again they never go back to that alcohol again sometimes God can deliver that way but then as I speak of other forms of bondage you stay with the Lord he'll deliver you even more he'll make you more free of other things that you didn't realize you had there so one of the things that we were saying Saints is physical bondage is most recognizable uh that's the most recognizable type of bondage when someone's under the bondage of a certain sickness or a posy we can see it in their body so it's more recognizable it's a bondage that we can see when someone is in prison we know they're in bondage that's a physical form that we can say that's bondage but it's the other forms of bondage that are not talked about too much and Satan hides them and Satan hides them in people's lives and some people don't even know they're Bound by something until God reveals it Jesus said to the Pharisees religious men you're bound and they got defens of said we're Abraham's children we're not bound by anything and yet the eyes of the Lord said you're bound by your Traditions you're bound by your religion so those Pharisees were Bound by something and didn't really know they weren't free yet but he said he who the sun sets free is free indeed you come in contact with this light of this hour it's going to set you free just going back to some foundational things that we talked about but but you see then people say sometimes and I'm just going to go into a few more of these and I won't be lengthy today the Lord willing I I'll be short but please be listening because I want to go into a few more of these things that are bondage that don't necessarily look like bondage and you may have some of them even you so you need to be listening because we don't want to be in under any form of bondage we want to be free and people say sometimes they have freedom from something while really they're in bondage to something else I got free freedom from this but they're in bondage to something else they're blind to it and then you have people say I'm free to do whatever I want how many's ever heard that before how many heard it from their teenager this week how many of you said it when you were a teenager can't wait for the day that I'm free to do whatever I want and later you learn no that's not really Freedom am my freedoms in this country I have freedoms as an American can you say Amen but they have misinterpreted freedoms that they can sin they can murder they can kill they can change change absolutes can you say amen and they have the freedom to do whatever they want no that's not Freedom that's not true Freedom I'm free to do what I want but that may be in itself bondage too the world's freedom is highly sellable in other words you can sell the world's freedom very easy Moy that looks like Freedom that looks like I'll be free but all the time it Woos us into some so-called freedom and it can only bring bondage to our life and there's no freedom in this world there's no freedom in a marriage of this world there's no freedom in in in uh there's no freedom in in in what the world has to offer there's no freedom in the all the entertainments of the world it only ultimately brings bondage so if we have witnesses of that this morning then we need to realize stop falling young person stop falling for the lure or for the the world wooing you and selling it that it's Freedom stop following don't be gullible some of your closest brothers and sisters even your parents can identify I've been there done that got the t-shirt and I can tell you there's only freedom in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so one writer said when we use our Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh we stick our head through the Yoke of bondage all over again can you read it again yes thank you for asking when we use our Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh and to live in the flesh we stick our head through the Yoke of bondage all over again because freedom is not just letting the flesh do whatever it wants to do freedom is not letting our minds think whatever it wants to think at any time we got to bring these Minds subject to God you see you say I'm free to I'm a freeth thinker ever heard of that before I'm a free thinker I let my kids be a free thinker I don't force them into anything no no no you got it all wrong I let them no if it's a free thinker there's a lot of freeth thinkers in prison today because they had no Holy Ghost to bring that mind under the right thing and so they free thinking is what got them into trouble and so we find then that's one thing is to use our Liberty for the flesh and go into bondage again another one and and I'm reading some of these that I have researched and looked at another one is freedom from discipline is a form of bondage freedom from discipline is a is a complete freedom from discipline becomes bondage and I can give examples of that number three there is such a thing in in this world with people as an intellectual bondage intellectual or mental bondage results from ignorance of spiritual things they choose to be ignorant of spiritual things the Bible the word of God they choose to be ignorant and thus that makes them intellectually bound to receive truth Jesus said the truth will set you free so they're Bound by a certain mindset that will not receive truth and spiritual truth just in their ignorance they have intellectual bondage when people do not understand the purpose of life or their ultimate potential they are in bondage to ignorance and cannot be saved amen it's just stinking thinking stinking thinking gets in the way of the freedom of Christ they're stuck in a concrete mindset this is the way I've thought about it this is the way I've always thought about it and their intellectual bondage keeps them from freedom in Christ I only think about it this way sometimes they've been burnt in life and when they're burnt in life they say I will never do that I will never do this I'm going to think this way I'm I'm never letting go of this in my mind don't say that I Will Never Never Say Never Never Say Never because God will take you down certain paths to challenge you in that I'll never do this I'll never do Never Say Never God will take you and test you don't be stuck and stinking thinking don't be stuck it'll keep you away from more truth and receiving more truth another one people get in is Financial bondage finances the bondage how many know that being under debt is slavery it's bondage the scripture speaks of that Financial bondage often occurs when there's selfishness when there's greed when there's materialism that takes over their life and so they went after greed or materialism or selfishness or they had to have this they had to have that they went in debt for it instead of paying cash for it and when they went in debt sometimes for years they're under the bondage of debt and it's not just that they have this uh debt that they owe but they live under a cloud it can BR it can make you bound up in your spirit sometimes I'm trying to preach to people and they're having such trouble with their finances and they're nervous and they're scared and I understand they don't know what's going to happen next in this world the economy May crash and so they come and so they can't enjoy a service like this because they're bound up worrying about their money now is that right does money bring happiness no money brings fun but it doesn't bring happiness and so people get under the bondage of debt and the bondage of things and you know what uh when I get to the end of this today I hope I have time to talk about certain types of bondage that we have carry with us I wasn't going to let this out but I'm going to let it out right now because it really stirred me up last night there are certain forms a bondage that we don't have a choice in this world it's a pressure to us but I'm still going to keep pre preaching that we can have freedom in Jesus Christ even though we have Financial pressure sometimes because there's been a lot of other believers that's lived through a lot of different economies and a lot of different pressures back in Babylon Shadrach Meshach and abingo and Daniel they lived under pressure as young people that nobody's ever experienced until this day it was ter terrible pressure they were indoctrinated with all the doctrines of Babylon they had to learn it all even though they knew Jehovah God and they studied the books of Jeremiah and the prophet they had to be it was in it was it was forced into them they had to do it and so now when you have that it's the system that causes us to have to take this stuff but there's a still a freedom in Jesus Christ that I don't have to take that mindset into my heart or my soul can you say amen and I don't have to even if I'm in some debt and trying my best to get out I don't have to let that Rob me from enjoying the presence of the Lord and the freedom he's given me I'm not going to let the devil beat me up over it I'm just going to stand up like a Son of God and say God I got myself into this mess and I've I've prayed this prayer I don't want to tell the details it's gory details 10 rental properties they all went under the economy all the housing market went down I had 10 rental properties I'm telling the details ain't I maybe it'll help relieve me or something made some terrible mistakes and it wasn't just me and all my renters a lot of them worked at Jeep and the Jeep plant went down for a while so they couldn't pay rent and you know it's it's I tell you it's it's a a pressure and I had to bring that prayer to God and say Lord you didn't do any of this I did this it's kind of like Abraham having ishmail and he brought a prayer and he brought the baby and he said oh that ishmail could be the one and live before you and God said no I didn't do that you did that with your wife you create the ishmail in your life how many has got some ishmail in your life just five of us all right well we can dismiss the rest of you and have an altar call just for us I guess I said how many has ishmail in your life decisions you made you didn't pray enough about it you got yourself in a mess and It produced an ishmail Sarah said Abraham why don't you to take maybe God meant to take Hagar and it was not God's will it wasn't the promised son God gave him blessings anyway God got him out of that and that's what I pray Lord I said I this is Lord this is my ishmail and I don't expect you to do anything but I just said humbly I said I did it you didn't do it somehow show me wisdom how to give out of get out of this took me about five years and God showed me bang bang bang he showed me how to get out I didn't deserve that cuz it was my ishmail but by the grace of God I'm out of all of it today you're in debt you're in things that seems impossible you go to your God even if you don't feel worthy say God I did this but Lord show me the way out and he'll get you out why because he's for your freedom somebody say praise the Lord he's for you being free he doesn't want you under that bondage so there's things that we get into so there's Financial bondage and then there's emotional bondage which I had wish I had more time for because that's when somebody is just all locked up in their emotions with either bitterness or fear or past abuse or some trauma that they've been through they're emotionally all locked up and can't be free to worship and to just serve God uh in in in Joy they can't find the Joy maybe they come from a past legalistic teaching or atmosphere and they're emotionally bound up they can't fully be the full potential of who they should be as a daughter of God cuz they stand and they or they sit and they're restrained because they got all that baggage of emotional from the past hanging right there I want to tell you my brother and sister God doesn't want you to stay that way as a human being there's a place to bring that and release it and give it back to him can you say Amen that you can be more free than what you're sitting here this morning there's a place to bring it it's emotional bondage locked up with bitterness or fear past abuse I can help you as a pastor if you come and talk we'll we'll pray together I can help you through that you're not the first person that's had that is everybody with me this morning I can help your family I can help you that's why God's put me here it'll mostly be preaching these type of things and preaching the word to you that'll bring Deliverance to you but if you've got confidence in me I can show you some things and help you out of it by the grace of God all I'm saying is that whether it's me or whatever it is don't live that way your whole life don't live under that bondage don't be locked up with your spirit bound and your pretending and acting and smiling but it's not a real smile somebody give me an amen this morning how many pretend Smiles do we have in the Church of God sometimes your smile and your joy does not have to be put on and fake to everybody else it can be from the depths of your heart I'm happy this morning to be a believer in Jesus Christ and my spirit has been freed up nobody controls me nobody's going to try to control me no I've given it to God I've been abused but I've given it back to God I've had a hard life I had a daddy that didn't love me I had a mom that didn't love me right I had dysfunction in the family I come from since a dysfunctional family and they live years and all this happened I was abused by an uncle and all that that's fine I have a care for that but don't stay there there there's a future and if you live in the past you can't get to your future you got to forget those things it's under the blood forgive them so you can go forward and be free in your spirit dysfunctional family guess what all of you come from a dysfunctional family Adam and Eve oh you don't know what it is brother you had a perfect family come talk to me we don't have a perfect family my children aren't perfect and I'm not perfect we we have the same battle as everyone every week but the truth is every one of us the very best of us those who have Halos over their head this morning you come from a dysfunctional family you come from a dysfunctional birth that's right and some have more baggage than other but you were born wrong before you took drugs before you committed adultery before you did wrong before you stole sold Twinkies from the twinkie truck some boys in in the neighborhood those boys were bad and I got influenced by him and one day we were out in the woods and we were just going and said that truck comes by there every day and goes behind that shopping center we lived in an apartment building in Lima and they come around that shopping center and every day they said did you notice it comes the same time it's big old Twinkie truck and so they said we he's going inside we can go over there and get a whole big stash and put it out here in the woods in our Fort now if I didn't have a weakness like I have for Hostess it wouldn't have been a Temptation be but Ryan because Twinkies were involved it was a huge Temptation we went and did it the next day we went and did it and I you know I was scared half to death but the Twinkies kept me going we brought a whole box and boxes of Twinkies back in those woods and we spent a few days and then it got reported in the neighborhood Mom I don't know if you remember but then I felt so condemned I confessed to my mom and dad I confessed to everybody but you know we all have baggage you know and no it's not my worst sin back then it was pretty bad but you know what we all come from a dysfunctional family we all are born wrong we're all born losers and the quicker all of you remember that the quicker you can come to a Saving Grace of Jesus Christ it's not about you it's about his grace and he can take ashes and make Beauty out of them and so we're all have the same we have a lot of emotional baggage and then addictions we have today more than any other age one writer says there's much that promises Freedom that in actuality brings bondage he's talking about addictions there's much that that promises Freedom that actually brings bondage it merely transfers it into a different form rather than conquers the dependency at its core in all of its forms addiction is ultimately bondage to yourself your flesh your Cravings addiction is a form of slavery in which millions are bound and you're bound by a lack of faith in yourself and who you are in Christ and so you're bound by rejection when you're rejected maybe you were rejected earlier in your life and so you have rejection things going on and so when maybe a brother or sister doesn't look at you right that rejection comes up again you feel rejected and you're bound by the lack of faith in yourself and who you are and you you you crumble you you crash and you're bound by the lack of faith in yourself your complexes are greater than the grace of God you've never been accepted right you want to be accepted by everybody when you know and you've got such complexes you think people are talking about you more than what they really are like the guy who says I spent the first 30 years of my life uh worried about what people were speaking about me and saying about me and then the next 30 years of my life I spent not really caring what people were saying about me and then when that was over I realized nobody was really talking about me or thinking about me so it was a waste of time God God wants us to overcome our complexes our fears our rejections daddy rejected you mommy rejected you Daddy never accepted you mommy never accepted you the family never had accept you you were the black sheep of the family and God's washed You by his blood and the black sheep becomes the white sheep so stop buying into that rejection that someone called you the black sheep you are no longer the black sheep you're the a sheep of God can you say Amen the future is different now and you have to look at what God has made you and what he is making you instead of the past thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website lital life. church
