========================================

i'm going to go back and finish in nehemiah tonight we'll be all wrapped up in this section of scripture so if you would read with me the text we read last wednesday and uh this would be blessed families part 11. and we'll finish up this uh segment of scriptures here and then we'll just see where the lord leads after this i i want to have a few of the ministers here some wednesday nights and get them back on board and to share what theirs are they're on their hearts they you know they're studying the word and seeing things and sending me quotes and different things and they just get on fire of god some things that god's placed on their hearts so we want to give room for all the gifts to be able to be used whatever they are and there's not just one gift here but there's many gifts in the body and we want to encourage those and see them grow in the lord all your gifts everyone should have a part nehemiah chapter 4 is where we were reading nehemiah chapter 4 and starting at verse 7. you love the lord tonight but it came to pass that when samut and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the astadites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped that they were very roth and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it nevertheless nehemiah says nevertheless we made our prayer unto god and set a watch against them day and night because of them and so notice now what he's saying that we heard that they were going to intimidate us we heard that they were going to come against us they didn't know how they were going to come against them but he says we we set a watch we set a guard day and night because of them because of their intimidation we're ready for them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall and our adversary said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease that was the agenda to stop the work of the lord and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places when she shall return unto us they will be upon you talk about intimidation and they said it ten times intimidating things they're gonna be coming they're gonna be coming they'll be upon you and therefore set eye in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows and i looked rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brother and your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses notice zerubbabel inspiring the people encouraging the people what to fight for fight for your sons fight for your daughters fight for your houses fight for your families can you say amen amen it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to naught that we returned all of us to the wall every everyone unto his work and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both their spears the shields and the bows and the hammer what is that word somebody help me out habergeons i guess it is and i really don't know what that is that's got to be some type of weapon of some kind i would imagine if it's with the shields and bows and spears somebody look that up and get back to me if you would and the rulers were behind all the house of judah they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that loaded look at this now every one every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon it's a good balance right for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so build it and he that sounded the trumpet was by me and this goes on and on and on i hope you read through nehemiah had the chance to because it's very inspiring to see what the lord did there let's let's just have a small word of prayer lord jesus we ask you again to bless the word tonight bless those prayer requests that we brought before you some of them urgent lord we pray you'll be mindful of them bless brother paul coffey tonight who's sick has been sick yesterday and just healing now but just continue to make him well so that he can enjoy his trip here and we pray you'll bless the word bless the families lord we pray that we as we come tonight you'll be able to pierce through any walls of darkness that we have put up or if satan has brought in our lives and the lord that we could walk in the joy of the lord and we commit that to you and our lives to you just now as we sit at your feet in jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated tonight god bless you the last time we spoke we were talking about the meeting of building the wall together and for some reason uh nehemiah we don't know all the reasons but he set the people on this wall of jerusalem he set them on there according to their families we don't know all the reasons but i thought it was significant to realize that somehow this leader under the inspiration of god was wanting to bring the families together let them be able to do something together as a family this was the vision of the lord for that day this is what god was trying to accomplish for the day that they lived in and they caught the inspiration of it but somehow nima i said if you've caught what we need to do let's do it together as families maybe there was a greater protection with that or something with that i know that god's all for families i know that i know that god is for the families being in unity i know that god is for churches to be in unity uh whether we look like it all the time or not god has that uh god has that in his mind can you say amen the bible says in ephesians till we all come into the unity of the faith so i know god has in his mind and i know he has it in mind for families to be one for fathers and mothers and children and the families to be able to be as one so it does come from the mind of god for nehemiah to say if we're going to work on this wall let's set it according to the families and let the families work on the wall together let them do that i think i think that's a great encouragement to the families and not only encouragement but a challenge to you to ask yourself the question what what is our family goal what is a let me just ask it this way because brother ram asks this of all of us he says if if you know god put you here on earth then somewhere along the line you've got to go say to the one who put you here god what do you have me on earth to do what am i here for if you haven't asked that as an individual then then you're not even acknowledging the one who brought you here who brought you here you didn't bring yourself here you know it's not your own life god breathed life into you god brought you on the face of the earth your creator did and so somewhere along the line we got to acknowledge that god sent us here and so we say as he worded it he said you know lord what did you give me on earth to do what did you put me here to do show me he says it's like being out on a job and you took a job and you go out there in the field and but you don't know what your duties are you don't know what you're supposed to do and you sit around he says we don't want to do that you'd go to your boss and say now i've been hired here but what what is it you want me to do what's my duties and in every age god has this vision god has something he's trying to do something he's trying to achieve and in every age we should ask yourself and in this manner every family should ask themselves god what do you want our family to accomplish for the kingdom of god and friends i don't want to put anybody in a box in that that i have heard so many testimonies and stories of how god uniquely uses families to accomplish something for his kingdom uh our family sings and and that's our a lot of our contribution to the work of the lord and we it's just by yielding to the gifts but i don't want that to be emphasized there are so many things and every family needs a family identity what is it you know we all have things we enjoy to do together whatever it is but what is your family identity is that what can we do as a family or what can we not so much do but what is our contribution what is our part what is our gift what is our little slot there that that and when we get on the other side i want to know that i made a contribution to god's work being continued amen there might be some family and they got a multi-million dollar business and and so now they're able to build churches around the world they're able to go sometimes and if they got a construction company send a crew and build those churches actually and there's families in the message that do that families and denominations that do that and so that's their family they're able to be uh have millions of dollars and and so you're saying man i wish that was mine i'd like to be the i'd like to be the contributor a million dollars but you see you can't you you got to go and ask god what is my contribution here what is my part because i've seen people do even more without any dollars can you say man a lot of things in this slide say it takes money well it does take money um but some things if you yield to the lord he'll provide what's needed amen can i get an amen he'll provide what's needed because he's the provider he's jehovah jireh and he's got something for you to do he will provide a way the spanish translation project is an example of something that's been in my heart for about almost 20 years to see launch and see done and sped up and uh god has his timing and his season too you can push all you want to but until it's god's season and here the last couple years bang things begin to open up and listen you don't have to worry about the money you have to worry about the money if god's in something the money will be there but all the gifts and the families all the things what is it and and so i may not be able to convince a 70 year old man of this but i've got young guys sitting here and someday someday they're going to have a family someday they're going to have little kids coming up and and some of you got that little children i would love for you to have a desire in your heart to put before the lord god i don't know what our family vision is but i want to ask my i want to teach my children that we're on earth to accomplish something for the kingdom of god amen not only to live this gospel not just to do that but lord what is it that you can do through us and that's good to get that in our hearts now these young girls to get it in their hearts now to live an unselfish life to love a life living for others that if i go to be an engineer if i go to be a farmer or if i go to be this i'm going to be a housewife whatever it is whatever calling god has for you no matter what it is god can use it for his kingdom praise the lord to that for sure we believe it but you got to find your place or you'd be bouncing around your whole life you got to find your place what am i here to do find that place but family's doing i think that's a wonderful thing when families can do it a family identity some goal that you're wanting to achieve together have a family vision and so the word in in this hour is building a people into himself and that's why we can type this thing of of this wall being built of protection around the temple of god the whole temple the all that speaks of the temples of the holy ghost that god is building in the last days a bride that he's building a word bride that he's building in the last days and the building or we should say the rebuilding of it is happening now the word is building a people unto himself the word right now i don't you can look at all the negative all you want to get your eyes off the negative pastor get your eyes off the negative saints of god get your eyes off the negative all along while the negatives going on god has spoken his word and you know what he's doing he's building a people for himself he's building temples can you say a man he's building the people of character he's building that statue of a perfect man in us and he's building a bride unto himself and so and a lot of it is rebuilding or restoration because he had a people as brother doug was saying he had a people at pentecost they would have been ready for the rapture right there that would have been it and he explained to us the reasons why that there was more seed of god to come and so now because there has more to come that was the time for the rapture but they had the faith right there in the early church but it wasn't time yet so now uh there has to be a purging or a captivity time just like when the children went into captivity in babylon to purge off all the the bad seed so that all the true seed could come forth and here these people right are right here coming out of babylon making the trip with zoroable making the trip with ezra making the trip now with nehemiah to come back for the purpose of restoration restoring they had the temple one day but now we're under a ministry of restoration amen all the scriptures many of the scriptures in the end times speak of a ministry of restoration starting with the prophet ending with his people coming into that restoration ministry being rebuilt themselves and so i'd like to say this that uh part of working on what god is doing in this our part of working is being teachable to learn god's ways for everything that's you know that's that's part of rebuilding because if men would have come in that did not know god's principles they would have rebuilt that place their own modern way the worldly way the wisdom of the world can you say amen so so now being 70 years away from it maybe not remembering all about it they had to read books they had to they had to go to the prophets they had to learn of the teachers what is god's way to build something now we're that way because you know what happens for generation after generation especially the television generation it so messes with our minds that we only know the world's way on something we only know the world's way of the approach to christianity he wasn't born you wasn't born back in the in the middle ages or early ages or even in the time of luther when the restoration started he wasn't born that then but you were born here at the at the uh the last century or or of the 20th century i should say and during the 20th century is satan's almost his worst work to destroy the minds of men through television to destroy marriages to destroy manhood to destroy womanhood to bring in homosexuality to destroy families can you say amen to destroy and through all that destroy the true vision of christianity and what it means to be a christian to where today we can sit in churches and that church by the way people are acting by the way they're dressing by the way they're involved in the things of the world it doesn't resemble the it's really watered down the name christian hasn't it so what did we need we needed a prophet we needed a restoration and so under a restoration it begins to god and his grace begins to reteach us now listen if you're not teachable you're not going to be re-taught you have to have a spirit of humility i'm i'm ready for god to challenge every former thinking that i had i'm ready for god to re-teach me i'm sitting at his feet lord teach me what it is to rebuild the temple of the holy ghost amen what it means to be a christian what a spirit-filled christian is re-teach me what that is and so now part of working is being teachable to learn god's ways on everything to rebuild things his way to rebuild things god's way internet opinions are probably the last place in the world to find god's way to build a family to build a christian life and this is the information age it's a lot of information a lot of it sounds good but we can be well whether we realize or not we're being taught by that so we got to have a guard up to who we're taught by because we only want to build this thing according to god's blueprint the way god wants it bill that's right i want to be the christian that god said that i would be and what god's looking for in this hour and so internet opinions is the last place to look the modern family is the furthest model to look at even television shows called the modern family uh with perversion in it one of them is a homosexual couple one of one of those this one of that three families there in the whole scenario of that television show called the modern family and it's a mockery to what the true family is but people feed on that and now a sudden the true family is dished out and this is what they have as a vision of a modern family this is what a family is and so if you you get filled with that god has to purge those things out of your mind and you start to look in your bible what a real family is amen i'll tell you that i'm telling you that does not happen overnight the holy ghost comes in your life uh i believe in a in a change of your nature but growing into god's principles does not happen overnight that's why we got to have a lot of grace for one another because every once in a while some of those old uh ways and those old soap operas spill over into your life and you got drama going on in the church you got drama going on in the families whenever we see that happen it's just like okay something's spilling over here and we're going that's not how things are supposed to work it's a spirit-filled people and so you have grace and you say lord it's spilled over in me before somebody's ever had something spill how much i ever had something and it just you know before you you hear it and it spills out of here before you process it through the brain or through the heart for that matter praise the lord i feel at home here tonight not everybody raises my hand but anyway you know it comes in here and things just spill out and it's all sudden you realize even after you say it man if you're in your bible you're feeding on the word you can't justify that because that is a carnal human being acting like a gentile carnal human being not as a christian so it's a growth it's a growth it's purging out old ideas of what a christian should be what a husband should be what a wife should be television teaches 99 point whatever percent that is teaches wrong images of almost everything can i get a witness of that yes yeah brother brandt says if it could have been used for the kingdom of god would have been the greatest tool for the world and thankfully there's some channels there that are used to preach the gospel that's wonderful i praise god for that but for the most part it's all the wrong images it's all idols and images that we begin to bow to you say well i didn't i don't get down in front of the tv and bow to it but what you're bound to is the the principles it's teaching you because when you buy into them your life bows to that because it starts to incorporate it all right yeah that's how you bow to that idol it's an image placed in front of you and so you eventually buy into the image and you bow to it in your this is what i want uh an example of that would be uh you see somebody what they wear there or something so yes a young girl she's watched enough and that becomes her image so in her heart she begins to bow to that and worship it that's what i want to be you see so and it may not be the right image a lot of times it's not and it and it's taking you from the image of what a true young girl should be so television teaches wrong images i don't have to spend a lot of time on that because you know that been there done that you know those things you should know these things but god uses stones to build with in this stones and i really believe the stones is the word of god or the revelation he gives us at the end time and we take these his own stones and begin to begin to build rebuild with his stones his revelations his principles not the worlds but but those in those days nehemiah gave them the stones that they were to use to rebuild this temple god has given us the principles and stones through the message of the hour to rebuild families to rebuild lives to rebuild christians that we have spiritual christians i'm thankful for the message of the hour because it's given us the revelations we need to rebuild gave us the foundation gave us the stones to build the walls and so we begin rebuilding the stones that god sent us and i want to say this that's the word the radical things that the prophet brought be careful you don't criticize them because even the radical things the prophet brought that are now being dished off as brother brahma's opinions and everything's be careful and just say be careful because the the things that appear so radical that he's saying uh are brought to be the rebuilding stones that god sent us to rebuild us into a people of god amen and it's quite possible some of them will why are they radical because we're a hundred years now past anything being decent in this world the prophet starts speaking and he becomes a radical right come on you know how to dress all the other what's proper in church order all these other things now it's become radical because why is it radical not because god made us radical because we live in a world that makes that look radical it looks radical some of it looks radical to most of christianity be careful you don't dump the baby out with the bath water be careful you don't just dismiss it as being that was brother brown's opinion you dump it out his opinion i have found that sometimes those things that seem so strange to the world are the rebuilding stones amen that i can build my life on so give it a chance feed on the message yourself don't take people's opinion from somewhere else and what it is you find out what it is you read it yourself everybody in this building can read everybody in this building can listen to can you say man don't find out from some other some other person or some other source you go and find out you find it and you know what if you're prayerful and humble i believe god will show you that god in his grace sent the stepping stones and the building stones to rebuild a people for the lord yes that's right and then when that happens all of a sudden is what happened with me as i got into it then brother branham as a man begin to fade out of the picture to where i couldn't even already see him anymore that's right yeah amen that's why i can't get my mind wrapped around somebody saying that we're lifting up a man because when i begin to study it and caught the christ in it the band william branham just faded off i will love him i'll embrace him someday when i get the other side i will thank him for his service but as i fed on the word christ became prominent in his principles and i don't see the man when i feed him the message i don't see the man anymore i see what god gave me for this hour no disrespect to him but i'm telling you that's what happened to me that's what happened with this message i don't i i i that that if that thing that that makes him something that and i and even being accused of lifting him above it no god put him in that position but but when i feed on it it's now it's like brother brown says you have one of those pictures and you're in the mall or whatever it is and you look and it's all messed up and it's all just a bunch of colors and everything else but you got to stand there and keep looking at it and you keep looking at it because there's something in there somebody's ever done that in the mall how many's done it for hours before you caught it i'm usually there for quite a long time so you're looking you're looking and everybody else catches it within seconds and i'm still there i don't see it you know there's this there's a beautiful picture in there and you keep looking and looking sometimes when you strain too hard you still see it so you don't need to get all nervous i gotta see this even with the message right just pray just keep looking at it be humble and this is the way brother says this he says once you see christ the message then the rest is filler amen that's why he said it about his own message once you see christ the rest is filler amen that's right and that's what i've seen that's my testimony and so now before we disregard things we should realize some of this is the rebuilding stones to rebuild a people now let's talk about them having to stand there as families or sit there however they did it around this wall holding on to their swords their spears their weapons last week we talked about them building what that meant so now i want to get to but while they're building he had him set his families and they got their swords there near them they're holding their swords they got their in fact the next few scriptures says he had some men there that were building with one hand and had their sword in the other hand i love it i love it and so why why though that they had the swords because there was a hindering force around them all the time that had an agenda to discourage them to scare them to intimidate them uh let me go further to there was a a there was a an influence there that was right close that was meant to hinder the work that they were trying to do to discourage true believers of uh to follow the instructions and you remember friends and i hate to keep getting on it but you remember that this the instructions they had to go back and rebuild and the whole restoration thing was a prophet's word under jeremiah that says that after 70 years i will deliver you out of captivity and i will take you back and restore the temple and you'll build it again that was the prophet's word that they do this they're walking in the vision of a prophet's word and the instructions of a prophet's word so now this wasn't their own agenda there was no own thing to do they weren't going to do it just to make themselves popular they're under a prophet's word when they do this so when they went back and done it there was those there to discourage the true believers who were wanting to follow the instructions of the prophet's word of restoration i said that they were there those there to discourage is everybody got their ears on amen if you believe me as a pastor believe me now that there are influences to discourage true believers when they want to follow the instructions of a prophet's word of restoration amen amen it's not them it's the spirit in the last days not the people but but but we have here uh tobiah and sanbolt being used of the enemy to discourage the true people of god true believers that want to follow the instructions of a prophet's word that's all scriptural jeremiah jeremiah he had the word of restoration that would be restored and under zerubbabel nehemiah and ezra they come back under that work of restoration and so now they we're not wanting to argue but the prophet spoke of this restoration coming and so now they caught that vision and says we're going to go do it zerubbabel ezra nehemiah we're going to go do this nehemiah wanting to build the wall and they said you know what if nobody else is interested in this we're interested in it we want to do it if no one else lives this we want to live it by his grace if no one else cares and says it's not important anymore but well that's fine but it's important to me we want to live this thing by his grace we want to build this thing and and and we want to and if we have to stand alone we'll stand alone but we have caught the vision of this day can i get an amen come on now there was some there that caught the vision of the day and said listen some may want may not want this but we want it we want to live it by his grace we want to do it because we believe this is what god wants to do at the evening time we have to stand alone we'll stand alone willing to stand alone praise the lord because it's not our word it wasn't their word it was jeremiah's prophecy one day that says after 70 years you'll be restored the temple will be rebuilt again the people will come back together again they'll go back into jerusalem against the prophet's word and so now there wasn't anything that could stop it if it's a true prophet's word right if he spoke something in his own name or his own assumption which men can do that's true he's reading deuteronomy 13 deuteronomy 18 you find the two places where he talks about testimony testing of a prophet testing of a whether he says what's right or not if that man points you should point you to other idols and he says he's a prophet of the lord we know that we can't follow him because he's pointing us to the wrong thing he points to himself if he points to other gods that's deuteronomy 13. okay that's how we know deuteronomy 18 says if one comes and he's pointing to other gods we know it's wrong but then if one comes in my name he's not pointing the people at other gods okay but the people ask but how do we know that what he's saying is what you said and not his own assumption it's a good question and god answers they weren't asking how do we know whether he was a prophet or not because a prophet can come in his name using his name and sometimes preach say something in their own assumption but he says how do i know that what he speaks to you so now i'm asking whether he's a true prophet or not he's asking is is how do we know whether this came from you what he says he says if it comes to pass it was from me if it doesn't come to pass then it wasn't for me amen and so these people knew this come from a true prophet of the lord they had already seen signs that god was in it all because uh nehemiah gets all discouraged at his job when he hears about the walls torn down his employee said this last week his employer the king there says what's the matter with you gideon you're always happy and singing and you know i got my mind made up and you're just for 10 years you've been working for me you've been happy every day a great employee today you're discouraged and distraught and you're sat in your face and finally uh nehemiah says all right i'll tell you i just heard my people went down the temple's been rebuilt but the walls that are of protection are torn down and they're just laying in waste and his heart was so grieved over that and so so the king has grace and says you know what take a bunch of people i'll send stuff with you whatever you need go on a mission and go get that wall rebuilt now that was a confirmation that the prophet's word was true that there's going to be a work of restoration a full restoration not a half do a job it's probably why nehemiah was upset because it's not fully restored yet even if the temple is restored the walls of protection weren't up that's right god confirmed that now he's going to finish his work of restoration and tell you i'll tell you brothers and sisters tonight you know this and i believe you can say amen to it god is not going to send a prophet in this age and we all just kind of go off into oblivion and just leaves us all hanging god is going to finish the work in his bride despite what we see despite the divisions god's going to do it because he said he was going to do it amen he's going to have a bride without spot rico and blemish there's going to be unity of faith and there's going to be a rapture because you said it no because i said it no because it's something well we believe it it's going to have no because god said it amen god said it and he spoke it through the mouth of a prophet acts chapter three it's mentioned about three times he spoke things through the mouth of a prophet and so if that's god's word coming through his mouth it's a seed and when the people believe it and it's planted in their hearts by by a vision coming in their hearts they begin to live out the vision for the hour i said they begin to live out the vision for the hour are you living out the vision for the hour are you living some self selfish life i want to live the vision for the hour whatever was spoken i wanted to be see it lived in my life can you raise your hand brothers and sisters i want to see it lived out in my life i'm not on this earth to to do my own thing not even just to enjoy a few entertainments and retire on the beaches of florida somewhere i'm here to first fulfill his purpose god put that in our hearts i mean he put it deeper in my heart and may he put it in your heart so samuel it and tobiah we found out were the influences that were opposed to the rebuilding of jerusalem now why why do you think that is when you look at their names you can't really detect anything wrong with these fellas because samolet means strength tobiah means jehovah is good but the problem was is their origin not their names their names were nice they were nice nice people the problem was was the origins sam bullet came from the moabite moabites children of moabites and tobacco from the ammonites with the children of ammon and if you read your bible you will see that the origin was not good because that's the two sons of incest that lots daughters after his wife turned to a pillar of salt the two daughters had incest and were with their father when he was drunk got him drunk terrible thing and two sons were one of one was ammon and one was uh moab and now they become the children of moab and children of ammon and became a hardship and a bad influence for israel all the way through right under balaam was those children trying to influence them to come come on over and worship with us we're the same we're all this we're all we're all the same balaam's doctrine children the moabites were involved in that and so now you notice how closely linked they are because they have a distant they're a distant relative of abraham they're tied in they're not just out right out here you know just no they're connected by relation to our father abraham that's right but look how it came first of all you have lot which is a nephew of abraham and he made a choice one day with his wife abraham says there's tension in the camp you choose one way and respectfully i'll choose to go the other way let's shake hands and let's do it and and it was that's how it happened and then the bible says lot pitched his tent towards sodom he didn't move to sodom right away we don't know how many years it was but he pitched his tent towards sodom you can tell the direction he's headed yeah that's right amen and so that was a very respectful thing later on abraham out of his love went and delivered a lot when he was in captivity he was still reaching out on his hand and even after that lot stayed in sodom so but notice now when he leaves sodom and it's destroyed lotus this inceptious thing that took place that produced fruit and produced these two boys that became a a problem for israel all the way through of influencing them trying to be the same coming against them threatening them and here's these two boys tobiah and sambalet that come from those tribes doing the very same thing against the true work of the lord amen against the message of the day you say why why were they against it they were probably nice men they had nice names their names meant something nice but their origin began to come out of them that that spirit is always jealous and always against the word for the age and that's who tobiah and samuel it were and i read to you last week i won't read them again because i'm taking up my time here tonight but i read you all the places if you want to read it again uh nehemiah two two places in chapter two uh two places in chapter four and then one place in chapter six one place that says it mocked them one place that says they were wroth with them one place that says it laughed them to scorn when they learned they were going to build on this wall everything they could do and the last thing in chapter six they did they they hired a prophet to prophesy against them right so now you've got all these attributes and their whole agenda we've we we want to stop this work we don't like we we don't it doesn't even say why they don't like it they were just mad they were just jealous they just they just you know they're not going to ever see this happen why do you have to do this and trust me friends these men were worshipers of god they weren't worldly they were worshippers so basically what they were saying is that we're already worshiping god why do we need the temple rebuilt why do we need this message we're already worshipping god come on why did we even need it to come it's not essential to salvation and i've taught you it's not essential for salvation the message is not essential for salvation but it's essential for the last days to bring a bride to perfection else it wouldn't have been in the bible to come and they're saying where worship what do we need a temple for what do we need walls built for this is stupid and they laughed them to score but there was the people who caught a vision saying this is what god said to do amen so my family here you can call us you can laugh us all at us all you want to but we're building on something that god said to you amen and we're right there you're a little two-year-old boy hey get you what's the name of your son there really rolling this right rolling hey rowan you know grab something grab some mortar you know rowan grab some more grab that stone rose you just you know he's picking it up and helping dad bring it up there and place it up there that's good son way to go what are we doing we're building the vision of the lord we're rebuilding god's work the whole family was involved teaching those children from there we're young we're in god's vision here we're doing god's work for this hour but daddy looking over there laughing at us look at samuel over there look at the children of establishment look at tobia laughing at us saying this is important they're worshiping god this is important i know they're laughing at us don't worry about that son this is what god's word said to do amen god says it's important so we say it's as important as a family amen there's even people today laughing at the way i'm preaching right now and calling it cultist because there's just some new theory that i can't draw out of scriptures and then bring this whole presentation to try to get people to follow and listen that's not what i'm doing here tonight the word has discernment for every hour and that shadow of zeb zerubbabel's day is the shadow of our day who said jesus said when he says in the last days i'll send elijah the prophet to restore somebody say it with me restore it's a ministry of restoration amen are we done yet are we done with this ministry is it over no because i'm not missing it that's right amen when i come up missing then it's done when you come up missing then it's done so we're still is everybody still here tonight okay put your hand on put your hand on your wrist everybody check everybody's still living in this earth okay i can see you you haven't raptured yet there's some doctrines of the message think we're already resurrected and already raptured are we resurrected believe it or not it's a wacky stuff and i'm going we're already resurrected raptured in the millennium i said this is it i'm disappointed i mean i gave my whole life for this and this is the millennium we're not there yet this works not over it's not time to give up it's time to keep building on this wall until the wall is completely finished and until uh i'm missing that's that's that's the final thing that i've been restored come to adoption as a son of god there'll be a quick short work of a manifestation through the bride of the of god of a supernatural work in the bride i believe that's supposed to happen not so much to tell the whole world it's not a show to the whole world but to identify there is god's group we'll know within ourselves something happened some of those resurrected saints will be risen from the grave after no doubt an earthquake in california somewhere they're going to raise for 30 to 90 days somewhere in there and some will see those saints raised from the dead they'll see them they'll appear to them and then we'll begin to know now we're on the final stretch it's gonna happen friends it happened before it'll happen again according to god's word now you can go out there and live your own life or you can be sitting right in the vision of god for this hour and saying lord fill me with your spirit lord let me walk with you no matter what you think of yourself just say lord i want to walk with you amen amen i want to walk in i want to be a part of your vision i want my family to be a part of the vision for this hour if i have to stand alone i'll stand alone can i get an amen tonight are you happy tonight praise the lord is is as much good preaching as we get all the time in is we're so blessed with the meat of the word we us preachers could just take 10 minutes and it should be enough to just revive us because we hear so much good food i'll be just it's just ought to bring us to just a rapture friends can you say amen so now this is so now uh the children of i need to get off of them but there's so much could be said there's always something trying to hinder the children of moab and ammon always were right close to the children of israel or trying to get close to agitate to distract and to threaten always i love the attitude of nehemiah this is going to happen boys i love the attitude of nehemiah this is going to happen in chapter 2 and verse 19 when samuelt and tobiah uh heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye will do will you rebel against the king verse 20 then i uh nehemiah answered them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in this jerusalem and you'll find that several times through the book of nehemiah you find nehemiah speaking back to these guys saying listen god will prosper us right god will finish his work and we will finish this wall threaten us all you want to we will finish this wall we're going to do it with one sword in one hand and building in the other hand we're going to do it with guards up we're going to we're going to have our garden so let's get to that part real quick here and so i i love the attitude of nehemiah if you get a chance to read that read it it'll be an encouragement to you so now it's a lesson for us this is a lesson for us for our times in this full restoration of faith and full restoration of families there are people anointed of the enemy to discourage you let's be adults about this let's be mature sons and daughters of god there are influences of people who be it's not the people but they become anointed of the antichrist spirit and the enemy to discourage you in what you believe amen more often now than ever it's right close to us that we are looked down on as being too extreme that we're looked down as being cultish i knew the world made fun of certain things that we believed years ago but now to be made fun of or looked at funny by our own in the message ranks i didn't think that would happen i knew the world made fun of leading our girls to be keepers at home like the bible says and to love their husbands and to obey their husbands but to be looked down on on someone of their own rank sometimes in the message right at teaching them to be keeper at home come on to be looked down on for that i knew that because we don't dance and take a social drink like the world to look like the world i knew if we didn't do that i knew we would look weird to our business associates and i knew we'd look weird to the world you don't dance a little bit what's wrong with dancing you don't take a little social drink at the office or the office party every now and then what's the problem with that don't you know they drunk wine in the bible same story i knew that i would look weird to the world i know i'm going to get persecution for that but now when you stand and you receive a little bit of funny look or put down on but some who supposedly be the believe the message things have changed it's true that's right people have changed but i want to say it's still wrong because of what it represents can you say man but to be told that it's too strict by someone who's following the word supposedly that's way too strict you don't do that i can dance at my wedding i can drink at my wedding i can have these things that has nothing to do with being a christian but friends these are the times that we live in these are the time i'm not here to talk to the nominal world i'm not here to talk to denominationals tonight everybody's believers here so i can be at liberty to say to you i never would have dreamed we'd come to these things and those are listening on the internet i never would but we're here now and the squeeze is ending up being a little bit different than what we thought that's the truth amen come in come on i'm not i don't have anybody in mind right now so don't think that i'm trying to preach on anybody particular if i did that i wouldn't be right i'm just trying to say it's real it's here and it's so why is he saying have your sword up while you're building and while you're growing in the lord have your sword handy have your guard handy because we're living in the times that these influences are trying to discourage you so the sword is used for cutting the sword is not used for patting somebody on the back the sword is used for cutting away unbelief but the ramp says you can have the sword but it takes a strong hand of faith to drive it to the heart of the enemy and he says it's used to cut the unbelief out so you can get to the promises of god there are unbelieving spirits that's in between you and the promise of god and you use the sword to cut that back so you can get to your promises that's what the sword is for so when those unbelieving things come up and say the days of miracles has passed we don't believe that anymore there's no more prophets passed uh past the book of revelations past john and those unbelieving spirits start to bring all this we cut that back and say that's no that's disbelief amen we've got to believe god's word if we're going to see results praise the lord amen as brother doug said the satan's guns are trained i want to refer you to revelations chapter 9 and just hold your hand in nehemiah revelations 9 and verse the reason i'm taking time to qualify this is we assume sometimes everybody just understands these things when the prophet said there's two hundred thousand thousand two million religious devils trained against the bride where's that in the bible revelations 9 preachers refer to it brother doug did revelations 9 and verse 14 says and this is under the sixth trumpet verse 13 uh and the sixth angel sounded and i heard the voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loose which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand so that's two million and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and then that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jason and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions and out of their mouth issues fire and smoke and brimstone so now this is all symbolism of course but if we have it under the sixth trumpet we have it during the time now that there's a persecution coming on god's people naturally the jews right so no on the natural side of these devils who were so cruel and remember their horses that's why we know their their their their powers because of horses power right horsepower got it all right so now 200 000 000 spiritual demons on the natural begin to raise up during the time of hitler mussolini stalin and begin to bring this cruel persecution against who god's chosen people in the natural there it is right there in the bible and it's under the sixth trumpet because the trumpets are all to israel the seals are to the bride the trumpets are to israel and so now the revelation of all that happened with the jews the majority of it is two it's for the jews it comes out of the trumpets and so you have the trumpets you get to the last one the sixth and the seventh then you have something significant coming for our day because things are wrapping up so under the sixth trumpet is when these demons are released lose from the river euphrates and come against the jews what the prophet taught us though is if we're getting close to the end under the sixth and seventh seal then we realize there is an ecclesiastical religious or spiritual side of the natural cruelty that came against those jews to go against the other people of god the bride of jesus christ so that's when he says 200 000 000 religious ecclesiastical death devils released at the evening time on not the church but the bride that's right that be you now go back and read the cruelty on god's people right things you can't even talk about hardly the cruelty what did it wasn't hitler it was the anointing he was under these 200 000 look at the cruelty relentless persecuting killing but now on the spiritual ecclesiastical side has a religious side to it to bring persecution against the true believers who believe all of the word of god not just a portion and i want to remind you of something awesome brother doug brought up in the numbers being the engineer that he is or was seven billion people on the face of the earth and one in a million would be seven thousand if that's true we're not making this a doctrine by the way but i thought it was real good if you divide all that up if there's seven billion people and there's seven thousand of the true believers 200 million demons released on the true believers you split them up and you have 28 000 demons per person of the seven thousand no wonder you're having a hard time that's right that's each of you individually if they're divided up like that we don't know that i'm not preaching a doctor here tonight but if they were to divide into each person and there was seven thousand believers on the face of the earth true believers spirit-filled believers then 28 000 per person would come upon each vision i don't know if you caught that when brother doug said that but you see what you're dealing with no matter no it's no wonder it's what i want to say no wonder no wonder it's so hard to live a christian walk in this day come on yes sir no wonder you ought to you know you ought to say amen to this because no wonder you give one small effort to get close to god and it's so fought against by the devil in two or three days sometimes you can have a setback in my i said here i am given an effort and i have such a setback it's because there's a hindrance there's a spirit there's a force against you being spirit-filled young girl there's a force against you being spirit-filled that's what god wants for you and that's what you desire but get ready because there's a force against it young men the same way older men the same way older women the same way married couples 50 years old 60 years old the same way no wonder when we make a stride towards spiritual things something hits us something hinders us somebody persecutes you somebody says something say something happens to discourage us just simple discouragement the devil says that's enough that's all i had to use on them is discouragement they're easy i'm not threatening to cut their head off like they're believer friends come on preach it did you just love when brother doug says oh yeah i know why you're discouraged yeah you got eternal life and yeah i can see you got these blessings you got the promises of god a little sarcasm there but you know what it's true we don't really have it as bad as we make it all to be but we have the power and we do have forces against this we just have to be recognizing it we have to be as these men that nehemiah instructed with our swords in our hand to cut back that unbelief and continue working on the wall praise the lord so no wonder the battle so hard so cool i could go on and preach more and more about that no wonder when we make a step no wonder a young person gets discouraged they get a bad thought they lean towards the wrong thing just a little bit and they just the devil beats them up over it don't be discouraged my friend don't be discouraged young girl god is looking at your desires can i get an amen every one of you god's looking at her desires he's not looking at you he's looking at your desires and there if the deep's calling to the deep there's a deep to respond god desires his promises for you you desire them on the inside whatever's in between you're going to have to crash through that with the sword you're going to cut through it you're going to have to get bold in your faith that's right get up in the morning realize that's where's my 28 thousand i'm ready for you come on can you say man you're gonna have to be bolder you're going to be be rougher with the enemy that's right no doubt about it or he'll just he'll just beat you up he'll just discourage you he'll use someone else to discourage you that's why a lot of people are giving up that's why people giving up you know i've tried this and you know what i've seen so much and now they're going to judge the message by all the things they've seen all their life in the message come on throw the baby out with the bath water that's right it's true i'm through with this thing i've seen it i'm through with the people and that's it we're not coming to this because of the people i'm done with it you know this is it they get so discouraged and they allow the discouragement to take him too far to throw out the good things of god that god's done in their lives amen praise the lord so their leader has set them up to live every day to live every day together as a family building and guarding friends don't stop building don't stop teaching your children don't stop teaching fathers don't stop cheating teaching your children don't let that fall i can always sense it in my home and actually we're there right now i'm just being honest with you i always sense that when we go too far without meeting together for prayer three or four days and i can always see the change that comes in the home don't stop doing it keep working against this this time we live in do the things even if it's painful even if don't feel like doing it even if you're tired sometimes you gotta do it when you're tired don't stop building for the kingdom of god don't stop that keep it going but have your swords very close to you and ready to use can you say amen for cutting away the unbelief uh and say i don't want to be rough here but if the enemy comes too close with his ideas i can get rough that's that's the that's what you want to say to the devil i got my sword here i don't want to get rough remember the swords isn't to use on one another by the way cutting people up on the internet just slicing people with the message you know i want to say this i think i'm bearing the blunt lately of a bunch of stuff that's happened on the internet the last two years and i'm getting labeled under a certain label people that act extreme and act unchrist-like and are sometimes a bad representation of this message and using the sword to cut everybody up come on we're not supposed to use it on one another let's use it on the devil amen i feel like i'm bearing the blood of some things but i don't like to be put into those classes but still you want to say to the devil i don't want to be rough here but i can be rough devil that's right that's why i think laying your store there and having it near and working in the kingdom of god i think that's what that says it said i don't want to be rough but if i have to come on good can you live a christian walk like this young people can you say that to the devil i don't want to be rough but i can get rough i have the soul of the world of the word i can do it amen that's what it's teaching us here the sword's for cutting and so i don't want to be rough but if the enemy comes too close with his ideas i can get rough i don't just use my sword just to use it but i will use it if i have to you know you brother some of you are carrying your guns now and you have to have a lot of wisdom to carry that gun you don't just use it for every little thing right but a lot of you carrying them now you know that's fine and i'm not against that in the the world we live in or whatever that's fine some of them are bringing them into church i probably shouldn't have said that now it's going to make everybody nervous but you know that's fine you know i i don't have one right now anyway but you know i that that's fine but you know what hopefully you have the wisdom because you know what you have it there in case you have to use it right for protection right just in case you don't have it there just so you can flash it around everybody the guy's in front of you in the lane you just wave it out the window say i'm merging no that's not what that's for or to make somebody dance and get them out of the room and just shoot around their feet that's that's showing off but there is something you said to be said about this whole picture of they had their swords there they had their swords they were girded with their swords they were ready because of the threat of the enemy and if unbelief tries to come and threaten they were ready to cut against it that's the way you have to live in these times as a christian that's the way you have to be to cut through people people sometimes are not willing to use the word to cut through ideas of unbelief and poison that's trying to poison the minds of the people they want to be nice all the time but we do we're not nice to unbelieving devils we have to use the word against them amen because they'll poison us so catch a glance at his family as i'm trying to bring it to a close as brother doug referred to um what do you say pulling over that's right catch a glance of this family the spiritual stance of a family at this time that we live in building all the time on one side building with the stones god's given us and on the other side guarding all the time guarding all the time right you can't let one of those sides go in the times within things are going to start happening to unravel your family you can't let one of those isn't doesn't this speak some great things for our lives doesn't it just click show us clearly how to live can't let so so i my encouragement to you as i close is keep feeding on the word stay teachable stay corrupt correctable by the word be in his presence as often as you can get up and join your family with the body of christ get up on sunday morning get up get up with get up from your nap wednesday night or whatever you're doing get your family up and go be with the body of christ so much the more as you see the day approaching not less go be with the body of christ go be with them because there are things in them that you can garner from that you need and there are things they need in you so teach your family the body of christ has strength for me that's biblical that is so biblical and so the the goal be with your family join so much the more you see the day approaching and make sure you do it for sure make sure you do these things for sure when you don't feel like it make sure you do it for sure when you don't feel like it do it more do it more when people are dividing people are splitting off to themselves turn around and do the opposite and do it more even when you don't feel like it take the nuggets take the stones take the revelations god's given us he's preaching to us over the pulpit through the message through the things you're learning and build them into your life and into your family don't stop doing it but on the other side be ready for all kinds of strange ideas that are meant to confuse you to discourage you and to scare you well i'm beginning to wonder if i've followed something wrong my whole life come on can you imagine all that god's done for you that's right it's true everything that it is even with all the stuff that reproach we have to bear with it but you better take a look at your life not in view of what that influence is saying to you that's here but look what god has done for you that's right man don't let anything discourage you or confuse you get ready always to use your sword and prayer against terrorist spirits that are against your kids against your marriage against your mind against your peace against your security against your stability come on now against all the things that you've learned all of your life that are true you didn't learn everything right but you learned some things that were true beware the spirits that make you question all of that that's true beware of it this i'm trying to give you i get down to the end of these i try to give practical advice there's terrorists spirits against your kids against your families there's lesbian spirits that come in every sort of way and attack a girl that's discouraged attack a girl that for all sorts of reasons in her minds you don't tell if you if you don't know i'll let you know not my kids not not my girls listen you better have your sword ready because then it can come through anything and now someone's as vulnerable to some insecurity they feel homosexual community and those spirits and the lesbian community is not happy to stay amongst itself and that's in the bible when it knocked on the door of lot asking for those men wanting their daughters couldn't give the dollar so they asked her for the men not offered his daughters to them so he wouldn't take these angels it's not good enough to stay in their little club in sodom it was knocking on the door of a righteous man who his soul was vexed daily knocking knocking until the bow says they were crashing the door down wake up that's our day we live in sodom and these spirits take a young mind of a young girl a young guy and start to confuse their minds and that's why we be a strength to them with the sword of god and cut that unbelieving thing or that movie that's bringing in whatever it is we don't mess around with these spirits don't think this is happening in the message girls pastor's daughter turned into lesbianism that's right i don't i don't like to share that stuff but i'm telling you we're living in real time right and i'm not here to scare you i'm here to say we've got a sword to put up we've got a sword to guard against these things and we better do it because it's at the door many times these things are real and there's dividing spirits as well that we're fighting against against kids coming against marriage come against your mind right dividing spirits to come against the church and to divide the church divide families god help us may we all have the love of god in our hearts tonight to override these dividing spirits and say lord help me to love anyway may just be in agreement that loves the answer many times to killing demon spirits loves the answer because the part of that sword is the sword of the spirit and in that spirit is the love of god you give enough love something of the true genuine love of god demons start to run away lord help us to love one another help us to pull together help us not to separate through the true love of god would you read one scripture with me about that romans 16 verse 17 i'm closing on this one i'm pulling off i've been reading this scripture quite a bit uh but it says here in romans i pray this as an encouragement to you tonight but we have terrorist spirits and today they sneak in so ugly they're not ugly looking but they sneak in sometimes among us they never look destructive you know the islam religion the extreme islam religion you know they strap bombs to a people they strap bombs to a woman strap bombs to a man they think they're going to get rewards in heaven for doing this but that's characteristic of a terrorist spirit look how they're doing it it reflects the demonic realm that comes against you right it goes into the grocery store it goes into a coffee shop and it looks like everybody else it's being friendly it's talking and all the while it's got a bomb on it to just in cruelty destroy all kinds of children and men and women that's right that's how the devil works especially in this hour amen be ever so nice ever so but but be careful friends in the hour we live in that there's not a something there to try to destroy and discourage you it says in romans 16 17 and now i beseech you brother and it's an urgency i beseech you mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which she have learned to the doctrine that you've learned if it's true doctrine you've learned even if you grew up in it if it's true mark them that cause divisions and confusion to try to get you away from that that's right amen mark them and avoid them mature uh immature sons of god don't like to read the scriptures on avoiding people but mature sons realize it's it's in the scripture and sometimes it's required right they're causing divisions contrary to the doctrines you've learned avoid them for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly in other words their own um agenda their own their own self they serve themselves and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple it's true how'd they do it how did you see the hearts of the simple by good words by fair speeches but by things that sound so good right and you need to be in the word yourself and check it out because on the front of the surface it's good words and fair speeches and so nice and it can be an agenda to discourage you that's what the bible says there is security for families in someone who's willing to stand on the same things for the long haul and be consistent not trying to change things after a certain time if something has been established as truth beware of new ideas trying to modernize things i'm giving instruction as a pastor tonight all right i'm being really down to earth and i'm getting ready to close but what i'm saying here i wish i could articulate it better i wish i was an orator i'm not but what i'm saying is is so important and i say it to you as a pastor what i'm saying is instruction and admonition and encouragement to you these things are real this is how you need to live in this hour i'm not playing games but when someone stands for something for the long haul and it's a clear stand that brings security to families you know how many people have come to me and said through these turbulent times thanks for staying consistent thanks for saying it like it is right young girl says i'm sitting there and i'm i'm wearing the wrong things and i've got you know caked on makeup and all these other things and she's the one that comes and says i went back and listened to your service on modesty i went back and listened to things and every once in a while you hang on brother paul don't stop hitting on it stay consistent keep saying it like it should be said i don't always listen to the ones who are complimenting me i take the constructive criticism too and i get it but security comes when fathers and pastors and leaders like nehemiah are consistent we believe the word amen and 20 years later we believe the same thing nothing's changed here security comes not trying to change things beware of new ideas trying to modernize things as nehemiah did this i believe it created unity not fear creating unity security and happiness happiness can i end on that what he did for the people created unity it created security it created happiness when you have caught god's vision it's not bondage it's not fear it's joy no greater joy than to see my children walk in truth it's seeing families in order in this hour walking in the vision and working on this wall and that brings happiness it brings joy it brings security because we are little creators can you say amen we are little creators and when a man or a pastor or a woman who's kind of the manager of the home when she brings consistency and she's consistent what she believes and she has a creative power to create security in her kids fathers have creative power to create security in their families where's our security
