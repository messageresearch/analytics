========================================

just a quick reminder that this Sunday is the Lord's Supper I think it's at four o'clock if I'm not mistaken four okay four o'clock on this Sunday so we'd love to partake with you if you're able to make it I was going to try to sing a song a couple songs have been on my heart all week and then I thought I'll just stick to my calling and maybe the Lord will put it on somebody else's heart uh brother Paul gave us a good report from camp today that the session he did went very well and a lot of the young people were very blessed by it so we were happy to hear that and and I was just thinking in the back they showed up not to make you nervous brother Josh they showed you on the camera just real brief but I was happy they did it was good to see you and um do you want to if I bring you a mic do you want to say anything or you're good to go no okay I won't put you on the spot then but it's it's good to see you we could just sit and look at you tonight if we if you'd let us healthy better than looking at me Hebrews 4 verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was on All Points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need God bless you you can have your seats may the Lord bless his word tonight I had this on my heart one day some time ago and just this this part about a we have a high priest and um I can't remember what it was not long ago just taking something looking at it deeper there was there was more meaning to to it there than what I had ever realized I think it was Isaiah 53 when when you delve into it you know we always say Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions bruised running we either take one thing or the other he's either died for our sins or he died for our healing and we don't always run the two together in this particular set of scriptures I just got to thinking about one day and I thought for we have we have a high priest we know we have a high priest but it says that he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities and then it says in all points he was tempted just like we're tempted so everything that we experience in Temptation on this life Jesus has to have felt that in some way when he was here on Earth he had to feel it in order to be a faithful high priest that can be touched when we have Temptation when we have sickness if he didn't experience that then we wouldn't have a high priest that could be touched that way he can he can enter in with us into what we're feeling into what we're going through in that time and so I looked up that word infirmity and and you know this particular set of scriptures I always apply and have always heard it apply to when we're sick well we have high priests that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities let's pray for you and we pray for physical healing but and it does mean physical healing it's want of strength it's weakness it's an infirmity of the body it's it's a native weakness and Frailty it's feebleness of health or sickness but it also goes deeper into what Jesus experienced that we experienced in its feebleness and weakness of the Soul and it's one of strength and capacity to understand something it's one of strength and capacity to do great and glorious things it's want and strength of capacity to to restrain corrupt desires now look at that in in Jesus Christ the son of God had to have a strength he had to experience a strength that would restrain him from corrupt desires and if it restrained him from corrupt desires it means that Jesus had to feel corrupt desires can you say Amen it means to Bear trials and troubles now we know Jesus bore trials and troubles because it says he learned obedience by the things that he suffered but I just think that this takes our high priest to took it to a different level for me that it's not just I can't just turn to this scripture now and look at it as when I need healing but when I'm feeling tempted I can look to the scripture and I can reach out to the Lord Jesus Christ and say father I'm feeling tempted right now I need your help and Jesus knows exactly what that is and he knows just exactly how to minister to you in that time if you'll let him I printed my notes off tonight because the battery on my iPad was dying really really fast and I don't know why and I thought I'm not ignorant of Satan's devices so I printed my notes that word means it's it's a feebleness of body or of mind it's implica it's implication a disease or a disorder but it also implies moral Frailty and and these things I just want to want us to take them to heart tonight that it's it's something greater it's it's when when we look in Hebrews just before Paul writes these things down that we just read tonight he's talking about arrest and arrest in the Holy Ghost and what that is and Jesus gave us God gave us a Sabbath and then he says but Jesus was Lord of the Sabbath it's something greater than what the Jews at the time were trying to hold a tradition of of arrest and Paul's saying you missed you're missing it it's no longer a day but it's it's it's the Holy Ghost rest that we get it's it's the overcoming prevailing power over the infirmities of the flesh amen it speaks of the Simplicity of Salvation in Jesus Christ by his grace now I want to turn to chapter 10 real quick and I'm going to try not to read a lot tonight but I have a lot to read so bear with me um stand up if you have to I I won't call you out unless you start coming towards the front Hebrews 10 10 . and I just want to read a couple verses because this this was just so beautiful it says by the witch uh will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all Jesus knew the infirmity that would be in our flesh so he went to the cross and died that there would be a sacrifice once and for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin the traditions of their time but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God his work was finished so he went and he sat down it was time for him to rest his work was completed amen from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made as footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified notice this is just an absolute complete work that Jesus Christ did whereof the Holy Ghost also was witnessed to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their heart so it's not something that you're going to have to strive for for this Perfection God's just going to put it inside of you I mean it doesn't get any better than that to say to require something of somebody and then say okay but I'm going to give you what you need in order to meet this requirement and in their minds will I write them this isn't just have to do with the with the with the heart this is of the mind this is the infirmity and the Affliction that comes on our minds because we know the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind the enemy attacked brother Josh in his mind but God through Jesus Christ provided a sacrifice brother Josh that your infirmity is completely taken care of Amen and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more no more it's the powerful work of Jesus now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin there's no need for offering anymore having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus where there was separation between God and man Jesus made a way that there's no more separation by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God notice this high priest that Paul referenced back in Hebrews 4 he's now in chapter 10 calling him the absolute high priest of the entire house of God let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke one unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as we see the day approaching good now in Hebrews chapter 2 Verse 18 . let me just turn there and I'll read it to you real quick for in that he himself have suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted and that word secure is is a help it's to bring Aid to relieve it's a helper not only does he just is he a Helper but he runs it's to cry or call with a high strong voice out of Joy or pain in a violent and overwhelming turbulence or upheaval way so he suffered being tempted and when you feel Temptation in your flesh Jesus runs after you and he'll holler out in a violent manner telling you avoid that Don't Go Near that don't do that because he's trying to secure you in God he's trying to secret secure you to not fall it says he that's able to keep you from falling all you have to do is surrender all you all we have to do is yield our vessel and and and listen listen and act upon it it ties back into four in in chapter 4 verse 15 and 16 that he's tempted in all points like we are and that we can come boldly to the throne of grace now I'm going to shift just a little bit and I know I've already read quite a bit but I've been I've been my wife laughed at me because I picked up a book I got into it it was really ministering to me someone gave me another book I started reading that a little bit and I'm not normally this way but I I can't put them down so I'm I'm reading a little bit one reading another I'm a terrible reader if you ask how many books I've read in the last five years all the way through I'm hoping to get these two done that's just how I'm just bad at it but I I had to take notice though because it's two separate books given to me by two separate people at two separate times I started reading them at separate times and it just so happens that both of them where I'm at in the book started speaking about shame and and coincidence I don't know I don't think so but it's just the Lord's been dealing with me on it and so I thought well maybe somebody here just seemed to fit in with these scriptures and everything so I thought well let's let's tackle it tonight so it's a lot of information so just listen and and I pray something speaks to you guilt though it's important to understand and this really it ties back to the sermon brother Paul preached on on uh condemnation verse conviction and uh both authors were saying similar things I was actually kind of wondering if they collaborated at all because some of it was so close but they started discussing we need to know the difference between guilt and shame because guilt would be like conviction that's what God does when you go before a judge the judge doesn't say uh you know we're talking about shame versus guilt he doesn't say um how do you plea brother Zach are you shameful are you Shameless or or do you plead no contest that's not what they asked they say are you guilty not guilty or no contest I've been to court before nothing terrible just be it's tickets okay everyone says it's an Italian guy a preaching what's going on we're all confused right now um but guilt is what you feel when you do something wrong guilt is a legitimate feeling for something that you did or that you thought uh shame and and Gil is is relates to morals so if you have a moral failure you're going to feel guilt for that moral failure but alongside and a close second with guilt is shame and there is an appropriate shame sometimes but most of the time it's a tool that Satan uses against us to bind up our spirit shame is felt in relation to models or in other words in in who I am and a relation to who I think I ought to be it's it's one about one is about actions and thoughts which is guilt the other is about the very nature of the being and my character so one is really separate from who you are it's just related to what you've done but shame comes in and the devil uses it and it and it starts affecting he's telling you this is who you are this is your identity and and this is the shame that you have to bear from that reproach so you see the difference between the two and how dangerous it can be in simple terms guilt says I have done something wrong shame says I'm a bad person shame is felt as being a dishonorable inferior or worthless person has anybody felt that way before okay just a couple of us all right pray for us Sheamus felt as being dishonorable inferior or worthless or a worthless person failing to live up to expectations whether it be your own expectations of yourself whether it's the expectations somebody else has put on you or really even the expectations that are set of you in God's word it's usually triggered when we anticipate a disapproval or a rejection by somebody you'll feel that shame if you think if I think man you know Kenny is just he's going to reject me if he finds this out he's gonna he's gonna uh he's gonna disapprove of me and that Kenny hasn't done anything yet Kenny doesn't even know anything about my life yet but I'm already walking up to Kenny thinking sorry Kenny Kenny is Kenny is thinking and feeling this way about me and it brings a shame on me and a heaviness on my spirit and then I can't I can't Fellowship freely with brother Kenny and brother Kenny's innocent he's done nothing wrong but yet I've already put his expectations that aren't even his on me so you see what the cycle is shame is feeling uh that you're inferior or a worthless person let's see I already read that so it's anticipating disapproval or rejection and and it's it's anticipating and disapproval rejection and when our foolishness or our weaknesses or our sin is exposed we we feel shame for Guilt we need forgiveness but for shame we need acceptance we're going to go deeper than this in just a minute so bear with me our culture moves the standard by which guilt is felt numbing us when we should feel guilt telling us we shouldn't feel guilt about something that we should when the moral standards of the culture around us starts to Decay then when you should feel guilty for doing something when when a woman walks outside and strips her clothes off she ought to feel guilt for that because it's wrong but but you see how twisted the world has got and that they say well let listen nobody's putting you undue shame on you for for walking out with no clothes on nobody you know they call it body shaming nobody's no no shaming your body they're just telling you that that's wrong go put some clothes on you're naked and that's wrong but the the but Satan's Eden has moved the goal post so much that there's there's no moral standard anymore we know sitting here that it's the word of God but anybody out there has no has no uh measuring tape to measure it by there's no scale to measure it anymore so but we ourselves can can enter into that and and and the more you in uh the more you respond to an enticing Spirit the more that you're drawn away and you give in to your lust as James says the the more you become numb and that guilt starts going away others can make you feel shame this is kind of hard to explain unless you've experienced it but you can you can talk to somebody or somebody can send you a text or um they can give you a look and it makes you feel I always said you know it makes you feel guilty they just that person just has a way of making you feel guilty but if you haven't done anything wrong then it's no longer guilt it's shame that that person is making not that person but the spirit on that person is making you feel shame they have a spirit that will make you feel shamed by things they say the looks they give the way they treat you or talk to you the way their body language is or the things that they do you go away feeling shame but really you have to stop when you feel that way and ask yourself is this true do I really have anything to feel bad about right now and if you can really answer no and and let me let me throw this in why don't you take that to prayer because every man is right in his own eyes God might be able to show you something that you are wrong in this area but if God doesn't show you anything you've taken it to prayer you've examined your heart I didn't mean anything by that I've I've apologized already then that's it that it's between them and God at that point you don't have to bear that shame shame can start from events in our lives when human dignity has been attacked by verbal physical or sexual abuse that's that's how shame can come when our human dignity is attacked by verbal physical or sexual abuse and and these books are both full of scenarios of of things that have been done awful to to most of it is to children and they bear that throughout their life to where when they become an adult you're going to say he's studying psychology um fair enough but those things that happen when we are a kid follow us into adulthood and then when something gets close to that pain that we felt back then it triggers a response today when we're adults and when we're 50 and 70 years old it triggers that and and we have to be careful we have to ask the Lord to show us Lord where is this coming from and then we have to go deal with it back there so that Satan can't hold that shame over us anymore and and we can live in Victory in Jesus Christ another author described the shame he felt for making it home alive from Vietnam and we know that that's a you know the the controversies around that whatever but he describes the shame he says he got off the plane and he was in his uniform and he was expecting you know thank you for your service and and welcome home but he said he got spit on and cussed at just getting off the plane and he said it immediately brought a shame as though there was something wrong with him for not dying in the war like so many of his comrades there's no reason you can't call that guilt it's not something that he did he he just made it out alive there's nothing wrong with that so it's not guilt he shouldn't feel guilt but it was shame he was he was being shamed for making it alive shame can make us feel responsible and deserving of abuse and bad things that happen to us these are the traps of Shame this is what Satan does to bind us is when we feel shame we feel responsible we feel deserving we feel like when something bad happens it's you know when I was young you know it was always you know Lightning's gonna strike you if you don't make that right you know and and and storms of life and just storms in general and I remember one summer God was dealing with me and and I don't know if it was because you know God love and my my grandfather and his Pentecostal background or what but we had a lot of storms that summer and I remember feeling so convicted and and petrified because of these storms because I because God was showing me my sin and I felt like these storms were caused by me it brought me to repentance so I'm happy for that but it it it makes you feel deserving of something it makes you feel like you can't have happiness because you deserve to be sad you deserve to be heavy you deserve to be disliked by others like there's something wrong with us that God has never and and could never and will never love us is what shame will make us feel when we feel shame and try to address it in our own strength though we can tend to overcompensate so many examples from these books that a a mother or father can pressure their family into being perfect so the family doesn't have the same shame that that father and mother has so they'll take their shame and they'll project it onto their kids or onto their wife onto others because they don't want them to carry the same shame that they have some people might have enough Pride with their shame that they feel like if I'm not happy then nobody can be happy so everyone should be it should feel shame are you with me still so even though the shame is not true a man can develop an unrelenting drive to be perfect or be the best at everything to compensate for his parents telling him he was never good at anything that projects a shame on that boy and now he's going to compensate for it and he's going to give his all to everything which isn't a bad thing but what's driving that that's where it becomes wrong is what's the driving force behind it it made him feel shame as a child so he strove for perfection he could struggle with trust he could struggle with showing emotion to those even that he loves and and shame can make a person feel like they have to be in control at all times they have to control other people in situations so that they themselves don't feel that shame again I'm not going to let that person put shame on me so I'm going to control that person I'm going to control this situation so I don't feel shame anymore shame will make us feel like we're un unenjoyable undesirable empty alone and like no one would want to pursue us or accept us it makes us feel diminished insufficient and defective as a person in response we will live in denial will live in perfectionism we'll live in anger or depression I'm going to turn this around in just a minute but this is I'm if you're dealing with shame I pray that something that's being said tonight would would help you understand the source of it's coming from we can become addicted to the sense of Shame though it almost becomes a comfort blanket something we have to fill or we don't feel normal because it's become so normal to us it's no longer a feeling but it's become our identity foreign often people fail to fully understand the incident that caused their shame or they hold it in and hide it within themselves never to share it with anybody and you say well are you telling us to go see a shrink no I'm not but there is a freedom when we confess our faults one to another there's a freedom and a healing James said that comes with that so you might find somebody who you have trust in and be careful because oftentimes we can tend to gravitate towards somebody who's struggling with the same thing and while that can be a good thing it's also a bad thing because you need somebody who can you need to be able to strengthen one another in the Lord you need to be able to strengthen one another in the things that are right shame within causes us to look outside for reassurance that we are worthwhile and if we're not careful we'll give ourselves we'll give up on ourselves and give ourselves away so we'll look in the wrong places for reassurance and we'll do things that are really self-destructive we can turn to things and become addiction uh that become addictions like alcohol and drugs and pornography excessive shopping excessive eating dependency on relationships even when they're the wrong ones the shame will only grow deeper and will still have not properly dealt with the shame that we feel this will eventually catch up with us and cause us to break down eventually we'll have a breakdown as Christians we know there's freedom in Christ there is Victory and we see it in other people's lives and when we feel shame and it's and it's just inside of us and we're holding it in even though it's a good thing and those are good examples we'll feel that shame and because we're not living there it can make us feel more shame so you see that you see how Sly The Devil is to make this cycle and to make it go deeper and deeper he he one example the guy uses is he calls it a noose and and Satan will just tighten that noose up every time to hold you down so you don't have freedom in Christ we must address this is one of the authors says we must address our sense of worthlessness at the point of our shame we have to find a safe place where we can finally let all the secrets out with nothing held back and I'll tell you the first place that you can go is to Jesus Christ the first place that you ought to go is in prayer to Jesus Christ and bring your shame to him because in the end he's the only one who can take it but we can if we can confide in somebody and share it with somebody who will lead us to Christ then they can help us go in prayer amen we need a safe place to confess our sins in order to be healed James 5 16. shame is incredibly painful people just want to be loved and accepted in that desire we can turn to the wrong things and the wrong people um our only chance of healing is to bring the things that make us feel guilt and shame to the Redemptive blood of Jesus Christ and let our minds be renewed by the overcoming transforming prevailing power of revelation of who we are in Jesus Christ the healing from shame is a process and if we introduce destructive Behavior relationships the process could take longer most often irregardless it's never a quick fix you can take that shame to the cross and it's in its and God can do it miraculously but oftentimes what happens is a slow process where God is dealing with that shame but he doesn't want to just deal with the shame that you're feeling he wants to go to the very core and cut the root out of what's causing the shame because otherwise it's just going to keep growing back now this is one thing I'm going to read two paragraphs right out of this one of the books this is shocking news to many Christians that it's not a quick fix because they expect Christ to deal with a problem miraculously he does but it involves renewing the mind and that never happens overnight we have to cooperate every step of the way the sense of being unlovable that lies within an addictive mindset can only be dealt with through healthy relationships at close range and that takes time the sense of aloneness that in this case sexual bondage brings to the human soul doesn't disappear quickly or easily those in the healing process have to give up their old friend the sexual High the the drug High whatever it is when they are feeling alone or worthless and they have to learn to trust in who Christ says they are notice I I love it because yes these are psychology it's it's psychologists they look at Psychology but I love the source that they're bringing us to because it's the only thing psychology can't fix your problem psychology can't wipe away your shame but they're taking us to Jesus Christ to the only source that can says address the issue of the person's position and identity in Christ as many ways as possible this is one subject we can't speak about too often from every possible perspective we need to make a bold declaration concerning the believer's position in Christ we must underline repeatedly that the individual is accepted in Christ secure in Christ and significant in Christ shame is like a charge from hell that violently attacks those truths so these facts must be rebuilt constantly in the believer's life especially if he has been entangled in sexual bondage so don't beat them down continually tell them who they are in Christ go to Christ Christ can help you you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you can overcome this thing because of who you are in Christ because of what Christ did for you Jesus Christ shed blood has removed the accuser's ability to bring accusations one of the authors brings the the scripture that in Revelations where he says the devil Satan's before God day and night bringing accusations against the believer but he says Jesus Christ shed blood has removed the accuser's ability to bring accusations against us before God we've talked about that many times we're well aware of that here but he has never stopped making accusations about God before us in other words he can go to God and we know that he has no say in the presence of God when you bring that under the blood God says I don't I don't know what you're talking about that's probably all these notes are worth tonight but Satan can come to us and and tell us that God God that doesn't apply to you maybe he's telling you that tonight maybe Satan's talking in your ear tonight and he's saying what that minister is saying doesn't apply to me Satan says that doesn't apply to you 'll never be free from shame you'll never be free from guilt you can't go ask forgiveness for God you've crossed the line brother Branham said if you have a desire in your heart to take it before God go take it before God because you haven't crossed the line I don't know these notes are pretty good if I say something when we have something traumatic happen to us or feel like God is not changing our situation we can feel deserted by God with what we know this in uh with what we know here this increases our shame level which Satan reminds us of continually which increases our shame again and it just and it increases his control over us Satan is good these are statements from this book and I just love them Satan is good at interpreting events for us if we let him something happens and who's right there to tell you what the deeper meaning to life is it's the devil Jesus Christ bled four times for us so now we're going to deal with shame Jesus Christ bled four times for us and I I just thought this was remarkable he bled in the garden and we brought these things out during Easter time blood was shed to free us from our own will so you're stuck in an addiction you're stuck in bondage to something you're stuck in a sin cycle in your life Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane gave up he bled and gave up his will so Jesus Christ that means Jesus Christ bled for you to be able to give up your will the crown of thorns blood was shed for the abusive games people play for the abuse caused by others remember they put the crown of thorns on him and then they started mocking him and they made a game out of them and they they were they were it was just complete mockery hitting him and saying tell us who hit you they're playing games against something that of against who who Jesus Christ was but it says he took that crown of thorns and he took he took that beating he took that mockery so that when somebody brings an accusation against you when somebody plays a game with you with your emotions young people when some guy or girl plays with your emotions when when somebody abuses you verbally or physically or or sexually that Crown of Thorns took that and bled for you at the whipping post blood was shed he took Stripes so we could be healed physically but also for our deepest hurts our deepest traumas and the bondage in our life his healing goes much deeper than our physical bodies it penetrates to the spirit where our most painful memories and shame is stored on the Cross blood was shed as the total expression of God's grace to us in Christ Paul wrote what Christ did for us blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us and and the the author gave this example of what Paul was writing there and it reminded me of what the prophet said about dropping a drop of ink into into bleach the ink disappears and when it says that Christ blotted out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us it's referring to at the time I guess they had you could take a piece of parchment and it could be cleansed for reuse so that piece of parchment could have the law written on it it could have it could have the things that make you guilt that that are are punishing you making you guilty of a crime that parchment could have that on that but they could take that parchment and clean it to such a place that something new could be written on it and there would be absolutely no trace of what was written on it before and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ did for us it blotted out the things that were written against us to where it's a clean sheet of paper it no longer has the things that are bringing you shame on it it's pure white and Jesus is writing a new story on it amen the blood shed on the cross totally washes away everything that is written against you every sin and record of wrongdoing guilt and shame is the power of the blood so I know it seems cliche sometimes to say to say these things it's the power of the blood you need to just bring it to the cross and and oftentimes Granite that that's it is more difficult then then it's that simple but it's difficult too because Satan's always right there to tell us and to to keep beating us down with those things and and and the the way we feel like I can't approach God God's not going to hear my prayer it's it's the voice of Satan but if we can just press through and and let our faith rest on the word of God and renew our mind instead of letting those thoughts of Shame dominate us we start taking the word of God that combats that shame it renews our mind and it starts healing us it starts healing your spirit it starts healing your soul amen are you with me we're already accepted you can find scriptures for everything I'm going to say right now we're already accepted you are the joy that was set before Christ to endure the cross you are each one of you are were set before Christ it was a joy for him to endure and to bleed like he did because you were set before him you gave Jesus Christ the spirit left him when he was in the garden he was walking to the Cross as a man but you gave him the spirit's gone you gave him the strength you gave him the power to move forward with every step bearing the weight of that cross every every lash that was in in flesh that was ripped from his body you gave him the power to endure that you gave him the strength to go on every drop of blood was for you he made you and knew you you say well I'm not I'm worthless that shame it just make I feel so worthless I'm I'm not worth nothing nobody would care about me nobody could love me I'm unlovable but he made you and he knew you when you were in your mother's womb you are fearfully and wonderfully made you say well so and so they they told me I was ugly I just I feel ugly you're fearfully and wonderfully made you are accepted in him he's traded you brother Zach he said give me your ashes and he's given you beauty he said he said I'll give you brother can a Garment of Praise but you give me your heaviness what are the things that make you heavy tonight what has Satan put on you that you're bearing tonight that makes you heavy Jesus says I'll take it give it to me and here here is my righteousness for you here's a garment here's a Garment of Praise let me give you something you give me your ashes and I'll give you something to Rejoice about amen he desires you he loves you he accepts you and you were worth dying for now there's been another part to this that it's I probably have three sermons and one but there's another part to this that got me really excited this week and one of the songs I wanted to sing was we called out to dry bones come alive because I got to thinking about the scripture in Ezekiel and if you want to read something beautiful just sums up everything I read Ezekiel 37 go read that tonight because God comes to Ezekiel and it says he picks Ezekiel up in the spirit and sets him down in a valley and it's not a small Valley it's a huge Valley and he said it's dry and there's bones everywhere it's a it's a giant graveyard and it's so it's so dry we know when when Samson took that that uh that bone of a donkey and started beating in philistine's heads it was a dry bone it was a dry Jawbone he should have walked over picked it up and it should have crumbled in his hand but the supernatural kept that bone intact this Valley is full of Bones like that and then God says son of man which brother rap taught us it just means prophet my Prophet can these bones live in ezekiel's like you know Lord I why are you asking me and then God says I want you to prophesy to these bones this fits in with what we're talking about so just bear with me he says prophesy and he starts speaking life back into these bones back into we would say the valley of Shame he starts speaking life back into him and he says Speak Life speak the sinew speak the skin speak it and when he was done speaking it was a whole Army it wasn't just a bunch of dead people it was an Army and when when he speaks life into him he says join the Army you're part of the army of the Lord he says rise up and the bodies are standing there but he says there's no breath in him and he said Speak Life speak breath into him take the shame from them and let them live Speak life so what was broken and dried out before now has life [Music] he says son of man this is Israel they're the dry bones they were cut off for what they've done but God said he'll open their graves he says I'll bring them out of the graves I'll put my spirit in them and I'm going to place them in the land this is a beautiful work of redemption because he doesn't say Okay rise up Army now go take your land he says I'm gonna give him life and then I'm gonna put him in their land he'll do away with the divisions Among Us if you feel shame because of some division he'll do away with that division he'll take us out of the Heathen that we've gotten ourselves mixed up in if you're if you're if you're stuck in pornography or you're you're stuck in some addiction fashion magazines or whatever it doesn't matter he'll he'll he'll take you from out amongst that and bring you into himself he'll Clean us so that we don't defile ourselves with the Heathen anymore will be his people he says they'll be my people I'll be in their midst he'll be our King and his word uh and by his word we will walk we are his children and he's made a covenant of peace with us if you feel shame tonight if you feel conviction tonight take it to the cross and get rid of it Let Jesus Christ take it because he says I want to give you peace he is our God and we are his people and it says he sanctifies us forevermore you can stand to your feet I pray that something tonight spoke to you I wasn't wasn't very long I don't know really how long I've been not very but but I pray that this spoke to you in some way because God dealt with my heart on it for me personally but I believe if he's been dealing with my heart on it then it just correlated with timing of being asked to preach and everything so I trust that something that was said would bless you and help you in your journey that's that's my heart's desire that's God's desire is to lift that shame from you to take it to take to take the guilt if you've done something wrong bring it before the Lord take it to the cross and give it to him let him take it let him cleanse you let him renew your mind don't feel shame for it get it under the blood and then you have no you have no reason to hold on to that any longer Satan has no jurisdiction over you when it's under the blood and Christ died for it he bled four times four different ways he bled all along the way but there was there was four different things there that caused him to bleed for you and then I think sometimes about maybe somebody on their deathbed given their heart to the Lord and I think that thief on the cross and and brother Paul said it a long time ago Jesus that was the first time Jesus looked at somebody through the blood and gave him forgiveness it's that same blood Jesus yeah his work is done and he's sitting on the right hand of God we read but he's on a mercy seat and he's still the bloody lamb he's still looking through that blood at you and I he's he's able to take your parchment tonight and and wash it clean so that he can write something new for you he wants to write you a new story don't don't hold on to the Past it's a scary Journey it can be a very scary Journey but take the Journey of the heart ask God to show you why do I respond this way why do I react this way why why do I have to have why do I have to control people and situations why do I get so angry what what is it in My Heart Lord that has caused that and I guarantee you God will show you he might not show you tonight he can but it may take time because something at some point God will bring something in your path to where when you when you you recognize it and it it clicks it sticks because you're you're thinking different you're praying different Lord show me this and he says now now I can work with you now let me take that let me take your beaut let me take your ashes and take my beauty let's let's bow our hearts and and I don't know what to pray specifically here just if you have something that you want God to take maybe you need to just take a moment and repent just repent ask God Lord help me not to do that again I'm sorry Lord I got caught up in the Trap you know Satan can make us think you know well you did that willfully you went and did that you you had some desire listen temptation is is a form of Desire I would believe make you feel like I wanted to do that well your flesh wanted to do that but ask yourself if you're feeling if you're feeling guilt if you're feeling shame then there's something inside of you that didn't really want to do that you don't want to be that you don't want to be that way just lift it before the Lord now take it before the cross and Let Jesus Take It father I pray Jesus that if we've done anything Lord here tonight or anyone that would listen we pray for our loved ones lord they're part of the dry bones father that was in that Valley as our unsaved loved ones and Lord we're asking you to speak life to breathe the breath of life into him tonight father go catch them wherever they're at God maybe they're in the performing some Act of sin right now God Lord I I have a hard time getting away from The Prostitute that was thrown at your feet caught in the very Act of adultery and you didn't condemn her you forgave her [Music] the enemy the religious of that day were trying to Heap up shame and guilt on her get Jesus to to claim that she's guilty make her feel ashamed in front of that group of men but you said I love you I forgive you I'll accept you Lord I pray father whatever anybody is going through tonight God look deeper into our hearts Lord father there's things God that we can't even put into words we don't know why we're the way we are we don't know why we respond that way but we've done it for years and I just pray father that you would let the healing process start tonight father that you would let your people be free God and I don't say that Satan to make them feel guilty to make them feel shame for not being free that you put them in that situation but Lord God you said I'll take you and I'll wash you and I'll make you be my people you you'll I'll be your God and you'll be my children all dwell in your midst I'll give you my spirit father I pray God if anyone here tonight is the lacking of the spirit Satan's made me question whether I had the spirit many many times but father where I found peace is that you want to give it to me more than I want it so if I don't have it then I can rest that you'll that I'll get it because you said he that started a good work in me as faithful to finish us and Lord You Love Me and I'm resting in that Lord help your people to rest in that take our sin and shame in Jesus Christ's name amen
