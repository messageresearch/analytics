========================================

this is be the uh continuing talking about blessed families how many wants a blessed family getting down to the nitty-gritty of things a little bit but i appreciate all the comments that's come in even some that are listening on the streaming some that aren't in our congregation have jumped on to the blessed family series and i think it's because they just want to have a better family and this isn't worldly based isn't carnal minded based it's not uh it's not even really james dobson or any kind of psychology of the world or christian psychology i'm trying to stay right in the scripture with it and uh because i need to learn i need to be a better we need to be a better family for the lord so i hope you have your ears on your spiritual ears and i hope you're listening and i just appreciate all the comments and it's just been a blessing i think more to me than others but i'm just glad that we're able to take this time so this is blessed families part nine tonight blessed families part nine i don't know how many parts it'll have to it but we'll just finish when we get done amen brother branham was preached a couple years uh job on the ash heap for a couple years and they said when are you going to get him off the ash sheep well i tried to get him off but he just preached for a long time i think it was a year he said not two years about a year and just talking about that one one place in scripture ephesians four and verse and i want you to think of this in light when as we read up into verse 15 i want you to think that's in light of family okay think of these scriptures in light of family and the body of christ i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called we have been called in the end time not only to chris to be a christian not only to salvation but we've been called to more than salvation we've been called to the age of adoption to grow up as sons and daughters of god and to come to the final completion of redemption that's our vocation that's our calling and so we should walk worthy of that kind of high calling we are so blessed to be called to the message and to be called to this high calling of the last days we're not better than anybody else but we're so blessed and if you've been called to that that's such a wonderful thing and we we should walk worthy of that vocation where what we are called and i truly believe the rest of the chapter goes into details of how we walk worthy according to that calling and it starts in verse two with saying with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love and so probably the first thing that's mentioned here is humility and loneliness um we can't really walk worthy of this great calling without humility let's start there can't walk worthy of the vocation without humility and loneliness so with all loneliness and weakness with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace what is the goal that we have it's to keep the unity we endeavor we do everything we can to keep the unity uh of the spirit in the bond of peace there's one body there's one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism i always love how this word is this is worded because um it's one it's it's one of something if you have a lot of something it gets confusing it's like trinity's confusing you know to have three three lords or three gods they see it's three one god and three persons but quite often you have people say well which one do i pray to um if i pray enough to the father to the son then the holy spirit is he left out and so all of that breathes more confusion we only serve one god one father of all and so one lord one faith you say what what faith there are there's only one faith what faith are you what well i'm this i'm baptist i'm denomination i'm this it knows only one faith and that simplifies it can you say amen it helps us to understand it better one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given to grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended let's skip down to verse verse 11. what happened when he ascended verse 11 he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the work for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the what till we all come in the unity of the faith the one faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so once again just as in verse 3 verse 13 mentions the same word and that is till we all come into the unity it mentions unity coming into the unity and this is this time it says through the five full ministry helping that god sent the fightful mystery help us till we come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure the stature of the fullness of christ so the goal is unity the goal is the unity of the faith the goal of the world is more diversity the goal of the world is that we can all branch off into whatever idea that we have and they we all tolerate one another the goal of the christian walk and the goal of the holy ghost is unity of the spirit can you say amen it's not the goal of the world that's for sure but we come in the unity that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slideman so that must be a characteristic of children being tossed about to and fro by every wind of doctrine and so if we're being children and tossed about what by every different idea that we're then we're not growing into the unity of the spirit if we're being tossed about like children and so think of that in life as families we need to be stable we need to be consistent because if we're tossed about as far as what we believe as far as where we're at then our children we've certainly tossed them out right so so that we henceforth and from here on out be no more children tossed and grow and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of man and cunning crappiness so the strange doctrine and the wind of doctrine comes through the slide of men and cunning craftiness that they bring it they lie and wait to deceive verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which the is the head even christ so here's the goal to grow up into him in all things till we all come to the unity the one faith can you say amen the one unity of the not to not to be diverse not to branch off into diversity but the goal to come into the unity of the spirit that one thing that he was bringing us to and growing how many wants to grow uh as it says here grow up into him in all things amen father bless your word tonight and this little series we're doing on wednesday night so you just blessed it lord to me in such a great way i pray you continue to bless it to the ears of the people as we commit my words to you tonight may they be your words may be direction of the holy spirit for uh many lives lord and we just committed to you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated tonight so when we look at this now i want you to go back to joshua 22 and i want you to keep that foundation in mind about endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit that's the goal so joshua 22 is where we led off of last week and i'll just give you a quick background as we read this in joshua 22 and verse 10 and when they come under the borders of jordan that that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see so um without having to go into the whole story from last wednesday night i hope some of you were here and some were weren't but i'll try to get to the quickest thing because we really need to move on this is the part that i wanted to get to but we had a tremendous theme here last week and talking about the two tribes as joshua came into the promised land two tribes of israel decided to not go into the promised land they decided to stay on the border they decided and it's right there in scripture they said moses can we stay here he said why they said because we are into cattle and this is the best place to raise our cattle this is a well-watered land this is a wonderful place and uh you know what we and we've decided this is the best place can we stay two tribes now said can we stay this side now all of us are saying today that's crazy we're all going god called them out of egypt for the purpose of bringing into their own land it was the land of promise and we're trying to figure out why in the world somebody would stop short of the promise and say i i don't need to go into all of that i don't need to go in that promise that's all going to be just a bunch of fighting anyway and just trying to find the land i can just sit right here because it's it's it's well watered and they chose a place of convenience that fit their future economic outlook and i was trying to bring to you that we should never do those things our decisions should never be based upon things that would keep us from the promise of god the first thing is the baptism of the holy ghost nothing should keep us from the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost none of us should team to come short of the baptism of the holy ghost and just get on the border of jordan all of our children all of us we need the baptism of the holy ghost that is a promise unto us can you say amen and once you're into that land of the holy ghost you have to fight to keep growing in this great spiritual land and so maybe that's why a lot of people don't want to go there because it's a constant fight to keep growing to keep growing into the full mature son and daughter of god but they chose a place of convenience that fit their future economic outlook not the land of god's promise not god what god promised to them and god's promise wasn't even regarded and moses got upset moses said my how can you i don't understand it and he says now here your brothers are going in to fight and and they have to go fight and you're staying here well they said well i'll tell you what we'll go fight with them but when all the fighting is over and they find their land we still want to come back to this well-watered land because it's the best place for our cattle carnal decision a worldly type decision these are believers now but they chose to be borderline believers and so they made decisions based upon uh a convenience made decisions based upon convenience and so the decisions were placed on the convenience of life over growing in god's spiritual promises and families can make the same mistakes today all of us have the potential in our decisions to make decisions that that are more about other things except the promise being the priority in our lives we should teach our children the promises of god is the priority of our lives growing into god's promises living god's promises walking in god's promises every day from healing to the baptism of the holy ghost to growing as an adopted son to all of god's promises priority of life is that we live in the land of god's promises and i said as i said last wednesday night follow them that in our inheriting the promises getting around the people that are beyond us getting around spiritual believers and getting our kids around spiritual believers that have grown beyond us that because they're inheriting the promises i want to follow anybody that's inheriting the promises praise the lord that's what we try to get around and so families though can make those same mistakes any family could and so now then at the very end of this story after this is now beyond numbers this is the end of the they come into their land and they fought with their brothers and now joshua says it's time you can go back now if you want to go back and they decide to go back so they go back to back across the border back across jordan they find this place that they want to live and the bible says in verse 10 here that they built an altar all right they built an altar of their own the bible says it was a great altar to see now right away israel reacts because that was not supposed to be because of a principle in god that when god sets up an altar there's a provided place of worship and if god sets a place he said that's the place i choose to put my name that's where worship is accepted and that's where all of israel needs to worship we know that now because of the revealing of the word of the last days god's only provided place of worship is not under a denomination it's not under a church as such but it's under the shed blood of jesus christ we know that from abel all the way through then it's always under the shed blood of jesus christ and it is an altar of sacrifice it's not an altar of fruits it's not an altar of doing good deeds we don't come and say here's all my good things i did for people in life this is what i gave to charity this is why how i helped people and that's why i laid up what i lay at the altar that's that's not acceptable to god it's a wonderful thing but that's not what takes care of sin it's an altar of sacrifice and so these two tribes and now they're two and two tribes and another half of another tribe and uh i'll just throw this out to you that means that these borderline believers influenced other believers a half of another tribe to go with them and to live there so influence is a powerful thing wow you're going you've been they gave you permission to live over there you don't have to come and fight every day for the promise you can live in that well-watered land and bring your cattle there we want to do it they influence half of the of another tribe to go with them influence is a powerful thing but this group built an altar it was a great altar maybe they could see it from the other land across jordan they look over saying what is that thing over there that looks just like the real altar it looks like just but it's great i don't know what that word great means but it must have been even more beautiful but it resembled the true altar that joshua had set up in joshua 8 this is the place we're coming together to worship now all of a sudden israel reacts in such a uh uh uh i don't know what to call it almost an anger and they're ready to go down to go to war with these two and a half tribes because why because there's a principle there's only one provided place of worship they thought they were going to worship there they thought this is terrible this is the division they begin to think about the principle in the place that he should choose and also they they're ready to go to war because if you read with me two reasons and i can't read the whole story but i'm just pulling some things out so be real spiritual minded here and remember the things that you've read in joshua 23 22 and verse 17 is the iniquity of poor which is that's the reference to bel por too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord so they refer in their history to the worship of baal poor the influence of balak to bring the people over set up set up seven altars set up all the things just like israel does it and ask them to come over and worship with us and many of israel fell by that because it was the same type of altar it was the same sacrifices it was the same things and that was uh something never forgiven of israel and they lost many many people over it can you say man it just became an influence because somebody decided to go worship at another altar than the god ordained altar so they got mad at it here's the next reference they made to the history verse 20 did not ache and the son of zara committed trespassing the accursed thing and wrath foul on the all of the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity so notice he he and his family is is they perish with his family and we just went through that story for a few weeks ago aiken it's because he decided to do something different than what god had gave the all of the children of israel to do and so they're reacting saying have you guys forgot what happened at belport have you guys forgot what happened with aiken just a few just when we started this journey that haven't you forgot the principle that if you decide to do something opposite of what god's told the rest of the children of israel how you realize how detrimental that is to all of us we could all die over this so that was their first reaction to it and you know what i'm going to compliment them for that it was a quick reaction but i'm going to compliment him for it because we should have our nose smelling for sin right away anything that has a history and it looks like it's something that's going to be wrong we should be sniffing out and saying oh lord what's going on here instead of just letting it come in we should have discernment as christians and we should be willing to say if something's wrong in the right way but we should be willing to say listen you better be careful that something's wrong here because why we have we're not ignorant of satan's devices if we're ignorant of satan's devices then we're being immature christians we're we're letting we're just letting anything come in without i'm going to pray about that i'm going to study the word about that there's something not quite right about that if it turns out to be right then praise the lord if it turns out to be wrong then we've got to have a concern about that and that's all they're doing they're just reacting saying do we want to be like bell poor and aiken when some and it came when someone broke unity and said i'm doing it another way it affected all the rest it also affected their own family so there's there's things that are spoken of us uh just like them let me just say it this way god has given things to us as a as christians as believers i'm going to be free tonight to say not only in the bible but since he sent an end time prophet he has given us absolutes and direction back to the word of god but even how to live in this age and so when he gives those things he speaks them to all of us and they are absolutes and paul said it would be good if we all spake the same thing now tonight these are these are very uh hard things to divide and that's why i want you to listen close if you're interested i want you to listen close paul says there's division among you in the corinthian church there's division among you and he says this shouldn't be he said the desire the goal should we be that as he said in ephesians that we be in unity and that we all speak the same thing that's right now automatically most of us are saying if you can say that all of us are saying well you know that's that's impossible it's because of the way you're looking at it that's right come on now okay and so if the bible says it and that's our goal then whether we see it or not or whether you think it's possible or not you should be believing it saying somehow we've got to understand this and this ought to be our goal that we all begin to speak the same thing amen amen and i personally believe is that whatever god has spoken to us we should make it a goal in our lives and in our families to say lord we may not be there yet but we know that's the goal and that's what we believe can you say man and if he spoke it to all of us then we should be heading in the direction of coming under headship to what god spoke instead of what the family sometimes that we've been reading about saying i know god said that to the whole congregation but i'm going to do it a different way every time they do that we have example after example it hurts that family it hurts that person and it hurts the rest of the congregation now that's things god has spoken just give me a minute i'll talk about diversity of opinions but i'm not talking about i'm talking about what god has said clearly to us we should not be finagling with those things and using the criteria to say well i do my own thing even amongst the body of christ not with something that god has said for all of us to do that principle of the world that let's have diversity of thought and everybody do what they want that's a worldly principle and it's not a godly principle at all and it never works in the body of christ paul said i know of many divisions among you and someone's told me of the house of chloe i've heard about these things the ones of apollos and ones of that and he spoke about a different division there that today but he says these things ought not to be so we shouldn't have this among us and yet we do many times can you say amen so there are things in absolutes god has given us and paul said it would be good if we all spoke the same thing given to us from god's word if one says well i don't really care i'm not doing it that way it's never good for them or it's never good for the rest of the congregation why why is that because that approach is the pride of the world it's not the holy ghost filled body of christ it's not contributing to helping as we're preaching sunday christ to be released the people and the holy ghost to be released to the people to do what he wants to do it's it's squelching the spirit it's quenching the spirit it's restricting christ it's holding it back and it's always done that and so now it's the pride of the world that makes it say that way it's not the holy ghost body of christ it's a self-focused approach of the world and we could agree with me that the world is self-focused the world's approach to everything is very self-focused why because that's that beast nature without a new birth it's just a beach beast nature the interesting thing about it a person can have that beast nature they're so self-focused but at the same time they can be so giving it seems like they can give to the poor they can do this they do that but if they're self-focused they're even doing that to bring attention back to themselves because it's that nature that hasn't been born again and it's very very self-focused as we were studying friday night or listening to the message about calvary and the effects of calvary last friday at communion we learned that one of the effects of calvary is it burns all of the selfishness out of us and it continues to do it throughout our christian walk lord burn out the selfishness within you burn out this self-focused attitude and lord may i become eternal life is living for others you begin all of a sudden to care about the souls of others and life isn't arranged so that everything comes back to being about you praise the lord so now it never works to have a self-focused approach it's not balance the other side of it would be that everybody and just explain that let me just explain this right now so it never works to say okay i'm going to do something completely opposite of what the lord has told us all to do i'm going to do something different and so we know that doesn't work but the other side of it will be that everybody needs to conform to a code without the holy ghost well we're all afraid of that because why is that that's a cult that's cultish so that's the other extreme and brother brahman says the devil is always trying to take us to extremes we don't want extremes we want to balance we want them want the middle of the road a lot of us are scared to the extreme of becoming cultists where everybody conforms to one cold code it's a communistic thing isn't it that's why we hate it so much even some of the world even hates that communistic way is because everybody comes to a certain thing and uh in a certain code and it's very it becomes very cultish without the holy ghost that's what happens is it becomes everybody conforms to a certain code we don't want that either that's a cult but both sides are flawed both sides are flawed the side that makes a code that everybody needs to stand by without the holy ghost is flawed but the other side that says i do my own thing even in the body of christ i do my own thing is flawed as well it's just as fun praise the lord so this altar that they built what purpose did it have why'd they build this beautiful altar that resembled the true altar they even had good intentions and after israel reacted the way they did then all of a sudden these two tunab tribes explained wait a minute wait a minute we're not in rebellion here we're we're not listen hear us out a minute okay you're you're overreacting we're not trying to build an altar here to to uh you know to be in rebellion to the true altar of god here are reasons and i'll tell you if you hear the reasons they are good intentions they are good reasons uh they are good things it it seems like uh and israel was respectful to their reasons both times when they said we want to live this side of jordan we don't want to go in eventually israel said and even moses said all right if that's what you want to do if that's where you want to live you don't want to come into god's promise completely then you go right ahead and do that and that's why you have to be as a christian you have to shake your hands and say all right god bless you my brother speaking on sunday or wednesday about about abraham saying a lot god bless you my brother choose which direction you want to go and i'll go the other direction god bless you god be with you it's respectful god doesn't know what's in the god knows what's in the heart but maybe abraham didn't see what was in the heart where all they'd end up someday and abraham went down there and fought a battle and delivered him one time took him out of captivity that's being a brother as well you know after he delivered a lot like that lot went right back into sodom again his wife and they just they liked the world but the respect of israel here says you want to live there that's fine now here's a respect saying okay now we understand your intentions i'll get to them in a minute now we know that you're not being a rebellious to build another altar to sacrifice or to worship at and okay and that and that'll be fine i've been pondering these scriptures for a week to say but wait a minute is this a good thing there's something so mysterious in these scriptures that i'm going what what's going on here is this a right thing that all of israel accepted an altar being built over there and it's fine because they said it's just going to be an altar of witness so so some of you that are looking at me really strange let's read it so you understand why they built it okay verse 22 verse 21 then the children of reuben and the children of god and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands the lord god of god is the lord god of gods he knoweth in israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day kill us then if we're in rebellion that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or it to for if to offer their burnt offering or meat offering or if it to offer peace offerings therein let the lord himself require it and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye do to do to do with the lord god of israel for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you you children of reuben and children of god ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord therefore he said let us now prepare so first thought is that we're not in rebellion we're doing this not the sacrifice not to worship at this altar but we're doing it as he says in verse 27 here but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings so said we're going to do it as a witness we want something that resembles the true altars because we want to do it as a witness it's verse 27. you see that word witness there but that it might be a witness between us you and our generations after so their thought is the generations after us now i'm not against somebody thinking about the generations after us i think that is a good thing but you got to make sure that you're sending the right message to the generation after you that's right so i mean if you want to study this more and look at i just i keep saying as i said it last wednesday night i should go back my notes and find the way i said it but now they're concerned about later on other children speaking against their children that if there's nothing there to resemble the true altar so they wanted it for that purpose but these parents are not concerned at all of their children coming to them asking them someday dad and mom why in the world did we not go into the promised land why did we settle short of the promise and that question from your kids is going to be a lot harder to answer than the one mom dad these kids were making fun of me today they were saying that we weren't part of the lord and part of this whole thing of jehovah god and they were worried about why they're kids making fun of them that way but they but what about the worry that you've established your whole life short of the promise of god hard set of scriptures to divide but that's the only way i can see it because it wasn't a good thing to stop short of the promise of god for them or for their children i'm encouraging you make the priority the promises of god for you and your children fight the battle every day for the promises of god say i don't feel like i'm hard i don't even feel like i have anything brother paul listen keep fighting the battle for the promises of god because they are your promises you just have to fight for them let your children see you fighting for the promises of god whether it be healing or whatever it is let them see you always focus and say i may not want be what i want to be i may not want be what but i i should be but thank god i'm not what i used to be and i'm headed in one direction and that's going through this promised land taking every promise that i can take amen let your children see that of your life and so they had a good thing uh good intentions they had good intentions but they just wanted to build something that resembled the real thing and what appears to be a good thing for the field future for their children may not and the main reason it's a borderline religion to start with it's not living in god's promise that he promised to give them it's the best way that i can bring it is is is that helpful to see it that way is it helpful to your families to see it that way and you're you raising families it is so crucial that we not make a resemblance to the real thing to our kids but we pray for the real thing amen put your seatbelts on because i'm going to say a few uh strong things here at the end and then hopefully lighten it up i know some of you are saying and you haven't said strong things already so verse 24 i want to look at that and if we have not rather done it for the fear of this thing so look at that word the fear of this thing you know what the purpose was why do we we'll make this alter we're gonna build this so it resembles what the true altar is so that later on when we die that our children there they have something to their resemblance and alder and the other children will and so what's the word though it's fear they're doing it out of fear fear of what other children may say that they would be put down because they have nothing to do with their god how is it that they missed that their decision as parents that kept him out of the promised land let me just say it this way in talking on the subject of fear and all of us do it all of us have made decisions based on one thing and that's fear a lot of times with our kids everyone in this room has done it but any decision based in fear and not faith is not good for the future of our children any decision even putting on religion out of fear any decision based in fear and paul was so strong in the bible he says whatsoever is not of faith is sin because there's only faith and fear whatsoever is not of faith is sin we're called as christians to live by faith thus our decisions must be based upon faith and trust in a god that will provide and a god that will give us the answer in a god that will bring it out and sometimes paul i don't hear a word from the lord i don't know i don't know what to do it well that's when you study everything you pray the best you can you look at your motives you measure your modes and you make the best decision that you make and then you have a trust god will watch out for those decisions but when decisions are based solely on fear you're setting yourself up for trouble and you won't see the results of that right now but most times you'll see it in the future can i get an amen i know you're a little tired tonight i can tell it's the long-term effects by making decisions based upon fear so we could talk a lot more about that but don't make decisions based upon fear you want to make decisions based on faith and from everything i can see they're thinking i complement them for thinking of the future there's not too many people who have a multi-generational vision they only think of today and so yeah parents in the world example the world is that you know they're smoking and drinking and partying and and they're doing all these things and and they have no they don't have no care of the effects that's going to bring on the children someday okay they have no regard for it then you sometimes come in the christian realm and people aren't thinking of a multi-generational vision in other words they're thinking only only today that their actions are just about today and so now but there's a tremendous effect not only on our words but mostly our actions that affect the future generations and we have to be praying about that i wouldn't say worried about it don't be worried i would say sensitive about it praying giving our hearts to god saying lord please direct me and direct my actions so that my children are not affected in the wrong way in the future that unless the best impression we can leave i can tell you i i already did some things when my children are young and i'm alright i'm already paying for them let me be the honest one tonight um i'm already trying to regroup on those things so all of us have done it all of us have said something and it's planted certain seeds and now you can see those things pop up in your kids and you're going oh my goodness what have i done i see that same thing coming out of them and if you're going to own up to it like you should you say you know what most of that came from me whatever it is it's better to be humble about it and own up to it get further along in growing with christ if you own up to your you say i i did that i can see where i contributed if not then it contributed to it so any decision based in fear let's let's not make our decisions as families based in fear but let us follow the lord and make them in faith so now let me say this parents don't build your own version of the word that's really what they did they built and it was even more beautiful they built their own altar there was no sacrifice in that altar and it wasn't even the worship at it just something that's just so it resembles we are not called to build our own version of the word for our family that's right i said we're not called to build our own version of the word for our family convenient just for our family just a little more acceptable to the world to to make it easier on our kids or to teach them to just keep a little religion but minimize the battle and the sacrifice that goes with the holy ghost life i think that's leaving a very wrong impression to your children to take out the battle part and take out the sacrifice part and make it convenient to make this holy ghost field life something that's of convenience no i think that we should teach them reality that's unrealistic to teach it that way and and knowing that it's full of the glories of the lord and overcoming and all these other things but still what goes with it is sacrifice and battle and all these other things and we shouldn't say well just it's good enough just to keep a religion no there's sacrifice that you say christ you christ made the sacrifice maybe you say christ made the sacrifice and so now we no longer have to sacrifice that's not a balanced doctrine christ made the complete and full sacrifice for our sin now either some of you are just zoning out or you're really listening intently but this is a point to divide right now because this is a lot of this stuff is being said around the world on the internet it's finding that thing christ is a christ sacrifice is enough for me it's enough for our sin but you cannot say christ did all the sacrificing for me and so i don't have to make any sacrifices that's not scriptural come on because paul said he said i lay down my life paul said i die daily paul said bring the sacrifice of praise paul said our represent our bodies a living sacrifice we don't die physically but a living sacrifice we die daily to our selfishness self i want things to come out my way i want to be right i always have to be right we have to die to that and that's the type of sacrifices we make as a christian and teach our children this is what we do as believers praise the lord so don't get that in balance because a lot of people someone even said me on the internet the other day my wife just repeated she said it's jesus alone that i need for salvation that's exactly right and so that's what they say is that we have jesus alone that's all we need is jesus alone and his sacrifice that's all we need the message is not essential that's false doctrine the message is not essential for salvation christ's sacrifice is essential for salvation but that doesn't make the message not essential it's still essential as well because it's the message of the last days to bring us back to the restored world but people want to throw some something out and say i want to hold it it's a security to them i'm just holding to this this salvation but god as i said in the beginning has called us to more than just salvation amen he's called us to redemption redemption and adoption and so that's a growth in the lord in the land of the holy ghost how many want to grow in the land of the holy ghost amen so this isn't like someone saying salvation is all i need that's saying that's all the further i want to go with god no that's not all the further we want to go we're in the promised land now we're battling it out every day it's the battle of the mind all the time and these are the things to live and teach in front of our children we're not to make this this an easy battle but let them see as my wife gives that testimony sometimes of her mom watching her struggle for years i don't even know if i'm supposed to say this i know i love my mother-in-law and i know she loves me so i don't think she'll mind she struggled with the temper for years and becca watched that for you struggled with the temper for years and but then she watched something happen in her life and she yielded and she watched she overcome that thing and she's seen the distinct chains as she just kept following the lord and kept exposing herself to the word of god and she seen her overcome that thing and she didn't see manifestations of it like she'd seen before something changed her life now to me when your children see you growing like that that's that's the way it needs to be amen praise god amen that speaks volumes to them because that's the land of the holy ghost praise the lord anybody listening here amen so now sacrifice is definitely a part of it paul said present your bodies but he said don't be conformed to the world present your body as a living sacrifice so let me finish up here with some points i want to make to bring more blessed families how many want to see your family blessed whether it's one or whether it's 10 in your family or where's 19 like the duggars i love the duggars 19 and there's more there's more coming with uh with the grandchildren anything that comes in this world that holds up a standard and the whole world gets a seat on on that weekly thing everybody sees those standards of dress and standards of courtship i don't know what all they believe but i just thank the lord for it that's right and i love it you know when they get on these these shows and there's all 19 of them you know and they're smiling and they're happy and and everybody says how can that be nobody can have that many kids and be sane in their minds but they are i i don't know if i could do it but i praise somebody else that can do it because the whole world says that's impossible that's stupid that's weird no it's not how did i get on the duggar family i don't know whatever your family is one in your family you're blessed tonight 19 in your family you're blessed tonight when you're under god's headship and his rulership you're blessed following the word of god in the promised land so here's some points here's some lessons and i try to bring this thing down to practical things i'm certainly not a perfect father dad husband my kids will be the first to tell you i'm not qualified to explore all the things of families i'm just trying to be a pastor and speak the things in the word of god to make our families under this blessing of abraham that all the families of the earth will be blessed amen and i believe you want to see it that way it isn't healthy for our kids to hear us talk about where we all don't see eye to eye let me just word it this way isn't it unhealthy for our kids to hear us talk about where we all in the body christ don't see eye to eye more than we talk about where we do see eye to eye remember i'm preaching to myself now okay if paul says that we all speak the same thing and that's our goal and we're supposed to be headed to that unity why can't our children see that unity often what's talked about in our families is where everybody don't see eye to eye and do things different and we do that's right we do do things different we do have some differences of opinions opinions are like noses everybody has a different one every house has a different shape some are flat some are big some are big when they're born and they they grow into their nose through the years some are tiny some are pointy some are snotty some are you know there's millions of different types of noses like there's millions of different opinions and as i said a few months ago we don't have a right to lift our opinion as being the standard we're supposed to be here lifting the word of god not our opinions we're not the final authority on anything child rearing whatever it is we're not the final authority we're learning we're learning we're growing that's what the body of christ is grow into the unity grow into all things speak the truth and love so we can grow up into him in all things i ask you tonight are you still growing because if you're not growing something's wrong but we speak the truth in love so we can continue to grow isn't it unhealthy for our kids to hear us talk about what we where we don't see eye to eye more than where we do see eye to eye would not that build more trust and respect and unity if we talked about the things that we do see eye to eye on and pray about the rest that we don't but when that's what is heard then it presents for the future a thing that a young heart says wow isn't anybody on the same page everybody's coming to church and everybody's shaking one of those hands and everybody's worshiping the lord together and praise the lord but of all they hear is that we don't see eye to eye then that's really what they conclude it's hard for them to process all that right and i'm not denying the fact that we don't see eye to eye i'm not i'm not putting my head in the sand and pretending that's not there i'm just saying what do we want to talk about mostly i'm wondering if if things could change if we could talk about more where we do find kindred spirits with one another where we do kind of agree and then we could probably build better things to where we could get to the place we could talk about where we don't disagree without it it being detrimental that's right and you can apply this in a family too say for example uh you went to college and you learned administrative skills and leadership skills and so now you talked about that to your kids and i'm using an example that i've never heard in 25 years of pastoring so don't sit there and say he's talking about me it's not true this is i i tried to think so you had all these leadership skills you've studied it all and you can see after a few years of being in my church brother paul does not have very good administrative skills and you tell that to your kid you just said you know he just he's not running things like he could be running him and guess what you're you'd be right you're right i'll be the first to admit it i i have leadership skills and i'm a leader but i don't always administratively do it uh like everybody wants it to be done and i'm not a professional ed i didn't go to school for leadership skills and so but that's the impression that gives i got a question for you if that kid stays in my church now how are they going to trust me in my administrative decisions you see and so and and you know what we could ultimately say here that this isn't based upon professional leadership skills to run a church it's leaning on the holy ghost to lead the church so i don't care what you learned on all the books i read some of the books too okay but when i come here i'm not trying to incorporate all these leadership people get so disappointed i read all these leadership things and we should be doing this and should we do it what we should be doing is praying for the holy ghost to lead us and it's not that we can't have some form and some type of thing but if we get too technical about it everybody's going to get disappointed and what we all need to say is that we don't want another system or another program or another thing that's influenced by the wisdom of the world we need the holy ghost to lead the church we need the holy ghost to lead the pastor we need humility in the pastor we need humility in the people we need people in positions with humility from the pastor all the way down to the janitor amen and that's when it'll work and i'm not saying it hasn't worked i'll tell you every time you have that it does work but you have to keep your humility you have to keep that this isn't about trying to impress anybody can you hear my heart tonight amen what does that say to the next generation if that impresses that mind do you feel the next generation have trust in me or any man for that matter number two is it healthy to teach children unrealistic things about christianity like for example you have to figure it out before you believe it that's not true that's right i think we should teach our children that we pray for revelation understanding all the time because we need that kind of understanding but we should never teach them that you don't have to believe it until you fully can figure it out that's not biblical that's right that may be worldly but that's not biblical and you're you're misleading people if you say things like that it's unhealthy to teach unrealistic things about christianity the baptism of holy ghost that's that's fanatical you don't need to go overboard with it like some people go overboard and just you know we don't need that and we don't need all this screaming and all these just make sure you balance that out by teaching your children that every birth is a mess and if it's not somewhat of a mess then it's kind of a stillborn birth that's what the word of god teaches us so don't eliminate those things teach them there's no battle there's no fight to this it's easy kind of just blend in there's no sacrifices that we we make already read scripture on that and brother brown says how wishy-washy that's too many christians today so soft-soaked and everything until they think all they do is join church or go somewhere put their name on the book or do a little something jump up and down shout or something like that and call that christianity he said let me let me know what let me let you know what christianity is christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world and that's what we should teach our kids christianity you want to be a christian christianity is a rugged life a rugged everyday rugged life living for god in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to christ because you don't have to mechanically do that if you're on fire for god you're going to draw ones that are hungry for god so it's not if you're trying to make a convert mechanically it's that you're going to draw people and say wow pray i got an open ear here i'm going to witness to him and that brings conference to christ i'm describing by the prophet what christianity is and it's not some easy part that we go to can you say man it's it's not baby setting can you say man it's not this baby hood christianity is a rugged everyday life living for god in this present world amen can i get a louder amen than that amen let's not soft soap christianity to our kids let's not smooth it over and make it a little bit more convenient for them all them that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution oh i gotta shield my kids from all this persecution no let them be a holy ghost-filled christian and with the holy ghost they can withstand the persecution just like paul and the apostles did because it's the same holy ghost that we want in our kids that was in paul and peter that they would be hung if they didn't if they if they denied christ they could get out of being hung and all the other things what got him through the holy ghost you're gonna tell me the same holy ghost in that young person can't stand somebody making fun of them come on now when we got saints of god that had the same holy ghost and stood there and said you can cut my head off if you want to i will not deny jesus christ amen i pledge allegiance to the lamb it's the same holy ghost and it'll get your kid through that public school it'll get your kid through that college that's why we have to pray they become filled with the same holy spirit amen praise be to god that's what it is burning with the fire and the love of god that's christianity a constant burning of the fire and love of god in our hearts it sets you on fire and puts you out yonder with the people making converts to christ we should teach that everybody in the church just needs to live their own life by their own convictions now i know if you have a conviction of the word it's something god gave you that's true but we shouldn't teach the principle that everybody in the church just should live their own life and live by their own convictions it's not biblical never have unity that way shouldn't teach as long as you believe the message you're okay as long as you dress right and wear all the right clothes in the message you're okay that's misleading your kids that's right just because you're going to a message church you're okay and you're going to the rapture that's a deception you're deceiving your kids if you just wear dresses you'll be you'll be fine that's a deception there's so much more to it than that amen shouldn't teach them these things can you say amen and on the other side we shouldn't teach in that we don't have to obey anything that's another authority that tells is telling us what to do that's not scriptural because if you read your bible god allows authorities and he has delegated authorities even worldly bosses and worldly men can be god's delegated authority in your life and you're to bring yourself subject to it unless they tell you to do something that's not in the word you bring your life under that authority you'll teach your kids no nobody tells me what to do no authority i'll leave that to they're leaving job after job every job because they've been taught they don't have to listen to anybody in authority that's right that's not biblical right not at all so from the pastor and from the father from the father the pastor whatever authorities are placed in their life we teach them what we bring our lives under that authority and god will bless us for that we don't teach that we don't have to do that we don't have to be under that or listen to somebody who's telling us what to do we don't teach that if you're tired and you don't feel like it you don't need to make an effort to go to church whether that's taught or caught it's a wrong principle to teach however you feel that's how you base whether you come to church and i don't think that's a good thing to teach if you got a bad spirit i don't want to go because i got a really bad spirit and i it'll affect everybody if i'm i'm saying that okay that's what i did here years ago i did hear that and i've heard it several times through the years i didn't want to come because i'm got such a bad spirit on me that i i just feel like i'm going to affect everybody else and they can have a better service if i'm not there no if you got a bad spirit come on and we'll take care of you that's right you know i'm not saying this to down anybody i'm saying this in relation to blessed families i'm talking about tonight i'm talking about a multi-generational generation coming in the future multi-generational uh vision that these things that are not so much taught but caught will be carried on and sometimes in more extremes in our children i think we should use this text tonight as i close to take a good look at the position that these tribes took and the long-term effects that it had on their families i think it's wonderful to make the promise of god the center of our family's life amen that's good i think that's what we should do not other things but the promise of god not money and not careers do all that but let them kids know that the family know the center of our life is christ the word everything revolves around that and his promises and we want to live in and fight for those promises amen and and to leave the impression and teach them that having the true baptism of the holy ghost and growing into the unity of the faith with the body is the most important thing in life everything else is secondary if you think i'm a weirdo tonight then that's fine you have a right to your opinion but i think for christian families this should be the priority this should be the priority growing into the unity of the faith with the rest of the body is the most important thing in life everything else is secondary to that that we're not a child-centered family how many's ever met a family that's child-centered something that child can be two years old and life's decisions always made in relation to that two-year-old that's not good it's not so good or if it's not a two-year they get to be teenagers and they're the cat's meow that's them that's it and so everything revolves around life it's a teenager centered family and the teenagers pick up on that after a while no in humility we teach them this isn't centered around you this isn't centered around me it's sitting around christ the word amen and that's the influence of our decisions that's the main hub that turns everything in this family not mom's emotions or not dad's emotions or not that teenager's emotions sometimes emotions can be the center of the family and it's controlling everything that happens by the emotions up and down and sometimes men's emotions go up and down but not as often as women's emotions go up depending on a lot of factors but teenage girls and teenage boys i never thought that would happen to me i thought it was going to be girls but man since they're not here tonight they're on the way to tennessee with the townsends for the weekend and i can say i never discovered that boys teenage boys can be just as emotional sometimes as girls isn't that terrible to say when they're not here it's terrible and they're you know they're growing out of some of that but you don't rearrange your whole life just to save their emotions you know brother eugene told me something the other night and he says because of my nature he says i bucked against my dad when i was young in a lot of ways but he says my dad was used to teach me that you can't have an emotionally driven life because he said i would lean that way he said i didn't realize that 12 years old so one of the first lessons he said they had a bunch of dogs on the farm and there was this one dog that was influencing the other dogs and being a being a bad influence on the other ones it was it was a you know just just and after a few months eugene knew it he's 12 years old his dad could brought him in and talk to him you see what that dog's doing he said yeah dad i see it he said you see how this is happening i see it i see he said you know what's going to happen though you said no he said that dog's got to go that dog's going to go he said yeah the dog's gotta go he said well you go get the gun and you shoot him that was a different story because he loved that dog and so he did it he says i cried the whole time he said i took that gun he said i had to shoot that dog's the last thing in the world i wanted to have to do he said but you know 20 30 years later he realized his dad was teaching him that life isn't always controlled by emotions sometimes you got to do what you got to do and those little lessons sometimes that god uses in our life to teach us don't get so unemotional and so detached that you have no feeling for anybody and you're carrying a gun around please don't do that the bible says to be tenderly affectionate towards one another just keep a balance but we don't want a child centered life we don't want a home that's centered on money we don't want a home that's centered on some other objective we want a christ-centered home that's the hub that's what everybody looks to that's what influences the decisions you make daddy's went to prayer about things daddy is is consulting the lord and the word about his decision that he has to make no decisions are made too hastily or too quickly without prayer without considering the lord without even calling some other older people to get some input a lot of people don't believe in that today i believe it is there's big decisions in our lives i'm going to call and ask some other older brothers and sisters and say what do you think it met a few months ago with all the older ones took them out to dinner in the church and i said to them hey how am i doing what's my report card is there anything that you can see that you want to give input on why because they're the elders of the gray hair of our church i'm i'm still very young but i was i want to submit my why are you laughing jared i want to submit myself to the older ones like that to their counsel i don't want to make too hasty of decisions which i have made without input so what's my report card how am i doing as a pastor how's the church doing what do you think could be changed what would you do that's submission amen i can i can say that the lord would speak through people like that now some people think no the lord can't speak through anybody there i get it directly from god i can tell you the lord can speak through other members of the body of christ if we'll be humble about it we can learn and be teachable and learn things from other people but god would speak through i've taken too long tonight let's stand together if you would blessed families praise the lord heavy heavy tonight i believe the next one subject we got coming up the next blessed family subject is going to be a bit lighter so praise the lord for that but we could all examine our lives tonight we could all say lord help me to be a better follower of christ in the sense that we don't want to make our own little concoction of a new altar in our lives but we want to worship at the true altar of god and i had it in here but i i didn't i didn't find it in my notes but i had sent something in there is that we we don't want to present something that resembles the things of the message and things of god we want our children to have the real thing that's right and often we try to get something that resembles it but we want them to have the reality of this person of jesus christ we want that in our lives father we thank you tonight we pray that you will anoint our words as they go and the examples and the the heart lord and my motive i pray that you just anoint that to the people that they could in the coming months lord changes could be made by the holy ghost and that we could be as paul who said endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit with lowliness of mind loneliness and humility contriteness and brokenness lord that you would continue to work through those channels and those things that we could learn to be a people that really are inherent in your promises father we thank you that you can speak to us this way lord and we pray that you will bring the fruit in our lives of your word we pray if anything i said lord has been offensive or something out of place we ask now for your forgiveness we don't intend that lord but nevertheless if we have we ask you to forgive us we just pause a minute to ask you as the saints tonight how many would raise your hand in response may the lord just give me the wisdom to be able to be the christian that i should be and also to lead my family and be an influence on my family and the church that i want to be amen thank you lord bless them father bless those that are raising their hand even in the streaming tonight you know their desire and lord you thankfully you look at our desires not so much just our actions all the time we have to repent of our actions sometimes but lord you look at our desire lord i believe everyone here tonight has that right pure desire i want to follow what the word of god says and i want my family to be blessed by it help us lord those who don't are lacking what they need i know you'll feel it and you'll edify it through the body of christ and through the word thank you father we just commit this evening to you and your word that has been spoken in the name of jesus christ amen i pledge allegiance to the land with all my strength i bless they were foreign hello
