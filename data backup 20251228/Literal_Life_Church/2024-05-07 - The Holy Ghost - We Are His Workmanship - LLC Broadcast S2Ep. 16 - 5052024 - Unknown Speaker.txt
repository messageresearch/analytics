the hope to which I cling a firm found fir Foundation my God you are [Music] found my God you are of foundation my God you are Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God there is nothing that we contribute when it comes to the gift of Salvation And the gift of the Holy Ghost there's nothing that we contribute it's a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast that's why God has set it up this way because if we had a part in it then we would boast and we would take our part and probably glory in that but it's not of any of our works that we receive any of this from God anything that God does in us whether it's salvation or whether it's whether it's uh sanctification or whether it's he uh blesses us in a certain whatever it is the Holy Ghost it all is a gift of God and it's not by our works at all how many know that for we are his workmanship you're not your own workmanship you're not working on yourself when you come into the kingdom of God in his presence you have to know we are completely his workmanship from day one until he finishes the the work and how many know the scripture he he who hath begun a good work will he's the one that will finish it so he is he he is the one that's T that that that has all of this we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus un good works so this is not just a a Reformation this is not just m god making you better this is a creation we are created in how many know that Jesus is a Creator how many know he created the heavens and the Earth the same creator that created the heavens and the Earth is creating something in you you are his new creation so you the reason I keep emphasizing this before I even preach this morning is that we've got to see that we are his workmanship and we are his creation and what he does is not just a little work it's actually him creating something in you the creator has come into your life and he's creating and anything good that comes out of you that's of God he created it in you looks at it a different way for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them and anybody says there's no truth to predestination it's all through the Bible it's right there that we have been ordained before the foundation of the world world that we should walk in the manifestation of Christ on this Earth but it's not because of your works it's not because of you getting better it's not because your own efforts it's because he's creating in you what he's going to do we are his workmanship now the last time we ministered we talked about the Holy Ghost a little bit and I'm going to continue that series and uh we laid a foundation in speaking about the Holy Ghost uh called the Simplicity of Christ Paul said I fear that your minds would be corrupted from the Simplicity of Christ and so I I laid that Foundation I'll just have a little bit more of that today because that's before we talk about the Holy Ghost what is it how do we know that we have it before we get into those things I I I want us I wanted to speak about the Simplicity of Christ because the enemy takes something so precious as this and he wants to confuse it more than any other doctrinal subject he like to confuse this because because this is your experience this is this is your uh walk with God this is the reason you have a walk with God is because the Holy Ghost comes into your life and so if he can mess that up he wants to do it but I wanted to simp so in my series on the Holy Ghost that's my foundation and effort to simplify it so even the youngest child can understand it because the devil has complicated it may God help me to to bring it that this the youngest child could understand it the Simplicity that's in Jesus Jesus Christ so it's really this that there is a promise of God I want to simplify it there is a promise of God given for your life to give you his Spirit within you the power of God for this life and to transfor transport you into the next life so I want to say it again there's a promise of God given for your life to give you his Spirit within you which is the power of God for this life to live in this life and then to transport you into the next life guess what it's not any more complicated than what I just said sir should I say it again go ahead there's a promise it's your promise it's a promise God has given for your life that he would put his Spirit within you and that will be the power of God for this life and the power to get us in the life to come it's not any more complicated than that amen can you say Amen amen so you know when you when you speak about the Holy Ghost then you you realize the world has messed up the term even ghost would be scary because the world is messed it up and we realize that that's not the way we look at when the scripture says the Holy Ghost people uh don't know the real meaning of it the church the churches today and the the new Bibles that are written they tend to lose the Ghost part and they call it the Holy Spirit which is the same thing but they like to lose the Ghost part because that's too scary for kids and that's just to it doesn't fit in our culture I like to use the Bible terms it's just if you don't understand it and and so you could say if you read Webster's Dictionary it says this the ghost is the spirit of a dead man well that's his his thing but you see if you're more specific about the meaning of ghost it's the spirit of a living person without a flesh body so that's why it's termed the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of a person that's living can you say Amen that is doesn't have a bot form but is able to come in another bodily form by pouring himself into the people so that's why it's called the Holy Ghost the Holy One of Israel the Holy One of God the the person of Jesus Christ so this Holy Ghost is a person it's it's a living person it's the holy person of Christ the word that came out from God in the beginning uh uh and wherever you see God like for example in the Old Testament whenever you see God and he moves on the situation and most of all he moves on prophets to speak the word because the the the person of Christ is the word can you say man he came out in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God it was the word the logos that came out of God and then we see them throughout him throughout history in the Old Testament moving upon the prophets there's a scripture that says holy men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost so back there it was the Holy Ghost and it always always moved into the prophet for that age to speak the word for the age so remember something about the Holy Ghost it'll never work outside of the word for the age it is sent to make alive the word for the age and to make it live in the people that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for so that's why you see them in the Old Testament with all the prophets and there they are and God moves on them by the Holy Ghost to speak that word for their age this is what the term the holy ghost means when every you see God in the Old Testament you see that person of Christ working there to bring his word to pass for that age but in the New Testament that person was not just to anoint prophets but to set Abode in the soul of man or of a woman and guess what he did it he fulfilled it the same holy ghost that moved upon prophets in the Old Testament now it moves to the New Covenant it would not be just anointing them to speak the word it would not be just a h uh making uh David shout and dance the way he did it wouldn't just be something outward but he would move now into the very Soul the control tower of man that same Holy Ghost would move to a different thing and why could he come into your soul because Calvary had come because if you were born with the nature you're born with the Holy Ghost couldn't sit there it's too holy can you say man there was no way that the Holy Ghost could sit at your soul level you were born in sin can you say im you had the the the nature of the serpent from the beginning you were born with that but if he could go to Calvary and and do away with sin and a person receives it then you make a place for the spirit of God himself the Holy Ghost to dwell in your life that's what the Holy Ghost is and so now in the New Testament he sets his Abode in the soul of man or woman and he did it and guess what he still doing it that's why I say this morning to everyone including the young people it's something you should never be afraid of it's the greatest priority in life that you seek and you say God I want this promise for me I see it in my pastor I see it in my parents but I want it for me most important thing in your life more important than jobs and money and career and marrying a wife or husband it's more important than anything that you say Lord this promise is for me praise the lord it's a promise that he will live in you and when a heart says I see it I'm asking for it I'm seeking it that promise is mine too I see that it's for me and then he gives it it it's you know friends it's not any more complicated than what I just said a heart says I see it I want it it's my promise I'll receive it and he's more willing to give it to you than you're even willing can you say amen and he says I'll come to a heart like that I'll draw a heart like that I'll come to that heart that's open he doesn't want to complicate this experience of the Holy Ghost it's man that's complicated it but we learn that Satan is the author of confusion and especially confusing the Holy Ghost to take the simple things of God and do all that he can to keep people from it so be and you got to realize also about Satan that he has a history of when he knows something's coming to try to stop it he he steps out in front of it and particularly at times when a birth was coming a very important birth Moses birth was very important so now he moves upon pharaoh to kill all the children you got to look at Satan's nature and that is I'm gonna I want to be there at the point of birth I'd like to stop it I'd like to confuse it I'd like to disrupt it he would love to stop it at the point of birth that I can con refuse that person or that I can kill and so at the that birth of Moses and the birth of Jesus Christ this is what Satan did at the point of birth at the moment of birth he's trying to stop it I would say his nature is the same way today and that's why there's a confusion about the experience of the Lord and a true experience of connecting with him that God baptizes you with his spirit and your desires are changed from the things of the world to the things of God and you love the word I the greatest evidence in my life has been I love the word of God I have no resistance in my soul to any of the word of God and I got that because it's 16 years old he replaced it with a serpent nature what's the serpent nature it wants to serve the world but it also wants to worship its own way Cain wanted to worship but he wanted to worship God his own way when you're born with that many of you want to worship but you want to do it your own way most of the church world are worshiping God their own way a lot of the music is C worship it's worshiping the way they want to worship I'm going to sing about the cross but I'm going to live any way I want to live I'm going to have my tattoos in my earrings I'm going to blast out the rock and roll can you say Amen because it's Cain worship but God when he brings a new birth old things pass away All Things become new and we're not manifesting the world anymore we're man manes in Christ Satan is confusing it he tries to stop it at the moment of birth then to try to copy so if he can't stop it at the new birth then he we then you try to uh he tries to copy or imitate the manifestations of the Holy Ghost and tries to copy the gifts tries to point us to a sign or a gift or an emotion as the evidence and to get people to trust in the wrong thing avoiding the real New Birth avoiding uh the the real change people gravitate towards the Manifest inations of the Holy Ghost rather than the Holy Ghost himself as a person coming into your life that becomes confusion as well the confusion that he points the people to depend on a sign or to bend on a gift or depend on an emotion as an evidence that you personally have it all those things are manifestations of the Holy Ghost and we see them but they're not to be used as an evidence that you have it and so this creates confusion when I go into this series I want to show you when he the Holy G ghost be descends upon a generation there's a lot of things that God will do but there's there's few in there that's actually getting what the Holy Ghost was sent for it's on the inside people gravitating to what the Holy Ghost is doing on the outside but remember I said a couple Sundays ago I was saying that it's from the inside out God's work God works so the real there's a there's a reference to the Holy Spirit when Jesus said in the last day of the feast I don't have it in front of me but in the last day of the feast he says he said the the the spirit will come and he says out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so that that uh word picture is something coming from the inside of you going out and then the next scripture says this is referring to the spirit when it comes so when the spirit comes it's actually going to be a work I know know it says they were in the upper room and they all filled with the Holy Ghost because they emptied out but really what's intended to do is it's going to work from the inside out not the outside in and so that which is down there will like be like a rivers of living water flowing from your in innermost being so now we have a distinction it's on the inside so we have to be grown up we have to be mature in the Lord to realize the evidence of the Holy Ghost really in a person's life is not something they're graving gravitating or something out the outside but it's something that's coming from the inside out not the outside in and that's why he says it's the inside it's the inside we will go through that at length at at another time because when the Holy Ghost begins to move many people in fact I'm going to read to you when we get to it I'm going to read to you the first time the Holy Ghost begins to be mentioned in the Book of Matthew and that's the B it's at the conception of Jesus Christ he starts using the term and so uh Simeon and Hannah and uh Joseph receives a dream and he tells him what's conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so that's the first time we hear the term mentioned and it's around it's around the birth of Christ it says something so it's it's not coming just to anoint a prophet now it's not coming to give a feeling now it's coming specifically to bring that conception to bring forth the word and so now but you'll have people affected people having dreams people being shown by the Holy Ghost it says he was shown by the Holy Ghost this is the Messiah the Holy Ghost showed him that so but you see now everybody was receiving some of the benefits of the Holy Ghost coming in that era and that time but only one person is conceiving the Holy Ghost Inside them so the Holy Ghost can do a lot of effect people can feel better after a service even like this people can feel better just by being being in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost people can have dreams people can they can have a lot of things can be done but in that day it was only Mary that had the depth of the Holy Ghost conceiving a new life Christ within her so now we draw a distinction because that's going to come from the inside out that's not going to be see she's trying to produce something that's going to be that a life started within her a new life is growing within her everybody still awake and she couldn't stop it and it was without sensation she wasn't with a man it wasn't carnal wasn't a sexual experience it was the Holy Ghost without sensation she didn't feel anything she just said Let It Be unto me according to Thy word bang something she didn't feel any of it but a conception started a new life was in her now after a few months as some of her sisters being pregnant then you start to see wow there's another life growing within her that's why I say about the Holy Ghost sometimes you wait to see the fruit from it you wait to see the life that comes see if the desires are changed because you can tell you couldn't tell anything was changed with with Mary until it started to grow she realized the baby starts kicking all these things begin to happen and you realize there's been a change because there's a new life that's growing inside me praise the Lord now we're talking what the Holy Ghost really wants to do from the inside out a new life Christ being formed in you that's the Holy Ghost Beyond an emotion Beyond enjoying the benefits you can be around a congregation and enjoy the benefits for your children and families just by being around the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but do you have it for yourself is New Life conceived in you and is it growing when you have a new life inside of you how can you tell something's happening with a mom sometimes that something's different she gets cravings for things and Foods she never had cravings for before you will get a craving for the word of God like never before I never had this before I crave I want to be there at church I want to hear I want to get in my Bible it's an Evidence something has changed I want it for myself I want to be fed by this word yes and the and the Cravings come and you have to go sometimes at 3: in the morning and get that wife what she needs my fir the first baby with Beck and I was Seafood all the time seafood seafood we don't do that anymore but with that baby she craved Seafood so we were at Red Lobster all the time feel like I should own stock in Red Lobster I should have every baby had a different craving some of them I like some of them I didn't like I think it was it was Solomon or Gideon there and the craving was hot fudge cake at Big Boy I love that one that was awesome even if it was 3 in the morning it tasted great we went we're going cuz she couldn't finish all of it so we'll get back to that a little bit on the inside but I want to uh start wrapping it up just on this point he said all the father have given will come predestination clears confusion of the Holy Ghost it should and that is his sons and daughters will come now see we we have to take a rest in that not a rest that we could become lazy to seek the Holy Ghost but AR rest that all the father has already given will come God prepares the heart to receive the Holy Ghost this isn't a mechanical thing of our own works but we are his workmanship I'm glad this morning that I'm his workmanship and if I'm under the Potter's hand why are we so worried about what we don't have why are we so afraid of what we're lacking if I'm under his workmanship he will create in me what is needed I'm under the Creator lift up Christ and he said I'll draw all men unto me it's in everyone's own time can you say Amen what the worst case is God's Not drawing that person yet the worst case is to force that person to try to mechanically do something we encourage them we tell them what they need in their lives if their life is just full of all kinds of messing around with sin and porn and and and you you tell them as a pastor you need something you need the holy ghost in your life but never to force them because if that heart's not drawn by God they're not ready but I do believe if they'll begin to say Lord and ask say Lord I know I need this if they'll begin to say that God's all over it if we know the Lord is in our lives drawing our hearts if this morning I just want to simplify this and say if you've got a calling if you got something down there that's still drawing you and saying I need need more of God you should raise your hand and say thank God that I have that a lot of you you shouldn't be here things have happened in your you've have lost loved ones and all that and yet and you've had struggles and you've questioned God and you've questioned why did this happen I I I Pastor you I know some of those things and it's sometimes it can be so real the devil can really get you off track is this worth it all these other thoughts come all that but listen let's try to let's try to look at what God is doing in our lives that there's some reason that something deep down is reson and saying I know that I can't ever leave Christ and if you're in the hands of the Creator his workmanship I bet none of us in this church this morning could deny and say I I'm not under the hand of God I'm under the his work I bet everybody could raise your hand and say I believe that I'm under his workmanship and if he's in charge if he's under if he's in charge of molding your life then everything you lack you just offer a heart before God you just say Lord whatever Brother Paul's preaching on the holy ghost or any other subject Lord if I need that God please bring it to me make contact with me thank you for watching our message
