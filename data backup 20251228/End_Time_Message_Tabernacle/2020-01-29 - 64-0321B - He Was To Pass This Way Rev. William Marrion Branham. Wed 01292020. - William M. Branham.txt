opportunity by God bless you Javanese it's less than an hour see mind you never realized you leave that up would not that's man that love ya all bringing the book of st. Luke the nineteenth chapter I want to read just a portion of the scripture the first five verses and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and the whole there was a man named Zacchaeus which had was the chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and he could not for the press because he was little of statue and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to seen for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and studied him Zacchaeus make haste come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it all murmured sin that he was going to be the guest of a man which was a sinner zach is stood and said unto the Lord the Oh Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore am fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house or so much as he also is a son of Abraham for the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost as praying our Heavenly Father we are grateful to thee this morning the closet you are still seeking to save the sons of Abraham that which is lost we pray Heavenly Father that you will receive our humble prayer and bless our gathering together here today and may it not be in vain but may the great Holy Spirit teach us the way of life knowing this that we must stand in his presence some day to give an account of what we've done with this life blessed us together now as we further await on thee in Jesus name Amen I am sure happy to have good friends people who believe and believe the efforts that you're trying to put forth I had any other objective just merely to be different why I would be a real sinner but my objective is to magnify Jesus Christ and something that's in a man when you have a message from God you cannot stop yourself there's something in you pulsating it goes on anyhow you can't slow it up stop it or start it it stops and starts and slows up you see it's the one that has control thanks fine brethren for their testimony of our Lord Jesus they wouldn't speaking of me of course on him I was reading a little article here not long ago about mr. moody said Chicago was colder newspapers go write an editorial on me and they scented him someone happened to find out why people gathered to hear it mr. Moody the editorial mr. moody is like myself he didn't have enough education to read the editorials so his manager had to read it mr. moody was a shoe cobbler formerly and he was called of God for a message of his an hour and so the manager was reading the editorial that said why would anybody go to here the white moody said in the first place he's a ugliest man I ever seen and said he's bald-headed and long whiskers and so forth and said and he he whines when he talks his grammars worst I ever heard and and always just carrying on like that and said mr. Moody just shook his shorts that's certainly not to come to see Christ so that's it I think that's us the answer it's Christ that we want to see if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me I was thinking extra visiting here in them the city and finding it the people how nicely been what a nice meeting we're having him here at the Denham Springs High School or School Auditorium I was thinking that people here something like the coffee it's a not quantity but it's quality a lot more uncut I remember my first time landing at the airport out here the brothers coming to get me sitting here and a little french girl there I asked for a hamburger a cup of coffee I never drink it to all that was 38 years old all to know better but and brother brown oh yes he's here this morning somewhere who's sitting right here you like it so well he got me I'd have a minister Oh breakfast at 7 o'clock one at eight o'clock one at nine o'clock you couldn't eat all that so they pour coffee and I got this occipital got to drink so I asked this girl before I want a hamburger in a cup of coffee when they brought the little cup out of my my shirt ID on her coffee right the first drink first swallow I took all my had to fight for bread the lanes that you must be a Yankee she's gonna be a Yankee catcher so that's why behind the people maybe not the greatest crowds I've ever spoke to but real genuine quality I'm grateful for them a listening audience somebody who sets and pays attention and what you're saying what's what I want you to do examine what a man says for the word of God and if it isn't right than it isn't right that's all if it is the word of God then God's got to testify his word cause he promised to so that's why we like to examine these things too to find out I understood this morning and this was a be a business man's breakfast and for gospel businessman which I'm a member of their chapter think this they said some of them was here some of them didn't get out maybe their business man he got their business he had to tend to go to give him excuse anything so that's how I said many of their people were here anyhow so that's very funny not just a little joke I've told it but maybe it's not a place to joke of course it's just a little sense of humor you talk like we've been a while ago it maybe get people back on some sense of humor I remember one time the friend and I were school together it was Wilmer Snyder's brothers a Baptist minister knee he writes in this Upper Room a column in the upper room we were schoolboys together not studied the ministry and he had become an insurance agent and so uh he come to my house one day to visit me and maybe some insurance agents shared hypotheses about insurance now I don't think wrong with this but it catched a little hang of what I said it so my brother also is has the Prudential and he sells Prudential Insurance so one time I had a little something done by surance company that I'm I guess not knowing very much I I read the policy took me wrong and it's misrepresented to me and I just never did take it out so one day Wilmer come up to see me he said I get long Billy I said fine so here he's been out in the meetings I said yes time out means I was telling him about a fella said it me and said say you're a preacher what are you doing hanging around these businessmen I said I am a businessman and they said oh my business union I said assurance business and saying didn't get it I understand insurance I said uh sure assurance business I want the what insurance do you sell I said I sell eternal life for sure and I'm still selling so on I'd be in if any of you interested I like to talk to policy with you and the medium it's all right so he he said he said I eternal life said I don't mean by ever heard of the company I saw you know it's an old establishment he said where's the headquarters that's nothing glory Wilbur said to me he said Billy I thought I'd come up sell you some insurance that I hear that they don't have any insurance and I said oh yes I have assurance oh I'm sorry I guess your brother you have it with him I said no not exactly then my wide looking isn't that what you must be telling a story shioda didn't have any insurance but she did you later I said assurance I'm not insurance he said what in Kjersti aunt Billie I said blessed assurance Jesus is mine all what a foretaste of glory divine I'm an heir of salvation purchase of God born down his spirit washed in his blood he said Billy that's very nice that's very nice nothing against that but so that will punch if you're in this graveyard you're going I said he'll get me I'm not bothered by getting in is getting out so this is only under we'll get you out so if you're interesting getting out let us talk to you about it looking up on the audience this morning I won't keep you just a little bit and I've had a text let's go to preach from so then I oh wow they're not do that I just go to have a little drama of something in a character in the Bible and thinking hero under serious manners but while we're sitting here as Christians I suppose most of us did you know this may be the last time they will ever eat breakfast together did you ever think of that and you realize what little words that I have to stay here God's gonna make me answer fart out there at the day of judgment now I have soul journal nerves a smaller group but yet I have it's the word did I say I have to answer for them out there so we may never eat another breakfast together but I hope we get a separate again Sunday that's the light supper tea up there with him it'll be the first one there and then as we set here this morning and look up on these man here some of them great ministers who studied and me here just Bushmen come out no education set your man is qualified to preach and doctors in divinity feel very little stand tall or man like then but yeah I got to express what I feel and their great gratitude and kindness to let me stand and do this I appreciated brothers cooperating in the meeting and getting together I'm here to help you I'm going to do everything I can for each one of you by the grace of God man once all over some me I don't get to eat breakfast with you again it's all over studying across the table for one another no doubt what little tears run down our cheeks look across the table and get each other to the hand it means something named s work was time to work while the Sun's up it'll be down a tree logs getting very low then to think that while we're sitting here holding each other's hands and waiting a little then the great king you come out all of his great rollers come down along the line wipe all tears away Ferran says well done my good and faithful servants entering to the joys of the Lord has been prepared for you since the foundation of the world while the Sun's up it's light enough to labor that's labor now this little texture may seem kinda ridiculous but we're going to talk on this subject he was to pass this way it must have been a an awful night on the little fella he couldn't sleep at all it is rolled and tossed all night long he's breaking day and we all know what those restless nights mean it can't sleep got someone you're not or something he's got your nerves all upset this little fellow was a business man maybe in a city Jericho which is something like you businessmen and women here and he he no doubt had a growing business he's stood in good with all the clubs and so forth and was a member of the church Sanhedrin Council and had a fine priest and he believed this priest and a strange thing about this case always his wife will color Rebecca she had strayed off on the wrong side he thought so did the priest she was following a man that was supposed to be a prophet of Nazareth man named Jesus for the people the poor class of people believed him to be a prophet our Messiah that was promised but it didn't meet just the qualifications of the Sanhedrin strange sometimes God does things all of the color we think it ought to be in this fella you see was born to their opinion illegitimate birth his mother gave birth to him before her and her husband was married another thing he had no schooling it had no record he ever going to school he was not a priest it was he a rabbi he just had claims like of his own but a Don's a great estate this morning it was a turning the corner they didn't recognize it it usually happens that way come to that corner time but somehow another his wife had been persuaded that he was that prophet that was to come and she had followed him believing and she tried to tell her husband but he was so carried away in his business and with the Blanca Church isn't that good enough something like the rich young ruler you know he had a business also but he realized and he was a member the church but he didn't have eternal life and he has he's seen something in Jesus that other man didn't have and he said come to him and said I'd you wanted to know what he could do to have eternal lines and Jesus told him keep the commandments he said I've done this fence it was he used since showing he was a believer but he knew that Jesus had something that those priests and rabbis didn't have and when a man ever comes in contact with Jesus Christ he's different from me you're never the same when he once seen if there's any spark of God about you so Rebecca had found this Jesus and he he was to her exactly the full filling of the promise that the Jews had been looking for or their day so the news that got around that he was going to have a breakfast or some kind of a dinner or something down in Jericho so it she had got busy to bring about her businessmen husband we need more Rebecca's everywhere and so you see prayer changes things if you lay your husband or your unsaved one before God and then pray God will make a way somewhere cause he promised to so that's what Rebecca being a staunch believer and a follower of the Lord Jesus and a very fine sweet person she must have been she had interested in her household I think if that reflects again that if a person every meets Jesus and finds him really in your heart you're interested not only in your own household but the household of God everywhere you're interested if they know me and to know him is life know him you not know how to read the word or so but know him his life so she prayed hard and that they grew close to when Jesus was forced to enter the city no doubt but the day before she might have seen if his attitude to change Danny so she said maybe Zacchaeus are are you going to that breakfast in the morning why certainly not while that bunch of people would you respect me I've got the best restaurant in town they hold it over the Vince keys I hope there's not a Levinsky here but then anyhow over the other places seeing why I got the best place in town they picked that place down there where they ought to come to my place the whole this he wasn't going then she got the brain really desperately so then that night the little fella couldn't rest at all you know is something about it if you go to really desperately praying about something God works on both ends no [Music] answers so the little fella must have got to thinking that night wonder if I should go down and and and hear this man now Rebecca says that he's a prophet now we know we haven't had meat prophets for hundreds of years and I asked the priest that body said nothing but just the nonsense if there be a prophet raised up when we come through the church that's the way it had to come he had come to us Pharisees badges Caesar our group rate wouldn't be a problem you know that attitude still holds so they think it has to come that way or isn't right so they said holdout in this great time and she believed it anyhow he discussed it with the priest the priest sent up here damn days of profits have been many many years ago we've got the law we've got the whole Road out The Situation's under control and we got in our hands and we know about these things but then scores Zacchaeus not looking into it just absolutely just pursue me taking it for granted the word pursue mr. venture without authority well he he thought that that was all right as long as he's going to the church that's all he had to do but then his night begin to come on there come a sudden desire in his heart maybe if this person is in town he may never be here again I should go and investigate that the situation see for myself that's a good idea look at over yourself don't go to criticize take the word examine the word so she Rebecca had tried as a woman could to explain that what the prophets had said what Moses had said this person would be when he comes so she must have thought try to explain it to him again the priest had much more influence over him and what Rebecca his wife did then morning began to dawn want the little fella was Rebecca I can imagine her seen her punching said Zacchaeus you mean to say you don't want you to go down followed all nothing to do with it you know and don't be ready don't be disgusted read back at some time that's a good science he did this when he get so discouraged to talk about it and everything else that's a pretty good sign somehow so hey while Rebecca act like she's asleep only she was pretty and she finds Zacchaeus slips out of bed real easy and goes over and grooms he self all up and combs his hair just right and puts on his best garment and she peeped over out of one eye to see what he was doing she knew right then god of answered prayer she knew something's go to take place so exact his tip told I'm not letting Rebecca no worries are going you know he slips out it's outside and looks back she raises up the curtain looks like steam going on so thank you Lord it's alright now they like Elijah did when he said I've seen that the cloud the size of a man's hand just the first little evidence something's fixed the hand in it so he goes out and down the street she said I understand he's going to enter in by the south gate so I better go over there and stand said I'll get me a place and I'll stand right there and when he comes in I'll see how much profit that fella is me and I'm going to walk right out and put my finger under his nose and I'm going to give him a piece of my mind and when he comes and I'm going to tell him that all his nonsense is closed my wife and these prayer meetings and things I'm getting sick and tired of it I'm going I'm going to say something about this I'll tell him and I don't know rabbi or certainly pat me on the back you say Zach is your a good member of the church sir a fine fella it's always said I'll get out of there early so you got down when he got about a block or two of the gate come to find out the place was jammed it was hanging on the walls everywhere somehow another even though he was talked about there's somebody still like to hear he somebody would listen so he said now how am I gonna ever seen come in the gate remember the Bible said he was small expansion and he said I'm too little so he pushed around her give me a little room you can tell he isn't the Christian yet is he acting like that Christians don't have that attitude stand back you know my mom Zacchaeus I own the restaurant up here said on my way that even the Christian everybody know what he wasn't maybe someone knew that Rebecca was praying well they said you just stand back and so he know what he never get to see man all that crowd so he wouldn't be able to express these thoughts to me so he thought well now while I do maybe I'll go back home and just forget the whole matter but you know there's something about it that when you make up your mind that you see there's nothing gonna stop interesting care what it is your your persistence and like the little Greek woman was persistent to get to Jesus and there's something about it that whenever you make up your mind that you're going to seeing there is nothing going to stop it but remember when you make up your mind then the devil is gonna do everything he can to stop he's determinate you're not going to understand it you're not going to see it you'll throw ever black sheet across he can to keep you from spinning so there was his first barricade right there so then you start off said well I guess and looked over there and there stood Sonny's competitors and they he knew the end that some of the folks from the church so there he had made so much fun of this Jesus of Nazareth of being a prophet then your studies some of his members look at he might down they're the same group he just couldn't be here he was identified that gets here already identified you know if there happened to be one here you're already mixed up in the group so they already know it over here so we just might as well get acquainted here you look around seen one standing here you know after all they're all about like you and they they want to find out something a man knows that he come from somewhere from the beyond and when he leaves he goes back somewhere and he's always trying to find something to find out where he come from and where is he going there's only one has that answer that's gone every man wants to look over that curtain when you see anything that can show you what's over the curtain where you been who you are and where you're going there's only one book of all the letter to the road of the millions of tons this is a book that tells you who you are where you come from and where you're going there's no other book that'll look at binary and the word is gone now we find that this fella with all around he was embarrassed to find out he was a mist of a people that were screaming and crying and hard and acting like they were crazy so but he there he was sitting identified with him so he just had to stay that's all there was to it I said well if I'll come this far I might as well all not really finding out how's that yes that's a good idea don't got here at the breakfast oh now that says quality with all this part so now we find out that I said went along he said now if I stay here I cannot see because I'm too small so you know I'll leave I'll get out of this crown and run down on the corner a war I'll be standing by myself get me a place right on the edge of the pavement when he comes by down a walk right on the street and tell him what I think of him I'll give him a piece of my mind so you took off weak the crowd went down I thought now which way will he go well he went down halleluja Avenue that's usually weight travels and went onto a man corner where it turns there to go down to the the eating place that's where you go you know hallelujah I haven't do an Amen Corner then you're ready to work so you went down to this corner stood there on the corner said now there's nobody here and when I ought oh it sounds ridiculous so then first thing you know he got onto this corner he said there's nobody here so I'll stand here when he comes by I'll find out how much profit he is I'll walk right out the street now how telling something so it's 10:30 how to get to thinking out just a minute you know if I was too small down there that crowd will probably go wherever he's going I don't know why harder when I talk to you I want to tell you so he'll hear me and I'm hollering amen hallelujah glory to God Hosanna to the earth to the Prophet it comes in the name of the Lord all they'll ever hear me all that noisy bunch so there's only one thing that they have crowd all around me and then I can't even seem at all so we have to look stand on the corner and there was an old familiar sycamore tree that's a good indiana tree so standing on the corner you go well if I could get up there on that limb and sit down then I'd be up there then I could really tell him when he comes back so he come to run or he's too small he couldn't get up to the land so I said well now there's only one thing I can do and there's that city garbage can sitting on the corner so he thought well now if I go over and get that garbage can and pick it up bring it over here then I can get the rest way up the tree from that that will help me so he goes over and the garbage disposal hadn't come by yet that morning is pretty heavy sorry eating small and he couldn't pick it up don't have one way to do it that's wrap his arms around it and he had on his best garment so you know it's always hindrance this when you're trying to see jeans especially that didn't make any difference when good garment or not he want to see Jesus yeah so he's going his arm around the garbage can so he could get over there so he scooted it over and there he had garbage all over he well that make a difference he he wanted to see him anyhow so while he was pushing the can over with his arms around he heard somebody laughing and he looked around if it wasn't a little bit see standing here his competitor said well why do you know exact is has because I got him a new job from his resident he's working for the garbage disposal you know the devil just wants to see what he can do to throw everything in your way and he can they keep you from seeing Jesus he'll tell you they're a bunch of holy rollers they'll tell you they're a bunch of idiots you say there there's nothing to they're just a poor trash of the city anything you can do but if you're determined to seen God will make a way to your mind something go take place if that hunger begins to break into your heart something you'll go see him anyhow so didn't make any difference little face turned red he was embarrassed but he just push the cannon over anyhow and got a hold of it and shut it up the tree that's all right shitty you southerners know what it is that climbed up the tree got up the tree and he got a 30-pound were two limbs come together and met in the trunk of the tree and there he set down now that's a good place to set or two ways meets yours and God your idea is that's a good time to sit down and think it over your own thoughts about it and what he's word says he is what you think he is and what the word says he is what the message of the hour is - you're thinking what the message of the hour is to his word that's the difference sit there and think it over a little while no doubt Satan got on one of these shoulders said you know what here are a pretty look inside sitting up here picking spinners out here thinking and with your best garment on and it all garbage all over and now your name will be published all through the city the jerk should be all on you because look what a racial thing you have done sitting see Satan when you make a start and he'll try to tell you made of era Mary said that condition he said well Rebecca said he was a prophet I'll give him a try I'm Steve he's a prophet now he said when he comes by here and I'll just disguise myself he'll never know I'm up here first I'll get a look at him and then when I seen then I'm gonna jump out of this tree and then I'll go down there and tell him I said now if he if he is a prophet or as Rebecca said that he was he might know I was up in this tree if that's true so I'll tell you I'll fix him up so he pulled all the leaves around him and disguised himself all over so he couldn't be seen him at one leap to look out it seemed as he turned the corner and then sitting there thinking it all over Edgar wali heard a noise coming around the corner strange wherever he's at he's always a lot of noise you know noise it's one block never the high priest when he dressed and went into the holy Savoy on the end of his garment he had a pomegranate and a panel and that noise in the holiest of Holies was the only way the waiters knew that he was alive or not it made a noise and whether you ain't no noise and mighty might be david i thinkit's watched a whole lot of other churches and hey there's not enough noise about it not look enthusiasm not enough something and so where Jesus is there's always the noise one time when he would come into Jerusalem they were screaming and hollering and whole Santa to the King that cometh in the name of the Lord and some of those priests and there said why make them keep still holder peace he said if they hold their peace the raxil trial something has to move no worse and then the old should believe and then he heard this noise that coming around the corner and screaming and going on so he thought well he must be approaching so he pulled up his lead and raised up look over I've got him all now we'll find out how much profit he is so I won he was sitting there with his leap up looking in and up in this tree way up of other heads where they had made the tree so when he noticed the first man coming around the corner must have been the Apostle Peter because he was a big strong burly sort of a man I can see pushing the crowds back soon friends I'm sorry our master had a great service last night much virtue is gone from me you all won't understand would you just stand aside so master can pass by please do that you're come Matthew Mark and M alone said nah we don't want to be rude we're not here for that purpose but our master is awfully tired he hasn't had his breakfast so we're we want you to stand aside if you will there was a man standing there that maybe his Anka's took a look at a few days before that at a one of the meeting business place a doctor had been there and told this little fella that had a little girl that was really sick of a fever and she wasn't want to live Sonny had done all he could do it for and Zacchaeus when he raised this leaf up look he's seen this man with this baby wrapped in this blanket coming around the corner you felt what a rational thing that that father would do trying to follow that that's so-called prophet hearing coming around the corner this baby in it with a fever sending out this wind but you know just Assange's when you really believe there's nothing go to hinder it and she boarded get that baby to you and every time did make it a corner change he'd be pushed back but he he was persistent he was going on bond at this corner the little mother run out with a baby in her arms that she must have fell down and she said Lord be merciful to my child there stood the father of the baby crying - which was a brand of Zacchaeus he said what's changed his attitude so he couldn't make out who the man was and he was down in the crowd all that watched he seized a hand stretch out and touched over the top this little blanket and the little girl was unwrapped went skipping down the street now there's got to be something to that Zacchaeus they finally come into view one who look at him Zacchaeus have done changed his opinion just one girl inside there he was he didn't look like me there was something different about me gentle kind yet the blanket means to speak the world would come to an end it was a different character from what he had his attitude began that all of his starched began to wash out what he's seen comes walking on down the street he thought over this little leaf looking over see what was taking place and he said walked he got right under to where he was he said you know that man could be a prophet maybe Rebecca was right she might know more about the scriptures than I did so he walked that on down we said head down walking along humble gentle as he always did the disciples keeping the people out of his way and he's being guarded a dream he stopped does that case looking over the lead something like that he looked up in the tree Zacchaeus come on not only did he know is is up in the tree but he know what his name yeah let's couple get down out of the trees he told him the America was done on him scene he said Lord I've been wrong I'm ready to confess it wrong if I took anything wrong I'll pay it back I'll give asthma good to poor jesus said today salvation has come what changed what was a change brother and sister think just for a moment but change was he had seen something real it heard all the promises have been made the priest talked about what was great prophet Moses great this stand the other promising too great something in the future but ignoring what's being done now that's the way of man he saw something genuine something that he can see himself the American happened to him he was that prophet because he didn't know him neither would he ever seen him up in the tree but when he got right under the tree he stopped and looked up and said Zacchaeus come down but they salvations come to your house brethren it's the real thing it changes man's mind changes their energy sometimes it's oppressed surely to get to it but if you're going to proach Christ this morning with with the the thought in your heart that I will not be critical but I'll study the scripture in see what he was if he come to the meeting tonight before you come study and see what he wants whatever he was he has to be the same today his as I spoke last I have many of you were there he has God identify himself by his characteristic he always must remain that way because he's the same yesterday today forever man's hearts are our soul a real god-fearing man or woman businessman or whatever it is he's always is something in his heart if there's any God fear about him to know something about God say I never told you what happened to Zacchaeus he'd become a member of the Full Gospel businessman chapter Jericho they done I wanted to tell you about him first well sure he would be nothing that's before gospel of course not that's all Jesus a priest so he become a member there you are to be a member of the same now notice but he wanted to see something real and when he saw something real himself that was scripturally identified then he was ready it's a real things that meant there's a little story for closer how many in here's hunters I see your hands my brother need here I know it wasn't lonely so I loved it and I I used to go up in the North Woods up and New Hampshire's the home of the white-tailed deer how I loved to hunt them now used to go up every year and I had a partner of their name Berta call upon the finest man I ever hunted with and my nature has always been to the woods as born in the woods and I just seem like is raised up there even my conversion never took it out not so much to get the game but just to be in the woods I think God is there seem high moves and the nature how it dies and goes down comes back again and resurrection the Sun comes up of the morning a little baby barn and then about 9 o'clock it goes to school about 10 o'clock it's finished it's 12 o'clock it's in a string it took on the afternoon it's getting long about my age and five o'clock it's 80 years old it's dying it goes down and serve God's purpose and he dead it'll come back the next morning it's God testifying there is a live death burial resurrection what's been freeze out there last fall that set went down into the root before any frost or anything else come what was the news going down into the grave what happens in comes back again in the spring it isn't dead it goes down and lays the ground comes back if it stays up then the winner will kill it see God has no intelligence of its own sands and down there it's God's provided wait so it just follows God's provided weight goes down hides to the winter comes back again with new life make sure testifying there is a life death burial resurrection everywhere it is the same money gone in his green carnation testifying of himself this hunters is a fine shot a good shot but he was the most cruelest man I ever met he made fun of me all the time he shot bombs now not it's wrong he should have fought if the law says so but you know Abraham kill the calf and fed it to God so it wasn't the sect are the the size it's the attitude he'd shoot him just because it made me feel bad I mean say all your chicken hardly like the other than priests said Billy you have been good hunter if it wasn't you as a preacher and said but you're too chicken harder that's where them preachers said they're they're too chicken hearted I said Bert your cruelty and I was like a lizard anyhow and he said he didn't like the wind and try to paint dries you up I can't you say and looked over like at me said you're just chicken hard so it shoot those little pawns kill one let it lay go right on get another one just to make me feel bad he said I'll get you away that preaches some of these days I said huh so one day I went up there one fall and is linked and season been in about a week and I was busy a state game board in Indiana and I I've been busy and writing hunt season so I had to get my vacation I went up a little late and those whitetail dinner if they're ever shot at you talk about Houdini and be an escape artist not he's an amateur to him and so then they really stay hidden and had been moonlight nice snow underground about six inches trailing or so Bert when he comes out the cabin world was that he said say it Billy I got a good one this year for you now so wanna reach down his pocket pulled out and he had a little whistle blowin and sound his like a little fawn crying for its mother hello baby dear no crying for his mother I said bird how cruel can you be I said you mean you wouldn't do a thing like it haha your chicken-hearted preacher and we went on hunting that Dave and went aboard the Jefferson notch and you didn't have to worry about him you know how to find his way back so we climbed up to about noon and that would separate and go one one way and one of the other than ever we got our deer which hang him up and then we get our horses and go giddy so we've got about 11 o'clock we hadn't even seen a track not one track all the deer were laying down they get into brush and under the brush piles and things where the tops the trees for the loggers have been and they would they was hide and stay away cause they've been shot at they were scared about 11 o'clock bird stop sit down there's a little opening by all sides of this building in his inside maybe twice a side little opening and you set down the reach back together I thought his thermos that he had in his hope we usually carried thermos it has some hot chocolate and because it's got fuel to it children and then ever sandwich now we separate was getting up high towards Timberline so I thought maybe that Burt was going to have me sandwiches we sit down pull out this thermos and the authorities going to pull it out and I just let set my gun down against a tree and start at your mind but what he was he was getting that a little whistle out so when he got this little whistle out he blew it and anyone ever heard a little old baby fawn cries kind of pitiful anyhow and when he blew that whistle to my surprise rod across a great big mother daughter student now the dog is a mother deer so she stood up there was her big brown eyes the big ears pointed rod up like that see her baby was in trouble and he blew it again and she looked around and she walked right out into that opening now that's unusual any new hunters and all that for a deer to do that she walked out there I could see her big eyes she once spent over 20 yards from me and I thought oh bird you can't do that and it kill that poor precious mother her looking for her baby and you deceiving her like that and this whistle had lowered and she was she walked out there and the hunter raised that labor on his 3006 rifle or dropped it down that cocked the gun you know if it's a jail and she heard that and she looked around and she saw the hunter her ears speech right down usually they'd been gone and she would walked out there to first place at that time of day but you see she was a mother there was something in her she had something genuine something she wasn't putting on no show she was a mother she was borned another and her baby was in trouble that was to her interest and he looked up at me and those lizard looking eyes and his green I said Burt don't do it to her he just grew him turned her out that rifle oh my he's a dead shot now know when that scope air come across her loyal motherly heart you know what playing through her see she was 10 in 20 yards a big 180 grand Green hundred eighty grain mushroom bullet and there he would just build her heart plum through both sides I thought how can you be so cruel as the blow had precious mothers are out of her and her sinking her baby how can you do that bird I just thinking to myself I've seen his arms study down I couldn't look at it I just couldn't turn my back I couldn't see that that genuine loyal mother standing there she wasn't hypocrite she was just putting it on for a sideshow she was a mother that's what she's doing death it mean nothing to her the baby was in trouble she thought more of her baby she never alone live let the murder shoot whatever it was her loyal heart was beatin her mother hood that motherhood in ER was calling her baby was crying there was something inside of her pulsating was real how could that cruel hunter blow that law hard I just couldn't see it I turn my head Lord God don't do it I stayed like this I couldn't hear that I didn't hear the gunfire this is too much I'll wait the gun number five I turned around looking this going like this he couldn't do it you turn around I looked at me in those big eyes have changed tears I was running down his cheeks he looked at me two lips quivering he told the girl in the snowbank and grabbed me the trouser leg he said Billie I've had enough of it lead me to that Jesus you're talking about there on that snowdrift I led him to the Lord Jesus why he saw something really he'd been all kinds of churches he's seen something that wasn't put on you've seen something it was genuine friends we might have Church rules and Church regulations and theologies and everything else but there's a real genuine Jesus let's look between you just now as we go with your heads bowed or like to ask you a question your hearts bound to how many in here not do who profess Christian if a profession is all you have but how many of you would like to be as much Christian as that dare was a mother or something so genuine in you it seemed more than your life or anything at your hand you say it may say this brother Brennan I belong to church I'm a businessman businesswoman or one more housewife but really to be that type of a Christian and I could lay the whole world aside span the criticism or anything I'd like to be as much I'd like to be in my heart a Christian is that dear was a mother with your heads bowed on your eyes closed before God I ask you in Christ's name at the ending of the age would you just put up your hand take Megan Oliver call because there's no room but just say pray for me brother branham that automobile type of a Christian and that there was another cognition just pans everywhere that maybe as much Christian Zack is when you put your hand up that shows he's found you now horns just slide about how the tree here go home with you today for dinner he'll stay with you the rest of your days Heavenly Father we are grateful for the Lord Jesus his presence we're aware that there's something here that made man and women some of them even profess to be Christians for years but there was there something present that calls them even though they need professed even as Zacchaeus was but once the touch from Christ they lived in their hand as a testimony that something inside of him told them to do it let them know just now that's Jesus he was to pass this way this morning and he had there was I guess some 150 hands of Lord I pray that you'll visit each one and give to them the reality that it is to be a real Christian no matter how much the world tries to discourage and how much the others try to discourage us let us know that it's a fight to get there it's an effort we have to put forth but when connecting with something that's genuine real it changes us then I pray that you'll change every heart Lord and make everyone in divine presence at this time but the Holy Spirit in their life to be as much Christian as mother dear was a mother she was born a mother and may they be born of the Spirit of God and become a real follower of Jesus strike they they come from their sycamore trees today Granite Lord may you go home with each one of us and there abide with us until the time you come to take us to our eternal or we asked it in Jesus name Amen thank you kindly the Lord bless you I kept you late I was supposed to be out of here at 10 o'clock ten
