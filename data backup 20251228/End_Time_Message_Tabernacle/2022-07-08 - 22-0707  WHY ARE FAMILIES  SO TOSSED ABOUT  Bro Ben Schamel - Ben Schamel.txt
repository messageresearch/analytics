promises of god this evening amen we're sure blessed to and and happy to be here with you tonight we first of all just want to thank brother fosten and the church for the opportunity my brother matthew preached a wonderful service last night brother we weren't able to be here in person but we were streaming online and he preached on [Music] so we're just honored to be among the people of god if you will and we'll just go ahead and turn to our scriptures now we know that the meetings are centered around the family why people are so tossed about incredible message so what i would like to speak on tonight much of my scriptures and thoughts inspiration if the lord would help us we'll turn to psalms chapter 127 we know that families are the backbone of the church and satan has been trying to destroy families ever since the garden of eden psalms 127 the scripture reads except the lord build the house they that labor they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchmen walk wakeeth but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early and to sit up late and eat the bread of sorrows for so he get giveth his beloved sleep lo children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen thank you [Music] dear gracious heavenly father lord we just come before you yes once more lord lord we're just so thankful that we have a time and a place to come together lord that we can gather ourselves around your word lord that we can encourage ourselves in your word lord we're coming together tonight to speak about families that we wouldn't speak anything that's dishonoring to you tonight that you might just get the speaker out of out of the way that we might hear from the holy spirit we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen and you may be seated so again we'd like to speak tonight on why families are so tossed about it and we realize that god has a family and he had in his mind a perfect picture of what his family would be done and if we would tonight it may not be so much preaching but maybe more teaching tonight as brother has taught us preaching often convicts the [Music] but teaching positionally places the bride of jesus so we can only preach so much he a correct good noble obedient family [Music] the mother with the father [Applause] you'll see one lovely picture was and the only way that they could be won with the family god in his family father overall supreme so we see we're starting to see this picture that god has of his family it's a beautiful picture and he's put into place headship [Music] he's put into place leadership in the family the backbone of the church but we know that satan is trying to skew the portrait of god's family it's no longer mother it's no longer father mother children but here's satan trying to distort the picture of god they say that really much did you so much so he's projecting to them mother mother and children my mama it is what a perverse nation the satan is doing his best they said they felt this on you to try to get god's people who you see the point is you're away from the headshot that a family should be fully surrendered to the leadership of god the scriptures say except the lord build a house except we neglect to include god into the relationship and i'm not talking about the marriage side i'm talking about before that yes when we're dating girl and it has nothing to do with their family but they're only talking to her because she's pretty meh or she's cute many times worldly girls and it shows what is inside of you and it's expressing itself through who you're talking to same thing for the women but we've now become distracted by these other worldly things and now we're worried about having a boyfriend or girlfriend not trying to walk in the will of the lord so are we trying to get a a a boyfriend or girlfriend out of social status [Music] i can take my halo off i can take my halo off we're just going to preach tonight do we believe this yes praise god but from the beginning we're starting to get our picture distorted but marriage we realize is between three persons not just two pastors the problem is we're all on the boat called life and many times we want to be at the helm of the boat and we want this ship to sail where we want the ships we don't want it to go where god wants it to go vulnerable but many times we are like jonah and we know that we're running from the presence of god because it doesn't feel as good as where we would go is this okay many times we come to church and we sit here on a sunday or a wednesday night [Music] and we're just playing church we come out of traditions or we come to show face or see friends and this is not just a nominational christian but you now have the spirit of jesus christ his blood flowing through your face we are now children of the living god and i'll try to stay on my on my notes but brother branham talks about the the temple that was in israel and how there was an outer court there was an intercourse and there was a holiest of here and so many times we are tossed to and fro we feel like roller coaster christians up then it's because we are still in the justification phase brother brown said not a different christian but a different phase of the christian world so when the storms of life come in that light is blocked we feel the rain we feel the wind but there's a higher calling may yeah and that's where we have the seven golden candlesticks it's no longer the sun is the light but that light shines all of the time but that light is still a false light that is not where we're trying to get to it then there is no more [Applause] [Applause] no longer up and down a christian must be fully surrendered to god the father the mother and the children must be fully surrendered until the storms of life start to come and then what do we do we throw our hands up and say oh no look at the mess the batista lord just take care of my situation when 10 minutes before me you were doing what you wanted to do and had no regard to the word of god [Music] he says that faith in god's word will give you rest [Applause] [Music] and he preached to her at midnight in bed the christian faith is based solidly upon rest he says that's right and worry about all things a christian rest he says it's all over it's if you need it's finished for the believer at calvary that's right oh sickness [Music] there is neither just let and as psalms 127 says a song of decrees for solomon except the lord build the house but i want to build a family the way i want to build a family we've already seen the result of of you trying to take this video [Music] doing their own things totally disintegrated there was no family unity and it's the same with the bride of jesus christ so many times we see the church family if you can get the entire church surrendered to the holy spirit whereas before the church was struggling but god must be the centerpiece of the family otherwise it won't work so god has set up an umbrella of leadership inside the family we see this god christ and his church are a perfect type of the family did you just as god and christ are one comes christian and all that christ is he said now the bride cannot be any more inferior to the man [Music] our families [Music] they told us [Music] but because we have a promise [Applause] amen amen so now when two are married in christ they are not now two flesh they are one flesh just as god in christ and when they have children they come in no zombies are fun those children are now an expression of the father expression living through the children just as we are attributes of god come i'm coming into communion now we can see why the message families are being so bombarded many times we don't realize the struggles that are going on with the person next to us many times we think the homosexuality demon is outside of our church but i'm telling you the devil is attacking for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear gov but you have received received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father verse 16 says he says the spirit itself bears witness is with our spirits history that we are the children of god you know not only our spirit so god says you're a son of god so the next time the devil comes to you in a question and he says this message isn't for you you aren't the son of god this message is for somebody else that message is old-fashioned [Applause] yes praise god thank you [Music] [Music] if jesus says let this mountain be moved don't we believe that it would be moved then why did we lack the faith for a two-member [Music] that we may be also glorified together but you see here's where satan has tricked us especially in the american culture but the father who's supposed to be the head of the home has now taken a back seat and he's no longer leading the way he opted he says say what about the man he says it's you brother it's your time you call yourself a man and the head of the house and you let your women strip her strip herself off and get out there on the lawnmower and get a cigarette in her hands so man as the head of the house when you see your daughters when you see your wife and they're dressed so tight they can't even be afraid it shows what kind of man you are and our place should be at the altar we need to be born again we shouldn't want our daughters or or or our wives out there looking like that but when we're fully surrendered to the holy spirit then everything we do is to glorify god so if the scriptures say i god what you want you to be dressed this certain way modestly and we are in love with jesus then you've got a heart problem somewhere but it shows how much a man you are he says that's just exactly it you know that's the truth what we need is an old-fashioned holy ghost revival second say hey because we are dealing with the eternal destination we're not coming up here to to try to preach something that might tickle your ears we're trying to get our families prepared for our wraps [Music] why take that substitute he says pentecostal skies are full of the real holy mothers will never be the mothers that they need to be outside of the holy ghost and children it is our fault you will not be the arrows in the hand of a mighty warrior that you should be unless you're fully surrendered to the holy ghost you're never too young to be surrendered [Applause] so you can't give me that excuse me he says why do you take anything like that listen to what brother brandon says and he's talking to the men because you're trying to live in sin basically and possess the holy ghost at the same time mum possess the holy ghost at the same time now we can see why we're up and down because as men we're living lazy sinful lives the leadership that god gave the role to the to the father and we've shifted the responsibility over to the wife [Music] you're trying to live in sin yet possess the holy ghost at the same time so the men we come in yeah and we put the check on the table we beat our chests and we sit down in the lazy chair the wife do everything else and that's where satan will come in and start to divide and it goes on [Applause] but we are going to be fully surrendered to you but with that check we also slap down all the bills and we don't even know if there's enough money in that check to cover all the bills [Applause] we try to make everybody else in the church think that oh we're so religious does not take care of his family worse than an infidel those are pretty harsh words but a message believer sitting here in a seat that's not taking proper care of his family is worse than a homeless drunk on the side that's the scripture because when we come in we sit down our family knows they know the temper that we've got they know that we're not reading our bible the way that we should be we know that we're letting the mom do all the bible studies with the kids we're letting mama do all the the prayers with the children just because we have an eight-hour job we go to work and come back for me but we see the same thing happening in churches he's not afraid to chase out that guy why because he's pastoring his people that god would pastor his people and we praise the lord for that he's not neglecting so we follow our pastor as he follows the message of our hour as brother branham followed christ it's leadership but so many times it gets messed up at home maybe something that needs to be addressed in our family how are our children's our parents or or our family going to receive it the day before you were talking [Music] but there will come a time when we'll realize that we are sons of god that we are the manifestation of the lord jesus and some of us fathers are going to stand up and we're going to look the devil in the face i've had enough yeah i'm not taking this beating but i step up to the responsibilities i will lead my wife if the devil is coming against one of just as our brother preached the roman centurion last night he said i am a man with authority but i am also a man under authority so if we as fathers of our homes can't be under authority to the church how can we turn around and expect our children if we won't surrender the boat ourselves unto god then how can we expect those following us to do the same they felt the men shows them insurance that's why brother branham taught us that it's so important who teaches you it's very important who you're following us in this local assembly are not ordained to stream another pastor but god has put a pastor in your area to take care of your neighbors [Applause] he can't attend to your needs but many times we try being spiritual leaders the wrong way brother he goes just couldn't believe that he would associate with such people so he grabs oliver and and and he goes all pentecostal and he says oh god he was trying to take the minion of this household is the way brother branham said some of the the most uh powerful moves of god then the poissons are done in quiet places what we need is to be surrendered [Applause] he said brother let's get people inside the veil let's not only get them to church but let's get them to christ says that's right this is powerful i want you to read it he says you want to know a little secret would you like to know a secret of this age here's what about a child of god that's that's that's squabbling laid out on the floor gonna see this don't forget love amen he says the love of god constrains us to do such a thing he says come in the veil so instead of going and trying to cast a demon yelling and screaming at your wife you know honey maybe we go out and eat it i know you've been working so hard raising the children isn't it at least i didn't make it easy on my mom but that gives a whole different reaction because brother branham put this to the test time [Music] and he completely changed the atmosphere not by screaming and shouting but he was allowing the power of god he was fully surrendered to the holy ghost and he was allowing that to manifest in his everyday life he didn't say oh do you just shut up get the kids out of here [Music] and disaster but he said no you know what honey let me help you wash those total different approach and i'm so glad that that's how god works because if god acted the way that we thought we should act then instead of sending christ down to save us then he would have sent judgment and i'd be in hell right now but the love of god is man and he has that love to bestow upon us my goodness time flies we must get god's picture of headship right there before anyone can take their full position in god's portraits didn't find her in the morning he never found her at noontime he found her in the evening it shall be liked in the evening a woman it's her nature to surrender to a man it's the nature of the church to surrender to christ and surrender to his will it is there's too much verse 4 of psalms says as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them that they should not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate come the flesh but in the english language so the scripture's saying that children are your reward components but we live in a society now that doesn't want any children we live in a society now where they say i just want one one boy one girl that's it i'm done and i won't go into that too much but you search it out yourself [Applause] [Music] and those arrows if you're fully surrendered and they can go around they can shoot over the wall and they can reach places don't discount your children and then negligible many times even as ministers members of a member they come to minister they think that that that it's our ministry our wife and our children don't really have anything to do with our ministry why would paul have said that you have to have your family in order for me because the children pascale along with the wife avec and i apologize i'm i'm trying to hit these points and move on excuse your voice [Music] all right talk to the the dads and the moms are your kids ready one of the biggest things that i've ever seen that destroys families i'll go into it a little bit but i don't have a lot of time but many times when you're talking evil about your parents and you start to harbor bitterness it creates a division within the family division and if you notice bitterness is often referred to as a root of bitterness [Music] bitterness oftentimes is not something that you can see with the naked eye la la so when we see all of these other things that are manifesting in our children peter i know a little bit about uh i'll give you money tell me how to lay my hands on people he had an indifferent spirit so i i love how the scripture puts this bcc we'll go ahead and we'll read it give me also this power that on whom so ever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost nor lot in this matter for your heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore that this thy wickedness descent and pray god it's supreme if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven now without the leading of the holy spirit he would have not said this next and in the bond of iniquity so spiritual leaders start looking out i mean spiritually when you start seeing the young people and they start to get indifferent toward the word of god [Music] you know the brother branham talked about the the birds and how the dove doesn't have any gall doesn't have any bitterness in a message called do you uh now believe in them but forgiveness is the antidote to bitterness i'll say that again for the kids forgiveness is the antidote many times our parents are growing up with us i have a lot of friends my age that now have four or five kids on saint kusi zamfar and i'm realizing this now said that bitterness will hold the holy spirit back from your life and that's going to be the root of the thing if we can root out bitterness emma okay i'll read this one little quote in the middle god being misunderstood 61. now if a great if a great blessing on see benediction and the people are shouting and the glory of the lord is falling and people want to scream and shout and do whatever the spirit tells them he said go ahead that's right but when a man's coming to be healed where the question between death and life is involved i believe we should uh we should be reverent and speak to the father and talk to him instead of worshiping let's ask him father i am a worshiper of yours i love you you know i do you too i express my love to you now so if we want to have restoration in our family don't take hold of the helm with an iron fist but start expressing god's love and that will turn the entire ship around just let go and let god have his ways and i believe that stronger families will result in a stronger church on the ground the good fortune and a stronger church will result in a stronger bride of jesus christ good blessed be the name of the lord being swollen on the senior amen amen it's certainly a privilege and a pleasure certain mind privilege and pleasure when the old men preach the younger people they said oh because because because legend on this pascal but god always has a witness if there are many young people they said the message is for all the people god is gonna raise some young person and talk to the young people amen amen this is the purpose of this meeting to have at the same time the couple and the single davao memo couple as i said yesterday because this is the target of the enemy enemy to destroy family did they tweet for me amen thank you very much let us stand on our flavor now uh we are gonna take a few moments to pray for our families i would like the parents to pray for the children the police and friends and the children it is our fault to pray for the parents is [Music] [Music] parent regardless of what the children have done for giving the children and the children doing the same ellis face show same in the family of god in the church the remember son of a mediocre it's not because a child has done something senate papastathopoulos that you are gonna hold him responsible forever okay responsible forgiveness [Music] to jesus is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] forcing oh [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] oh i gave myself to [Applause] me [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is oh [Music] is [Applause]
