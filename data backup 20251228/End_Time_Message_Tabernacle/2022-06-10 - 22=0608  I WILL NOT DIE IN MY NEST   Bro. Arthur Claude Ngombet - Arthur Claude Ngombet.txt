that nest job released sample mode that that job wanted just to die in that nest you wanted to prosper in that nest if would you ask yourself did you ever ask yourself excuse me is the purpose of the birds is to die in the nest casa come over here what does it mean die to die queso que la mo what is death the more the prophet music plan to park they don't plant us or no less like in their produce for prosecutors they just laid us there there's no hope for that body personally nobody stay in the cemetery until your body wakes up they can stay for a while and then after a while they go back home continue because the life goes on believers we know the body that we put on the on the ground le pere knows it the the father has promised us not to replace that buddy and then he will bring us back the body in his own state it's a pokemon but we keep in mind that it's just for a little while but the prophet says also there's a death for inside body hey local anterior osi is because it was meant to be the likeness of someone you readily imagined to be the image after somebody eh when your inside body dies and that death is the most dangerous start tomorrow don't you follow me that death is the one that you have to get away from or dying means to separate yourself if you're living your life separated from christ with a very common cell movie you started to die civil prone evil decision if you have taken your decision without the word vupre never sure son christian you have made your choice without christ you're living your days without christ your death has started because dying means to separate yourself from that if you are able to live without god over here from monday from morning to evening it doesn't mean you don't miss him gw elephant so many novel monk from the beginning of the week until the end of the week he doesn't miss you you don't miss him sante plisa presence you don't feel his presence is a normal you just will condemn you in an eternity in his

sundry if yeah you decide without him will that be sorry you good enough without him sasuraj if it would be difficult to be always with him that means those that will live eternally with him has already started living here yeah there's something in them seeking his presence to stay away from him [Applause] but there's something in them info it takes god in assembly either they have church or not a love for christ don't love it he takes god in their lives a lot of skills the wrong case when they will have christ christ the communion christ will stick to fellowship with other christ

may not to journey but our god is not like this [Music] when they're talking about little ones was in the kingdom of birds buffalo mama pools sometimes it's like a mother chicken but foreign sometimes it's like a madder ego any particular and the mother eagle has a particularity circumference that means he builds his nest in the highest prison accessible in a way that you cannot access that means
