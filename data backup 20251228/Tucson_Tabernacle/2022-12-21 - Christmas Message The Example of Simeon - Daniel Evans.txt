us can we sing Amazing Grace as we ready to turn over oh man Amazing Grace house [Music] I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see let's stand if you could keep playing for just a moment Luke chapter 2. [Music] we'll start with verse 25. and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just in devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then he took then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all the people and a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel let's bow our heads Lord Jesus [Music] as I say Lord Jesus it was you that was dedicated that that Simeon saw on that day oh God it's a little overwhelming just saying that but father I pray that I would that you'd anoint my words tonight and father may I as I talk about this man Simeon may I present it in the right way the way that he actually was when you were there in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can be seated I tell you when I said I wasn't expecting that when I said Lord Jesus I thought wow that was Jesus that was dedicated that day I uh sister Amelia thank you for the testimony God bless you Lord took care of you praise the Lord I don't know if they announced it but a friend of mine passed away last night brother Jim McGuire brother Kenny you know brother Jim McGuire he passed away last night I don't know if he knew it he passed away last night brother Jim was the tape boy for brother Brown he is the one that worked with brother softman that made brother branham's tapes during all the sermons he traveled all over the country with him and um saw many great things I've had many many conversations with brother Jim one of the things he told me he told me about a testimony he was he was in service and back then in the 50s and 60s they used to have what's called a Waterhead baby and it's a baby that the Ted swells really big and and brother Jim told me that he was standing he was sitting there making the tapes and and there was a lady that brought her baby up and it had just a really big head it's unnaturally big and brother Branham said he had a somebody had a a cloth tape and they put the tape around the baby's head and it measured a certain size and he announced it to the crowd and then brother Jim said he prayed for the baby and he said now measure it and they put the tape around the baby's head and it was much smaller and then brother Bram didn't stop there he's he's dogged for a little bit he said now measure the baby again and they measured the baby the last time and his the baby's head was perfectly normal brother Jim said I was sitting right there I saw the baby's whole head shrink he was um bojem was is a special brother to me I've known him since I was born my family were friends with the McGuire family um brother Jim as I said he made the tapes and we listened to brother Branham in in the messages and how many times have you heard brother Branham listen and why are you listening say these tapes go around the world and they're translated how many people have heard them say that when brother Jim was making those tapes let me tell you how Prophet speaks that wasn't happening there were no tapes going around the world back then there were no tapes being translated back then brother Branham was speaking prophetically and that would happen much later decades later we'd see these messages be translated and sent around the world and brother Jim I asked him I said how many did he send he said he said well he said I remember sending a couple to Germany and maybe one time I sent a ship into South Africa and that was it now this message has circled the Earth of prophets speaking prophetically of what was going to happen like it was happening right then which is the way that most of these prophets spoke in this book so yeah brother Jim was uh he was he was close um man he worked to voice guide recordings and I sat at the break table many times talking with him and hearing these wonderful testimonies about brother Branham and the things that he did and traveling with him and the personality that he had he will be missed he was he was a good friend and a good man um this week in preparing for Christmas I thought it would be good to maybe talk about this Christmas Day this original Christmas day that happened and talk about this man's Simeon and you know we so many things there's so much conflict about Christmas especially in our ranks of people some people believe well it's okay to have a Christmas tree some people say no you shouldn't have a Christmas tree because it's idolatry some people say well it's okay to give gifts during Christmas other people say no you shouldn't give gifts because that's it's a pagan holiday and and we we go back and forth and and we we sometimes fight about these things and many times it just depends on where you go to church if if you're going to celebrate this Christmas holiday or if you're not and I think this man Simeon I think that he gave us a good example on how we should we should acknowledge the Lord's birth and how we should handle this Christmas Day this uh we all know that our Lord wasn't born on December the 25th everybody knows that not just us but pretty much everyone knows that it was it was sometime in the springtime and I see in Simeon simeon's greatest desire as I just read his greatest desire was see the Lord's Messiah he lived his life we don't know exactly the Bible doesn't say how old Simeon was it talks about how old Anna was and a couple verses later but it doesn't we don't know how old Simeon is but we know that he must have had a lot of age on him because he starts talking about his death and he he talked he starts talking about well now your servant can depart so it's pretty much understood that this man Simeon was an old man and uh we look at his example and the way that he celebrated didn't celebrate but the way that he treated this baby Jesus and that's the way that we should we should treat this Christmas coming up you know we look at and we're gonna you know we make decisions in the church we're about to continue on with some of the changes that we're making in the church and we could follow this man's simeon's example also I want to I want to show Simeon in uh in verse number 25. if you'll notice three times that the that the author Luke here says that Simeon was led by the holy spirit let me read it verse number 25 it says this and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was Justin devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him there's one and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ there's two and he came by the spirit there's three into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law so we see that this man Simeon he was led by the Holy Spirit to see this man Jesus and um Christmas is a awkward thing and I I feel it right now I feel even right now that there's strong feelings on Christmas um it should be about Christ it should be about the Lord Jesus Simeon was all about this this baby the Christ we see that you know we see that should we have a a tree should we give gifts is that about Jesus Christ giving the gifts is that is the tree about Christ is the manger scene about Christ when you see the star on top of the tree is is explained that this represents the Star of Bethlehem the the presents that are under the tree is that about the gifts that the wise men brought or is it about how much that we can give each other and if I got as much as the next guy that's you know so often we hear that well I bought this person a present it cost a hundred bucks and this person just gave me a present it was 20 bucks you know a cheapskate now welcome to the pagan holiday of Christmas if that's the way that we think about it Jesus said is more blessed to you are more blessed to give than to receive so you're more blessed given the hundred dollars than receiving the twenty dollars it becomes Pagan it becomes wrong it becomes a worldly thing this Christmas that's what we make it into but I'm not against Christmas but if we are giving gifts in the name of the Lord Jesus and we are talking about Jesus Christ then yes then move forward like this man Simeon did move forward in that it's all right but make it about Christ because if we don't then it is Pagan it is wrong I see you see so much fighting on Christmas you know arguing and bickering back and forth between families you see depression and people that that are prone to that you see often depression strikes the worst during the holidays because it doesn't become about Christ it needs to be about our lord Jesus you know Stephanie and I when the kids were growing up we're trying to always do our best did we is are the decorations are they right are they wrong sometimes a few times remember we put up the cross in our house you know we want to we want to you know have that we want to be like we're Christians we're different and it always we always wanted to be right and it's so confusing sometimes this Christmas way and then other times sometimes not having a tree and I keep talking about the tree because there's the manger scene and all the other things but but sometimes not having that makes us better than the people that have it and it's not about Christmas anymore either it's not about Christ anymore it's about exalting ourselves over someone else I've seen people that they say the the lie and they'll cheat and they'll they'll um gossip we don't give gifts on Christmas so we're better you know and it's not Christmas is about Christ brother Branham said this he said now my brother the only quote that I do you have the quote that I have there from presuming brother Bram said this he says now we have just passed two of the major holidays that we know here in America to be Christmas time in the new years it's actually not a Christmas it's a day that we set aside of course we realize it isn't the Lord's birthday he couldn't be born on December 25th because it's so cold up there the Shepherds could not have been on the hill and so forth and if you was ever in Judea along that time of year you know it wasn't it wasn't in the wintertime but it's thought that it was perhaps along in April or May when Lambs are born and like he come by all nature just like regular Lambs are born he was the Lamb of God and he was born along that time but I don't suppose that he cares what day we set aside because the day is actually lost but it's in commemoration of his birthday instead of we making it a commemoration a day of worship to God for his sending his son to us we have a celebration see we celebrate Christmas it's not a celebration you can celebrate Washington's birthday or Lincoln's birthday or some other great man's birthday you might celebrate it but Christmas should be a day of worship we have Twisted it around and have made it one of the greatest commercial days it's all fixed up on passing presence to one another and having feelings hurt if we don't do it and pay them back and it's just all twisted up because the world makes it about the commercial and not about Christ and we like I said as we as a church body are also making some decisions and we need to make those decisions not in what serves us the best or what we like the best but what does Jesus Christ want what serves him the best and what serves the body the best again I said three times Simeon Luke mentions the Holy Spirit when talking about Simeon now let's dig into the word Luke chapter 2 verse 1. and in preparation for as I said for the Christmas holidays as as we're thinking about this week and what it means Luke as you probably know the author of this never knew the Lord Jesus what he did is he talked with those that were with him it says that in Luke chapter 1. he talked to those that had an eyewitness account and he wrote these things down and that's where we get this Book of Luke first one and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was the governor governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and the lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields keeping watch over the flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for under youth is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest in in and on Earth peace good good will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us I would probably say the same thing if that happened to me and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe laying in a Manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told by them told them by the Shepherds friends right there is the First Time The Gospel was ever preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ was the first time was by these men called Shepherds and these Shepherds you notice they didn't bring gifts and I think I know probably the reason why is shepherds are not poor people shepherds are the poorest of the poor they don't this flock you know we talk about we talk about the pastor and we talk about how pastors their role in church that Shepherd as with the pastor he does not own those sheep that Shepherd is hired by the master to watch over these sheep to bring them into good pastures to to point them in the right direction and to have them ready for when the master returns I was I was in Malawi which is in a country in East Africa my brother Adam and I were doing a doing a project there and we were way back in the mountains of Malawi way back in there and it's it's a land kind of like the desert here um with some scrub trees a lot of stickers on everything and and real Rocky uh it's different than here because they over graze everything and the um the fires will come through and only the trees Will Survive so it's real it's really a rocky harsh area and we were as I said we were way back in there it was hot and we looked up and here comes this herd of goats coming through and hurting these goats was was this man obviously he was black he was African and he had just a pair of ragged like shorts I guess you could call them if if I don't I don't know if they were just pants that had fallen apart or or what they were but there's shorts and then this ragged old shirt and he had a staff in his hand and he had one rubber boot on his left foot you know those cheap rubber boots that you can find in Walmart the the waterproof ones just there's nothing to them he had one of those here and on the other foot is barefooted and he was walking with these sheep and he had the staff and he was he was kind of limping and he was looking at us he'd never seen a white man before and he was looking us at us like what is going on here with these people out here and my brother Adam he's a mountain of a man but he's got a heart even bigger than he is he couldn't handle it he uh he told Brother saeedi who was our he was our our guide there he he said he said I got to get him a pair of shoes he said um is there there somewhere and brother said he said yeah I think so he said my brother Adam said well can we can we go talk to him so said he says sure so they walk over there and I'm I'm not too far away um maybe here to you brother Kenny and um Adam walks up to him and and the man is looking and anxieties interpreting and Adam says it do you have a place that you can buy shoes and and he said he didn't really know what to say so well there's a there's a little village over there um that it was a couple miles away that I can probably get some shoes and and Adam asked said he said how much would these shoes cost inside you said probably 20 bucks you know we can we can get him a pair of shoes and I remember seeing these these Shepherds and seeing these people they don't even they're so poor they don't even have homes they will they will go into a tree and build a little shelter to keep themselves out of the Sun and and put some thatching over the top of it to to keep themselves out of the the rain at night but they are the poorest of the poor think about who came to Jesus here that I just read out of the Book of Luke these people are poor they have nothing So Adam is talking with this this man through the translator and he Adam talked about the the shoes and he started to shake and and Saidi pulled out the money to pay for the shoes and Adam told him he said he said I'll pay you you know you give him the Malawi currency and inside he pulled them pulled out the money to pay for the shoes it wasn't more it was maybe 20 or 30 dollars and and the shepherd he he started shaking and my brother got choked up he had never seen that much money in his life that Sadie pulled out this is a tiny amount of money and Adam looked at him and he saw his feet walking across these hot these hard rocks and and all of this and he just wanted to get him a pair of shoes and and the man he said he said why would you want to do this and Adam said you need you need this and he was he was shaking he didn't know how to do no one had ever given him anything I doubt anyone even knew he was alive hi Daddy had any family he was as poor as you can be out there in the middle of the desert hurting these sheep with nothing they give them they give him this money anxiety talks about the Lord Jesus to him and introduces them to it and I thinking about these Shepherds that were up on that mountain that that angel came down to and that's who God chose to go and Witness this new baby Jesus and I think how important are we I look at that Shepherd out there there's this man and I was thinking if he could just hear this gospel if he could just hear if he could just accept this gospel this 20 bucks to get him shoes how would he have felt if if he said you will inherit the earth nobody else may know you but God knows you these shoes they'll get you by they'll help you but this Jesus Christ will take your sins away that's Christmas this man this these this dudes two young people Joseph he was a little older and Mary she was young they have this baby and here comes these Shepherds like this man nothing they had nothing they were as poor as you can be and I I remember looking at that man and oh my brother just he came back and he couldn't hold it back how poor that man wasn't and when he he started shaking no one had ever given him anything and here comes the greatest gift that has ever come to the world God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the greatest gift this world has ever seen and it's it comes down here and God chooses the poorest of the poor the the we would call or the world would cause low lives nobody even knows them and they come in here and they come to that stable and there is the king of kings the Lord of lords the Everlasting father right there and I have seen with my own eyes a shepherd they are nothing but God chose them God chose the Shepherds to come to witness that birth that's Christmas and we think it's about swapping gifts we think it's about how much I can get from this or it's about some Christmas tree or some nativity scene or I do or I don't and it's about Jesus Christ the greatest gift and we lose the thought of it and you can see why the prophet said it's a pagan holiday because of what the world has done with it it is no longer about that Manger it is no longer about that baby that took away the sins of a world it's weak let's make it about him let's make it about our Lord and our savior Jesus Christ friends that Shepherd I I can't even explain it we took a picture of him I I had a lens on my camera and I I took it afar off the way he was limping he had nothing I know he didn't have a home I know he didn't have a family because they asked him he had nothing he followed these goats around for for just a meager something to eat and that those are the people that the Angels Came to and those are the people that preached the gospel for the first time out of the Lord is he does not do things like we think he should do things he doesn't do things like we expect he chooses people like that that's what Christmas is let's um continue on with the scriptures I think about that man it's only a few years ago I wonder if he's still alive he was so poor his hair was kind of bleached um I pray that something said he said struck him and he'll be a king in heaven he will be you don't have to worry he won't have to worry about hurting those goats anymore verse number 19. but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy unto the Lord and offer sacrifice according to that which was which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons as I read before and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just a devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the law then he took him up in his arms and bless God the most important thing that it ever struck this man's Simeon in his life and it's the same thing to you and me that is what this child Jesus means I remember Paul one time I believe it was Paul in the Bible he prayed to God and he said in the name of thy holy Child Jesus referencing our Lord and here this baby was Simeon we don't know where he came from we don't know where he went we don't know anything about him we don't know how old he was but we know that he came in there somehow the Lord had revealed to him that he was going to see this child can you imagine how he felt think about that Shepherd that I just talked about and how here's here's 20 bucks shaking here's the salvation of the world imagine him holding that baby in his hand what he everything he lived his life for and here is this baby he says Lord I can depart now you told me how he knew that was the Christ have no idea but he knew it and we they brought the child to be circumcised who circumcised him I don't know neither is anybody else we know about Simeon but we don't know about the priest that dedicated it or circumcised him he didn't recognize this but this Simeon he must have remembered he must have been studying that Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive and bear some he must have he must have known that this man was coming because there were some things happening in that day that were signs and I might get to those if if we keep going where was I verse number 28. and he took him up in his arms and he blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation I've searched my whole life for this I can put myself in simeon's place my whole life and still I want to see him face to face it is my life's desire if nothing else happens ever in my life if Lord if I can just see you if I could just see the Lord's Christ the one that takes away the sins of the world Lord if I can just see you fall down in a speech sister Shirley and praise him because God gave his son to us and that's what Christmas is about that's what this week is about my eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all the people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people is real other translations say a light for the Revelation to the Gentiles now don't just read over our scriptures when you read your Bible make sure that you're reading it all and there's some little nuggets in there that are absolutely just earth-shattering let me read that again it says here a light to lighten the Gentiles now in the Bible Gentiles were basically anything but Jews never in this book very seldom there's there's a couple um in judges but very seldom do you see a gentile mattering anyway anything in this Old Testament very very few times you don't see evangelism in the Old Testament you don't see people coming to the Lord and giving their hearts to God in the Old Testament you don't see that but look right when this Jesus is born all of a sudden the Gentiles are going to come to you can imagine why these how these priests are like what Gentiles they're filthy were God's chosen people Jesus by the grace of God was sent to you and me because brother Ed I think you you're a little bit of Jewish but but we're not but God was God sent this man to us also let me read John 3 16 one more time for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved that's the gospel and then Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel tell everybody about it and Joseph verse number 33 and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against this child will be the most hated man that has ever walked this Earth and he will also be the most loved man that has ever walked this Earth wherever he goes there's going to be hatred and there's going to be love even today Even in our lives today brother Jeremy at your work or wherever we are sometimes were mentioned the Lord Jesus in the right way not like the world does it's taking his name in vain but we mention the Lord Jesus and what he has done and you see hatred you see ridicule you see people making fun of it and then you see people say hey man I believe him with all my heart I'm a Christian I love the Lord Simeon said it in that day and it's carried all the way through and it'll carry all the way through to the end yay a sword shall pierce thine own soul also now Simeon remember is talking to Mary here yea a sword shall pierce through thine own soul that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed I studied this and I I researched this this verse and I what is but then what does that mean you know as I was as I was studying it I searched for brother Branham said about it I couldn't find anything and I and I was studying through the internet and I and what I what I think in my thoughts on this this is me speaking is that this is the first prediction right where is this born this is the first prediction of Jesus's death and the pain that it's going to bring to his mother you know so often we think everything is the spiritual thing and it's it's this big prophecy but don't forget there was a little mother that was proud of her little baby there and then 33 years later Mary the one that Simeon was talking to would see her son spread out on the cross and imagine her sadness but maybe she thought way back to the prophecy that this man sent me had given a sword shall pierce your own soul also imagine if it was our child you know I I think about Simeon and I think about this baby that was born and these Shepherds that came and they they were they they had just talked these angels and they're there and they're looking at this baby Mary's proud of it Joseph they they know that this is something that has come that's very special it's the Messiah of God but I don't think they didn't see Jesus in his glory Simeon didn't and I these Shepherds probably didn't either but they didn't see this Jesus Healing The Sick they didn't see this Jesus standing against the Pharisees and the Sadducees of that day they didn't see Jesus preaching the gospel this very strange gospel saying prefer your brother over yourself saying I would rather give a hundred bucks for Christmas than receive a hundred and receive the 20. strange gospel that's Jesus's spirit and Jesus they didn't see him in his power yet Simeon knew who he was and Anna knew who he was they didn't see Revelation chapter 5. way at the end of the book in The Book of Revelation they didn't see the John the Apostle John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos when these Seven Seals were locked up and there is right there is the book and the Book of redemption is standing right there no one no one could be saved without this opening and John is looking at it and the angel says who is worthy to open this book it was quiet no one was Worthy and it has the book there the scroll had seven seals on here inside of this everything was lost if it didn't open John looks and he must have thought it's all for naught brother Lyle it won't work I live my life I followed this man nothing it was all for naught you can see why he wept and then angel said John don't weep don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed this baby that was in the manger that same one that Simeon held up this Lion of the tribe of Judah John was he must have been confused he he looked and he looked to see a lion oh it's him it's the lamb the one I knew and he was a bloody lamb sister Rachel it was Jesus Christ that same one that was in that manger and all of redemption that was just in John's mind was just lost no and here comes Jesus and he breaks the seals seven of them opens up the book brother Branham said John must have seen his name in there and he shouted and the whole Heavens hurt him that's how important this man this baby that Simeon held up by the grace of God where are we verse 36. we'll finish we'll finish the chapter and there was one Anna a prophetess a daughter of fanuel of the tribe of Asher she was of great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow about four score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayer night and day what an example to all of us and she coming in that instant gave thanks life likewise unto the Lord and spake of them to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned to Galilee to their own City Nazareth and here we have the story of the birth of the Lord Jesus that is the importance of this week that is the importance of this day that's coming up I know it's not his birthday I know he wasn't born on December 25th but as brother Branham said that's the day that we honor that it's in commemoration it's important it's important not to be thinking about shopping and Christmas and swapping gifts and all that those things are good I'm not against those I've always given my kids presents and and tried to do things right but if it's not about that child that Simeon dedicated that day then we're off and it becomes this pagan holiday that Rome tried to set up but I'm not going to take part in it I'm gonna make this about our lord Jesus and then gives gifts have a tree don't have a tree have a Manger don't have a Manger do you know put it and make it about Christ that's the important thing I have a I wasn't gonna go here but I like to brother Dan here's the little little extra thing I uh I like to put us in this word whenever I Minister many times I'll say this book is not a history book take yourself and place yourself in here and look around and look around and what was happening at Jesus's time God had promised to send a deliverer let's look Way Back Into the Book of Exodus and what was going on when we needed a deliverer way back then Exodus chapter 1 verse 15. and again we see right here we see God's people needed a deliverer they were in bondage things were really bad at this time I think they're worse now verse number 15 and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives which the name of one of them was Shipra in the name of the other poor and he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it'd be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives fear God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of Egypt called for The Midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive and The Midwives said unto Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women for they are Lively and are delivered and are delivered Heir The Midwives come in unto them they fought back basically they were Lively they were going to give up their kids therefore God dealt with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared God that he had made them houses and Pharaoh now listen to this and Pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter you shall save alive it probably killed thousands of children and pharaoh was afraid of losing his way of life Pharaoh was afraid of this prophecy of this deliverer Pharaoh liked having these slaves he liked having his easy life so he said just kill the babies because I don't want to change my life this goes on to Matthew chapter 2. again it was time for another deliver to deliver to come it was promised The Book of Malachi that this man would come Isaiah and other books they were in bondage again with Rome now watch the spirit of Satan in Jesus's day the spirit of Satan and Moses day now watch the spirit of Satan in Jesus's day speaking of Joseph when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and there was until the death of Herod and and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of by the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt I've called my son then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding Roth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under killing the babies so we see in Moses's time over here kill the babies kill them because it I don't want to lose my way of life and then we always see over here Herod and he's saying the same thing kill the babies because I want to have my way of life I don't want anybody to challenge the way that I do things probably killed who knows how many that killed hundreds of thousands of people of babies back then in herod's day and I look today and it is again time for a deliverer to come it's been 2 000 years since the Lord Jesus came he promised that he was coming back he promised that he would send his messenger before him like John the Baptist came before Jesus introduce Jesus he promised again according to the Book of Malachi and other prophecies that he would again send a messenger before which he did and look at the situation that was in Moses's day killing the children look at the situation that was in Jesus day killing the children and look at the situation today how many Martin Luther's how many John Wesley's how many William seymours how many oral Roberts's how many Billy Grahams have been killed in the womb before they've ever had a chance to be born in today's world Millions millions are being killed the same evil spirit here today and we expect this Messiah to come and he's coming it's that same evil satanic spirit that was back then it was there when Jesus was here and it's here now if uh brother Peter if you come and the musicians but as amram was praying to the Lord Lord we need a deliverer as Simeon was praying Lord let me see the salvation of Israel so the bride at the End of This Book and Revelation Amen brother while Revelation chapter 22. verse 17 watch the spirit of God's people he sent to deliver with Moses he sent to deliver with Simeon Here with Jesus verse 17. Revelation chapter 22 17 it says this and you all can probably quote it by heart and the spirit and the bride and the spirit and the bride say come amen crying out Lord we need you we need you in this day I think of Simeon and how he cried and he wanted to see the salvation of Israel so bad in the first Christmas was there I think about that Shepherd and it's so hard for me to even think about how how he just started shaking when he saw that money there and I think if we really knew the meaning of Christmas if we really knew how much this child Jesus meant how could we not be shaking how could we not Lord cry out Lord come Lord thank you thank you for all that you've done we've seen the signs we've seen your messenger now Lord come and on this Christmas friends as as we're going through the week now as we're preparing for things in church and we having our Christmas time with families don't forget about the Child Jesus don't forget what he meant put yourself in the shepherd's Place put yourself in simeon's place put yourself in John's Place when he looked to see a lion and it was that same one put yourself in that place and that's how important this Christmas is it's about Jesus and all the other things that separate us and divide us about the all these little doctrines and stuff they don't matter as long as we have Christ and then Christ loved us so much he wanted this fellowship with us so much that he said not only brother am I going to be with you I want to be so close to you that I am going to enter your very being and then all of these questions that we have on our hearts honey when we were putting up trying to put up a cross rather than a tree and and not giving gifts to the kids or giving gifts to the kids that Spirit that's within us it tells us it tells us what we need to do it's not it's not a book of rules it's the spirit working within us that same spirit that same spirit that Simeon came he must have just walked up and said can I hold him can can I just hold him and he gets a hold of that little baby and that's what Christmas is and he lifted him up and said Lord I can depart now my friends I want to find him one day he's blessed me so much one day I want to see him as job said in my flesh I'll see God and I want to see him so bad That's What Christmas Means to me it's such an important thing make it about Christ tell your children and I know you do I I know the Roberts is over there and I know all the all the families here if we do talk about Jesus and we should and it's about him and tell the world about him like the Shepherds did God bless you all brother Peter if you'd come and uh have a Merry Christmas and a good week we could not honor any day greater well maybe between Easter and Christmas I don't know honor both of them I
