is [Music] so [Music] if somebody has something they want to say we're going to open it up for about 20 minutes or so and try to be conscious of the time that others may want to say something as well about i hired david one day to help me with a house and my brother was helping as well and and i was working on a ladder in the kitchen my brother was down there in the bedrooms doing something and david was out there by the front door and the inside he was bent over doing something i don't know what he was doing but he was acting like he was busy and all of a sudden the the doorbell rang puerto and i go back to the ladder and i go by david he's working down that i don't know what he was doing he's acting like he was doing something and i got up there on the ladder and that doorbell rings again so i get off the ladder i go back to the door open and there's nobody there yeah you know how strange so i go back to the kitchen i'm getting the back on the ladder and that doorbell rings the third time voice he was standing he was sitting there and he had the wire extended over and he was he was he was pushing the button on the on the doorbell and he never let me forget that either he's wanted he pulled something on you he'd never let you forget [Music] jordan this microphone right here thank y'all for coming to pay your respects there was nothing he couldn't do or couldn't fix and he started to take me to work listening to hammers and saws and nail guns guys yelling truck that he loves across the job site to where he was at once i found him it's about time uh he also took great practice working in himself he's tried to be the best the fastest the strongest the most productive guy on the job i remember um uh but uh but my that's the way my dad was he he wanted to work harder and better and faster than everybody else he wanted to be the strongest guy on the on the job site uh my dad was full of jokes full of stories uh most of when we heard i think it was only a handful of jokes and stories but we heard them so many times it seemed like a whole bunch i remember driving around with my dad around tucson and surrounding areas and stuff and be running errands or picking up material or just doing different things and he'd uh he'd point to a to a building or to a house or to a subdivision and uh first thing he would say i remember working over there back in uh you know back in 71 or whatever scott or a lloyd or you know whoever he was herman whoever he was working with you know and at the time and he was always so excited you know and he would tell me all the practical jokes and the stories that went along with each job site and each uh each of the his working buddies and stuff like that um and as time passed i felt kind of bad because he would he would you know point something out and he'd already showed me five times ten times you know building and what year and who you did it with and halfway through his sentence i'd finish the story for him and he would just kind of look at me and give me that serious face but the funny thing was whenever there was a new guy on the on the job site or you know somebody brought a a new person into the family he would always start with his jokes and his stories again and uh you know either me and david or somebody would dad we've already heard that 100 times come on he's all well they haven't leave me alone but uh i mean my dad as much as my dad loved work he loved his family too he didn't always convey it in an understandable way uh i can probably count on one hand and this is not saying anything bad about my dad but i can probably count on one hand you know the times he he said i love you tooie but but i know he did you know uh he's just that just wasn't the way he was and he was a he was a tough guy uh he my dad grew up he had a hard life he worked most of it and and he's at rest now and uh he's asleep he's asleep uh he was he wasn't a mushy guy so i understand but he did have a heart for people and his friends and family sometimes too big i know i'd get frustrated when when he would he was always trying to cut somebody a good deal give him a good price you know just that was his his main thing to help people out and that's great now i can see that now he used to frustrate me when when he was still doing it but uh that's the way he was as good as a a man as my dad was he wasn't perfect he had his flaws he made his mistakes i said some of the some wrong things at the wrong time sometimes he had his vices and his weaknesses just as we all do but he tried he tried his best at everything he did um you know and that's all we can do he he wasn't a perfect father but he was a great father he was as good as father as he could be and that's more than i can ask for um and i know for a fact something that that allows me to rest easy is that i know he loved the lord and i know that he feared the lord and i know that that was something that brings peace to me and and and i know that he's mateo julio now and my tea freddie and and his mom and all the family that's that's preceded him in death or sleep uh and i know they're having a good time up there i know they're they're having a better time than we are here um you know i was thinking i'm like i wonder if uh he's watching us you know he's watching me or kind of hanging out and uh he had this bracelet that he'd wear all the time and uh martha my stepmom gave it to me and it means a lot to me it really does it i wore it to work and i kind of felt like he was watching me you know kind of hanging out with me at work but then i started thinking about it i'm like well if i was if i was up there with with the lord and family i don't think i'd be wasting my time looking looking around down here on earth but uh you know i'd be wanting to meet adam and moses and you know all the noah and all the wow that that would be my my thing it's going to be my thing lord will uh my dad cherished his family he loved his nieces and nephews kids grandkids great-grandkids he was always happy to see see the kids and and play with them and make them laugh and you know tell jokes to them that was that was my dad uh he was a good man um i wanna read a couple of scriptures here um going to say a quick prayer before the reading the word of the lord lord may you bless the reading of your word here you may touch someone or all of us here lord may it comfort us and guide us please lord protect us in your precious holy name bless the reading of your word in jesus name amen first thessalonians 4 13 through 18 but we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about those who are asleep that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope for since we believe that jesus died and rose again even so through jesus god will bring with him those who have fallen asleep for this we declare to you to you by the word from the lord that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the lord will not perceive those who have fallen asleep for the lord himself will descend from heaven with the cry of command with the voice of an archangel and with the sound of the trumpet of god and the dead in christ will rise first then we who are alive who are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so we will always be with the lord amen this last one second corinthians 5 6-8 so we are always of good courage we know that while we are home in the body we are away from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight yes we are of good courage and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the lord those kind of kind of brought me a little bit of comfort i just thought i'd share them with you well god bless you all and and thank you again and uh thank you see if anybody else wants to say something you can take this time right now anybody okay we're gonna have a brother patrick brown you're gonna sing a song near the cross serga la cruz in english [Music] jesus keep me near [Music] the cross there are praises [Music] this dream [Music] ten [Music] the cross be my glory [Music] [Music] shall find rest beyond [Music] the rings [Music] the cross i'll watch [Music] trusting all until i reach that golden strength it lies just beyond [Music] me the cross near the cross be my glory [Music] my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the ring [Music] so beyond [Music] if the brothers would put the song the second spanish song is this song is about confronting death as paul did and scriptures were taken out of the bible to write this song [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Applause] a [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] moments want to just open the scriptures this morning and speak a little bit about what it is to encounter death and what the bible says about that in little los almost in psalms 116 15 if the brothers would put it up there is a [Music] to lose a child is one of the hardest things that someone could could ever feel and it's very very very hard i we buried my my daughter passed away last year in september and my brother in march my only brother in spite proverbs 14 32. if you can put it up there brothers i'll try to tell you before i read it the wicked is driven away in this wickedness but the righteous hath hope and his death seniors bible you know the world tells us the humanistic views that are in the world right now in secular views that there is no god there's no creator there's nothing after this life but the bible says that the righteous have hope in his death we're all flesh and bone and he was a man named job that in one day lost everything his health his children his wealth everything his own wife looked at him and said why don't you just curse die god and die with all of that he was in great sorrow and just being a man the mind is just blurred and con confused and and all this knee and he's and he said these words palabras job 14 verses 1 and 2. s that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he comes forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continue with not that's our life we are a lot of maybe 50 60 years 70 maybe 80 some might go 90 or 100 but very few we know that our time is allotted we know that our time is short here on earth he also said in job 14-5 seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that he passed not our days are appointed the bible says that that the steps of the righteous are ordered by god god has set limits we don't know that limit yo limits we know that many have come to this place and and they laid in a state in a coffin such as this right now young people adolescents older people middle aged there's no exception of persons when it comes to death and we know that the bible says there are no god sets the limits in the boundaries and we won't cross that day is where is david we could ask that question but man dieth and wastes away yay man giveth up the ghosts and where is he where is where is he what we have here are the remains the house that david lived in you know that soul of man which is a real person on the inside never gets old we get old this body this is a corrupted body we inherited this from eden but you know that that inside that inner man is it's hard to see the death someone we love and we might be in sorrow this morning not and just think what i know i went through these things last year so in job 14 and 14-16 if man should die shall he live again what a question to ask we we can ask the question why am i here why is all this was all this an accident or is there an intelligence behind all of this is he said all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come he knew there was a change coming we all know there's a change it's an appointed time and a change that's coming forth for every one of us responded it says here thou shalt call and i will answer thee he knows your name this morning he knows your name he knows the sorrow he knows the pain he knows the suffering is he says thou shalt call and i will answer thee that will have a desire to to the work of thine hands he formed us he made us he will call us before him one day will stand before him for thou for now thou numberst my steps not even one step further than what he has numbered will we take does thou not watch over my sin the all-seeing eye of god we have a book of life there's a book it's called the book of life every one of us there is a book written and all our deeds are written there there will be a cut there will come a day of of judgment the bible says the the judgment was set and the books were opened books plural the book of your life the book of my life so the question is this morning is abraham said he sleepeth he's asleep because we as christians we don't believe we die we change a geographical position our john 11 11 through 15. jesus jesus had a friend his name was lazarus and he had gotten sick and they sent word to jesus you know jesus said they had sent word he didn't come and lazarus died but jesus knew that when he was far away and he turned the disciple and he says you know uh he said uh well here it is the scripture right here he says in them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well next verse howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep entonces we had to talk to them in their terms he's dead in ton says uh then jesus said unto them plainly lazarus is dead versus john 11 11 20-27 anton says he came back to bethany maria marta we find that when jesus is coming back to bethany that martha saw him walking towards bethany and she went ahead to meet him on the road and here we find these scriptures she goes to him she says lord if he had been here my brother lazarus he would not have died but i know that whatever you ask of god god is going to give it to you jesus jesus led if i would say this morning jesus said now lazarus shall rise again he shall rise again if i will say to you this morning what would you think one day david will rise again well i know he's to he's going to rise again he says that be the next verse brother 23 probably or 25 yeah see i am the and she says martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the last day she puts away over there but jesus looks at her can you imagine had you been martha standing there that day your brother laying four days in a tomb after the third day the body begins to decay rapidly the eyes cave in and and and the inside the internal organs everything just starts to get eat up so it was more than just death he was he he was he was corrupted it was a fourth day i think jesus did it on purpose the word god says dust thou art dust thou shall return jesus he looks at her and she says oh way over there sometime no says martha listen to me i am the resurrection and the life amen she was looking at the very fountain of life standing there fuente de vida paraguay [Music] believing a religion or a tradition or even a church not even this one they're just walls but believing in him believing in jesus christ he is the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto him unto the father but by him hallelujah he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen amigo shall not die he asked her a question he said believe is i ask you this morning do you believe do you believe in the resurrection i want to cut it short as much as i can but just let me give you this few minutes more the whole world everything around us the very nature itself speaks of the resurrection we just have to open our eyes and look around you see a tree in the summertime bueno verona you see that tree there full of life those leaves and the birds and and all these things and and we see that how that that that that the the that it's it it's symbolic of a young person full of life and young and healthy and vibrant and strength and everything but you know it doesn't stay that way we know that life goes on then fall comes and the leaves begin to fall off hair begins to start turning gray and fall out the shoulders get stooped we start our eyes begin to get dim it's called old age and in autumn we see that and then when winter comes that life comes winter time goes into the roots into the ground talking of death buried in the ground is that the end of the story no wait around till spring is [Music] of a life a death and then a resurrection you see the sun in the morning how it rises weak in the morning in the east memorial salir la manana and we see that the sun is zenith in the middle of the day in the strength speaking of a young man a young woman full of life and full of energy and full of youth and health but does this remain there no it goes on that sun continues to go and then it starts to get weak again speaking of old age infirmities and things of that nature and then the son is the sun goes down behind the mountains and then darkness comes speaking of death a life being born lived old age dying death is that the end of the story is a certain man in our day a leader a religious leader stood up and said that the greatest failure of god was the cross allowing his son to die on the cross he called it a failure of god because he doesn't know the scriptures the cross was the greatest victory that was ever won for mankind because that bee having just one stinger he stung his his stinger into christ and all he is is just a bluff because we come to this place right here and we just step into another place it doesn't stop the christian for me to live is christ and to die is gain this is our victory the victory greatest victory ever won satan lost the battle and we are the victors in closing this morning i had another scripture i wanted to give but brother abraham he gave that scripture we know paul said behold i show you a mystery [Music] maybe it's still a mystery to us in a way because we never we have not experimented with death this is first corinthians brother 15 51-58 we should not all die but we shall all be changed from in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last drop for the trumpeter god shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible amen and we shall be changed vista for this corruptable shall put on incorrupt and this mortal shall put on immortality equando esto victoria verse 54 brother and when this corruptor shall put on incorruption and when this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death listen is swallowed up in victory the death of christ on the cross was not a failure but it was swallowed up in victory and because of that we come into victory donde esta o muerte if david could speak to us right now you could stand on this platform right now in that new body he has right now he'd tell you oh death where is your victory here where is i sting oh grave where is thy victory is this thing of death is sin and sin is the strength of the law that's why there's a law that's why there's a rules god's trying to keep us in check but thanks be unto god who gives us a victory amen by the lord jesus christ i seek hermanos verse 58 brother mios amados it's a work that never ends our walk until he calls us through foreign is not in vain 25-27 and after that we'll be singing the song i won't cross the jordan alone [Music] he was he was hurt so badly he was a sorrow his heart was broken his mind was confound confused and he lost all his children he lost all he had and he was asking the question like any man would oh god is this all there is is there nothing better than this this is all there is that life's got to offer is there life after death after he got his thoughts back together again there was an anchor in his soul and we as christians as an anchor we may lose our our minds sometime and lose our thoughts and forget who we are but he'll always come back and remind us we're anchored in christ thomas like a ship in the ocean and the storm and the waves striking against it it's the things of life and the the all the things that you might be i've gone through already you can look back in your past no sickness and cancers and all kinds of things and people passing away and last year was a year of death for me and we go through all these things and it's like a ship on this on the sea of life and being struck by the winds and by the rain and by the there's a little song that says the anchor holds though this ship is battered the anchor holes though the sails are torn i've fallen on my knees to face the raging seas the anchor holds us he said in job 19 25. [Music] so he said for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god hallelujah whom i shall see for myself [Music] hallelujah and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reigns be consumed within me [Music] [Music] david he was a very gentle person you know the gentleness the kindness in him and yeah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] go [Music] that jordan speaks of death that jordan river we're all going to cross many before it have already crossed much the word of god will not return back void but it has power and if you feel this morning that something was spoken to you in your heart with every hitbox nobody's looking around just raise up your hand and say lord i lord i want a closer walk with you god bless you god bless you god bless you i see hands going up through the audience god bless you in the back god bless you over on the left repeat after me repeat me these words i want to pray this morning father this morning we come to your presence lord seeing the life of david figueroa gone on into the eternities lord we'll never see him again in this life but there's a hope that we shall see him over there lord this morning your word spoke to me i put them in your hands this morning every hand that was raised may god bless each one of these hands these persons that they feel their heart was spoken to yes this world will not return back for it we thank you for your word this morning we thank you lord for the life of david a wonderful man my my precious cousin i loved him respected him he respected me lord we thank you for his life i ask lord you will that you will comfort every heart lord that's hurting this morning that you put your hand upon their life lord that lord that this will cause them lord to turn to you quindos causes seniority foreign [Music] amen familiares hermanas david sobrinos consuelas corazones solo puede there are tables that are set over here next door in the fellowship hall there are three ways to get back in there and the the table's already set and we're just going to say a quick prayer for the food and bless the food and to bless the fellowship father this morning we ask your blessing upon the food we're going to partake of lord and bless our hands and prepared it and all that was done the money that was spent and bless these things father we pray and and all the fellowship that has done lord god may be pleasing to your eyes saying we just ask it in jesus christ's name [Music] god bless you you're dismissed [Music] i won't have to cross [Music] i won't have to cross jordan alone jesus with the darkness i see he'll be waiting for me i won't have to [Music] alone jesus died all my sins to atone with the darkness i see you'll be waiting for me i won't have to cross jordan i won't have to cross jesus died all my sins too with the darkness i see he'll be waiting for me i won't have to cross jordan alone i won't have to cross jesus [Music] with the darkness i see [Music] he'll be waiting for me i won't have to cross [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you [Music] great [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] do [Applause] [Music] you
