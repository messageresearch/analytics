god told us is that he dwelled with his universe you dwelled in his son he said he dwelt his word he said but then god in us and i believe tonight that's the greatest privilege we have is knowing that he is not just god above us or just god with us but he's god in us do you believe that this evening amen may god bless you bless you this evening while you're standing if you have your bibles we'll invite you to the book of proverbs the 24th chapter proverbs the 24th chapter and we want to look here in the third verse and sure want to take this opportunity to greet you in the name of the lord we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be with you here this weekend and pray that something was said this morning to encourage and to help you and to bless you in your journey and i just want to take a thought here tonight in book of proverbs the 24 24th chapter and the third verse solomon writing here says through wisdom isn't a house builded and by understanding it is established through wisdom isn't house builded and by understanding it is established in the book of first corinthians the third chapter first corinthians the third chapter and the eighth verse i want to speak to you a little bit tonight about building here and in first corinthians 3 and verse 8 paul here writing says now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth their own but let every man take heed how he built a therapon for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try some of they say try the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire then in second peter the first chapter one last place i'd like to read this evening and we'll pray and let you be seated in second peter the first chapter and i want to look there in the fifth verse the bible tells us that my wisdom is a house builded by understanding is a house established then paul's going to tell us about the foundation now we realize if you're going to build something you've got to have material to build it out of in second peter first chapter in the fifth verse peter says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you if these things be in you and abound they make you they build you they establish you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ we ask lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as we just buy our heads together and we'll just ask the lord to come and speak to us heavenly father lord as your believing children have gathered themselves together here this evening father i realize that this is lord another service another opportunity lord that you have given us in this hour that we could come into your house and we could lay aside the cares of life we could lay aside the situations and the circumstances the things we're going through and father for just a few moments tonight i would ask that your grace would be ministered to our hearts i pray that you would come lord may you anoint us afresh tonight dear god lord may you move us aside lord that we could lord be a vessel that you could come and speak through but father may you not just anoint the speaker but may you anoint the here also lord and whatever lord any spirit that would try to hinder this meeting or bind it in any way i pray oh god you would drive it out of the building you would drive it away from the hearts of your children that liberty could come in this meeting tonight and lord when we would leave this place may we be able to say lord as those on the road to emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as he come and talk to us along the way and we'll be sure to give you all the praise and to give you all the honor and glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen and may god richly bless you this evening as you have your seats amen from those scriptures tonight i want to talk to you here for just a few moments on a thought and if i would title this tonight i want to speak to you on the material that god built his church out of the material that god built his church out of and the message the infallible word of god brother brahma says what kind of material are you built out of is it methodist baptist catholic presbyterian lutheran pentecostal nazarene pilgrim holiness he says if you're not built out of bible material he said the boards drove on by the holy ghost he said then you better tear off the boards and get built right so if you're not built out of bible material he's actually saying tear down what's been built without the right material and go back and build it with the right material in another quote he says i think every christian amen ought to take the same attitude that's right we want to know where we're standing we don't want our eternal destination amen built upon the shifting sands of some church theology amen but on the eternal word of the living god right because remember every one of you sitting here tonight he said stormy times is going to hit that building that you're setting in tonight that's right he said death is going to strike it and you better know what kind of a sand it's built upon or what kind of a foundation it has now i think tonight that we're all aware that we're not angels here tonight but we're humans we're we're human beings we have trials we have tribulations we have persecution amen we go through all kinds of things and sometimes i i'll be reading through the bible and i'll read about paul or peter or james or john amend different men in the bible and you read about them and you see the things they went through and when you read about the things they went through something comes over you to say how did they go through that and come out still a christian how how did they go through that and come out a believer and then sometimes i think well you know i'd like to go find those people i like to sit down and talk to him which we all know that they've gone beyond the curtain of time now they've passed on to their reward amen but then the reality strikes my heart amen that those people that went through those things amen may be gone amen but the god that got them through what they went through is the same god that is here with the church tonight and therefore if god got them through their trials if god got them through their tribulation then that same god is here tonight so i'm speaking to a people tonight amen that as i said this morning is a people of paradox amen it is a people that you it is incredible that you're still here amen amen the world don't know why you're still here let's just preach for a moment amen the the you may not even know why you're here tonight but let me say this amen if god has still got you here he's got you here for a purpose amen if god has preserved your life and has kept you amen through everything you've been through amen then you're here for a purpose tonight now i was just recently listening to a tape and the tape was presuming preached in 1962 and the prophet of god says amen to presume means to venture without actual authority now we realize that the world tonight is in a presuming state can you say man amen they're presuming they're guessing they're hoping they're probing they're looking for something amen the world is in a presuming mode then we find amen that the church world has moved under that same condition where it's not just the world presuming it's not just governments presuming or politicians presuming but actually churches are presuming church leaders are presuming but the problem of god is going to say this is not the hour amen to be presumed he would say now we're not here presuming anything we see it we know that god is here amen the holy spirit the great god the god of elijah amen the holy ghost which is the witness of the last day is pulling his ministry right into the church the same thing that our lord did he said the high priest is descending from the throne amen to the church and the church is heaping itself up with the word because he can only come to the word he is the word he said the word can't come to an almanac it won't fit amen so the word has to come to the word amen then we find tonight that we're not building out of theology amen we're not building out of education but we're building actually by bible material which is the word then we find tonight that the bride of jesus christ she is not presuming amen she knows who she is amen she knows who's she is amen she knows where she come from she knows where she's at and she knows where she's going the right of jesus christ he is not presuming we have amen scriptural and supreme authority tonight can you say amen amen your amens won't scare me okay amen we have supreme authority and we have scriptural authority now we find denied that not anybody can be the bride of jesus christ it is not an open invitation it is only to the elected amen the chosen of god from before amen the foundation of the world those are the ones that god amen has called to be his bride amen in this hour then we find amen that the bride is not amen she is not called to be bribed by her own will amen but god called her to be the bride in the message of total deliverance the prophet said when god sends a man to do anything amen he completely equips him with everything that he has need of if god calls a man to be a preacher then he puts something in him to preach with if he calls him to be a teacher he puts something in him to teach with if he calls him to be a prophet then he put something in him to see visions and to be a prophet god always amen completely equips his man amen so if he calls him to be a preacher he's not asking the man to go out in the world or to something some seminary and find a material to preach with but actually he's going to give him the stuff to manifest the call that is upon his life then i'll say it this way amen we're not looking for material tonight to be the bride amen but we already have the material to be the bride of jesus christ when god calls a man he completely equips the man when god calls a teacher he completely equips the teacher when god calls a singer amen he completely equips the singer amen then when god calls a bride he completely equips the bride amen with what she has need of to fulfill amen the commission that has been placed upon her life by the almighty god amen i think of how in genesis the sixth chapter amen that noah did not call god amen but god called noah amen and he called him to do something he called him to build he meant and to build the ark now brother says god actually gave noah the order amen the form and the use of the ark in genesis 6 chapter and the 13th verse and god said and in noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth but make thee an ark of go for wood amen room shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shall make it of the length of the ark amen shall be 300 cubits and the breadth of it 50 cubits and the height of it 30 cubits a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the ark shall thou set in the sight thereof amen with lower second and third story shalt thou make it and behold i which is god even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth amen to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life amen from under heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die amen but i love verse number 18 amen but with fee i will establish my covenant and thou shall come into the ark thou shalt and my sons and thy wife and thy son's wife with thee and of every living thing of all flesh amen two of every sort shall i bring in the ark amen to keep them alive with thee and thou shall be male and female of fouls after their kind of cattle after their kind of creeping thing of the earth after his kind amen too of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive and take thou unto thee all of the food that is heated and thou shall gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them and thus did noah according to all that god commanded him amen so did he amen what's amazing here is god actually delivers unto noah some instructions and he says no i want you to build an ark now the prophet picks this up and says noah's works expressed to man what his faith was in god's promise he said now god met noah and he said noah it's going to rain i'm going to destroy the whole earth with water now it never had rain that's the impossibility amen but said prepare an arc of the dimensions that i tell you about and him being a carpenter he went to work and began to take his footed eyes and everything to cut the boards and fix it up there with the him wood and put the pitch in it just like he said and you imagine what people thought about that man they said that man is actually crazy because he says it's going to bring water out of the heavens and there's no water up there but you see noah didn't think about that his works was expressing to the people what his faith was and what god said would take place that's the reason the genuine christian amen separates himself from everything but the word of god amen no matter what the people think what anybody else says he isn't just saying that if he is it won't be long till his works will be make known he'll fall back and slip this way and join this when he'll show what he is but if he is a genuine if the word of god has been it in him then it's going to bring forth of its kind you'll see that man preparing for that great hour see that's the way noah did amen now think of this noah receives instructions amen to build an ark and the prophet put a beautiful thing in there he said and noah being a carpenter amen noah being a carpenter receives amen the blueprint amen now here's what astounding to me is no one is not look at it and say god we need to change this and we need to change that and we need to change this but noah just receives it and he actually begins to work on it no matter how crazy it looks no matter how ridiculous it is he meant because noah had a commission and god sent him the material to fulfill the commission amen we didn't know until the prophet told us that there were other boats in those days we just thought there was the ark amen but the prophet said in those days there were other boats you do know brother baby said that right in those days there were other boats in the days of noah when noah was building that great boat that was going to stem the tides well no doubt but many of the church members of that day said why that fanatic what if it does happen what if it does happen what if it doesn't happen what if there does come a storm well we'll get an our boat and ride amen because our boat is as good as their boat our boat will float as much as theirs whether it's god constructed or not they say i belong to this church i joined over here that's as good as any of them he said remember when the floods came amen only the god-constructed boat floated when the floods began to descend amen only the god-constructed boat was the only one that flooded in other words they presumed they would be all right amen but presuming amen was the ticket to drowning amen but obedience was the ticket amen to getting on the god constructed boat and he says unless that is god constructed it will not stand no denomination unless it's god constructed by god's construction here that it will not stand see it has to come the way that god said build it amen it's got to be holy ghost material and holy ghost material actually makes holy ghost people holy ghost material amen makes holy ghost people he said a cypress boat material amen makes a cypress boat a poplar material makes a poplar boat see what i mean and a worldly material makes a whirly church amen but a holy ghost material actually makes a holy ghost church amen then you find noah's construction amen was according to his instruction which came from god he said he know that his construction had been according to his instruction and i wonder if our construction will compare with the instructions that we have been given see now when noah's family got on the ark amen they saw the other boat seeking amen they looked out the window and no doubt noah's daughter-in-law's no doubt noah's sons and his and his and all those people amen no doubt they knew those other people amen no doubt they had went to school with them amen they had played with them amen and when they got in that ark and noah and the door was closed and they looked out the window and they saw amen the rain began to fall and they begin to see it accumulate and they begin to see those other boats that their friends were in they begin to see them sink the prophet said it this way he said finally the waters got deeper he and deeper and deeper he said but noah checked everything every corner was pitched in he said mother it's got to work god promised it this way why she said i looked out there and i saw the joneses and so forth their boat sunk right down and ours is still setting on the ground amen it just takes a little more persecution amen a little more judgment of god to bring it up and finally the waters got deeper and deeper and after a while the whole family felt something move he meant and she left the ground amen all of a sudden they began to feel a move and she left the ground and i'm kind of getting tired of this old pest house at 53 years old one of these days i expect amen to feel something move we want to leave and the ark was going up while the other sank amen the ark was going up god in his word had fulfilled his promise amen and now here's what i want you to notice amen satan tried to discourage him amen he tried to discourage him through the people of that day through the religions of that behavior amen to the science of that day but there was nothing the devil could anoint people amen to discourage noah with amen that was enough to stop him from building because a commission fell upon his life and in the face of every adversary amenoa was made out of stuff amen that was not destroyed amen that was not that was not that was not persecuted enough to quit working amen is it okay to have church here tonight i mean i think that's what we gathered for a ride amen let me say this church the only reason why you're here is because you're not made out of stuff amen that falls apart at the first trouble that falls apart at the first situation amen can we preach tonight amen some of you have been through enough stuff you shouldn't be sitting here tonight amen satan's trying to discourage you he's tried to beat you he's tried to kill you amen but the reason why you're here tonight is because you're a holy ghost church aiming with holy ghost material and that's the material that will weather the flood it will weather the bombs it will weather the war oh god it'll weather every storm that comes this way because it's god's material my to thank noah amen was discouraged amen noah was he was he was beat down he was lifetime he was made fun of amen but he never lost the vision he never lost sight of what god told him to do now one thing that amazes me is in order to accomplish a project amen there has to be a master which a master means one in charge amen now you found the ark it would have never got built amen had noah left the instructions up for opinions amen it's amazing when noah received the instructions from the lord and he takes them down there he doesn't go down there and gather all the city around and say what do you think about this amen but he judged him faithful that delivered the instructions amen because people would have said noah amen there's no need to build it this big and there's nobody to deal with that big amen but god was looking for obedience amen god was looking for somebody amen that would just stand and do what he called him to do in the face of criticism i think it's amazing how the prophet said i'm not trying amen to a serp authority or something like that but you see a man or anything with two heads to it doesn't know how to go god never did have two heads to his church he never did it's one head he always dealt in every generation as we've studied through the scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two men amen you get two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute amen and my absolute is the word amen the bible amen then you see why amen we got 900 different denominations it's because they never came to one absolute we've got amen we've got now that was that was in the 60s that we had 900 amen but think about tonight i think last time i had a camp there was 33 000 amen different sections and different breakups and different denominations amen based upon one bible they're all claiming the same bible and 33 000 different churches amen different opinions of one bible which one do we follow amen but here's the shout material in the last days god would send a prophet that would take the same bible that they were divided by and would open it up to the bride and that bible would not divide the church that bible would unite the church and i say tonight amen because we've got a message amen i don't think there should be any opinion different on predestination than what a prophet taught i don't think there's any room amen for a different opinion on the seventh seal than what the prophet taught are you hearing me amen sometime or another church we've got to come back amen to one final absolute or that job will never get done amen see we've got to come back amen to one final absolute and that is the word see now you find then in colossians 1 16 my bible says for by him somebody say by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him created by him and for him and he is before all things amen and by him all things consist see then if there's got to be a master amen then christ is the master of all things he is the master of all things and let me say this and he is in all things the prophet said whether it be father son holy ghost he is before all things before all things that's in heaven and earth visible invisible or anything this son of god was before all things that's right i don't care if it's thrones dominions whatever it is amen heavenly thrones amen kingdoms whatever it might be in the great supernatural realm beyond in the eternities where it was whatever it was angels gods whatever it was he is before all things and there is nothing amen that can make it run but him see then a prophet here is turning our focus amen back not to a man but to christ and saying whether it's god the father god the son whether it's the angels the principalities the powers dominions whatever it is all things run by him and all things consist by him and the prophet shouts he amen let's say that together he see who is that he it is christ amen the return of christ in the church see the master what what does the word master mean the word master means having or showing very great skill amen or proficiency amen the main thing or the principal thing now we find then that the prophet is going to tell us that christ is the principal or the master he says he is the principal theme of the entire bible the bible is christ another place he says he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is in the thanks to come he is the same yesterday amen today and forever amen see notice here he should be the principal amen tucson tabernacle can i talk to you tonight amen if you're going to go forward amen if you're going to take your family forward if you're going to go any further amen than where you are right now amen christ has got to return as the principal theme amen of our talking amen of our singing of our church gathering amen if christ is not the theme of this church we might as well turn the lights off amen and board up the doors it's another building with a bunch of religious people amen but if christ comes in amen if christ comes in the church he will be the principal theme of our thinking he will be the principle theme of our singing he will be the principle theme of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life oh somebody say christ amen christ if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us amen then he should be the principal theme of everything we do amen say or think should be christ that might say it this way only what's done by christ and for christ will last only what's done by christ amen and for christ will last now if you look in psalms 127 verse 1 david says it this way he says accept the lord amen build the house except who the lord build the house amen they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city then the watchman waketh but in vain see so david here is showing you if the lord does not do it then we're wasting our time if the lord is not in it then it will not be a success if christ is not the principle of it then it's only a matter of time amen before it falls apart before enough storms hits it before enough troubles hit it before it crumbles at the foundation amen but if it is built by christ amen there is no fire too hot there is no water too powerful there is no storm too strong that can tear down amen what god has built up and i'll say to you tonight church amen let's just have church here tonight if that's okay this church amen if you'll agree with me you've been through some things you've been through some troubles you've been through some hard times you've been through some let downs you've been through some victories amen but why is tucson tabernacle amen still standing here tonight amen because the lord built the house amen because the lord amen would raise up a ministry amen to build the church not on the foundation of a man on the foundation of christ the word and if it's built on christ then it'll last are you hearing me if it's built on christ then there's nothing coming there's nothing being and there's nothing that is that'll tear down what the lord has done my to think tonight if the lord builds the house amen if christ amen is the master of the building now you realize there in first corinthians 3 where we read the bible says paul amen was a master builder right amen now what made paul a master builder it was because christ was in him and who is christ christ is the master see the master was in paul amen see now if i said this way amen if you take a man who is a murderer and he goes around killing people and he goes around shooting and cutting and all kinds of terrible crimes but he's a murderer see he's a he's just any kind of murderer amen but if john dillinger's spirit comes in him that's going to make him the master murderer amen because john dillinger was actually titled amen the master murder amen let me say it this way if you take an individual that plays a piano they play the piano beautiful amen they're just another piano player amen but if beethoven's spirit comes in them he meant because beethoven was claimed to be amen a master pianoist then if beethoven's spirit comes in them it's going to move them amen from being a pianist amen to being a master pianoist amen then you see amen paul was another builder among other builders amen but when the spirit of christ amen descended into paul it moved him amen from being a prophet amen to being a master prophet amen from being a preacher and just a builder amen to a master builder why because christ was in him then can i say tonight church it was not paul building amen but it was christ it was christ who had claimed paul's body amen see it wasn't paul building amen paul was a surrendered vessel amen that christ had claimed amen it was christ building through paul in first corinthians 3 10 according to the grace of god which is given to me as a wise master builder amen as a wise master builder now the the word definition their master builder is an architect the superintendent in the erection of buildings the master of a project so when paul is talking here he is not talking about a physical building amen but what he's talking about he's talking about a people see the church that paul's talking about was not a building amen the church was a body a men of people who truly believed in jesus christ i find it amazing that god actually gave paul the grace amen the strength and the power and the ability to reach people for jesus christ and to assemble them together into a body to worship god see whether where they met did not matter amen can i preach to you tonight amen this church here this building is a beautiful building amen but if tomorrow it was gone the church is still here are you hearing me if tomorrow the building and god forbid but if the bill didn't burn up or or a flood was trying to build and amen and you couldn't gather in this building the church is still here amen the church is not dissolved amen the church is not washed away because the church is not a building amen the church is a body so what paul is saying is they could meet in a home they could meet in a hut they could meet in a cave they could meet in a field a backyard a public building or a church building but wherever the body was they could have church brother amen so it so then that tells me the church amen actually it's not the building but it's the people so when paul says i am a wise master builder he's not talking about laying concrete he's not talking about putting up sheetrock amen or putting tuba force together but he's talking about taking people amen and beginning to build with people now now the message here ye him so glad to be here at the church again tonight the church is not exactly a church building amen but a church is where the people have gathered another place he says the old testament amen the church was called the kingdom of god in other words god is a king and the church is his domain amen seek god's kingdom the old testament in the new testament it's called the messianic empire oh i like that messianic in other words and otherwise the messiah's empire therefore amen the church is not an organization amen the church is not a gathering of people amen the church is the people of god that has been called out of the world to serve in another kingdom amen now let me see it this way through seven amen successive church ages amen god has been building a people in the message dedication now we already have the stones amen the stones that god for ordained see and we've got them all the way from ephesus amen to laodicea now think about this the prophet goes all the way back amen to ephesus and says from ephesus to smyrna amen to pergamos to fight tyra amen this hardest to philadelphia until all those seven ages amen was stoned amen but was people amen and we've got them but we're only waiting amen for that headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming he says the capping stone now but the troop ride another place the first seal the true bride will be made up of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every age every time a message went forth and the people believed it and accepted it all the light it was when they were sealed amen then they were sealed away until that day of redemption are you hearing me amen then paul amen built the ephesians amen each messenger built the people amen but in this last day there's going to be more in heaven than just what come out of laodicea he says another place harvest time look hurry and there must come a true seed amen see there's got to be one because he's coming for the bride without spot a wrinkle he is coming for it amen he calls it a word vindicated bride oh she'll be such a bitty a little bitty group but jesus said as it was in the days of noah wherein eight souls were saved so shall it be in the coming of the son of man how many i don't know but seek the bride somebody shout the bride but the bride is going to be made up of all down true that had the word in their age it's not just this last group but god is going to take the whole thing out of there then if you'll look within the book of revelation the first chapter and the 12th verse here paul is writing about the patmos vision and in the 12th verse he says and i turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned he says i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one amen was one like in the son of man who was clothed the garment down the foot and dirt about with pabst with a golden girdle now notice here you've got you've got seven candles i mean you've got seven candlesticks you've got seven amen seven spirits amen one with each age but in the middle of those it's not two men amen it's not three men but it's one like unto the son of man which is christ amen then you read that and you say what what is that seven candlestick what what is that then in verse 20 jesus speaking the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches can i say it this way those seven stars amen were seven master builders seven stars amen seven master builders each age messenger amen was building but they were building by christ amen in the star messenger of that age see it was christ that came into paul it was christ that came into luther it was christ that came into wesley it was christ are you hearing me that came into martin it was christ that came into columbia the product of god picks this up in the church age book how many thanks gone for a church age book he says in his right hand were seven stars and he had in his right hand seven stars now of course we already know from verse 20 that the seven stars actually are he said the mystery the seven stars are the angel messengers amen of the seven churches now we couldn't make a stake here on any account as he interprets it for us notice here brother brahm's not interpreting this but he's saying he that wrote it is here to interpret it he is interpreting it for us these seven stars are the messengers to the seven successive church ages they are not called by name they are just set forth at seven but one do we change from the ephesian age on down to this layout of sin age each messenger brought the message of truth to the people never failing to keep the word of god amen to that particular church h amen see each one held to it they were steadfast somebody somebody shot steadfast amen they were steadfast in their loyalty to the original lie notice here they were a light amen but notice where their light was coming from it was coming from the original light amen which who was the original which was christ which was like in the son of man in the uh are you hearing me tonight amen the whole purpose here is christ has got to be the master he has got to be the conductor he has got to be the architect he has got to be the superintendent or it will not stand their strength amen was from the lord or they could have never stemmed the tide they truly were yielded to him and kept by his omnipotence now notice here it's not hard amen now it's not hard to stand up and keep true to a creed it is easy for the devil is right behind all that but it is something else to be true to god's word and go back to what the word originally produced after pentecost see not only men said the roman catholic church had to be the true church how many has ever heard that he said now notice here they said it'd be the true church because all the things has been through all the changes he said and it's still going brother branham said any church with the government behind it and with its own creed which isn't the word at all and with no manifested ministry with no manifested ministry to cause the devil to get aroused could surely carry on see there's no mystery why that the roman catholic church is carried on because the government's been behind it amen politicians has come out of it are you hearing that amen all kinds of corruption is being amen laying right there brother matthew and the bed of that thing amen and it stemmed ever tied amen and the prophet of god capped it off and said another reason why amen there's been no persecution against it is because there's no manifested ministry what is a manifested ministry it is a ministry amen that christ gets a hold of and christ manifests himself through that ministry you tell me one time amen that christ has manifested himself to the pope but i'll tell you of another man by the name of william branham amen that for seven times around the world amen christ would meet him on the platform amen christ would meet him in the jungles of india christ would meet him in portland oregon christ wouldn't mean him right here in tucson arizona and would claim his body and would manifest himself through that ministry are you hearing me tonight amen this comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only but every true believer is in the hand of god and can draw from his loving power and receive the full benefit of all that god is to the believer what god gives the messenger and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen now what is his body the building see then we say paul was a wise master builder then can i say william branham by the same grace of god that was given paul was a wise master builder of that age was given brother branham to be a wise master builder of this age see he says on the angel amen of the church of the laodiceans right now i'm one that don't like to read scripture when i've got an interpretation on it and continue reading it in ignorance is that okay amen let me say it this way unto william mary and branham there's an angel there but let's put a name there is this okay amen there's no resistance to stand here and call billy graham's name there's no resistance to call oral roberts or but but call the prophet's name and every devil in hell raises up amen to try to shut that man up amen but there are some men in this last day that is anointed with the same spirit that was up on paul to withstand that persecution there is some men in the land today that will withstand every devil and will preach this message until every sickness is healed until ever demon is defeated until the power of god moves in the church again because we're not under another dispensation we're under our dispensation see under the angel under brother branham the church of our sins write these things said the amen the faithful and the true witness amen the beginning of the creation of god brother says we're not building an organization i'm not here this morning amen to build an organization christ never sent me amen to build an organization christ sent me a men to build individuals to the stature of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse somebody shall powerhouse that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word by his word see what now know this year build up the individual to that place not the organization the individual amen now we're made up of light meters inside of us is cosmic light now that cosmic light is a light that they can take an x-ray with but the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray light it comes from your own light and then if that cosmic light say could be pushed to a place where not cosmic light would eternal light god could dwell supremely amen to do our thinking to do our walking to do our talking then it's no longer the man it's god in the man are you hearing me tonight church amen then when the prophet said those seven angel messengers were drawing from the original light they were not drawing from cosmic light they were not drawings next to ray light they were drawing from eternal light and a prophet right here says if you push the cosmic light out of the way and the eternal light comes in then that's god in the man doing his thinking doing his talking doing his walking it's no longer the man it's god in the man doing the building see every building amen must have a foundation do you agree with that there are two types of foundations jesus spoke of those in matthew 7. he said there is one that is built upon a rock he said there is another one that is built upon the sand now isaiah 28 16 if you can give me that verse i'd appreciate it isaiah 28 16 the bible says therefore thus saith the lord god amen behold i lay in what behold i lay in zion amen for a foundation stone now what is zion a type of the prophet said the zion is a type of the bride so here isaiah prophesies and the lord says behold i lay in zion amen behold i put in zion amen a foundation stone which is a tried stone which is a precious cornerstone it is a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste amen leave that up there for me if you don't mind in saint john 6 53 verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you realize that offended them and jesus picked it up and said do this offend you in verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away but notice who speaks here then simon peter answered and said unto him lord to whom shall we go for thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe notice this next word and are sure we believe and are sure and what did the bible say i lay a sure foundation we believe and are sure amen that thou art that christ the son of the living god now you know brother picks this up into whom shall we go and says it this way he said there are seven things that we must come to jesus for he said the fourth is jesus is the only safe and secure foundation he said that's right a lot of people build upon riches what does it do it leads to slavery you become a slave to your money see there are jesus many penny heirs as there is millionaires will be in hell because it's your attitude towards it what god has given you now if you build it upon riches it'll fall can i tell you a few things if you can leave that there i appreciate it amen can i tell you a few things here that america's doing america right now is trying to build upon the foundation of popularity and then you look at young people they try to look and act like the television and the movie stars and the brother said what does it do it leads to a ruined life of chaos it stumbles of hay it stubbles of hay which will be burned at the judgment many people are building upon the foundation of education and the prophet says school is all right but it will never take the place of christ teenagers he says have gotten so rough till we can't even get teachers to try and teach them he said little oswald and let's run the teacher out of the building but we're talking about education he said but the trouble of it is we've tried to educate our pulpit and when we did we took the way out and christ is the foundation and that way we cannot build upon the foundation of political powers both parties are rotten he said the nation needs to build upon the foundation of jesus christ now one time the brain was arriving in new york with a friend of his and he's going through there and he sees this great big mammoth build them and he says now it's probably 50 or 60 stories high and i said well why didn't somebody move into it he said because come to find out the foundation wasn't right he said it had been laid upon some kind of soap stone not a real stone therefore the building was condemned and said it's only served for one thing that's for the contractor who built it to climb up to the top of it and jump off to commit suicide he said see no matter how good the outside looks there's not another foundation that's sure but the foundation of jesus christ he is the real foundation to be built upon amen revelation 3 17 says because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have needed nothing and know us not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked the prophet said that word miserable there means pity he said they vault what they have but what they have will not stand amen the test of time they have built upon quicksand rather than the rock of revelation of god's word amen if you're going to build a building you've got to dig down and lay the right foundation that's why paul said for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is what which is jesus christ ephesians 2 20 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets and jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone first timothy 6 19 laying up in store for themselves a good amen foundation against the time to come that they may hold that they may lay hold on eternal life another place in second timothy 2 19 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure hey then somebody say sure having this seal that the lord knoweth him that are his let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity what does that word sure mean brother sister it means strong it means firm it means immovable it means firm steadfast amen now notice here he said wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion amen a chief cornerstone notice the word timothy or peter uses here elect amen he's going to lay in zion amen a chief cornerstone which is elect which is precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded therefore isaiah prophesied of it and said behold i lay in zion amen a sure foundation a tried stone a precious cornerstone and peter comes along and says an elect stone amen a precious stone and brother bram comes along and says because there's a new creation not a denomination you're a creation of the word why oh my because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be the sons and daughters of god oh i'm trying to behave myself amen but what did timothy say timothy said he would lay in you a foundation stone against the time to come amen listen church jesus christ knew this time was coming he knew these troubles was coming he knew this virus was coming he knew pandemonium would break out in this nation he knew all about it amen and at the same time he knew you would be here he knew i would be here but he was not nervous he was not concerned that coronavirus would be what would shut the church out and what would take our victory and what would cause us to quit serving god because before you was born he laid in you a foundation stone which was a tried stone which was a precious stone oh i thank god tonight we ought to shout to the top of our voices satan you can't take me out i'm still here amen throw it you want you at me punch at me all you want to but before i was born god amen laid a stone in my heart against this day oh church my god in you he laid something that would not be shaken something that would not be destroyed he built you up on something of surety see that in order to build you have to have material to build with right now what is material material is the matter amen from which a thing is or can be made facts information or ideas for use in creating something now in first corinthians 3 12 now if any man build up on this foundation gold silver precious stones or wood hay stubble now do you realize permanent and valuable materials are materials that are not corruptable they do not deteriorate this stone has been in the church since before the foundation of the world and it's not corrupted one bit it's not deteriorated one bit see permanent materials last forever they are incorruptable they are undefiled they do not fade away and paul says that gold silver and precious stones are permanent materials then you go through the scriptures and you find examples of those permanent materials in galatians 5 the fruits of the spirit love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance in second peter 1 you find the seven virtues faith virtue knowledge temperance patience goldenness brotherly kindness and charity in first peter 2 the souls and lives of believers who become living stones in the church amen that is that is permanent material to whom coming verse first peter 2 4 to whom coming as unto a living stone this allowed in need of men but chosen of god and precious amen i tell you this is a beautiful study amen to run it all the way from here amen in the bible and see that precious and sure is connected with that stone ye also as lively stones are built up somebody say built up you are built up amen a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ not the same time that you've got permanent materials you've also got perishable materials at the same time there's a church being built out of permanent materials there is another group that's being built out of perishable materials and paul likens that to wood amen to hay and to stubble as perishable materials amen let me tell you some of those an example in the scriptures treasures amen wealth and cares of this world are perishable materials galatians 5 amen the works of the flesh are perishable materials colossians 2 amen the false teachings of the scriptures are perishable materials but god in this middle of all that in the middle of all of that god is building a bride that is not out of perishable materials but it's out of permanent material the prophet said god is building somebody say god is building in in seven ages a bride for christ through the philadelphian through the thytiran through the pergamus through the sumernian to the ephesus another place he says we know i love this we know there's going to be a bride we know that and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be here's that word again amen just as sure to be as god is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they have the material on the earth now to make themselves ready now a natural carpenter comes along and you know what he'll do brother sister he'll tell you how to build your natural house but the prophet says i'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where god can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself now if you study you'll find that there are two bodies amen everybody knows that a body amen is the church we clarify that tonight right amen this building here is not the church it is a house it is a place we meet but the church is the body of people that the foundation stone has been laid in then there are two bodies there is a human body and there is a spiritual body now the human body is made up of 16 elements of the earth which is calcium amen petroleum potash and cosmic light but the spiritual body is made up of three elements amen cosmic light cosmic light petroleum potash cosmic all those things are perishable items or perishable materials amen that the human body is built out of but the spiritual body is made up of three elements which is water haman blood and spirit see the three elements that came from his body is somebody say is is what makes his body see it comes from his body is the material to make his bride now this last great step must come into the perfection of the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head and the body unite together see he is the head in the body and we find these last days that that would be done so let me announce to you today church don't give up don't get discouraged don't quit working don't quit building don't quit serving don't quit doing what you're doing because let me give you a little let me give you a little boost of encouragement here okay amen you're not at the bottom of this thing we're not down here at the foundation of ephesus tonight we're not at the second building stone we're not in the fourth building stone we're not even at the sixth building stone church we have come to the end of this thing we have come amen to the final building days we have come amen to the top of the pyramid we have come to with the final stone amen laodicea has been positionally placed by a prophet and the problem of god said and when that is done then will come the headstone church i'm trying to behave myself tonight but i want you to know we are just almost home we can see amen home from here we have come to the top the human body amen that is made out of those perishable elements it can only handle so much amen before it begins to break down are you hearing me amen the human body can only handle so much before it begins to break down why because it's made out of perishable materials potash is perishable cosmic line is perishable amen are you hearing me amen petroleum is perishable amen but the water is eternal amen the blood is eternal amen the spirit is eternal those materials will not break down you find then that job's human body now look here job was a believer job was a christian man but he come under so much pressure that his human body began to break down amen that petroleum and that potash and that cosmic life it began to break down and the bible says job was smote with sore bowls from the soul of his foot unto his crown amen job's body begin to break down his mind begin to break down his nerves begin to break down amen the human body begin to break down but can i preach to you tonight amen all these friends could could say things that would tear that human body down his wife could say something that would tear that human body down amen amen could come and say something that would tear that human body down but there was a spiritual body there was a soul in there amen that no matter what was said no matter what come against him no matter how much of a loss he suffered there was a spiritual body that could say though you slay me yet i will trust you in the message victory day now remember when god has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows somebody say it shows it shows the grace of god has found you and you've found favor with god and god believes that you will stand the test you remember he did the same thing by job oh yes he did but god had confidence in job amen he puts trust in you when it looks like everything has gone wrong god is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant you are a hybrid you are a real christian god is giving you a test see what you do about it amen no wonder peter said these fiery trials why count it joy it's more precious brother andrew why did you have him leave that verse up there because i wanted you to get familiar with those words because that's who you are more precious to you than gold and many times we hum and hal oh well if i just well that's something god give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he put trust in you then the bible says in job 19 26 and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh child i see god job was a part of the spiritual body now let me say this the spiritual body which is the bride can handle whatever is thrown at it are you awake the spiritual body can take anything that's thrown at it because it's god constructed it's god constructed you can throw church trouble at it and it'll stand there you can throw cancer at it and it'll stand there you can throw you can throw family problems at it and it'll stand there you can throw marriage problems at it and it'll stand there you know why because it's not built out of perishable stuff are y'all hearing me hey man i'll tell you like this amen it's a body that god built it's a it's a it's a ministry that god built amen can i preach to you tonight how many out here knows ron spencer just a few months ago brother ron was diagnosed with cancer right do you realize amen since then i was talking to brother andrew the other day but andrew said brother he said buddy he's doing good he said he's preaching and a man that was given a death sentence with cancer was said you've only got so much time still preaching amen probably preached this weekend still standing there swinging the sword amen in the face of every negative in the face of brain surgery in the face of losing his eyesight in the face of all that still standing there amen preaching the message of the hour at the same time and i don't say this to the believer of a man but i just want to show you the difference at the same time there's a man named rush limbaugh amen who received the death sentence of cancer and he just said this week i've come to grips this is my death it's a death sentence and i thought isn't that something amen two men living in the same world amen but both of them made out of different stuff are you hearing me amen cancer in both bodies amen doctors give them no hope both bodies amen but one says this is the way it'll be amen get ready this is my death this is my hand but another stands up and says give me a slingshot again give me a rock i'm not born to die i'm born to fight are you seeing what i'm talking about there's some people here that are built out of different stuff oh glory to god amen can i bring that right here i don't know many of y'all here tonight but i'll say this there's people here tonight that the devil's been waiting on you to quit he's been waiting on you to give up he's been waiting on you to say well this is the end but something in you something in you begins to move something in you begins to feel a wind something in you begins to feel a charge what is it church it's the material you're made out of this bride is not handmade she's not handmade she's not theologia she's not hatched out of some seminary she is a spoken word bride are you hearing me she is a spoken word bride amen second corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any man be in christ who is christ the master if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new brother andrew what does that word creature mean it means creation it means building glory he is a new building amen a new establishment amen the building of individuals the prophet said here it is amen kind of an evolution rising higher he is creating his bride but you see this bride is not going to be made up of just what little group show on earth now when the seventh when the seventh watch when he came all those virgins raised trim their lamps all the way back everyone that believed the anointed word down through the h come forth like the pyramid he says the bottom part but the headstone had to come to pick the whole thing up to make it a pyramid see put it together this is the bride building of christ this is the body to receive the head the bridegroom things that are to be now these are attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living believing god 52 you get you got a soul beside your senses god never give you those senses to trust him with then you can believe the impossible things because you're made up of the miracle working god i pray this is helping you tonight remember it says here in perfect faith i mean substance faith now speaking here he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature becomes a new building in christ see there now you're getting into bright material but andrew what do you say and i'll tell you what i'm saying god wants a time tested church you know what really proves a building time time a contractor could build that building get his check and walk away and you could get 500 men together and get them all circled around that building and get them to put all their pressure and try to push that thing down and it'll stand right there and that contract will say see i did a good job but give that thing 20 years and nobody pushing on it and it collapses are you hearing me only time proves a building the bible says in the time tests memorials of god and jesus christ came from heaven the glory from glory down here to build a church and the material that he's putting in it is time tested material you might come to the altar and make a confession but when he finds blow holes in and everything else see the world has blown the maggots in you and so forth you cannot stand he just pitches you to one side god wants a time-tested church not somebody that is a christian today and a backslider tomorrow in and out up and down he can't place you nowhere but oh glory but he's got a church that's tested are you awake i want to drive this home to you tonight he's got a church that's tested that's went through the trials two of you went through trials three of you anybody here gone through trials okay went through trials next one went through losses anybody gone through losses went through sickness anybody gone through sickness went through sorrow through death and still stand with a testimony that's the man that's the man he's looking for i don't care if you are a pumper i don't care if you are a beggar i don't care if you are a rag picker whatever you are god puts this test to you he's looking for time-tested material what scent when science says how can it lose gravitations hold you to the earth brother says now i feel religious let me tell you where them knocks on the pulpit six times that time-tested church you hear me that time-tested church will come into existence someday oh brother branham if you're looking over the banister rail of heaven tonight won't you look over here at tucson tabernacle and see that time tested church that you prophesied about is in fulfillment here today church come on i'm not going to preach all night but help me for a minute the time tested church is not coming he prophesied it was coming into existence notice how he said it he didn't say someday they'll find it or someday they'll build it he said someday it will come into existence which is connecting it with the spoken word which is tied with creation power old church don't you see you are not a man just a church member you are a new creature you are a new creation by the creator jesus christ himself that time tested church will come to existence someday let me read you what they say abraham did he knocked on the pulpit once more and then clapped his hands together he said oh there may be a half of them sleeping in the dust of the earth i don't know where they're at but god has got his material all tested and one day he's coming to take the forefront and say follow me right through atmospheres through stratospheres and spheres and spheres into the presence of the almighty god he will go with a time-tested church that's a memorial to his grace that's a memorial that god gives him this bride is not built out of perishable man-made materials this bride is built out of permanent god constructed materials permanent god constructed can i just make news down in hell for a minute this bride will never pass away this bribe will never decay this bride church will never perish she will never corrupt she will never be defiled upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it behold i lay in zion hey you know what i believe with all of my heart andrew glover is a part of the bride of jesus christ and zion is a type of the bride so if you all don't mind i'm gonna read this like i like to read it therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay an andrew glover for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste brother arnie behold i lay an arnie peterson for a foundation come on church put your name there tonight brother jordan put your name there brother matthew put your name there amen everybody put your name there and say devil see i'm still here the wind didn't get me the storm didn't break me the trouble didn't discourage me i'm built upon a rock that the very gates of hell shall not prevail against it what is it it's a revelation what is faith is god by the spirit revealing to you is something that he's going to do or he's promised now if you only hear faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith a loaf of bread is purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread see hearing only brings the word that produces faith but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of thanks not seen then you see you hear the word god reveals it to you that it's the truth and by spirit revealed truth confirms your faith to god you get it now notice then that's the church that god built upon the rock that the gates of hell will never prevail against it as musicians come tonight how many remembers me saying that there were many boats in the days of noah but there was only one god constructed boat just as there was many boats in the days of noah there are many churches and brides today there's been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides churches bride's brides churches brides churches churches brides brides but there's got to come one hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it that makes that church live and move in the power of his resurrection then testing time will come and only the god constructed church will pass the test oh there's too many here to read can i read one more that's what too many is doing today trying to float through on a popular log but we find out it sunk and they thought they could build a boat and it would be all right but their boats went down that's what you think today that we can build an organization or educate a bunch of people into it it'll go anyhow whether it's god constructed or not but the only thing that'll pass the test is a god-constructed church by the word filled with the holy ghost got to be god constructed and god inspired how many say tonight lord tear down every board on this building that's not bible material tear down every board that's not holy ghost material let the inspector come in tonight let the inspector inspect the building let him go through and see what kind of materials in it let him check and see if there's any false teachings in it let him check and see if there's any hay or stubble let him check and see if there's any works of the flesh in that building tonight [Music] because if there is there's a storm coming that'll hit that building and if it's not god constructed it'll fall apart how many how many ministries have we seen around this message build out a perishable materials might have could breach like a house on fire but a storm hit it down it came how many churches have we seen oh this is it this is the church and a storm hit it he said andrew you're getting pretty pretty discouraged no i'm not i'm telling you what a prophet said he said we're going to sail through treacherous waters he said we're already selling through them now christ revealing his own word 65 we're already selling through them now he said but here's the good thing about it the stabilizers the stabilizers are already on the boat the stabilizers are already on the church that church she spoke about already come into existence she's still here she's still standing how many wants to testify to the devil tonight i want you to stand up to your feet and say devil i'm still here after all i've been through i'm still here after all the troubles and all the storms and all the hurts and losses and disappointments and sicknesses and sorrows and deaths we just still stand here as a [Music] a testimony built out of god's material if you're here tonight and you're not built out of the material of god i encourage you tonight pressure's coming the pressure test is coming says it this way he says anyone a chemist anyone else will always test something i used to work for a gas company and they'd test those pipes by putting a plug in the end and a valve and i don't remember now just how many hundreds of pounds of pressure they had put on them pipes to see if there's a little sand hole that would blow do you see how close this has got to be how how big is a grain of sand can't even hardly see it but if there's a bit of a grain of sand hole it'll blow apart and if they could not stand the test then it was thrown into scrap heap and when you're put under a test anybody here tonight under a test glory when you're put under a test when you're fixing to be people out there maybe you're christians and wonder why you're put under this test god is fixing to use your testimony but he wants to see how you'll react so he puts the pressure on if you blow up well then he can't do nothing with you but if you'll hold on and stand the test [Music] i wish i could say tonight to you that [Music] it's going to get easier brother matthew i'd be lying to you i wish i could tell you tonight that things are going to get better trials are going to get less but i'd be lying to you but can i tell you this he's proven you [Music] every trial every test every storm he's proven you to come out on the other side to stand to stand as a witness what are you playing here you later snap brother [Music] [Music] say [Music] is there a part of me that can't take the pressure tear it down refilled me to not [Music] maybe you don't know the reality of this message like you need to he can give you the reality of it tonight [Music] it's not too late to be built again [Music] glory [Music] in my church lord come on in and be the master be the sinner be the principal thing [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] today when the lord gave me this thought i was preaching in our home church there and at the end of the service i just began to call some people out in the service not in prophetic or discernment but just you may know out here brother kenneth walker he's an evangelist traveled many years i said brother brother walker how many years you've been on the field brother i think he said 30 40 50 years something like that traveling preaching i said why are you still here today because you're made out of god material ask our deacons in the back i said brother how long have you been a deacon how long you been a deacon i said why why are you still here because you've been god constructed ask our musicians and i'll ask these tonight why are you still here god built you holy ghost material makes holy ghost musicians holy ghost material makes holy ghost churches holy ghost material makes holy ghost deacons are you hearing me if you don't have the holy ghost tonight i

disappointments and losses lord i'm speaking to people that have ever right and every excuse they could come up with not to be serving you today not to be still pressing the battle but lord then i realize i'm speaking to people that i believe would testify their best day serving the devil cannot even compare to their worst day serving the lord the the best day they had serving the devil could not beat cannot come near the worst that they had serving you for lord i would rather have struggles and trials and be serving you than everything going well and be serving the devil lord i believe that's the testimony of this people tonight lord i believe that's the testimony of this church lord you've seen what they've gone through father you see the struggles and the difficulties they've been through but lord here they stand tonight as a testimony as a witness that they are a new creature they are a new building in christ jesus lord things they've been through perishable materials would
