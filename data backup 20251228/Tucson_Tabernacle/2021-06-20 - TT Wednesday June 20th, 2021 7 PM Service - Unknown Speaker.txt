savior's name i love the name of jesus [Music] the sweetest [Music] jesus blessed jesus thank you good evening thank you for coming out on this what i'm told is the first day of summer we're finally gonna get rid of all this cold and wet and rain and fog and get some warm weather and sunshine i don't know if you're looking forward to that i'm not as you're aware today is celebrated as father's day that's that's been mentioned here but you know there's too many children being brought into the world these days and raised without a father figure in the home we see the results of poverty despair hopelessness gang activity to replace family and the missing father crime hatred lack of respect for others lack of personal responsibility it's a seemingly endless cycle that we find ourselves in these days but but we have a father and as we sang earlier he knows our name and he calls us his children what a privilege is that what we're standing let's just approach our father lord jesus we're so grateful for this time that we can share together in this laodicean age and this 21st century this era of skepticism lord and the and the things that we see going on around us lord that that causes concern lord and at the same time we believe it's just fulfilling your word for the hour in which we live lord you said that if we trust in you with all our heart if we don't lean to our own understanding if we acknowledge you in all of our ways you will direct our paths lord we're depending upon that this evening lord that you would allow words to be spoken that would benefit your people lord that you would help lyle johnson to just disappear and lord that you might you might speak that you might reach out that you might touch those that need to be touched lord we we just desire lord and we thank you for your presence this evening and jesus precious name amen tonight i i have something to share that i hope will encourage you to to press on in christ so we'll get started you'll notice a little difference tonight i'm not doing things here my computer system this week we've been moving in in the process of trying to get ready my computer didn't boot up in the morning i'd lost all my notes all my everything so i have no power point or no anything like that but we don't need powerpoint we don't need computers we don't need screens we need the lord jesus and he's here with us so i'm going to read from mark the 10th chapter starting at verse 13. i don't know if there's something i need to do here for that oh there we go and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for if such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you jesus i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them please be seated we're we're told that order to be like little children that i believe means that we should have a childlike trust obedience even when we don't understand always curious exploring seeking to understand and growing paul tells us in first corinthians 13 starting at verse 9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part our our knowledge our grasp it's incomplete but when that which is perfect has come when that which is completed comes then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as your child i thought as a child but when i became a man when i grew up when i went through childhood and through adolescence and into maturity and adulthood i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then i shall know even as i am known so we're expected to grow to learn to mature and to share paul admonishes in the letter of the hebrews hebrews chapter 5 starting at verse 11. he's been talking about things the priest after the over melchizedek he's sharing some some things with the with the people there but he says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered and why is it hard for paul to speak these things seeing your doll of hearing it's not hard for paul to speak except that people aren't receiving it for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and become as such as have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful and the word of righteousness is a babe but strong meat belongs to those that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil i'd like to read these same verses from the niv but i think it may help clarify things a little paul says we have much to say about this but it's hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand in fact though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you the elementary truth of god's word all over again you need milk not solid food anyone who lives on milk being still an infant is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness but solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil and the title of the message tonight is patience and training training for what last wednesday evening brother peter brought us a synopsis of brother branham's message how can i overcome the bottom line was to stop trying in yourself and overcome by the word obedience to the word just like jesus resisting satan he said it is written and what he just asked siri popped up some little google web page or something and and and then he was able to quote that back to the devil no no he uh he there's more to this in doing a word search on a device and do you find it strange that we no longer talk about computers and tablets or even phones we talk about devices right smart devices does this sound like our age to you i think jeremiah might have had something to say about this jeremiah 18 and 12 and they said the people there is no hope can you hear them there is no god just your imagination or you've been indoctrinated it's how you were taught it's all science and reason humanism these days the rainbow right get out of the dark ages there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will everyone do the imagination of his evil heart welcome to laodicea in the 21st century jeremiah and second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 paul says lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices okay the bible's talking about strategies and tactics and other non-physical things but but these modern devices so often and so easily work to advance satan's agenda he isn't just in our home when tvs came into our home and i love susie and all the rest of it and movie houses now our kids carried around in their pockets access to everything everything carrying it in our own pockets so it's it it's in our hand it's in our pockets it's in our minds okay back to the lesson we're very familiar with the letter to the angel of the church of laodicea and his conclusion in revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh is that who we are will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame how did he do that and him sat down with my father in his throne further on in revelation we're told that they overcame by the word of their testimony and the blood of the lamb now i'd like to share with you a little bit from john chapter 16. i keep wondering if somebody took my verses to brother aaron but understand that john chapter 16 this is jesus sharing things that are so important with his disciples this is the very last evening he will spend with them the very last moments that he can share that he can give them instruction to strengthen them for what's coming verse 31 we read jesus answered them do you now believe behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone yet i'm not alone because the father is with me until that awful moment when he cried why have you forsaken me these things i have spoken unto you why that in me ye might have peace in the world you'll have tribulation he's not talking about the great tribulation he's talking about life in the world you can have some tough times but be of good cheer i have overcome the world the king james version translates uh the good good cheer the original there means to take courage comfort take heart be encouraged and to overcome means to subdue to conquer to prevail to get the victory but what exactly is it that we need to overcome what does it mean to overcome the world to conquer the world we're we're not talking alexander the great here what are we fighting in the battleground of our minds well i'd like to tell you a story uh several years ago i had the privilege of having a catholic priest come to my home for breakfast in washington when i lived there there was a group of five to seven of us that would get together every friday morning we started out at a restaurant eventually we came to our house because it was quieter and hopefully a bit more spiritual than the clattering of all the dishes and stuff in a restaurant and and partly because these guys really enjoyed heather's breakfast cooking but but this catholic priest was it was a friend of one of this small circle of guys that i met with every week and and he was telling his story and he was telling us that he was an alcoholic he said i've been sober i don't remember the exact number 20 years 30 years he hadn't touched alcohol in years and years but he said i'm an alcoholic but i've been sober these number of years when he became a christian he looked through the various traditions to find which church had been around the longest because in his thinking that would be the one that he would want to associate with he thought it was the catholic church so he went through their seminary became a priest then later realized he should have become greek orthodox but he was a bit of a maverick but but but he was a very sincere and wonderful man i believe he was a christian yeah you might ask yourself can a catholic priest be a christian well i'll let you decide that i'm i'm not gonna make that judgment now i had never been around a person who claimed to be a decades sober alcoholic before i wondered what does this actually mean how can a person be a sober alcoholic if you've stayed sober that long surely you're no longer an alcoholic so i did a little looking into this organization called alcoholics anonymous this was started in the 1930s as a self-help program to help those with an alcohol addiction i found their program was based on christian principles you've probably heard of their 12-step program um uh the the the 12 steps are basically we admitted were powerless over alcohol our lives had become unmanageable came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity i thought that was an interesting term sanity made a decision to turn our will and our lives over the care of god as we understood him made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves admitted to god to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs we're entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them seek forgiveness take responsibility and goes on another step continued to take personal inventory when we were wrong promptly admitted it don't want to backslide don't want to fall off the wagon as they might say sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god well as christians i believe that we're called to be authentic transparent and accountable if we look at some of these steps we can see how they apply and it may help us understand what is this that we're supposed to overcome so step one we must recognize and admit that we're sinners that's the equivalent we read in romans 3 verse 23 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god that doesn't leave anyone out and we have to recognize that we're powerless over the sin our lives are unmanageable in ourselves before a righteous creator in romans 7 starting at verse 14 we read for we know that the law is spiritual this is paul speaking but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not what that i would that do i not but what i hate do i not i did and and now i don't paul's talking in the present tense at this stage of his life we're talking about the first church age of messenger we're talking about the guy that wrote the majority of the new testament we're talking about the guy that established virtually all the doctrines that we believe and hold dear and this man is telling us in his state at that stage of his ministry in that stage of his life he was still battling every single day he didn't get into some nirvana if then i do that which i would not i consent under the law that it is good now then and there's no more either to it but sin that dwell within me now some people have taken this and run off with some doctrine about two souls and they can do what they want because the soul that sinners are going to die but their soul is going to go to heaven even though paul's not talking about that i know that in me that is in my flesh in this carnal body in which i dwell dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not our lives are unmanageable for the good that i would not do but the evil which i would not that i do this is paul talking now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law a rule i observe that when i would do good evil is present with me i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind the battleground bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i i read this again today and i thought this is paul this is paul this isn't just some guy that just you know got witness to and came to the lord and is still struggling with some issue this is paul in first john chapter 1 i'd like to read verse 8 and verse 10. we'll get to verse 9 later if we say that we have no sin now this is in paul this is john talking we deceive ourselves the truth is not in us verse 10 if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so our lives are unmanageable we've got this situation steps two through four we come to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity make a decision to turn our will in our lives over the care of god as we understood him made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves what does the bible say about this if we put this in our context not as alcoholic but as a human and as a christian we must come to a belief that we're salvageable that god not only can but is willing to care for us and we need to make a firm decision a commitment to surrender our lives to his care initially that our understanding with god is very limited as nursing babes that we read about a little earlier but as we grow we need to also mature we don't remain little children in many senses although some of those attributes we do want to have last time that i spoke with you we read some from peter's sermon on pentecost and i'd like to read just a little bit of that in this context acts 2 starting at verse 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you to your children to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words that you testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day were added unto them about 3 000 souls there's also this very familiar scene from the prison at philippi from acts 16 starting at verse 28. after the earthquake had broken all the chains paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm we're all here then he the jailer called for a light and sprang in he didn't saunter and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house they spake unto him the word of the lord and all that were in his house it's it's simple it's available it's there paul's consistent with this in romans 10 we read starting at verse 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that's and it takes both that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation what about step four then this moral inventory david talks about that in psalms 139 we uh we sing this as a as a song search me oh god know my heart try me test me know my thoughts see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting well then what's next steps five through seven admitted to god to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs we're entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character and humbly ask him to remove our shortcomings there's i believe as christians again that we must be authentic transparent and accountable i think that's the hardest one the uh with their step five admit to god yeah your prayer closet you can you can talk to god you commit all sorts of things to god into yourself yeah i recognize i should have done that but to go to another person that you care about and trust and admit that same shortcoming that same fault accountability that's tough well uh another little personal testimony here about about 15 years ago uh myself my youngest son and one of my brothers-in-law decided that we wanted to become scuba divers so we went to the this is when i lived in washington we went to the ymca and and went through the program and became certified as open water divers and all that good stuff and we learned all sorts of rules about that we learned all sorts of things about our equipment about underwater breathing systems pressures at various steps and how it builds up the danger staying down too long what can happen if you come up too fast how to clear your mask so you can see the shark that's about to eat you um all sorts of things how to get in the water how to get out of the water how to take care of your equipment so the next time you get in the water and go down in your life depends upon it it doesn't go um but one of the absolute cardinal rules of every other rule never go alone always always with a buddy now i only went scuba diving five or six times after we did the lessons my my relatives up in washington state thought that puget sound was too cold i don't know it's it's more than 40 degrees i can't imagine that being it's hard to imagine 40 degrees now even in the freezer in the house so a couple of years ago i realized i'm getting to be old and not as strong as i used to be and probably can't swim as far with all this stuff so i gave the scuba gear to my son who would learn to dive with me but once heather and i were visiting our oldest son samuel who's here tonight he lived in western australia at that time and went diving with one of his friends carmelo i don't yeah i think that was the fella's name he was a chef and he liked seafood and he was a scuba diver so we drove over to the to the edge of the uh probably would have been the indian ocean there and uh and got on all our gear and double checked you know and of course that's a lot of heavy gear so you're kind of staggering with the stuff and we waited out into the water to go out after abalone that carmelo was then going to cook up for us because he's a chef and loves seafood so we had our little measuring devices so we could be sure that we don't get an abalone that's too little and all of that so we got out there got past a reef and on the other side of the reef could dive down a little bit and there were you know different rocks and things where abalone abalone when it starts growing in one place it uh it doesn't move it it stays there just gets bigger until a diver finds it harvests it and cooks it for summer so uh so we were out there diving and and we got a couple of uh of these abalone but i'm the type of guy that that when i'm out diving and swimming around down there and stuff i i like to breathe and so my my air tank was starting to get a little bit low and we were coming back in we had our little bag full of the correct number of abalone that we were allowed and and as we're coming back i i notice that my error is getting a little bit low and carmelo signals to me and he says i dropped something back there my i don't know what and so i'm going to go back and get it and i thought uh oh cardinal rule number one so off he swims something well i better swim after him but he's much better swimmer than i am so pretty soon i couldn't see him anymore he's gone so i'm a little disoriented i'm not i'm not familiar with these waters i mean this is australia i mean the whirlpool goes in the wrong direction in australia so so i'm trying to get my bearings of where i am and i come up to the surface and and there's a lot of current there and the weather isn't exactly perfect and and i'm a little bit lost but i finally figure out where the shore is and that reef and stuff and i start swimming and i can't swim on the top of the water because of the currents and the wind and all that stuff so i'm underwater and i'm swimming but um i'm running low on air uh so i just this is this is not a good thing and i'm all by myself this said the guy with his little buddy thing that i might be able to breathe with if my tank goes empty is uh swimming someplace else looking for whatever it was that he lost so i i finally make it to the reef and by now i'm pretty exhausted and i'd always wondered how could a person with all this scoop equipment all this gear and training and all the rest of that how could a person possibly drown they must really be idiots if they drown with all that scuba gear so i was in the process of discovering what an idiot i am and uh so i crawled up onto this reef area and i wasn't in the passage through the reef because the current had moved me someplace else so i was kind of crawling on top of this thing and getting my breath and looking around and i saw not where i expected but i saw over there somewhere i saw sam and heather and i thought oh i've got to get all the way over there and oh my tank says that it's got about three breaths or something left in it it's pretty low this is not a good thing but i tried swimming then after i clambered over the top of the reef and got back into the water on the shore side of it and trying to make my way back and and it was uh it was a little tenuous uh eventually i got to a place where i could find the bottom and and still breathe and then i could stagger to the shore and try and get rid of all this heavy equipment and all the rest of it and uh finally finally got back to shore so i learned that even if you have all the right equipment and a little bit of training you can still drown it's it's quite possible and how potentially deadly something like scuba activity can be if you and your buddy fail to stick together well the aaa their system they hook you up with a buddy whenever you feel the urge to drink alcohol before you do it you call your buddy you get a hold of them there's you know you you confess i've got this problem that you know i need help and and and you try and help each other before you fall off the wagon as they would say well i mentioned earlier about that catholic priest that had come to our breakfast table that day as i said every friday morning there was a group of five to seven of us that would that would get together and and the reason for that the intent was that over time we could get comfortable with each other we could grow confident that what's said at the table stays at the table that we could confide in each other that we could recognize the christ in each other so that if we were having a problem or a difficulty that we needed to overcome that we could confess that and we could have a buddy or a couple of buddies that we could be accountable to and they could be accountable to us well lyle you said that you were having a problem with this how's that going now how it became not just the authenticity and the transparency but the accountability sometimes i i wonder if we have that accountability in our relationship with christ and with each other it's it takes time to develop those kinds of relationships it's not superficial you don't meet somebody one day and immediately tell them all your deep dark secrets the next day it takes a while takes time accountability you need a buddy psalms 32 and 5. david tells us i acknowledge my sin unto thee in mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin salah john tells us in first john 1 and verse 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now james yet another writer in the new testament that the holy spirit used james takes us maybe a step further he expands on it james 5 verse 16. confess your faults one to another one two and other this is a one-on-one this is a this is a on my mind a buddy kind of thing authentic transparent to be transparent is hard on the flesh but to be accountable is even harder and pray one for another that you may be healed it's not just talking about physical healing here it's not just talking about an injury or an or an illness the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much how does that fervent prayer become effectual so that it can avail confess your faults one to another pray one for another confession not a priest not going into a confessional booth and ever how that works i've never been there and done that but transparency one to another when heather and i were in our first year of marriage we scraped together enough money to to go to new zealand oh this was a big adventure i and i do mean scrape together it started out as a short trip but we ended up being there for five months it's a long story but related to what we're talking about here like like most young couples i suppose or maybe we were unique uh we had some issues i i suspect we weren't entirely unique that in that sense now to be honest and frank i had a lot more issues than heather had and i still do but in this particular case heather was struggling with something i hope you don't mind me talking about this sweetie if you do i'm sure i'll pay for it later we had the privilege of staying at brother reg and sister gloria searles for a few weeks brother cyril we we had got there for the wedding of one of his sons and the next day brother cyril took off to somewhere in asia in the pacific where he was spreading the message this is early 1972 the the message is a very new thing on the world stage so after he returned after a few weeks heather and i were in his living room and we were talking about things and things became a bit serious and heather started talking about this struggle that she was having and and brother cyril walked us through what i call brother red searle's four-step program to overcome and deal with a spiritual problem he said the first step is you've got to realize you've got a problem not because somebody said hey you've got a problem i'm sure i'm right you've got a problem no no no you personally have to recognize that you personally have i have to realize that i have a problem i have to confess that i have to understand it i have to believe it i have to accept that i have to know it that's step one the second step is that i i must sincerely desire to be rid of it not a superficial not pasting it over papering it over sincerely want to be rid of it then i must ask the lord pray and ask the lord to remove that to take care of that then you have to in faith thank the lord for having done it right we sing that song it's already done and it's true and then if you do all of that then brother searle was willing to pray with us about that and the lord achieved a great victory in our lives that day now i i've heard people say and and and at some level it's true that we're sinless before god and through the blood of jesus christ that's true it's true by faith it's true by grace but we're still creatures in sinful flesh and we live in a sinful world not a world with sin but a sin full world our souls have been purchased the holy spirit is our earnest but our flesh is still awaiting the redemption what we call the rapture or the resurrection and first corinthians 15 paul talks about this he says there's one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon another glory of the stars one star differeth from another in glory and brightness and magnitude we'd say today so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it's raised in incorruption it's sown in dishonor it's raised in glory it's sown in weakness but it's raised in power it is sown a natural body but it's raised a spiritual body that there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body as it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening a life-giving spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual that's why the body is sown in dishonor but raised in honor the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are also they that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy that's our natural life here we also bear the image we shall also bear the image of the heavenly so we're presently living on earth in this earthy body of flesh but we have a promise of something so much better but as paul points out we're still sinners wait a minute brother lyle listen what paul says about himself i'm going to read this it's first timothy chapter and i'm going to read it from the niv because i think it's a bit clearer but if you want to follow along in the in the in the king james version you'll find it saying the same thing he says i thank christ jesus our lord who has given me strength that he considered me trustworthy appointing me to his service even though i was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man i was shown mercy because i acted in ignorance and unbelief paul was this zealous jewish man who was pursuing the law of moses everything to the best of his ability and yet he said he was in ignorance and unbelief the grace of our lord was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in christ jesus paul says i was shown mercy if if you're disobedient you get disciplined if you're a rebel if you revolt you get wrath but in ignorance and unbelief you get mercy an opportunity to experience god's grace verse 15 paul says here's a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am the worst i don't think he's bragging here but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me the worst of sinners christ jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor glory for ever and ever amen paul is so excited he just has to stop and praise god at this point look what he has done for me and paul doesn't say i was the worst of sinners no he says i am the worst of sinners at the time that he's writing this this is one of his pastoral letters to timothy right this is not in the first part of his ministry paul says i am the worst of sinners so what about us like that sober alcoholic catholic priest we're flesh addicts needing the lord's help and each other to stay sober romans 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god and another place paul says prove test all things hold fast to that which is good for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god it's dealt to every man the measure of faith you don't renew your own mind you don't transform yourself the command is is to allow yourself to be transformed by that renewing stop doing what prevents it do it allows or permits it right you read about and self-help things you know the the x number of of healthy habits of a person trying to do this or do that don't stop doing the things that prevent the progress that you need to start doing the things that enable it so it it's not by trying as as as brother branham said in the message that peter uh brought to us on on wednesday night as we read in romans just a few minutes ago romans chapter 7 verse 21 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man i delight in that but i see another law and my members in my flesh warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin paul captivity the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death training exercise first timothy chapter 4 verse 6 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things he's talked about some of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine where unto thou hast attained but refuse profane and old wise fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness that exercise is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and that which is to come paul elaborates on this in his first letter to the corinthians first corinthians 9 24 and i'm going to read this first from the niv we'll read it again later do you in the king james do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize that's a little scary run in such a way as to get the prize everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training they do it to get a crown that will not last but we do it to get a crown that will last forever therefore i do not run like someone running aimlessly there's the track i'm going to go down that track i do not fall like a boxer beating the air no i strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after i have preached to others i myself will not be disqualified for the prize strict training a brother arnie back there he worked with horses for quite a long time and i think if i were to ask him is this is this true brother arne if an owner wants to race his horse he just says this one has good bloodlines i'll enter into the race and i'll probably win no no the horse with the correct bloodlines must go through rigorous training and we as the bloodline of christ must go through rigorous training we're talking about running a race one of my grandsons plays football for calallen and you all prayed for him back in uh back in march when heather and i were were gone and he was in an accident on his little motor scooter got hit by a car and uh and was very serious but i'm happy to report that he is now walking and that he acknowledges the grace of god in his life in this but our young man he he needs an experience with the lord he really needs that but he has a soft and gentle spirit and we just trust the lord will we'll work that out but he has a very rigorous training program includes education and diet exercise practice skirmishes then and only then if he excels does he get to go onto the field to face the opposing team and he's not by himself it's a team sport he's got somebody next to him and they've practiced with him they know each other they know how they react they know how they think they know how they do he plays his position on the defensive line he doesn't subtly decide i'm going to be the quarterback he has his place he trains for that place now his training would be ineffective if you were trying to swim in a race or run a marathon or compete in rowing to train effectively you must have a goal then you train to achieve the goal so what about sin sin we know is what separates us from god right we know the story of adam and eve in the garden but what else does sin do how does it backfire on the devil not continuing and said i'm not talking about that but it our sin drives us to the cross to restore the valley fellowship that it deprived us of but the path is recognition through the law recognizing or sinners grace and mercy through the blood to the right relationship that righteousness that comes through faith and because we are all sinners right romans 3 23 we read that at the beginning all have sinned none of us are left out we can help others i i've never been involved in these programs but and i guess i would admit it if i had but but just as an ex-addict makes the most powerful counselor at a rehab center if i was at a drug rehab center and and and i've never used those drugs and a person came and they were seeking help they were seeking understanding they were seeking sympathy and empathy and and a way to get past this and i just said well you know it says right here you shouldn't do that so grow up and stop doing that stuff and send them out there i would not be a very effective counselor but if i can say i know exactly where you're coming from look i was this i was that i was addicted to this other thing it was a struggle it was so so hard you know but you can do it if you just you know get a hold whatever that counseling is the most effective counselors are the ones that have been through it i think i've told you this story before i i have a brother-in-law who's a physician and he would do surgery on somebody or something and they'd say oh oh that really hurts he said just get up and walk you've got to get up and walk you're not going to be healthy you don't get on a walk just do it you know and so he was he he was he didn't have a bad bedside manner but he was pretty he could be a little bit abrupt and then one day he had a problem and had to have his gallbladder bladder removed and then when he had to get oh that hurts after that whenever he was dealing with a patient that had had surgery he could identify with that patient he could empathize with them and look i know it's going to hurt i've had to go through this and and and this might help you a little bit and i know it's really hard but here let me help you you really need to do he's a much more effective physician in the post-op now because he's gone through it himself okay so we can share our stories and our struggles and our ongoing battles paul was having ongoing battles our sin nature alcoholism if you will while being careful to remain sober sincere authenticity and humility and bold transparency and we are to do exactly this galatians 6 verse 1 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault he was your spiritual restore such a one and the spirit of meekness meekness is not weakness meekness comes from strength christ was meek but he was powerful considering thyself with your spiritual people what what do you got to worry about if you're spiritual you're going to help restore this person consider yourself you're still in this tabernacle of flesh lest you also be tempted and then we get to the buddy system verse two bear ye one another's burdens you can't do that if you don't share bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ the law of christ we're all sinners we can all be tempted we can all fall into traps set by the enemy paul tells us in hebrews 12. you read a lot of scriptures brother lyle well i i don't know that i have anything of value to share with you but i know the word of god is of great value so i'm i'm happy to read scriptures and i hope that uh that you're getting something from that even if you get nothing from this guy up here that's trying to be a vessel of wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight easy to say not always easy to do and the sin which death so easily beset us is paul talking and let us run with patience the race that is set before us hmm that race again we'll talk about that a bit set aside the sin run with patience it takes patience to run a marathon when i was younger junior high high school whatever i really liked in those days was a 50 yard dash i think it's a 40 meter dash now because they don't want people to count to 50 the only one to count to 40. but but i like that one because i could give it everything that i had and it was all over in a few seconds running a marathon i had a couple of my sons that decided they were running the portland marathon and i remember the training that they did over a period of months to build up the strength and the stamina and whatever to just be able to complete running 26 miles i know i didn't even try galatians 6 verse 7 we're talking about running with patience now be not deceived god is not mocked whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap right every seed brings forth of its own kind for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption that's death and decay but he that soweth to the spirit shall reap of the spirit life everlasting so let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not crops don't grow overnight it takes time and the right conditions for a seed to become a crop we're in this for the long haul there's no shortcut there's no there's no quick path second thessalonians chapter 3 and verse 3 paul emphasizes this thing again uh second this long as well i i made an error there brother jeremy the verse that i want it's okay i'll just read it but yeah brethren be not weary in well-doing regardless of our anticipation of the soon coming of the lord and we should be in that kind of anticipation we're in this for the long haul until that time comes we're in this for the long haul don't look for a shortcut now let's listen in as jesus talks about this this is a familiar parable luke 8 and starting at verse 4. and when much people were gathered together there was a crowd there and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable you're familiar with this the sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it some fell upon a rock as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some fell among thorns as thorns sprang up with it and choked it other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit at 100 fold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath an ear to hear let him hear does that sound like laodicea like revelation 3 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches his disciples asked him saying what are you talking about what might this parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others and stories illustrations that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now now the parable is this here's the key i'm going to unlock this one for you the seed is the word of god those by the wayside are they that hear then come with the devil taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy but they have no root they believe for a while and time of temptation testing hard times come they're gone that which fell among the thorns so they which they have heard go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection they might begin to have fruit but it never gets ripe but that on the good grounder they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience bring forth fruit with patience it takes time to grow if you get in a hurry you'll succeed in being frustrated but the crop's not going to grow any faster luke 21 verse 16 and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren kids folks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death you should be hated of all men for mind's sake but there shall not inherit your head perish and your patience possess you your souls the the word there translated patiences is cheerful or hopeful endurance constancy enduring uh continuance waiting in in closing i'd like to refer you back to paul's description of the race in first corinthians the race which takes great patience and constant exercise the race that we're in and the king james version will read at this time first corinthians 9 starting at verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things in other words they're focusing on their training their that's where their focus is they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we and incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainly determination right so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection bless that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway i should fail to obtain the prize now in a race here in the earthly realm i'm sure many of you have been involved in or or seen someone race run maybe with your siblings or your cousins or your friends or somebody only one person wins and and that only happens if they compete according to the rules you can't you can't take a shortcut right i remember uh when uh one of my sons was at west point and and he was a cadet there and they were they had to do some kind of a thing in the summer and it was this race course or it wasn't exactly a race but it was a timed event where they had to cover this much distance and this much time and one of the guys was really just not in very good shape at all and so he took a shortcut and uh he didn't stay at west point you have to play by the rules so we're okay so only one only one winner right but this race is different i mean think about this if there's only one that's going to win the prize and paul's run the race are you going to out race paul i i don't think i can outraise paul so i might as well just give up throw in the towel and go do something else right no no why should i put in all the hard work if i'm guaranteed to fail if only one's going to win the prize but paul says so run that you may obtain put another way as long as you run as if you would obtain the prize right we're often told if you think there's only going to be three pill one person in the rapture you be it right if long as you run as if you will obtain the prize you will obtain the prize so run not uncertainly but with utter certainty train exercise be patient keep going if you fall down get back up and keep running fight for real not shadow boxing beating the air when i was in the army during basic combat training uh we had a day that we spent in prisoner of war training they they took us over in this vehicle they had these guys all dressed up in the the the uniform of not the us army and uh they had us in this compound with all this barbed wire and they took a couple of the biggest guys out of the line and they beat them up and all the rest of it just to make us you know think that wow this isn't just a classroom this i can get hurt here and so they ran us through a lot of things and teaching us the kind of bugs you can eat and the kind of leaves you better avoid and all the rest of it and and it was all pretty intense and kind of humiliating and all the rest but but in the end they had taught us how to escape and evade and that evening this was an all-day thing and well into the dark of night they trucked us up to this place so they said you need to go to this rendezvous point that you don't have compasses you don't think you've got stars if there's no clouds and and as long as you go through this escaping evasion when these guys send up flares you do the right thing when they're out you know snooping around you you all all the techniques and tricks that we've been taught as long as you do this by the rules even if they see you they won't capture you and take you back you'll make it to the rendezvous and if you don't do it by the rules and they see you you're going to wish that you have been going by the rules you you might get hurt so so but if we followed the training if we did what we were supposed to do if we ran the race correctly we'd get to the rendezvous point okay it's just like paul's race so back to the alcoholic illustration as long as we're in the flesh we're fighting this addiction we read in galatians 5 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh put it at the spirit lusteth against the flesh these are contrary to one to the other so you cannot do the things you would now we usually equate lust with sexual desire longing appetite hunger paul says that the spirit lusts against the flesh just like the flesh does against the spirit wow no wonder brother branham said that the lord wants to give you the holy spirit more than you desire it because the spirit of god lusts against the flesh it hates that it has an appetite to destroy it so god has that hunger to see us filled with his spirit to see us running with patience and if you run well it doesn't matter who else or how many others are running i believe paul ran and obtained the prize that i believe a lot of others have too and a lot of others will because in the end you're not competing with those around you even if they're running in the same track you're running in a field of one you're running in a field of one it's you if you run you run well you run with patience you if you run as if you would obtain the prize you will obtain the prize there's there's no limit to the grace of god finally last verse again from galatians chapter 5 verse 24 they that are christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in this spirit elsewhere it says it you die daily right crucify the flight it's a the flesh is a very resilient thing that keeps coming back and you got to keep pushing back on it we need to be diligent we need to grow the musicians could come at this time we need to help each other we need to recognize that we're vulnerable we're a body of believers we've been told many times about cutting off a branch and it dies after it's separated we need to run to obtain the prize to reach the goal then we must be patient and you should find a buddy a person a small group of persons with whom you can gain enough trust and confidence to share your struggles when you fear you might go off the track contact reach out before you stumble bear one another's burdens it's okay to struggle in fact it's not okay to not struggle because in this body of sinful flesh that probably means that you've given up or given in don't ever give up press the battle against your flesh run the race with patience but run brother aaron if you'd come i i normally have a song to sing at this point and i'm blanking out so i'll i'll pass that burden to brother aaron thank you god bless you i found something out about brother lyle that i didn't know he's human now if i would ask sisters heather and sam he would have said yeah he is but they love brother lyle they encourage brother lyle they say come on honey or they say come on dad you can do it they stand for each other amen let's stand lay that way to pause lay that way upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up within as he goes they shall run and not be with me they shall teach us lord teach us lord to the first verse teach me lord [Music] you and teach me not to rely on [Music] to whatever in prayer for an answer from you they that wait upon shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faith teach me lord teach me lord [Music] wow [Music] keep my faith renewed and my eyes on thee let me be on this earth what you want me to shall renew their strength they shall mount up [Music] [Applause] [Music] they shall walk and [Music] when we were young at home still me and my brothers and my sister dad thought it would be best to teach us how to box to defend ourselves and and my dad never boxed professionally but he did box so he knew how to do that and taught us to do some things and my older brother's four years older and i'm about 14 months older than my younger brother so i always chose my younger brother to box against [Music] because quickly i could beat him i never liked to choose my older brother because quickly he could beat me but see the battles you face god has placed him in your path to to bring a character something in you that he wants to develop in you we're not all robots we're not all clumps we're not made us yes we are to be sons and daughters of jesus christ but you have a character and a nature about you i look at brother joe and and you know he's quite a bit taller than sister aaron but i'm going to give you a little secret here brother aaron could not have the brother joe sorry could not have those children his wife did because god makes each individual to be who they are and he teaches you to battle with who you are but you know what you can encourage one another you can strengthen one another my dad used to bring all the neighborhood boys over not any of the girls but the boys and say now i'll teach you boys to box and i found out later he was keeping us off the streets that way and getting in trouble but we still got to learn to box that way and take care of ourselves but each one of us was different and and you might say you're battling a different battle you're going through a different time but we can encourage one another this is how the lord has given me strength this is what the lord has done for me the scripture even says ye older sisters teach the younger why would he say that because you've gone through your battles and you've gone through your times you've gone through your experiences and therefore you can help one another i remember brother peter and brother lyle had not really ministered before because i started ministering here and and i was the experienced one because i'd done it a couple years maybe nowhere near brother green but i encourage them give your heart to the lord pray seek the lord and let them do because that's how god works brother eddie god has called you you have your brother peter but your brother eddie you can help one another encourage but you have your race to run brother sam you have your race to run but you can be encouraged by those that run i ran cross country and one time i took off with the leaders and the next thing i heard all this shouting go aaron go go and then suddenly i was running with the leaders and i got afraid and i backed off the leaders kept right on going and i finished i finished let's put it that way but you know run your race that is set before you and you know and we you will trip and you will fall you will have your down times but you can call and i know this to be and i'll just say it personally me and my wife started going through a hard time in our young marriage and we kind of took our eyes off the lord a little bit we found ourselves doing things that we would have said we've never done just being a little loose a little axe and suddenly the radio station churn changed and suddenly this changed in the house this is what i had to do i called five brothers five families we attended a different church at that time and i said me and my wife are going through a hard time we're struggling we're going to at seven o'clock this evening we're going to get before the lord and we're going to ask god for help would you pray with us and all of them did and the next time we saw him in service they were saying thank you because god met with us also in that prayer well one is encouraging and one is strengthening they're also receiving encouragement and strength also and i appreciate god being so mindful of us i appreciate the word of the lord it comes right down to where you live you know a young man young lady you're going through your times but look i hope it doesn't go that long but you will overcome because there was a time i was that young man in church not quite there but we have all overcome because god has had a set of race before us let's bow our heads and pray lord we thank you for your word because your word is true your word is perfect it is unfailing it is life lord you became flesh the word became flesh and lived a life and overcame here on this earth it's hard to believe and hard to understand that you were tempted and tried it was hard to be to understand that you would feel pain that you would feel left out when you said my father my father why has thou forsaken me but you did and you said as i have overcome you can overcome this spirit will be come back and he shall lead you he shall guide you he shall direct you in all things that where i am you may be also lord help us to believe lord and encourage one another and strengthen one another pray for one another because we are the body of christ lord every part of the body different in how it does but still the body of the christ lord we thank you for your word and we accept it lord now help us to live it we ask in jesus christ's day amen god bless you lord willing we'll be here wednesday night and we had to announce that we would have a prayer meeting this wednesday night come seek in the lord saying lord the things that as a church as brother jordan even prayed as a church in a congregation and as individuals seeking the god lord i want to know you more i want to love you more i want to see our church just grow tighter and closer to one another and just follow your leadership and then lord willing next weekend sunday services brother reggie pled coming down from flagstaff to be with us this weekend so you love the lord jesus turn around tell the
