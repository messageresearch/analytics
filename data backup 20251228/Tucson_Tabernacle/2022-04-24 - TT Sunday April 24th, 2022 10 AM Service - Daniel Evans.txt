lead not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths amen let's turn over a couple pages to proverbs 14. let's we're let's read verse 12. very serious scripture in one that again that we should all be thinking about always and one that i'll be talking about this morning proverbs 14 12 says this there's a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death let's ask mercies of our lord jesus almighty god we thank you that we can come together once again knowing lord that there may come a day that we can't gather the lord while we're here we want to work and we want to serve you the best that we can to point as many souls to our resurrected savior jesus christ bless us this morning i pray and father help me to say the right words in the right way with the right spirit granted lord in jesus name amen you may be seated it's good to good to see you all i see my friend brother scott here all the way down from fairbanks alaska his name's scott winter and if you have a a friend that's a winner like that there's no way we can lose brother scott is a special brother you've never heard any jokes like that have you but scott's a special brother to me a good friend it's uh and we've had some good fellowship over the years i am i'm still kind of feeding over service last sunday i really appreciated that what brother aaron had on his heart to have all uh four of us ministered i appreciated what the brothers said i appreciate appreciated what brother aaron said and and brother joe quoted him today when he talked about saturday and and how saturday was a hard time and i appreciate brother aaron ministering on that i appreciated brother lyle ministering also on the humility of mary and and how that mary was had the honor of being the first one to see the resurrected lord but the one thing that that really stuck with me and i think the thing that meant the most to me of of that whole service and i know it it went a little long everybody stayed right on time except for the guy that spoke last and you know he he got a little bit excited and and he let it go a little longer and i feel like i feel like it was when i was back in college i am and when i was getting my bachelor's degree brother peter i i was able to squeeze four years of college into six it's a gift but uh so i did i i was a little bit long last sunday and i apologize for that but i wanted to uh point out something that brother peter said and brother peter said this and i thought it was such a profound statement i went back and i i listened to the service on the website peter said this peter says god's plan for resurrection was never for a single son to be raised but that there would be many sons brought to glory what a what a wonderful statement and it's something that we may all know as christians we we look at that resurrection and we all we all understand what what peter's statement was but the way he put it so eloquently it just really stuck with me all week and brother peter i really believe that the lord led you in saying that i i listened to your whole sermon again and it was it was just a tremendous blessing to me i thank you thank you for that and um i i believe that the resurrection is something that it's so often overlooked but it is the most important thing in a christian's life in a christian's life in a christian's testimony we could we could go on a promise and we we go on promises that that we will be resurrected that we will we will receive eternal life but jesus showed us that he was the only one as i said when i was preaching that could lay down his life all of us could lay down our lives but he was the only one that could take it up back again and i get i i was excited all week i had a really good week it started with a dear friend brother ed calling me up and praying with me on monday morning you know i was going through some uh hard things that people that all of us go through at work and the lord took it was a really difficult week last week and made just a great week this weekend and i appreciate being on somebody's heart and let's never forget friends to reach out to each other that meant the world to me when brother ed called me and and said he wanted to pray with me it was important to me and i know that we pray for other people i i pray for other people all the time but when somebody calls me up and says hey you're on you're on my heart that's a real blessing um i wanted to talk this morning about a subject that is dear to my heart the first sermon i ever preached was in the traditional sense here in the here in the pulpit was at a minister's meeting and brother aaron was there and i preached on the images that divide us and it was it was a subject that's dear to me and and i pray that the lord will give me the wisdom to bring it forward to you and to maybe help you all in your walk with the lord and and you're not judging other people i think we have to be careful with that we all do and i wanted to maybe say i know that all of us are asked one of the questions that probably every one of us has asked is why do you go to that church and i've been asked many times why are you going to the tabernacle just as you all are why do you come to the tabernacle why do you go to this church or that church and i really don't believe that any church is any better than any other church what i believe is that you will get out of church what you put into church no matter where where you are if you come and you come expecting if you come not willing to all the time just sit back and feed just sit back and eat but i think that we should also come to church to feed we should also come to church to work we should come to church to serve others and i think when we start serving others is when we will start receiving more and when asked why that stephanie and i are coming to the tucson tabernacle i i wanted to share with you all why we're here and i know that this church has a long way to go like every other church this church has problems like every other church this church really needs to improve like every other church but when i come here i come to this church because i see a great potential i see a foundation in this church that's built on the people that are in these pews now that has a potential to do something very special i really see that and that's why i'm here brother and that's why i come to church here is because i want to be part of the lord doing anything i am my my dad and my my grandpa evans they used to follow brother branham around the country they followed brother branham because they knew that god was doing something in those meetings and they wanted to be part of that they wanted to be there and i think that i might have that same spirit that i want to be wherever god is i want to be where god is going to move and going to do something and i have two very important things on my heart that that i want in a church and it's something that i've always desired my whole life and we don't i don't have we don't have it yet but i want a church that i can witness to someone on the street and that i can bring them to church and that they would give their hearts to the lord it would have a place that wouldn't be judgmental that wouldn't wouldn't hammer them with doctrines but that could come to a place that they could give their hearts to the lord jesus and grow and receive the holy spirit i want that in a church and i see that this church could be that and i don't see that very often and then i also want a church that the people that have left that have left the fold maybe that have lost faith in brother braham's message i would like to see a church that would welcome them back instead of judging them instead of saying that you have to conform to our image of christianity that would welcome that and that they would feel comfortable coming back here those are the two things and and friends this church i see that that we could be that i want to be like i said wherever the lord is wherever he's moving is where i want to be and it may not be here i don't know just like you all all of us are constantly we should always be praying lord where do you want me what do you want me to do i want to be where god is i want to be where the holy spirit is moving where where the love of god exists and that is my purpose for being here because i see that we could be that we could possibly this church this church is really the first message church besides the branham tabernacle that ever was when brother greene felt to start a church and he welcomed brother branham to tucson this church was founded on that the church in sierra vista also i think that was that was the if not the first it was one of it was either this one or that one it was the first real message church and i see in this church that there is also the potential to reach across the aisle and break down some of the barriers that have come up over the years brother branham's message came to tear down the denominational system it came brother branham referred to the scripture that this prophet of malachi 4 this angel of revelation chapter that this man was also in the book of revelation that it's there was a voice that said come out of her my people come out of those denominations come out of those those separations come out of that and friends i see that this message the the message that not let's say not with the capital m in message this message has become divided again it's become segregated we've started drawing circles that if you don't see it my way then then you're out you're out of the message and i believe the tucson tabernacle could be i don't know and the lord hasn't told me that i just have hope in my heart that the two son tabernacle could be the church that could reach a cross and say we're our brethren and that's what i want to see so bad it may not be it may be but why not why not this church brother branham he's misquoted many times on this on this quote but brother branham said this he said it is better to be right in your heart and wrong in your doctrine than right in your doctrine and wrong in your heart it's misquoted many times many most people say spirit brother baby never said that brother brahm said heart and i believe the people in this church have the right hearts we have a long way to go we have there's there's many weaknesses that we have but i think that we're right in our hearts and we have the right motives and we want to get we want to get there and i want so bad to see our children come back i want to see those that have left to have an open door an open place to welcome the men that's that's what that's why i'm here because i see that this church more than any other church that i know of has the potential to do that i uh i could go on and on and on uh about that i'll never get to my sermon but um brother braham said this brother branham said the church can never progress until it knows what grounds it's progressing on and friends that grounds needs needs to be none other none other than the lord jesus christ and him crucified none other my topic today is images that divide us let's turn in our bibles to the book of daniel now as you're turning down to daniel chapter two what's going on here is the um nebuchadnezzar invaded jerusalem invaded judah and he took thousands of these hebrews captive and he brought them back to his hometown to his home place which was the country of babylon which is the city of babylon and he took the good ones he took the ones that were able to do things and he brought them back he conquered jerusalem he took all the treasures he brings them back to his country and he puts these men and women to work in babylon and the king has a bad dream and this dream the king knew the king knew it was very significant and it was so significant that he wasn't going to trust it to his ministerial group he wanted to see some sort of a sign that these men were led of god so he makes a decree he says i had a dream he says i want you to interpret my dream they're like great no problem king we can do it and he says but here's the catch you're going to have to tell me the dream like wait wait a minute nobody can do that except god the king says that's right and he says oh and here's another kicker if you can't do it you're going to die i'm going to kill every last one of you if you can't do it that's a rough boss brother joe so they they start everybody starts getting upset and we can't do it they argue with the king and the king sticks to it i've made this decree and this is going to be how it is so just before the king starts slaughtering these guys the word comes to daniel this prophet this young man that was taken out of out of his country his family was taken out of his country and he had a gift great man and and here's what brother daniel did brother ed this uh makes me think of of you calling me on monday in daniel chapter 2 26 um i'm sorry in daniel chapter 2 17 and 18 he goes to his buddies his buddies are shadrach meshach and abednego his his three friends these three young men he goes to them and he says brethren he says pray for me he said let's pray and what a good example it is that that the brethren can come together and pray one for another so he gets them together and they they pray and let's go to chapter 2 verse 26. and then daniel goes before the king and he says this the the bible says this and the king answered and said unto daniel whose name was belter art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof now listen to the prophet's answer daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king had demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the the sayers shall show unto thee daniel's saying right here he's saying no i can't make it known i can't i can't do this see the wisdom of the prophet then he says this but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days notice how the prophet gives the credit to god thy dream and thy visions upon thy head of thy head upon thy bed are these and then daniel goes and discerns the dream tells the king the dream and then tells him the interpretation of it the king was like wow this must have really made an impression on nebuchadnezzar so the king he's listening to daniel and he says he's got to be thinking in his mind none of my these men that i was about to kill none of them could do this in fact i've never seen anything like this so he he goes on and let's let's go to the next verse here let's go to verse 46. then the king nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshiped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of the secrets seeing that thou couldest reveal the secret then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many gifts and made him a ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon then daniel requested of the king his friends and he set shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel sat in the gate of the king now go over to the next verse chapter 3 verse 1. nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breaths thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon look how that falls in the line of the scriptures so this king nebuchadnezzar who is who is by nature a gentile an idolater daniel does this great thing nebuchadnezzar pays homage to him and then we see right after that he goes and he builds the statue now what's going on here let me read to you before i start talking about it let me read you what brother branham said he says this in possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial he said let's take the hebrew children because they stood true and wouldn't tolerate with image worship they refused to bow down to an image that the king of the nation had made it was made after a holy man too the image of daniel so it's it's in perfect order in the bible so this statue that this king nebuchadnezzar puts up is of the prophet is of the holy man brother braham goes on showed that the gentile race was brought in under the false side of worshipping an image of a holy man it goes out the same way when people will be forced to worship images of people it come in by revelation of daniel being able to interpret the word that was wrote in the handwriting of the wall that's the way it come in and that's the way it goes out the same way of the image of the gentile so we we see that that this nebuchadnezzar he he builds this image and he he fashions it exactly how he thinks this holy man is or should be he builds it its shoulders were this wide it was this tall its head looked like this its feet its its legs looked like this the feet look looked like that it was in this perfective image of nebuchadnezzar's idea of what a holy man should be and then he says this he says if you don't do what i say if you don't worship this image that i have created in my own mind if you don't worship this then you're going to die and today we would say then you're going to be cast out then i'm going to disfellowship you i'm going to draw my circle with you outside if you don't see things the way i see them so so this great image was was set up and nebuchadnezzar made the decree if you don't follow the way i've set up church if you don't follow the way i worship if you don't follow my image of the prophet if you don't follow the way that i think then you're out then we have separation and what do we have today we have all of these different different separations within the message that was brought by a holy man a man of god a prophet a great prophet and we we see that same spirit carrying on today and then there was three three of these young men that helped daniel pray they decided we can't do it we cannot fall down and worship this image we can't do what you're telling us to because this is off the word we are taught by the prophet moses that we are not to lift any man up above god so we're not going to do it it kindle nebuchadnezzar's anger you do it the way that i say it because in nebuchadnezzar's mind like all of us if they don't do it they're saying i'm wrong and they're not they're not conforming the way i think that things should be so then nebuchadnezzar his anger gets gets all fired up he says heat that fiery furnace seven times harder and throw them guys in there and the lord delivered them we we know the story it's one of the most famous stories we learned from our kids coming up but we see that spirit of conforming to these images and it's a religious spirit it's a the the statue of daniel was a religious spirit it was a religious object so if we fast forward about 600 years we have the jewish religion has been fractured into different sects and organizations and groups we have this group called the pharisees who they were the local pastors but aaron we would be like a pharisee back then i mean if they had groups we wouldn't be i mean we'd be out of that mess but but that would be the pastor of a local church like this is a pharisee and the ministers of the local church so for the lyle brother peter and i we would we would be like these ministers in that group and then there were the sadducees and the sadducees they were too good for everybody man they worked in the temple they were the high priests they they they weren't didn't want to dirty their hands with the common people that the that the pharisees did and they disagreed and they fought like cats and dogs the the sadducees they didn't think that there was a resurrection the pharisees oh no there was a resurrection and they argued about the scriptures and then when they look at the scriptures and this will be a common theme when they would look at the scriptures they would only see what they wanted to see and then there was this other group there wasn't just pharisees and sadducees there was this other group called the essenes and these essenes they were the self-righteous ones they were the kind of the the right wing cult and they were out in the desert and they afford their they formed their own communes and they lived a life in in in their way that they didn't want to they didn't want to mix with anybody they completely separated from the world so they were out doing their thing out there and all of them hating each other and all of them claiming moses all of them reading this bible and believing it and using it against each other forming their images and they had their images and these images of christianity that they had the messiah that was supposed to come had to come according to their way of thinking they weren't they weren't able to flex a little bit they weren't able to bend and then when this man came he was nothing that fit into their images of christianity he didn't fit in with the eseems he didn't fit in with the sadducees he didn't fit in with the pharisees he was totally different than all of theirs came according perfectly according to the word but not according to their images let's turn to matthew chapter 5 verse 43. and this is jesus talking now watch he's about to tear down one of their images here he says this matthew 5 43 you have heard that it had been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy whoa what happened to eye for an eye no no we've never heard anything like this it sounds so normal to us because we are christians but that didn't that wasn't normal to them that's not that's not the way we do things we kill people if they're not jewish we fight them but then jesus says here thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despisefully use you and persecute you they ever had to be thinking uh uh i'm not going for this new doctrine you know this this guy out there preaching that you know he's got strange stuff that doesn't match up with our image of what moses talked book of mark chapter 2. in mark chapter 2 jesus goes to the house of his friend named matthew and it says this verse 15. thank you my brother it says and it came to pass that as jesus sat at mead in his house in matthew's house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him you can imagine what these pharisees were thinking look at this guy look at these sinners he's eating with these tax collectors and with these prostitutes and with these mentally with these mentally ill people how can he do that and there was mentally ill people there was a lady in mary magdalene she was delivered of seven demons that's mental illness friends it says here and when the scribes and the pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners now i think i've said it before that a publican was probably worse than a sinner a publican's a tax collector so what a tax collector would do is he'd say okay brother wilson according to my ledger you owe 500 bucks for your taxes this year and then he'd look and he'd say that'll be a thousand dollars and brother wilson's like hey no i only owe 500 to rome and he says no he says you owe a thousand so matthew would take his 500 he would give it to the roman whatever and then he'd pocket the other 500. and if brother wilson couldn't pay i'm going to take your donkey i'm going to take your land that's what kind of a creep that these publicans were they were not good guys they were hated because of their dishonesty and matthew was one of them so they're eating they're eating in his house verse 17 when jesus heard it he saith to them and i love this they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance and i ask you think about who are the biggest sinners there in that room was it mary was it matthew or was it these pharisees yes was it was it these men this clergy group that thought they were better than jesus who was the biggest sinner they're the ones that should have fallen down at his feet and asked for forgiveness but it came to people like mary that would humble themselves as brother lyle talked about last week and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not now these are some of the disciples of the forerunner of christ that they missed it they missed what john taught they should have been with jesus but they missed what the messenger said and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days no man also soweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filleth it taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse and no man put a new wine into old bottles those bottles are not glass those bottles are animal skins else the new wine duff bursts the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but the new wine must be put into new bottles it's put into the new bottles because the new wine has to it has to degas it has to has to swell a little bit and if you put it into something that doesn't have any flex to it it'll bust but if you put it in something that has some flex which is what i'm saying about this church and i think that we do have that that it can flex and it can move it can move as that wine starts to starts to ferment and that wine starts to really become good see where was i verse 23 and it came to pass that he went through the cornfields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful now one thing if we go back to the book of deuteronomy or leviticus i don't remember where it's at but they weren't actually breaking any laws they were out there on the sabbath and they were taking the the ears of wheat and they were rubbing it in their hands to to wipe off the the shuck and then they they were left with seed and they were eating it but the law says they could do that on the sabbath but they couldn't take a bunch of it out of the field so they weren't actually breaking any laws but jesus he didn't address their mistake in the scriptures he showed them the meaning of the scriptures and this is important that we understand why these things are they're not just rules and regulations and laws like when we're teaching our children it's better to tell them why they're not allowed to do stuff don't touch that you're going to get burned you know or you don't just don't touch that first thing they're going to want to do is touch it but if you touch that you're going to get burned and it says here verse number 25 and he said unto them have you never read what david did and when he had need he was a hungered and when he and they that were with him how he went into the house of god in the days of abiather the high priest and did eat the shoe bread which is not lawful for to eat but for the priests and also gave also to them which were with him and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath those pharisees probably swallowed their sermon right about that that did not make sense at all this is an ordinance from god that we are to keep this sabbath and jesus was saying listen he's like you don't understand the scriptures god gave this sabbath not for himself he's god he doesn't need it he gave the sabbath for us because god knew god knew that we're people god knew that if we didn't have this rule that we would be out on sunday working that we'd be missing church that we'd be that we wouldn't give god that time that will benefit us in the long run the time that every minute that we give to god we benefit over and over and if we take the time that we have for god and we replace it with work or something else then we're going to suffer for it and that's why jesus says this he says the sabbath is for us it's not just a law we need to understand why that we do these things therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath you can imagine when he said that um what happened there and you know they probably attacked him and they looked at the scriptures through their denominational eyes through their eyes of these images that they've created over the years without the leading of the holy spirit and they used those scriptures against jesus and that's my point today is we need to be careful in taking this bible and interpreting it in ways that benefit us and we need to genuinely seek the lord and seek what he says in this word and what he he says through his prophet and that is how we listen to the word that's how we listen to the tapes and so often friends i think it's more often than not i think it's a lot more often than not that people are listening to tapes to further their narrative to to increase that image that they have of brother brown's message and they're ignoring what he's saying just as they did with jesus they took the word and they attacked him with the word the very word that was standing before them in the in the form of a man in jesus christ trying to attack him with that word and jesus came back with the word and he says no you're not even you're not understanding things this word is a blessing to us these tapes that we listen to the the message of the prophet it's a blessing to us it was given to us to help us through this life and so often we take the message and we beat people over the head and what do we do it drives them out of church and that's why we see we see many of our families and friends we say you know they're finished with it and they leave they leave because they never got the meaning of it in the first place this message is not a hammer it's not a baseball bat brother joe it's a blessing to help us just as the sabbath is the sabbath is a was a blessing to the people if they would have just taken it that way they uh but they didn't they they um they use it against each other there's a there's a story you've heard brother branham i think we've all probably heard it there's a sermon called as the eagle stirth up her nest you know you know that tape it it's it's a it's a wonderful story it's a story about about this this baby eagle that the farmer took the took the egg and he put it he put it underneath the chicken and the hatch the the the eagle and that eagle was just different than all the other chickens and he's out there and then and you know the story the the mama eagle's flying and she calls and the baby hears the call and and there's two people that listened to that sermon and one of them was fired up man after hearing that he did not like what brother branham said and and you know what he said he says he says you know what i don't appreciate him calling me a chicken and the other guy said he called me an eagle so it's the different ways that you're looking at it and i want to be and as i hear brother brandt i'm saying these things and i hear him condemning sin praise god that's for me that's for my family i want to live that way but then the other people are seeing how he's just he's legalistic he's casting me out he's doing all this no friends it's not that way and that's how the ministry has to present it and not a negative beating us over the head with it but saying that this is a blessing to us it's not an image that we have of christianity that you have to conform to it's something that will help you through life it'll it'll help it'll make you more honest it'll make you more successful it'll it'll make you a better person you'll be happier if you're following this word and uh i i had a friend i was over at his house and uh he was we were talking about the word and he says he says you know he says i don't like the spirit of our church is better than everybody else i can't stand that i don't and that's why i'm here that's another reason i hear i like the way that this church is we're not better than anybody we're just trying to get through this life we're just trying to get to the lord we're just trying to give our hearts to the lord we're we're trying to be right but then i see other other churches and they're like we're better sadducees were better and and this brother tells me he says he says you know he says our pastor he says and i i love the brother i love the pastor he says he says he's one of the main things he's not afraid to preach anything that brother branham preached he's not afraid to tackle anything and he starts telling me about the third poll and he starts telling me about the the the um the tent meeting and all these things and i was like praise the lord that's that's i believe that too and i had just been doing some research i just resigned my position of voice of god recordings and i was i just had was doing some research and i just happened to have some quotes up on my phone and i i said well i said let me read you something and there's this quote i didn't give it to you brother peter i'm sorry but it's i may have it says this and jehovah jirei 6102-26 brother branham says this so it's a lesson to us tonight to keep our minds upon god regardless of what man says it is of what man it is let him be a cardinal priest prophet whatever he might be he is not immune from mistakes and error and even death and sin but there is one who is and that's jesus christ he is the one and then i read a few more um quotes about brother branham i was saying the prophets are not infallible prophets make mistakes i make mistakes and man did the claws come out he was upset that i was saying that to the fact to all the way to the point he says i don't want to hear that in my house and i was like brother i'm just reading what the prophet said you told me that everything is on the table that brother branham preached how come you don't believe that and he says well you just don't need to say it i said you're the one that told me that your pastor preaches everything brother branham said he's not afraid of anything so what's why am i wrong in doing this and he was so upset at me and i said you know what i said the difference between you and me is i believe everything brother branham said you claim to believe it but you have this image of the prophet that is not true that is not right and friends these images that we have they can lead us to destruction we need to focus on the one image and that's christ and then we need to conform to his image brother branham says this he says what i'm trying to say in influence 63 11 14. what i'm trying to say don't never lose your confidence don't let satan tell you evil about me because there's much but you keep that confidence because if you don't it won't happen don't look to me as a man i'm a man full of mistakes but look to what i'm trying look to what i'm saying about him it's him he's the one now there's a man i'll follow now there's a man that is why that god vindicated this man in such a way that's a that's the reason that god said i'm with him you listen to him and that's a man that i hold dear to my heart and that's a message that i hold dear to my heart a man that can say hey i make mistakes and he did you know i'm not i'm not infallible and he's not infallible but he was a man of god and he had a relationship with christ that i want i may not be able to do the things that he did i may not be able to to preach the gospel like he preached i may not be able to do the miracles that he did but i believe that i am entitled not entitled i believe that i do have the opportunity to have the same relationship with jesus christ as brother branham did i'm just i'm another one of his sons brother branham was one of one of god's sons and i'm another one and i don't lift either one of my children any higher than the other i love them both i love them both the same we can't brand we can't love any any one kid more than the other when it's not in us to do that and it's not in god to do it either i'm going to skip down to there was a there was a man a young man we call him the rich young ruler and he was a good man he came to church didn't miss service came to church he had position in the church he gave money to the church he he was he lived a good life and he came to jesus and he asked jesus he says this luke chapter 18 verse 18. and a certain ruler came to jesus and he asked him and he said good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said to him why call us thou me good none is good save one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother now jesus was repeating the law to him which he knew very well and he had kept himself from doing all these things but he hadn't fully surrendered and in another place where it tells the story jesus looked on this young man and he loved him jesus wanted this young man to prosper he wanted this young man to go to heaven and to be with him in fact this young man may have even been one of the disciples if he would have done what jesus said but he missed that opportunity and jesus saw that he was going to miss this opportunity and verse 21 and he said the rich young ruler this young man said all these i've kept from my youth up now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet thou lackest one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute it unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was rich he had an image in his mind he had an image of christianity in his mind this rich rugged ruler did he said well i can give and i can continue with my job and i can continue to to prosper and i can have all my stuff and he looked at maybe he looked at peter and john and he's like look at their clothes you know the car that they drive in today's words look at these guys i don't want to be like that i don't have to give up everything i'm a good person i come to church i believe the message i believe the message i'm a good person i don't have to give it up but there's one thing that jesus saw that was standing between this young man and salvation or eternal death never-ending torment everlasting torment i think the bible says and that was surrender to me and he gave him something hard to do and the young man the church-goer that he was how good he was and how he gave to the church and he showed up every every day he was a religious man he went to hell and he is in hell today that good man he's in hell today and i think are we willing as a people are we willing to give up our images the things that we were raised with check those things check those things with the word it may seem ever so right my testimony is uh i had an experience one night i was working late at voice of god um stephanie and the kids were in tucson i think it was january they we always come to tucson for christmas stephanie and the kids were still here i went back to go back to work in jeffersonville and since there was nobody home at the house i just worked late i didn't have a reason to go home so i just i just worked into the night because i had a lot to do and i had an experience with the lord and i was driving home from work and i said lord i said i was raised in this message my grandpa was probably if it wasn't his best friend it was one of his two best friends in the whole world i grew up sitting around the supper table hearing story after story about the prophet i've been so blessed but lord i am so full of doctrines i'm full of them and i was thinking about about the way that i thought of the ministry and how i thought the ministry was so evil what do they think they're doing trying to preach the gospel when you have a tape that you can play and i was like lord i have all these doctrines and i've been just listening to these tapes just to prove my doctrines and friends i'm not just saying that for me every single person in here now should be thinking on those same lines and i said lord i've been i've been listening to these tapes i've been following i've been reading my bible and all i see in this bible is listen to the prophet in him only all that i see in this word is that everything that's in me i see that image and i said lord i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm full of these doctrines and i made this commitment this is in 2012. i made this commitment i said lord i'm going to relearn your message i said i'm going to relearn it in the spirit that it was given and brother scott i've changed the way that i think because i believe that i was listening to it now under the anointing of the holy spirit and not so much under the anointing of the image that i had in my mind about how life should be lived and how that we should worship and uh i'm let's uh let's go to first corinthians chapter one now if we we read in acts chapter 2 and there beyond we see that the disciples had been filled with the holy spirit they were driven in driven away they were being persecuted and they were driven to the lord they were in one one place in one accord and the holy spirit fell and they were there was such beautiful unity in the book of acts and we see the unity and we see things happening and i really believe it's because of the unity there's a reason that it says in acts chapter 4 the place that they were in the whole wall shook as they were worshiping and it says they were of one heart and one soul they were all together they loved each other they were together in this battle and that's i believe that is why that we see such miracles that have happened in the book of acts is because they were united they were united not so much in their doctrine but they were united in their purpose and they were united in christ and then paul comes on the scene a little bit later and paul is part of this great movement of unity and part of spreading the gospel and then something starts to happen paul starts seeing division he starts seeing separation among the people first corinthians chapter 1 and paul is going to do everything that he can to stop it now i uh in a lot of my my education in my past i write and i've had a lot of schooling and how to write and and how to express yourself in words to the written word and one thing that's a cardinal sin of writing that is repeating yourself you don't want to say you don't want to say the the tucson tabernacle is located on stone and the tucson tabernacle is this big and the tucson tabernacle is this and this and this you want to say and the tucson tabernacle is located on stone and it is here and it in it or brother scott winter is is lives in fairbanks alaska and brother scott winner is this and brother scott winner is this you say he you define it and then you say he unless brother peter when you're writing unless you are trying to make a very pronounced point then you repeat yourself and you're jabbing it into the to the listener and you're saying i'm i know you know what i'm saying but i'm really going to stick this to you and here's what paul says now listen to the word that he repeats paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god in sosthenes our brother unto the church of god which is a corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ that in everything you are enriched in him in all utterance and all knowledge even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that you so that ye come behind in no gift waiting from the coming of our lord jesus christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ god is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord paul is making a very pronounced point there don't you think he repeats himself over and over and over paul was a very educated man paul was obviously a very good writer paul was good at what he did and he was making a point right now there's pronouns in every language and then this was this was written probably in greek and there's pronouns in greek because it sounds funny to do it otherwise but paul's making a point here and he says this in verse 10 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of chloe that there are contentions among you now this i say that every one of you let me say that again now this i say that every one of you now was paul saying that every single person i don't know but he is making a point saying that a lot of you now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i have apollos and i have cephas and i have christ look at the divisions that's creeping in the church even in the early church is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of paul he's saying don't go there friends don't fight don't don't argue on these doctrines some say peter some say paul some say have apollos paul throws himself right in there he says don't do it be brethren be united we are one peter and paul obviously had contention between them on circumcision and on on the different things they argue paul said i was stood into his face because he was to be blamed but they were still united they were still one and so much that even peter in his in his epistle one of the last things that he wrote he said listen to paul because people people they struggle with what paul says but listen to him and that's what images get us friends that's that's where in closing that's that's where we we develop these images and we want people to conform to them and we're we're not we're not right in doing them we're not writing and doing it to our children we want to raise them right we want to raise them in the image of god but don't force these things on each other and sisters if you come and brother matt don't don't impose that image let's make sure that we have the right image or we could be like the rich young ruler and find ourselves lost because our image that we had wasn't exactly the way it was yeah there's a story about a man his name is that's about 150 years ago his name is nox singh and he and his family he had two boys a wife and he and his family lived in india and they lived among head hunting tribes very very evil people that that noxing lived with that he was raised with and he had this image i'm sure that the way that they lived this warring and fighting that this was okay this is just the way i was raised there was a revival going on in wales over in england and a few of them and it kind of spread around the world and a few of these brothers went up to northeast india and they started witnessing about this man jesus christ and they got a hold of noxin and they started talking about how jesus taught these things and jesus said to love your enemies and it just resonated with his spirit and he just said that this man jesus is right and even though he had been raised with this image of cre of how life should be and as long as we can see it he didn't see it was wrong they didn't see it was wrong he gave that up he forsook that image and the people started coming to him in the village and they started saying hey what are you doing and he says i'm not i don't i don't do that anymore i'm not part of of this way of life i want to love my enemies now and they're like no our enemies could attack our village we don't that's not the way we live what are you what are you talking and he says i'm a christian now he says i believe in this man jesus christ so the story started propagating and it came to the chief the head guy and he goes to noxing and he says he says what are you doing everything that you've been raised with he says how dare you bring this strange thing into our village and you're telling other people about it he says how dare you do that not seeing answered and he says i've decided to follow jesus i'm not turning back and the warring tribe that this was he brings maxine's two sons his two boys he brings them up before him and he says he says this he says will you recant of this nonsense that you that you that you have been taught and you're bringing into our village [Music] and he has the men draw the bows to shoot at these two boys and oxen says this he says the world behind me the cross before me no turning back [Music] they pull the bulls back and they shoot the two boys kill him kill him dead so then the the village elder the chief he brings his wife before noxine and he says now will you recant of this nonsense maxine says the cross before me the world behind me no turning back you draw the bow [Music] you can imagine how noxine felt and then he brings knox seeing it up and he says now will you recant and he looked at the chief and he says these words he said will you decide now [Music] to follow jesus no turning back and they killed them they killed oxy but it's stuck in this chief's mind and it's stuck in the p the people's mind how this man could follow this man that had been dead for 2000 years and he could throw down all the images that he had grown up with and they thought about it and starting with the chief the one that ordered the execution starting with the chief he gave his heart to the lord jesus and the whole village followed one after the other after the other but scott they all gave their hearts to the lord jesus and now we have that song i have decided to follow jesus and friends we need to set aside all of our images that we have and we need to follow jesus god sent a prophet to show us these things and we've taken what he's said and we've messed it all up we've got to take what he said we've got to apply it to our lives and we've got to get back to christ his whole commission was to turn the heart of the children back to that of the pentecostal fathers and friends that's what we have to do so let's stand brother matt if you could start us on that song [Music] brother wilson come on up and close wilson come on come on [Music] no turning back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the cross before me the world behind me the cross before me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] let's bow our heads [Music] and this message that i preached i pray that it has made each one of you think about these images that all of us have in our lives think about these images friends and think about does the way that i believe does it please god does it represent jesus christ as this noxine represented christ to those in his village do i represent jesus christ in that way am i willing like maxine was and not like the rich young ruler am i willing to give my all for him and many times that may be just not saying an ill word or it may be reaching out to someone that's done you wrong am i willing to do that friends that's the way that we should be as christians but wilson if you close my friend god bless you saints in in second corinthians chapter two i think it is in verse 10 paul said casting down imaginations notice the word imaginations [Music] that there's your image that's your image because any imagination is not the product it's not what we're to look at images or imaginations or something we propose or something we thought that's like in dan was reading in daniel 3 notice every time the king had the sound of music did you notice the trumpet wasn't mentioned not one time the trumpet is pure word unadulterated el shaddai jehovah jireh hallelujah so you know we get all these images i've been there dan i'll tell you i've been there but i'm glad that god knows how to give us some i save clean our eyes out clean our mind now clean our spirit out clean our attitude out some of our attitudes just plain stinks in the in the in the eyes of god but god loves his kids hallelujah what key are we [Music] jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so
