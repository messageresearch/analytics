little bit of effort but then we got here this morning there was five other things broken so we're struggling through things this morning and but i appreciate these brothers for all helping brother dan roberts was the one that kind of spearheaded it and said hey let's do this he nominated his son to narrow down what we were going to buy and then everybody helped put it together but ed did a lot of effort getting the scissor lift in and i guess some of you probably came through the front lobby and saw the scissor lift in the front lobby still there but um we had to get a forklift to get it up the steps etc but there's a little bit of challenges but i'm afraid i'm thankful for all these brothers and all the different ones that help their their wives that support them and allow them to come

lord that healeth thee [Music] i like just take a moment and think of these words as we sing i'd like to maybe set a an atmosphere of expectation on god but it's not so much my expectation but what he promised because he's faithful i [Music] am i am [Music] i am [Music] now let's sing it back to him you are the god that hideth you are the god [Music] lord we we've come this morning [Music] not just because it's sunday and it's maybe to some it is a a practice or a ritual lord but we've come expecting and believing we look at ourselves and we we say well just i'm not sufficient i i struggled through this and i struggled that but you said to come anyways and to offer ourselves this morning lord our hearts our thoughts our attitude everything to you say lord here i am i need you i'm going gonna take you at your word today because you said you would be with us you would never leave us in a day in a time that there's so much fear so much questioning so much wondering and accusations and pointing fingers at everything lord but our hearts today are looking towards you lord what your word has said and you are faithful lord you keep your word lord we're just asking you to come and visit us today in jesus christ's name amen thank you thank you musicians well just take one scripture before you're seated if brothers will pull that first scripture up on genesis 5 24 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him you may be seated what a testimony what a what a thing to hear or and they walked with god and god was so pleased with them that he just took him took him home i i don't know but something that enoch had in his heart something that enoch believed something that that caused enoch to get up and walk said one of these days i'm just going to walk out of this atmosphere this whole thing and i'm going on to the other side and i think sometimes maybe we get a little too comfortable here maybe a little too planning our next few days our next few weeks our next few years and there's nothing wrong with that but sometimes maybe there's too much planning on that but maybe one morning wake up could this this be the day lord that i'm walking with you and you just say come on home i would i would want that to be soon and very soon so we know the things that are going on there's been some of the announcements made and some of some of the churches in in this whole world and some of the folks that we know some of the names we've heard that have had gone on to be with the lord and there are families today that are are missing their loved ones but we have a hope that soon and very soon brother branham said and brother green would always remind us he says one of these days you'll see your loved ones as they come close and you know we're going home soon what a day that'll be i i was just some different thoughts over the last few days and maybe the middle of last week just on expectations what what are we desiring what are we looking forward to what is what is our hope what is our anticipation um and it's it's amazing how you you get some some news some something maybe and and it changes your whole thought pattern your your your feelings and all and then you get past that and you look back and you say well it wasn't that bad after all but before you get to there you're kind of nervous about it and you can ask my girls if there's something that's to do with upgrading the phone or the computer or something like that i get lost real quick i know how to turn it on and off not a whole lot more so this past week the all of the service technicians from the company i work with were all salaried employees and they change us all to hourly one of the biggest reasons because there's been a lot of overtime especially up in the phoenix area a lot of the guys have been working 10 12 hours over time a week so they said we'll we'll do this and and um so now we have to do our own time payroll on the computer and i thank god i have nailed me because i get nervous with it i get and it just seems like i can never make it come out right and then so she shows me again and she shows me again and then she gets his look are you ever going to learn that and i said oh we will maybe 50 times down the road but once you understand it and you go on and you look back at it you go well it wasn't that hard after all it was just this area up here you know but it just made me think and just thinking about this some of the things that we get uh nervous about we get worried about we get troubled about and and in this world that's not hard to do you hear this side my boss on one side and my co-worker on the other side my boss is wondering why not everybody in the world has been vaccinated and my co-worker on this side he said you're crazy if you get vaccinated and i hear both sides of it all day but i have a confidence in god because i can't have confidence in myself or anything else but he said i sent my word and heal all your disease i'm going to stand on that now we never had different conversations would you would you take the vaccine i said i believe if i i would if the lord told me to do it i wouldn't fear it that way because god watches over us but neither am i going to live in fear if i don't because god still watches over us and that's my hope that's my expectation that that and as i was i was doing that going over this and we were in in flagstaff last sunday or over the weekend should i say for the meetings and brother daryl ward was supposed to minister on on friday but because of covid in in back in tennessee he was under quarantine and couldn't come out so they had a brother come up from um phoenix brother armando who who spoke good english but with a strong accent but he made himself well understood and he just took the thought remember when when things get hard and you get frustrated you wonder what's going on remember what god has done for you how he's taken you out how he's brought you through a situation where he's lifted you up from where you are today from where you used to be and re-encourage yourself and he finished his his sermon as he was finishing up he was talking about the angel of the lord it still is here today and how they watch over us he was he was driving a tractor doing some work and and i don't know if it was a lawnmower or what but his three-year-old grandson had come walking up and he didn't know and something just told him to stop and when he stopped and turned his grandson was right there and he would have run over his grandson but see god is still god he's still mindful he still knows how to take care of his children and i really appreciated that and then on saturday brother samuel browning ministered and he talked about interruptions took the the thought interruption taking it out of the sixth hill and things of brother graham's but how god will interrupt your life and what you think is an interruption but god says i'm going to stop or interrupt you here because there is something that has to change something and you look back at that interruption now and you say thank god that he came in and he interrupted me and it was such a blessing to to to hear that to understand those are things that god has done in our life and then he ministered again on sunday and he took the 50th year the jubilee year and two things that he said and that just really stood out with me and some of these things you may hear a hundred times but just one day clicks one day it seems to come together so he was talking about the priest when they offered that sacrifice to be accepted by god and they stood outside the temple and when that smoke came up and they realized the sacrifice had been accepted and they had another year their sins were covered so he was talking about that to come out and that praise it was his his job to go out and sound the trumpet of the jubilee year the setting free of the people your liberty was coming but you didn't see the sacrifice you weren't there but the priest was sent out to blow the trumpet and you had to believe that the priest had witnessed it and when he blew the trumpet you could go free you had to believe that you couldn't get there and begin to question really was he there was he not you had to say this is i'm i can walk away from that which has has me bound and he and i really appreciate it because he said jesus christ that day on calvary that sacrifice was accepted maybe i'll just take this off jesus christ is the accepted sacrifice of god for mine in your jubilee and there had to come a messenger in this day to tell us he's done it it's been accepted it's a finished work but now it's in your hands what do you do with it do you accept and say yes lord i accept my jubilee i'll throw that which has had me bound here that which has me working over here i'll throw it down and i'll go take the promise that which belongs to me and walk in that and he said one more thing and and just uh there was a lot of things but these were just just spoke to me as he was ministering and he talked about and if you know a couple wins he goes we we we had heard that message brother branham is singing he careth and he begins to talk to the congregation well you say my daughter this you say my son this he said but he cares he cares for you and he said so your son is is a homosexual your daughter is a lesbian your husband is a drunk and he and he goes you say it in a way that it sounds like there's nothing you can do about it he said god is greater than that he's bigger than that situation and he can change it and he went out of the prodigal son and we get to look at how that that young boy was living but his heart said i want to go back to my father's house and he began to go back now the story doesn't tell us the thought process of that young man and the father except that the father was looking every day for him until the sun is getting home and he begins to say i'm just going to tell my father i'm not worthy to be your son again just make me a servant but the father had a whole different thought whole different plan in mind that is my son coming back i'm glad that when he looks at me and you and he said those are my children those are the ones that i died for those were the ones that i shed my blood for and therefore they're my children welcome thou into the joy of the lord with no exceptions and it just it it i had had gone i even mentioned this to my wife i think we were driving up on thursday the thought of an an anticipation a hope or an expectation what what are we expecting what is my desire but beyond that is who is the god of my expectations who is the one that has already said try me ask me see if i can't do what you desire so yesterday i just looked up the word expectations every once in a while you get a different definition maybe something you hadn't thought of but there was a bunch of quotes in written by by different people so i started reading some of them and boy did i have great expectations after that to realize the opposite of god what god has said and what god is to what people think so i'm going to just just entitle this first part or the for just three of them the human thought and as human expectations are premeditated resentments and that caught my attention what do they mean by that so i read the little article they went with it and it was a lady who was going to do something for her best friend and she began to plant her birthday party i'm going to do this i'm going to do this i know she likes this she's going to be so happy she's going to be so excited and she made all these plans got everything laid up birthday party came up her friend comes in and her friend looks around and she's happy about what she's done and she's grateful and all you know but it didn't meet the expectation of the person that prepared it because she thought she'll be a lot more happier and this is her she says human expectation are just premeditated resentments you planned it all out then you resent it when you have expectations you are setting yourself up for disappointments quite even said lower your expectations and you won't be so disappointed i know i've put my expectations in a god who never fails and i can't i don't even think i can have enough expectation to meet what's here because it's it's eternal when you have expectations you are setting yourself up for disappointments i started to realize telling my wife and somebody i said listen to some of this no wonder the world is in the condition it is when you have expectations you are setting you're i'm sorry i read the wrong never get attached to someone because attachments lead to expectations and expectations lead to disappointments and some of us or all of us could say that's true we have been disappointed we have been uh we felt we've been failed at times by someone or something but i'll title this one god there's somebody who's got your best interest as his focus there's somebody who wants you to win there is a father who wants you to overcome he wants you to wear the victor's crown of life because he loves you if you have been failed in life you're not alone you have got to remember he is not your earthly father nor your mentor nor your earthly teacher nor your pastor he is the one who knew you before you were ever formed in your mother's womb and saw exact in you exactly what it was going to take to reach his plans for you he looked and he said yes they will be on this side and i will make sure that's god's thought that's god's act so when you put your expectation on what god said in god's word and there is an expected end like enoch and that's why i put enoch in there go enoch walk with god for a reason his desire was to be with god to love god and god loved it so much he said just come on home enoch that should be our hope that should be our expectation that desire lord this world is not my home while i'm here i will do the best i can to live as a christian i will do the best i can to help my my fellow man i'll be a a person that is not just uh just walking through life with no care for nobody else but this life is not my hope this life is not my ambition but rather the other one that's my heart's desire i have some quotes here and i was going to eliminate some of them but then you read them and you say how can i eliminate that one so we'll take a few moments too and you should be able to read them now with me so i'll tell you what i'll let them put them up you just read it and i'll just wait till you're all done tell me when you're done reading no we'll do this together we'll take that first quote awakening jesus if you you have them there okay well just go ahead and start reading then he said and this was called and i'm just going to say the right mental attitude i'm sorry this one i didn't give you so you won't have this one because this one i got after and from awakening jesus he said the man was to be in brother and he said brother brown and we have a record that when it's from a doctor when we tell a person that's got a malignancy or something that's going to kill him an ulcer ready to burst or tubercular it depends on what attitude they take if they get all tore up they die right away but if they take the added attitude well dying is just part of living it's all right when i die and you know it's almost retards that case brother brahm says i just thought it's that mental attitude taken like that that will do it when the holy spirit strikes the inner man there it is i asked him he said certainly that's right if you can move into a spot move up to into that one of the best surgeons and doctors there is in southland he said mr branham it can be proved if a man will move can move up into that spot until even his own mind doesn't even know he's got it to think he's got it and don't even pay any attention to it it wouldn't do it if he can believe that that's a doctor speaking that's true see the mental attitude you take towards it will bring now the mind won't do it but if you give that attitude towards something that's got life in it then that life comes down and does it not your mental attitude that only brings you in the presence of him that's what you do your mind the five senses is all right as long as they don't deny god but when they go tonight denying god then you leave them alone god controls them that's a creator when you take your thoughts and you begin to focus among god's word this is what god said this is what god said the word of god says this and you quit paying attention to the symptoms which is hard to do i think everybody can raise their arms and testify it's hard to do at times you begin to feel the pain you begin to see i woke up about 1 30 this morning and my wife said what's wrong i said i don't know i'm going to check my blood sugar maybe something's off there that was okay my whole left side was just kind of numb and tingling and i'm like what's going on and the first thing you do is start to get nervous and get worried could it be this could it be that you know and then i said i'm just going to go over to the living room i'm going to lay down on the couch and maybe it'll be all right and i fell asleep and i woke up fine this morning or i could have stayed up all night worried about it now i know sometimes people are different there are people that wake up in the morning thinking what's going to happen to me today what's going to go wrong what's going to go wrong and there are other people who get up in the morning said let's go out and face every challenge and that's the difference in people but but the word of god tells us that he watches over us he cares for us he plans our day he's got he's got the best in mind for you if you get up in the morning he said my symptoms are this but god's word says that and i'm going to stand on that so brother branham again tells us that right mental attitude god's god's word never fails all right now i don't know if you have the quotes here but these i did give to you okay from the 10 virgins and 104 and this is going back to enoch here so enoch just kept walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept walking and he walked into glory on into glory without even dying that's right god took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of god keep walking walking it's one thing to walk it's another thing to walk with the right purpose with the right motive whether you could walk and be going the wrong way okay so i'm going to go to town and i'm coming from marana we would say going south even though i-10 is east but if i turn north and start walking north towards phoenix i'm not going to get to do something but i'm walking but if you have a purpose you have a place you have something which is god's word you walk towards that you walk towards what god said show us the father and hit and it will suffice us and when we take a promise of god drop it into our heart we keep watering it with faith and it keeps pushing out pushing out hallelujah when christ is planted in our heart the holy ghost the only thing we do is drink in the word of god and it pushes out salvation it pushes out divine healing it pushes out glory it pushes out everything that we have need of is right in us when we have when we are planted in christ jesus this is and then he says here's my interpretation of him about being the water he is the inexhaustible fountain of life you'll never ask him too much you can never believe him for too great a thing he delights in you believing him for great things you can never overdo it lord i think i've bothered you enough today i think i've asked you too much no it pleases him when you go up to say father he says yes because it's he's a fountain of life and when you turn on the fountain what does it do it just continually continually continually he's eternal he's never shut off the next quote inspiration that a double portion of your spirit be sent upon me we know that was elijah elisha asking of elijah said you've asked a great thing god wants us to ask for big things my god he don't run out of blessings up there you can't ask for too much he says could you imagine a little fish about that long out in the middle of the ocean saying i'd better not drink much of this water because it might go dry well that's just as unreasonable as it would be or more so reasonable than to be to be to think that god's blessings would ever be exhausted to a believer because all heaven belongs to you brother branham says there's a better chance of the fish using up all the water in the ocean that one little fish then you're exhausting god's blessings you ever looked at it that way of all the ocean this little fish is out there and he says i got to take it easy because i could dry up the hole he goes there's a better chance of that happening than god being exhausted amen where pentecost where i think pentecost failed and god will never you can never exhaust god's love and mercy to you and sometimes i think we try hard don't we lord i've done it again i failed you again i've but god says hey this is the first time because i've forgiven you i've cleaned it you know it's just hard for us to imagine that sometimes well i hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does don't ever think that you could ever ask too much of god i believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed get out there here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things ass big things is just as easy to receive as little things and sometimes they say oh no lord i'm going to bother you that's too much no no no if it's it's um something that that i told my wife made me just a little jealous yesterday just a little honest my son-in-law amos was took the the backhoe the company back out of the yard because they're going to be doing some work and he was he was using it uh to to dig out the foundations and my little grandson amos three i mean asher three years old is sitting on amos's lap and operating the levers and i've always wanted to do that and i never have and he's three years old he got to do it well he's got a little excavator that he sits on himself they bought it for him and has two handles and he's always moving the sand around and i'm just too big to sit on that one i told my my wife i said i'm a little jealous because he finally got to do it he's three years old and he's on a full-size tractor and aimlesses letting him operate the levers but you know you're god's children and he says ask it's yours do it it pleases the father if if you could see amos face to see him having uh asher sitting on his laps and doing amos is my son is going to be able to do what i can do there's a there was a joy in that on my end there was a little jealousy in it it pleased my heart to see god see to see that happening that here's the father with his son and it's pleasing the father to have his son do that i wonder how much more it pleases god when his children will take him at his word and stand on it and walk on it and put it to use god you said so therefore i'm just going to put it to use it doesn't do you any good in the drawer it doesn't do you any good in god's medicine cabinet take it in a pile put it to use and be not afraid it is i i really like this i would like to ask the scientist teacher of of this school or whatever school what kind of atom did he turn loose not wheat but wheat growed milled shortened baked and ready to eat what did he do and when he broke those fishes a fish sired born raised scaled cleaned and fried and was there a second when he reached for it what did he do and when they taken five biscuits and fed five thousand people off five biscuits and took up baskets full i can hear young john say that took out took all of the doubt away from me because i remember that my jewish mother used to tell me this is them in the boat the disciples having having a a a testimony service oh i can remember her pretty big brown eyes looking at me saying john my son i want to speak to you of something that's real that'll mean something to you someday of all you can ever do john my ambition is for you to be something great but above all things i want you to be a believer in jehovah as i and your father are and are trying to raise you and i remember as a little boy when my little eyes would look up to hers and she'd say john when god jehovah brought his people out of egypt out into the wilderness where they had nothing to eat jehovah rained down bread out of heaven every night and fed all his children and brethren in this testimony meeting i would ask my mother mother has god got a whole lot of angels it's professional bakers and he's got a great big skype they're full of ovens and every night he'd bake that bread and bring it down by the angels and lay it all out on the ground is that the way he done it mama she say no john you're just a little boy you do not understand jehovah is a creator he just spoke the word and the bread came down let me ask you a question has he changed is he any different is he still jehovah god your provider then it's us sometimes so again expectations what are you expecting what are you desiring what is it he said well you know i would like to to accomplish this in life i would maybe like to go on to school or college or go to university and and prepare a career or get prepared for a career and and i believe that a person should make plans a person should have something in their life to push to look forward to that motivate you to get up every day and go forward because when you don't have some it's just easy to do nothing but well there's something that gets you to go and and um sometimes it's the things that we've caused ourselves that we got to get up every day and go to work because we got ourselves in a little debt a little bit of trouble and now we're motivated to get up or the debt collector comes and gets us but let it be better than that let it be greater than that let it be more than that lord i want to dedicate my life to serving you to letting this light that you've placed in me shine for the world to see whether it's at a job whether it's at school whether it's in my neighborhood or whatever you desire for me i want to press towards that and put that out before it's just something to to look forward to something to press forward to and and and again with an expectation but human expectation can fail you it has uh people that have gone uh if you watched or saw any of the of any of the olympics going on the best of the best pretty well made it to the olympics there was probably a few others that maybe did that last second win and normally they lost but they won they got to make it that does happen sometimes but their expectation there was some probably their expectation was to get to the olympics and they got that far but for for most of me was to come home with a gold medal that was the the the idea it wasn't just to get there but to come home and so i i watched a video clip of the joy of the the expression of the tears of those that had gotten to the gold medal from from some who stood there and and and basically glory in themselves to the team from fiji that won the gold medal who got on their knees and praised god in the front of the whole world and saying we have overcome by the blood of the lamb what a difference i was shocked to see it it said it was a little clip that said see watch this they sang and worshiped god for allowing them to win one of these days you and i will bow at his throne and worship him and thank him more than a gold medal but eternal life but to see that it blessed my heart but the joy of those people to to um to get the one of the the i think he took silver medal on the bmx bikes that did all the things my daughter sarah's one of her caretakers that was his brother he has competed worldwide many a times but he took a silver and it's kind of like i almost know him not really but there's a little bit of pride that goes with it hey i know his brother you know something about but you know what i'm glad i know the children of god i haven't know my family here and together i'm gonna get to go with him to the other side and together we're going to get to worship him together and say we have overcome by the blood of the lamb it's it's just motivate yourself with those type of thoughts those things something else that happened in just god's been so good what can i say working um i think it was wednesday working in a house the superintendent there a young man named carlos who had just recently met became a superintendent for the builder and we were talking everything that was on up that was on a friday and that saturday was the memorial service for sister annie bustos myself and my wife come walking in the door and carlos walks right in the other door at the same time and he looks at me says aaron what are you doing here and i'm looking saying what are you doing here he goes i married one of the boosters and it changed our whole relationship i'm still aaron the service guy but there's a friendliness uh something that's different there now i've heard him kind of get upset at some of the other guys and he treats me a little bit different i didn't do anything to serve it we just happened to be friends with the same family but i appreciate god being merciful but good that way working up at saddlebrook and i went to speak to the head manager of the or the construction manager and i told him i was going to take a week off because i was supposed to go to south america with brother greene and my father and them and he said for what reason are you leaving i said well i may be going on a little missionary trip and he said what church and i said non-denominational christian church what's the name of it and i said tucson tabernacle and he said oh brother green and i look at him like who are you he says i'm brother chuck levin he says brother green married me and my wife and the next words i didn't go in there for that reason i just went to tell them he said you're a brother if you have any problems here you come and tell me i'll take care of it oh i said lord you're you've got it all covered brother randy lunsford brother matthew watkins um father-in-law was working there too so i had two brothers too brother steve hickerson lord provides god meets he takes care of things for us and i appreciate that so our our hope our expectation is not based merely on our hope and our expectation but on the god that supplies are all our needs the one who said try me test me put me to the test and see if i'll fail thinking of elijah when he's standing there i'm out on the mountain and he's calling out he says call out to your god dear god baal see if he'll respond see if he'll answer let the god that is truly god let him answer with fire and then how much did he believe in this god he says okay now when we build this altar soak it wet fill it full of water make it seem impossible and watch my god answer just try god try god test him see lord you said so i'm going to take you at your word and see if he does it more over way above than you could even imagine first john chapter four verse four just a couple of scriptures here year of god little children capital g there's only one capital g god little children and you ha and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world ye have overcome them seducers if you go back and read the first three verses of there he's talking about those that come in to do so those evils perverted spirits and all this you have overcome those seducers because greater is a spirit of christ that is in you than the spirit of antichrist that is in the world the spirit of antichrist has come strong and attack hard making itself just as religious and just looking just as good but it's trying to tear you down but the spirit of god in you will expose that spirit every time he'll call it and i'll say that's not of god that's not what you desire creator is he that is in you now let's look at a couple of things in the old testament from habakkuk chapter 2 verses 18 to 20. what propheteth the graven image that the maker thereof has a grave in it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols and and of course you could say the word dumb as not very intelligent no he doesn't speak doesn't speeches can't respond can't talk with you can't have a conversation with you cannot take and put something in your heart it's just he says let's go to the next one to him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach behold it's laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it he said you would you would turn and give your your yourself to something that has no life in it so verse 20 but the lord is in his holy temple greater is he that is in you you put those two scriptures together greater is he the lord and is in his holy temple he's in you he abides in you and that's greater let all the earth keep silence before and this is just me let this earth say whatever lord it's your desire reverent reverence respect let god answer your questions i don't understand this lord but i'm giving it to you and you said you'd take care of it so answer it uh there was an old um was it an old tv thing that says daddy's daddy or father knows best way back it was black and white from what i remember so that was quite a ways back father knows best and at every once in a while i just thought just come back father knows best father you know best therefore i commit it to you now watch that was in the old testament and paul in acts 17 verses 22 to 28 then paul stood in the midst of mars hill mars hill was it was an actual hill there and i looked a little bit of the history of it from the the romans it was mars hill because of the roman gods and from the greeks they had another name and because they believed the gods had had had something to do on that hill he says paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things you are too superstitious another word for that you're too religious and remember religion brother bam taught us is just a covering that we put on ourselves if you're not careful you said i'm religious but i'd rather be a christian than be religious i know some very very religious people who are not christians at all for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an alternate with the ex inscription to the unknown god whom ye therefore you ignorantly worship him declare i unto you he says i i've walked by and i say you're acknowledging that there's a god out there that you don't know and you're being careful to at least give him some honor but he said i know that god and i'm gonna i'm going to unveil him to you i'm going to declare him to you i'm going to let you know that he exists he says god that made the world and all things therein seen that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands and and we'll look at that in that that's a building everything but how many times have we tried to configure this temple to please god with our own hands with our own thinking the best way is just i surrender all lord i give you myself neither is worshipped with man's hands as though he needed anything seen he giveth to all life and breath to all things he hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their hamitations everything that is there god already set it up god already took care of god has already said how it's going to be therefore rest that god has you in mind rest that god has you control god has you all can i say it figure it out rest in that lord i rest in what you have for me he says that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us in those old traditions he was the god of the moon he was the god of the stars he was the god of the sea if a thunderstorm broke and that was thor over here and this was something but no he said this god that you talk and ignorantly worship has walked just recently right here on this earth he walked through these things you just didn't recognize him he says for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring your own very people have said we come from god and i'm glad that today he's given me the grace to recognize that i am his and he is mine how many would say they know them how many you know god knows you by name and who you are and where you are recognize that understand god knows you paul is dealing with him he says with these people in in the in the new testament here he's saying looking at him going you're looking at this he said but i'm telling you this god is alive and well and has walked through this this land here just recently he's the same yesterday today and forever now as we look into isaiah and let's look at what god has said isaiah 43 1-3 and and it gets harder and harder to find a scripture you've never read before if you've read through the bible enough times and heard this message and they just come back to you and come back to you and come back to you over and over but now thus saith the lord has created thee o jacob and he that formed the o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walketh through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee what a mighty god we serve he this is something that that isaiah gets inspiration to write to israel and we are the the seed of abraham the promise of god goes to his children you say well this has happened look if god had not kept you and reason why you are today where do you think you could be you could be today take a few moments as the brother armando said remember what god has done for you think back sometimes say had it not been for the mercy of god and the grace of god there where would i be today where would my life maybe you look at a neighbor or may you look at a friend that their life has gone so totally different and you said you know at one time i was in that same situation but god rich in mercy has reached out and met with me and he's telling israel for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and siba for thee and i went to see what that was what is he saying there there was a time that a king wanted to avenge uh because something had happened to his father the son of the king who had become king something had to happen to his father because of israel so he got these kingdoms with him we're going to go and destroy israel for this and god turned it around and those kingdoms destroyed him god just turned it all around he said you think you're going to mess with israel you're messing with me you're stepping into my boundary now you have to deal with me understand that when satan gets in around close to you and he starts going he's got to deal with god in your life you say lord you fight my battles i'm not i'm not able to withstand satan with my own intelligence my own abilities all i can do is go at it is written it is written it is written the word of god says and saint says oh but you don't know him but i do have met him i have talked with him i have fellowship with him every day he talks with me and he walks with me and he tells me i am his own and i'll stand on that and i'll rest on that psalms 103 verses one to five bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless o lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and healeth all thy diseases iniquities iniquities the things you know better to do but you do them anyways and the things that you should be doing and you didn't do and he forgives as a parent we are we do forgive we have hard time forgetting but we do forgive but there comes a time and they say okay that's the third time you've done that today son or daughter now you'll have to pay the consequences for it we want to teach them we would like for them to learn we hope that that they would grow up to to be good good citizens to to grow up to be good christians and we're going to do our best to help them along the way but we are not those that can forget and that's what causes a lot of problems we can't forget breathe out brother enoch is a good fine young man but i remember when and i've just pretty well knocked half of what i said good of brother enoch down got to be careful with our words why couldn't i just have left it brother enoch is a good fine young man let brother enoch prove that he's not don't don't have to be my words no let brother e not be a good find him but if we're not careful our very own words we'll take and knock down our very own testimony right after we've said but he said who forgiveth all thine iniquities and remembereth them no more who healeth all thy diseases all uh you go back and especially today uh with with what's going on and the conversations that people have the things you read if you listen to the news or however you hear this side fighting that side this doctor against that doctor this group against that group and it just it's just satan's kingdom that's what it is but he said i forgive all your iniquities i heal all your diseases there's nothing new under the sun that i can't deal with that's not already taken care of i'm trying to tell you this god that you have your expectation and your belief and your your hope in he's more than able that's who you're trusting in that's who you're confiding in you know i you read something and i i read something the other day about about the viruses and and this side of it and then i read something about this side of it and i said lord let me stay centered in your word because this side brings fear this side brings fear and fear is not of god but god's word brings something that settles in your heart says yes lord i believe who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like an eagle that's what's god's word and it's eternal it never fails luke chapter 2 25 and 30 brethren preaches expectations i think five six times and he uses this this scriptures on every one of them and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man who was just was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him could you put your name right in there and the holy ghost was upon him is it just when you come to church is he with you all times i i believe it anybody else believe it with me if it's not then you're in trouble if he's not with you you're in trouble but the holy ghost was upon him and it revealed unto him by the holy ghost and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ god said this that you have anticipated this that you have had expectation this that you've been waiting for because you've read it in the scripture that isaiah said and this scripture said this and you heard about you know about it you're waiting on it you're waiting for that messiah he says go to the temple you're going to see him let's go to the next he says and he came by the spirit into the temple and when he and when the parents had brought in the child jesus the lord never said he's going to be a little baby i don't know what simeon was looking for but he went to the temple because god told him you're going to see the fulfillment of this promise and when the parents brought the child to jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then he took him up in his hands and blessed god and said lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation to simeon it was as good as done lord you told me that this was what the scripture said i'm holding this child in my hands so now i could go to sleep and death go to sleep a child of god doesn't die he just goes to sleep and then he says i can rest at peace now 33 years down to the road there was going to be one hanging on the cross that was going to say it is finished that's what simeon was looking at right there i have this promise i have this which god has given me and therefore it's as good as done in my life i can rest on that there's an expectation that's going to be fulfilled god has shown that to me and he walked in that he didn't give up on it he said take your servant home now lord it's all right i think we should all be able to say that lord you can take your servant home now because i know that it all will come to pass there is no fear in that now watch this and i'd just like to matthew 14 will read a couple portions out of 14 or read 14-21 and then 24-32 and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick he hasn't changed he still does the same thing he still moves in amongst a congregation of people and deals with hearts and ministers to people and heals the sick how many can testify that god has done the great things for you he still does it he hasn't changed and when it was evening his disciples came in and sang them the same disciples that had gone to mary or were there when jesus was at the at the wedding and they said there's no wine and mary just says go talk to him about it same once again he says the desert this is a desert place and the time has now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves some victims go get some food but jesus said unto them they don't have a reason to leave there's no need to depart give them ye to eat they each one check their pockets they look in their little well peter how much you got i got 50 cents how much you got we got enough to feed ourselves barely this very god that they had seen do over and over and over tells them go feed them and they said and we have here but five loaves and two fishes and them being like us probably said and peter will eat all those by himself hey they were human okay and he said bring them to hither to me and he commanded the multitude to sit on the grass i think he had a lot of confidence in what he just go ahead sit down there was no question he knew what he was going to do command commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and break and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples to the multitude he said go feed him put yourself there for a minute if you could you're watching god and as brother braham said that quote the bread is already baked it's already it's shaped it it looks like it just came out of the oven it's done it's ready to eat there's has to be something going on inside even though you've seen him do it a hundred times you still say it's god it's it's we're human maybe that's the best explanation i gave it we're human he says they did eat and were filled they took of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full and they that had eaten were about five thousand men besides women and children god looked at the number said oh more than enough how much do you got oh wow you could probably get rid of half of that and i'd still have enough now they see this miracle they go through all of this they see the feeding of these there had to be such rejoicing and worship and and did you see that peter wow is it you know just are you being just like us so now jesus tells him to go across on the ship and he goes up to the mountain but the ship was now in the midst of the sea and tossed with ways for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went into them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear it makes you think that jesus changed himself almost he looked like a ghost or or maybe if you read a little farther he said oh ye of little faith he's still the same god the situation doesn't change him the weather doesn't affect him the storms don't affect him it affects us but it doesn't affect him he was still god walking over the sea but straightway jesus speaking and said be of good cheer it is i be not afraid so peter here he says he answered him and said lord if it be thou. why was peter questioning if it was him peter had seen enough of god to know that he was quite capable of walking on the water peter go over to there and catch that fish and take out the gold and go pay the taxes peter had gone through a lot of things but he says lord if it's really you bid me come unto thee on the water so the lord says come on peter just come on and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus he walked on the water i don't think peter wrote this peter wasn't glorifying himself somebody else saw it and said peter walked on the water but when he saw that the wind was boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me he began to look around and he said no wait a minute i've never done this before people can't do this i i don't have uh floaties under my feet i don't you know he began to think about the situation rather than what god had told him come on peter and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and he said to him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt lord help my own belief when i'm faced with that next situation and you just brought me through one and then i say oh lord where are you did you leave me no there's a coming of time when you're a child of god and you stand on your own feet and god puts you through a test because one of these days you're going to realize he's with me he's never left me and you're going to go through the test it's easier when when dead mama holds the little children's hands we're over with eunice and sean at the they have this the swimming pool there and little liam's about a year and a half old now and if you turn your head liam just jumps right in the pool whether it's the what a foot deep there foot and a half deep or five feet on the other side four and a half whatever it is he has no fear of the water mom and daddy uncle and cousins and the sisters are scared to death for liam they don't need to be scared because we're plenty scared for him all of us at the same time liam he says there's everybody here to save me that's all liam's thing i'm jumping the pool because daddy will catch me sister will catch me somebody will catch me lord let me have that confidence in you let me have that trust in you that no matter where i'm at where i'm going you're there with me you never leave me you never fail me i don't want to ignorantly just walk into something but there are times things happen but i don't have to fear you're with me now chloe and asher they they're older enough now they know that they wear the uh the uh fl the vest so we're quote unquote we're not as careful with those two because they're wearing floaties and they'll survive we have a lot of confidence in the floaties don't we because we'll even turn our back on them sometimes but liam is not winning floaty liam has got his confidence in us lord i don't want to wear my own floaties i don't want to wear my own thoughts i don't want to wear what i think will keep me let me have my full confidence and expectation in you let me dress myself in the word of god in your promises what you are above my own ideas now there will come a time when liam will be able to swim and mom and dad will have a little more confidence they won't be as nervous as worried and that little boy won't get yelled at so much because we all did our fair share of yelling but it's our concern for him but god said i'll be with you even in you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll never let you walk on your own though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me lord why is there only one set of footprints he said because i was carrying you that time he's still the same yesterday today and forever and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased oh my lord that we could come to that place in our own lives that we would come and say oh lord let me have that confidence that no matter where i go where i'm where my path leads me you're with me and you never fail man hebrews let's finish with hebrews we're about done now hebrews chapter 10 19 to 23 and if the musicians want to come up now that would be fine having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus the holiest of holies going into the place where the higher priest was allowed to go in once a year but there was life in that place the rod of aaron was left there and then when they came back in it was budding there was life in there and you and i can go in there today it doesn't take a minister it doesn't take a pastor it doesn't take no you have the privilege to go in and talk and meet with god yourself and he'll have an audience with you he says by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god he says let's finish the last scripture there 20 22 23. let us draw near with a true heart of full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised i like that last how he finishes for he is faithful the promised he's never missed an appointment yet he's never missed a time he's never had to run back to the drawing board he's never had to re-figure out the plan and redraw and put things on hold because i'm not sure how to deal with the next situation he is faithful that promise oh my hope is in the lord in his word and his unfailing words of promise just power lord you know that what was in my heart today just to remind us that you are more than enough if we think we have enough you're more than that lord our hope our confidence our expectation and and maybe tying that with a right mental attitude which is god's word is true god never fails it's written through all over the scriptures from from the front cover to the back lord of your faithfulness at times lord that maybe if you would have been like us you would just got rid of everything and started all over but noah found grace in your eyes enoch pleased you so much he was caught up it was not seen elisha was told by elijah if you see me go because elijah was taken home with you how many lord in the scriptures abraham and isaac and jacob [Music] daniel and ezekiel and jeremiah all of them in their writings and all the things that they said how they were looking for a city whose builder and maker was god and one day that which they had written about that which they had maybe dreamed about and expressed they got to see him face to face lord and we're in the same place today lord we're believing we're trusting we're we're expecting and soon and soon and very soon we're going to see the king let us let us have that with a full assurance lord that he that is promised is faithful to keep it today thank you lord we praise you in jesus name amen you love them has it been good to you let me ask you can you recommend them to somebody could you say hey i'd like you to meet my friend lord jesus he's the best friend you could ever have he knows everything about you you might laugh at this even knows the size of shoes you wear you say how do you say that brother aaron because every once in a while somebody gets the gift of something and they open it up because you read it in the testimonies they needed a pair of shoes and they were the exact size they needed that's the god i serve that's a god that watches over me and cares for me is that you sister vaughn god bless you good to see you back there he's faithful he's unfailing the words to that song my hope is in the lord you'll stand with me is is is [Music] oh sorry the living sacrifice [Music] is and evermore [Music] is [Applause] [Music] i [Music] sacrifice the only source of life [Music] mercies [Music] is and forgiveness and those who trust [Music] ever more [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] i looked up and i didn't see brother jordan that's why i asked for the man to come up so so i got this note just a little update on brother matthew watkins he um they were having a family camp up in and i don't know if they had it or not up in sheldon and brother timothy pruitt had been asked to to host the camp that's brother dale smith and the church up in flagstaff and brother dale had asked brother matt if he would be standby in case he was needed and brother timothy pruitt had called brother dale just the week before because sister pruitt's health was was very poor that he felt it would be best if he didn't come so brother dale called brother matthew and asked him if he would cover the services of brother matthew let us know that this weekend friday saturday and sunday he would be covering the family camp for brother dale smith now we had spoken with brother matthew several times this past week in phone conference just kind of laying things out let me just say that what is in in that possibility that he would become our pastor just beginning to lay things out how he would go forward [Music] both sides asking questions and talking [Music] so brother matthew let us know that he was doing so he said so it'll be a couple more days now brother matthew sent us a text because and i don't know the details but somehow what we heard was covet got in among some of the brothers that were going to be at the camp so brother matthew felt it was best that he didn't go and so he told us at the beginning of this week he would be we would have another phone conference and had just been praying and asking us to continue to pray and so that's where we stand today because of that camp and we were aware of it and again i would just say we should be in prayer [Music] it's it's it's it's how we we have god uh speak to us how we speak to god and how he answers because he said to pray to talk to him and as i i think it was brother samuel browning that said prayer is not just on your knees prayer should be an attitude all day and and i started to say something and i i got tracked off this earlier i was in the house and the the painter he's an older gentleman um a hispanic man and i've we're all the guys that get in it at the end of the house and we're doing the detailing out so so you see the same people over and over and most of us don't know each other's names but we talk to each other she had his radio on and and he's playing some some he's a mexican man an older man always speaks spanish but he always has a radio on in english and he's playing the oldies songs and there are songs from when i was quite younger and those are the hardest songs to ignore because they bring back memories there's other songs that other songs i could just turn off and it just it was all day we were in there probably three hours together trying to get this house ready for the homeowner so as i drove away the songs were still ringing in my head and i asked the lord you know what you can talk to god you can verbally talk to god you don't have to think that you can talk to him and i ask him because he's answered me when i've asked him without fail and i said lord how do i get these songs out of my mind and as i finish that sentence he just said he began to sing a song back to me think about his love think about his goodness and immediately all those songs went out and we just began to sing he's faithful he's a god that is sometimes all these things going on around us get us nervous but talk to god about it tell him to put a song in your heart tell him to give a scripture remind you of the things he's done for you so i drove down the road singing think about his love think about his goodness think about his grace that's brought us through foreign [Music] let me just say something here god speaks god talks to you i don't just say that because i'm a minister and i stand because god does i know that in my life raise your hand if you know god talks to you if you're one that wonders turn around and look and see those who know that god does speak to you in an audible voice and however he does he's faithful he does those things for you oh think about his love think about his goodness think about his grace [Music] is [Music] god bless you this afternoon now i guess brother peter lord william will be speaking this evening and brother lyle johnson contacted me yesterday they were on their way back home and the air conditioner went out on their vehicle and they were in new mexico and uh but the lord willing they will be here with us tonight so yes i made a comment to brother aaron as i was walking out and i know some people may have heard it my mic might have been on or something but i'm sorry it can be hard sometimes song leading up here and dealing with technical things and i shouldn't let it bother me i'm sorry it was difficult this morning i'll be honest but i shouldn't i shouldn't let that bother me i should just we're here to praise the lord regardless of what's happening around us we're here to worship the lord regardless what's happening around us it's not about what anybody's doing around us and i let that distract me and i'm sorry so please forgive me [Music] you know when you're you're sitting in the back and you're looking forward and you're seeing everything that's going on in front of you and it's a whole lot easier sitting up front not seeing what's going on behind you a lot less distracted but let me just maybe you've never thought of it but i get to see everything when i'm up here but you know what it's okay i love you you're god's children we're in this together i appreciate brother jordan brother matt brother peter helping in the songs our musicians i really do [Applause] we went and ministered for brother david salada quite a few times a few years back and they had a family they did all the music and they left the song leader the instruments and everything so brother david the pastor of the church became the piano player the song leader the minister the everything so during the worship service he sat played the piano [Music] sang with the brethren there then he came and ministered and when that was done then he went back to the piano and played i thank god that we have the folks that we have who come and put their shoulders here and sometimes you may feel that nobody notices it but thank you to each one of you bring your part your portion your praise your worship i appreciate that god bless you as you go [Music] great is thy faithfulness the verbal chorus [Music] is new mercies [Music] is great is thy face [Music] forever is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies [Music] is great is thy faithfulness [Music] they i must tell jesus i cannot bear these birds in my distress [Music] is i must tell jesus i must tell
