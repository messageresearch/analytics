straight to the word amen god bless you certainly good to be here back gathered with god's people amen and i just believe that there's a purpose in our heart there's a reason that we gather the bible says that we should do it more as we see the day approaching we should assemble ourselves so we're here tonight the lord of jesus is here and that's all that matters amen romans chapter 7 i just want to say again amen it's a privilege to be here with you and i trust that the lord spoke to you and something was said that blessed you and so we just like to continue from where we left off tonight brother matthew i'll start at slide 13 i said 23 but we'll go to that after slide 13. let's just begin uh with romans 7 we've read it this morning but i just want to pick it up uh just one more time amen i'd like to just continue this being changed and this will just be where we left off let's just begin reading here at verse 20 uh 21. i find that a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and i say with paul i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin lord we're grateful to be here one more time with you lord and just believing that you're lord the need meter you're the speaker you're the great physician you're the healer of our hearts our redeemer lord your everything that we need in this journey of life lord and we've come to this service here tonight just needing one more drink from your water lord i pray that we would have hungry hearts thirsty hearts and we could just say lord i pray that we would be able to move everything aside all of the thoughts aside everything that would distract us and help us lord jesus just to hear from you this evening i pray it bless each person that gathered here tonight those that will by archive or live stream i pray god that you would just be near to them now we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen you can be seated you love jesus amen praise the lord i just want to pick up just right from where we left off and we've got just uh something we did we wanted to get to and so i just feel like the lord just still has this uh this thought here to express so let's just pick up right where we left off and i came back to this slide and i want to read it with you again prophet of god says and sometimes we find that people going through these prayer lines out across the nations and they just run up and think that the lord ought to heal them right then but there is something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveals that what that is there is something god and notice how he says this there's a reason for everything i want you just to remember that here tonight as we minister there's a reason for everything so brother baron begins to tell how that people would come through the prayer line and just think there we go that's it i have this condition i have this issue i have this disease however physical it was but the prophet of god understood that sometimes there's a spiritual connection between what you see outwardly or naturally jesus would see the same exact thing he would take a man and he would pray for him and he would lay his hands upon him and speak and that man was healed there was other times when he would pray he would take and spit in the dirt and pick up the dirt and ball it up in the mud and rub it on the man's eyes and then the man was ill you say why was there a difference because there was jesus could see there was a connection maybe deeper than what you or i could see physically on the outside paul begins to say this that inside of me and he says that is in my flesh there's nothing good but he says but after there's another part of me an inward man that loves the lord with all of my heart and how to connect those two how to put those two together now listen to what brother branham says there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first and then you could find what to work on so the prophet is saying sometimes there's an outward cause whether it was a heart trouble or a nervous condition or whatever disease it was and he says but yet there's something that's connected to that maybe down inside of there maybe down on the inside of there there's a reason that you see that and sometimes what we find is one person can get delivered from something just by the prayer of faith they accept it they accept the word of god god comes down and they're delivered and then you watch other people and that battle just seems to drag out and drag out and drag out and they're months and they're asking for the same exact need and you wonder where is the struggle well sometimes the prophet says there's something deeper something on another level and you've got to find the reason for it now let's pick up slide 23. let's just follow this along and i love this um the these messages that he cares do you care and or we're going to read from let's i think we said 23 brother brother matthew he says coming uh that was where we we stopped and let's just begin let's just look at 23 and just the very end of it he says here and the prophet of god says a few minutes to find himself and here they sit right here this morning sitting in the audience see how satan was trying to upset that young man by referring to him of some complex to be built back which the holy spirit knew and i seen it by the vision of the lord and i love this but god cared for that man god cared for that young boy so the prophet says here it's just coming in a few moments ago this is he cares do you care uh just coming in a few moments ago a lady see her sitting here in the aisle just got her seat someway and sat down she said nine years brother branham i've tried to get a hold of you she said i'm so desperate i'm here late i couldn't even get a prayer card to be in the line the lady moved back she said brother branham just a word with you standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman sorry didn't advance it standing there a vision broke over this fine looking young woman and see that her heart was burdened and she was trying to work to make a living and a great thing happened way back in the time of her parents so the prophet points all the way back here's this woman she's trying to reach the prophet of god i've got this condition nine years i've came to you and my heart is so burdened and brother branham says she was trying to work to make a living and he says and a great thing happened way back in the time of her parents that it caused this great thing to happen to her so something in her past even before her and now it was affecting her presently and he says and the lord jesus revealed it and showed what it was and there in a moment's time took it from the woman she went around rejoicing and now sitting here in the audience with us now rejoicing with tears as she continues wiping her eyes now knowing that the truth of the thing was made known and that what that poor little neurotic woman that was so nervous she didn't know what to do with herself notice and thinking that she was gone and there was no holy spirit and this is her last day if you've ever had that thought you're not the only one and he says she was little neurotic woman thinking there was no holy spirit this is her last day she had tried for nine years and she was about at the end of despair god cared for that little woman who no one cares for love that the prophet of god uses these examples uses these testimonies and the message he cares do you care brother branham says god cared for that little woman who no one cares for what a time he does care when he was here on earth and i say brother adam says when he was here on earth as i say he cared for the people so much until he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a place where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them and notice he cared so much until when he knowed he must leave in order to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i will send the holy spirit and he shall continue my care for you until he returns there's no one cares like jesus you say brother matt we don't have a prophet here to sit down in a private interview with a gift to go over my life and to discern what took place as i was younger maybe in the time of my parents but here's what promise we may not have that but here's what we do have the same jesus that cared for that little woman cares for you tonight are you thankful for that he says there's no one cares like jesus and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares now he was to continue care for the people his people here on earth in the same manner that he cared for them when he was here so the prophet of god begins to give this example how that there was something in her past even in the time of her parents you remember brother branham tells the story of this woman and i don't have it here on the slides but brother madam tells the story of this woman who came through the prayer line and she has heart trouble same exact as the woman we read earlier she's suffering with some condition and brother branham goes on to say hell that the number one thing that troubles uh the world today and i i looked this up about a month ago when i ministered this and it's statistically the same exact thing the number almost the number one as the prophet said almost the number one medical trouble in the uni in the planet not just the united states not just the nation and the planet is heart disease heart trouble and heart issues and heart problems because so much and doctors are finding out now what a kentucky hillbilly told us back in the 60s that stress and the neurotic age and conditions lead an anxiety lead to heart trouble and if you remove this the can if you remove the the stress and you lower your level of anxiety and your level of worry you can sometimes cure disease and we have a doctor back home and would he would testify to that that so much of the trouble is the amount of pressure that people are under it's causing physical pressure that's maybe in your mind or in your spiritual in a spirit realm is causing physical diseases remember there's more to you than what you see in the mirror there's more to you than what the doctor in the hospital or the er or the specialist can work on now you say brother mighty against the doctors absolutely not brother branham called them god's agents and so we're all for medical i'm thankful very grateful today for medical science saved my dad's life jesus ultimately is the healer but god uses the agents of men and medicine and knowledge to bring healing to people now healing can only take place by the lord outside of that it's just mechanics you're still working on the body so there's things that the doctor the specialist can't see his tools are not designed to touch those parts his tools are not designed to expose those parts but there's a physician that we know that can brother adam tells the story of this woman and he begins to tell how hard trouble's the number one outside of cancer is one of the most not no one of the the most diseases that's affecting more people than any other and brother adam begins to tell of this woman and she has this condition and he looks at her and he begins to discern and he and he's he says now you have heart heart trouble heart disease she said yes that's right brother branham and the prophet begins to look back down breaks in division goes all the way back to the time she was a little i think eight nine something like that year old girl and she walks out of her home leaves her driveway going to her neighbor's house and a dog runs out of the next house and begins to chase her and she starts running running panicking for her life and the brother branham says it was from that moment trauma came in your life and you were so fearful and now you've lived your entire life with the physical condition because of that moment you were chased by a dog now listen as we said brother branham says there's more to you than what meets the eye there's more paul says there's two of me living inside of me and the prophet says and i didn't put it on the screen but we quoted it this morning that's what's wrong with so many blowed up christians like a boiler and he said that flu gets clogged up and they never clean out the channels and then we have an explosion and he says but believers that's what's wrong with so many blowed up christians they never clean out the memory they never clean out the conscience they never clean out the imagination the affection say brother matt what are you saying i'm saying that you should spend every day of your life and say lord purge my mind purge my spirit purge my thoughts free me of any thought the bible says it this way cast down any thought or vain imagination that exalts itself above what this word says cast it down and so you can take things you can ingest even through covid and people that never got sick with covet in a serious way but they ingested fear in such a level that it's affected them today and how they live yet they never were seriously ill with covet but the fear that came with that pandemic caused more trouble than any disease or sickness that kova ever could imagine to do to that person because it in you ingest that into your and you say brother matt well i'm not fearful well i may not name as i say here tonight i may not name your this specific uh issue here tonight with the words that i use but just remember as we preach today these things are spirits and the way that a spirit gets access is the access that you give him you could take a complex you could take something and the devil let me say this this way satan has sold believers more believers more i call it this phantom pain you know what phantom pain is someone goes into the into the uh into the er and they've got it they've got they've they've got pain yet nothing's wrong with them the doctor back home one of our brothers who's in the er he says he gives out more placebos than he does real medicine to people who will actually just in their mind because they're in such a neurotic state let me say that satan has sold more christians phantom pain of how hurt i am or this person's talking about me and they're thinking this and that's why they did this and they've just got an agenda and that person maybe has no idea about any of your pain that you think that they're causing you and they have nothing to do with it whatsoever but you've believed a lie of the devil and now you've acted and reacted as though that person has done something and they may not have a clue well it's the truth anyhow and this person comes against this person and this group over here and then the entire time there's not really ever was really an issue but you you begin to your reality uh your your perception is reality and the prophet of god even begins to speak of this and he and i just want to take a moment to read this he begins to tell this and let's just look at it here together he tells about something that happened to him in the message standing in the gap and brother bannon begins to tell about this dream that brother roy uh has and brother branham says that he has this dream of him and the lord woke him up and and i just want maybe we'll just take time just to read it here let's just read it together one night the lord woke him up one morning we're sitting here and i looked like in jerusalem at the lord's communion table and i was talking he couldn't understand it brother roy set him present looking at me right now he saw it he called me up in houston or out in arizona sent me a letter and i called him back he said you were sitting there brother branham and i saw that big pillar of light come in notice and get you and take you away from the lord's table and you went westward cause he was sitting on the east side watching me go west and he says and this light come in and taken me out said it was one morning like it was a vision got up in bed about three or four o'clock in the morning something like that saw this happen and he said he screamed looked like for days brother bill come back roy and i have been real brothers we lived together hunt together and we're just brothers and he screamed for me until he was hoarse in his throat come back bring him back bring him back crying he said here come that pillar of fire coming back or a cloud come back and he set me at the head of the table notice and i had been changed it was a mystery to brother brother roy me being changed this is where i got the title for this message being changed it was a mystery to brother roy me being changed to look different and brother branham takes out a piece of paper and he and he takes just a little sticky and he and he writes a little note on that sticky and then he places it up on the up on the platform and it for his for his memory he says i lay this up here for something i want to remember being changed when i give him the interpretation of it now i know where your minds immediately go as you read the message that this is surely some mysterious thing that brother branham gives maybe it's about the opening of the seals or that you know the something that brother adam's going to preach on the trumpets or it was a vision but i want you to notice actually what this dream was about when brother branham says brother roy notice me he says he sent me the pillar of fire comes in the room takes brother branham pulls brother branham out of the lord's table takes him from his seat and then brother brother roy says then brother branham that light came in the holy spirit comes in the room and he sets you at the head of the table but you were different you looked different you were changed now let's look at what that change was that brother branham writes that sticky note and he writes it down listen to this prophet of god says now i'm preaching to myself could we stand and see a human being that's blind now brother branham tells us here this is uh this this what we just read here is prior and then he goes into his sermon standing in the gap i'm preaching this to myself could we stand and see a human being that's blind physically blind and know that he was walking over a cliff could we in our stall state of mind that we're in this morning pretty honest could we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff blind and not try to warn him it would be would be so cruel we would be so indifferent in our heart now brother branham tells us here in a moment he's speaking about himself and he says i became so cold and indifferent in my heart could you see a blind man know he was going to walk over a cliff and not warn him brother branham says we would be so indifferent in our heart could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he could almost laugh and see a blind man that cannot see and can't help himself deliberately walk over a cliff that would be a bad thing do nothing about it well to my brethren world over i want to make this confession he says i want to make this confession i humbly say it that that just about what i was doing or fixing to do i had been preaching for years you say how did brother branham get to such a place now here's god's prophet but remember he's a man just like you just like me he's made up of memory conscience reason imagination affection emotion now the prophet of god says you could get so indifferent and so cold in your heart that you would look at someone and brother adam says now brothers i want to confess that that's about how i was i had gotten so calloused and so cold in my heart not in his soul where he's born of the spirit of god where he's living in an eternal day he's been translated he's a new creature in christ but in his spirit he became so bitter and so hardened towards people brother brandon begins to tell i've been preaching for years i've become an old man and an old veteran preacher and had a lot of hard battles and maybe i'm scarred all cut up on the inside from fights because my lot that the lord gave me was not to kiss the babies and marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-headed two-handed sword at the battlefront against the wiles of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of god till i seen the enemy defeated i've been cut deep many times now ahmed a man was a christian he's got a great country right under alaska and i made him made up my mind that being that i had left here and going west that i would take my wife and kind of trap her into something any of you brother's ever done that you know just trap her don't tell her just sort of his brother adam says i'm gonna just get her up there and get my wife up there and sort of you know then reveal to her why i brought her there uh oh oh y'all don't do that i know you don't here in arizona i get her up here and i become a guide and then the lord wanted me to do something listen i'd let my hair grow out my whiskers and i'd go back there and be a guy there's only two or three indians live back in the country there i'd just be a guide i'd help bud and if the lord would wanted me to do anything i'd say all right lord give me a vision i would slip on out and he says then i be a nervous you will not find and here's what i just want to stop here and say i am so thankful that we didn't have just a sage on the stage we didn't have a man with pride that was so indignant he could never be transparent but we had a prophet who could be so honest with us so that you can relate and i can relate and say i'm the same built the same exact way as he was and brother branham is going to become you won't find him being more honest and transparent that i find than you will in this message standing in the gap listen what brother branham says here he says then i being nervous i say this kind of quietly maybe a neurotically type of person that i am knowing that i was insufficient at the beginning for the job here's what a man here's what brother branham could tell you about himself knowing that in myself i'm insufficient for the job for the job as many has complained that had to do it was hard but i thought god why didn't you just call somebody that could have done it i'm sorry but i failed the people just won't listen to me and i failed to do what i should have done somewhere because they won't listen my mother that's just passed on to glory about a little over a year ago my mother father was a hunter i think i got all that come out from him in that stand because i love the woods i thought if this people that call themselves christians if they don't want to listen to the message that i'm preaching then let them alone i'll just stop all together and i'll go up into the mountain and i know a friend to where before leaving here i might drop this in we'll hurry i dreamed a funny dream an odd dream i hope when my brother-in-law gets a hold of this it doesn't hurt his feelings i hope it don't hurt my wife who's sitting present now but she knows it about many months ago right on around about october november i dreamed that i was roaming out in the dark and well i had no place to go and nobody cared for me and i had become a bum just a bum and i was cold and i looked in the distance i saw a fire and when i got over there it was a city dump and they had ditches and the fire was in these ditches between the ditches was slick where bums would sleep there to keep warm keep from freezing between these fires on a cold winter night and i was cold i walked up to this fire to get warm and it was laying full of bums i didn't see any of them but they like had stalls or places where their sleeping place was and i saw my brother-in-law fletcher broy when i woke up before i woke up fletch said to me he said in the dream he said billy i'll hunt for you a place brother bill you fed my children and they were hungry and said you was a daddy to them now i'll find you a place here to keep warm and we went by walking by the bums places and finally come to a place he said i'll sit down here and i'll walk up here and see if i could find a place i walked and looked out into the dark cold night and i thought think of it one time god almighty let me lead his church one time he let me preach his gospel and see souls saved men and women come from around the world to speak with a few speak with for me for a few minutes and here i am now a bum and nobody wants me and i'm cold what must i do then i woke up i told my wife i said maybe it means fletcher's in need so we hurried up to see if we could find him his brother found him i come back down from canada with fred and them the other day and in my mind now notice this notice remember he's three parts he's a he's a person there's two of him listen to what brother adam says here and in my mind not the lord the lord didn't tell him that not in his soul but in my mind i had made up if these people don't want to hear my message they didn't have to i had preached now for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18 years i've done nothing but just to the lord i've tried to live so close to him and not say a word till he told me first everything then i come down from canada and fred told her brother roy told me his dream as he and i brother banks rode along together just before we separated and i say the people i've never regarded myself anybody knowing the people have said brother brandon the lord called you to be his prophet i've never regarded myself as that but i began to get the time that i was just i was about ready to do it to think well maybe i am if i am i'll live back in the wilderness if i look back in the wilderness then i'll be his prophet if he wants me to send me somewhere and while he's not using me then i'll sure to catch some fine fish and do things of course that was kind of a selfish attitude because i wanted to do that now it isn't just exactly the thing that's to do and now i had that made up my mind to do that so i got up about four o'clock got started driving billy was sleeping we went to a place i was thinking on my mind everybody's asleep and brother branham's just you know he's he's he's he's problem solving he's crunching this he's just thinking about what he could do and he said i was play thinking in my mind you know what one of these days as soon as i can get the wife up there i won't tell her what i'm going to do but i'd get up there and then i'm going to tell her i love this place so well no no need of us going anywhere let's just stay here and that's back from civilization 1100 miles from anywhere say way in the wilderness i thought won't that be fine i won't have to get a haircut now don't you nobody use that for justification to not get a haircut i won't have to dress up i'll just be a regular mountaineer what i always wanted to be and i said i got some guns and some people give me and i'll be a guide like you never heard of i'll just love it then the lord tells me to go and somebody's i'll run out and tell them and come back again and i'll help bud and we really have a place here i love how brother branham says this i was thinking on that i was really pondering that that's a good thought man what a life now remember he's not saying i wanna you know he's not pondering to go sit in a bar somewhere he's not pondering to go backslide on the lord he's not pondering to give up on the lord or just just he's gotten so hurt and so scarred no what he's pondering is just a little detour and you know oftentimes if we're not careful we we succumb to the pressure and rather than staying on the path that god's given us we we really think on a detour you know i'll still serve the lord but you never know where that road's going to lead and it goes further and further and further and further away and brother brandon's rationalizing all this in his mind he says i was i was thinking on that it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that immediately brother brandon you imagine when that voice spoke carry out your plans and you'll be like that take that detour that you've justified and you've made it out in your mind well i've been hurt i've just been cut so many times and people have hurt me and they've they've just now listened if anybody ever had a good excuse if anybody ever had a good reason to take a detour it would have been god's prophet and now brother branham here you think he's not doing something it's it's just innocent he's just trying to escape the pressure and the lord speaks and says go ahead and do that you know that bum you'll end up just like that and listen what brother branham says here said the voice said your wife will go too she won't live up there in the hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would i said i don't i don't want to be that i don't want to have to live like that i want to do something different i was told that you called me to be a prophet i want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but i was using my own excuse so i can hunt my own good i let the sick lay i want the lord to tell me where to go and not do that's wrong i had built my self a complex because the people didn't hear my message and if god forbid that i'll try to compare the life now of like moses but it's exactly what moses did that people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone and went in the wilderness but god turned him around and he had long forgot the suffering people now listen and these rickys and raketas that have so sassed the words and i've called them ricky and raketta god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children so god corrects him and says you call them rickies and mercators you shouldn't do that they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that spirit upon them they're in as much prison as israel was in prison just as much just as moses went down to deliver them from slavery slavery human beings that loved jesus christ would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't do this and you don't do that but the call of god listen the call of god must come whoever wants to march towards the promised land let him march when i rode to the promised land let him come on our road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere a mistake that a man could make yet being sincere moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother roy you see your dream and now i cannot go with the ministry like that until i feel different in my heart about it no matter if god did tell me but that is that change that brother roy seen coming what was the change in that dream that god would remove him from the head of the table and then have to do a surgery in his heart and then set him back it was his attitude and his feeling towards people and if god cared so much how god's pronoun i know this is just simple but it's just i know i'm impressed to preach this to you here today if god would care so much about how god's prophet viewed people that sassed the word and wouldn't listen to the word of god and brother branham developed develops a complex and so much he just wants to quit the ministry and god cared so much about brother branham's attitude towards people you don't think god cares how we treat one another i should get a much bigger amen you don't think god cares how we treat one another let me go just a little bit further you don't think god cares about husband how you treat your wife or wife how you treat your husband or father how you treat your son or vice versa and how children treat each other you don't think god cares how we treat and our attitude towards one another and the attitudes we take towards people listen god's prophet allowed a complex brother adam says i allowed myself even to build a complex to where it tinted his vision or it tinted how he viewed people so much you say well you know we all get the bad the wrong attitude sometimes brother matt i mean sometimes we get you know we just get upset at one another and you know i know i got to get better about that you know sometimes i think we minimize that just a little too much whether brother branham would care so much about it that he said i'm just going to leave the field listen to what he says something's got to change me because in my heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to done it and i don't have the feeling for the people that i should have until i can get that feeling there's no need of me going because i'd be a hypocrite and all these years i've tried to serve him with a true heart and i won't go out there being a hypocrite i've got to feel that this isn't ricky and raketa it isn't this bunch it's god's children that's in bondage what a shift you say brother matt does it mean that the prophet wouldn't call out the same sin no you can call out the same and view the sin the same exact way brother branham could still call out the sin but his attitude he had towards it was two totally different things i must go them until i could feel that way i'll just loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait god bless you each one hope to see you again real soon until then will you do this one favor for me now both here and on tape also you brethren pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex and you could take and you don't even realize it prophet of god says i have lost pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost the bible says he's a satan's a a thief he comes to kill steal and destroy and if he can't get you on a bar stool somewhere he'll allow you to stay right in church but give you a grudge or a bitterness or a complex and rob you of everything and you don't even realize you've lost something as a believer you've lost your joy and now there's no joy you know joy is your strength hello and you lose something as a believer you don't even realize you're bitter and you're angry and you don't know listen you say brother matty here i'm not here to kick you or hurt you or condemn you i'm here to tell you jesus can heal every part of you he can heal what a doctor can't heal his tools his tool bag has tools that physicians don't have and just like that he says i've he says it's so easy to build a complex i don't know the video the other day with brother way sitting here standing here in front of good man but build himself around a complex another kind of complex did the same thing brother ray by the way you can so easily do it it's you just get a little something in your mind keep thinking that way go back and check it with the scripture and see if it's right or not then go from their own don't lose the feeling of the people you must remember they're not made out of sawdust they're flesh and blood human beings and a soul pray for me all of you if you will god bless you we're going to bow our heads and ask brother i'm glad we had that kind of honesty go to that next one if you could brother matthew it's just six o'clock now can i have just a few more minutes so something would come in brother branham's life cleaning out those channels now he builds a complex listen what brother branham says here uh about cancer and i'm just going to read some of these quotations let me pull it up on my screen my brother brian and my brother matthew is getting these quotes pulled up of the prophet listen to what brother branham says here in healing this is 1953 its parenthesis message is what cancer is now a cancer that second greatest enemy the world has heart troubles first then cancer tubercular according to according to the insurance companies now the cancer would be caught in a natural a scavenger or a buzzard something that eats dead things a cancer usually comes from a bruise a bruise it strikes and the cells break in other words they backslide and then in there sets up everybody say this with me together another life say it again another life so here's what a cancer is it's another life it starts brother branham says those cells he says he says cancer comes from a bruise strikes and the cells break in other words they backslide and he says and then there sets up the betting ground or the foundation for another life i was just maybe two months ago now had a good friend very close you remember brother travis actually came here how many remembers brother travis good friend of mine and he sat here and gave his testimony how he came to the message just powerful you won't find a bolder witness for the message of the hour than brother travis just will tell you what the lord's done for him and how he's changed his life and brother travis had came to me and long before he had came into the message before the church actually before he came to our church and and found the truth he was he was at a what they call a vineyard church and it's a a non-denominational evangelical type of church and there was a man there the associate pastor name is marcus and big strong guy i mean just in the very healthy eight his his diet was very good he was kept himself in shape and just a really good really good genuine guy i met he had a chance to meet him uh three or four months prior to this and and just got to shake his hand and travis introduced me to him he was a associate pastor and travis had told me that he was diagnosed with cancer and that it was very bleak and it was it was bad and the doctors had given up on him given any hope for him to live and when they found it was already stage four hopkins lymphoma and and it looked like he was just gonna go and he was alright his health was already breaking down and this person was very close very close to brother travis and he asked me said brother matt would you come with me and would you pray and lay your hands on him and let's pray the prayer of faith for him and i want to go and visit him and have just a conversation with him and i said absolutely you know brother travis i mean count me in whenever you want to go we'll go and speak to him and we'll pray pray the prayer of faith for him and so that maybe a week passed by two weeks and travis called me and said okay i've just spoke to mary uh marcus is at home and we could go in and so we had a moment just there very special i just even here now uh reminiscing about it just a very special moment uh that we had there in the living room of this man's home and he's man much elder to me um and and and he's a wonderful christian man and he just begins to you could tell just by looking at him that he looked different from the last time i had seen him as you could tell his health had uh you know you could almost see just that look to where his health had just left him and and he was stooped over and he could still speak to us and you know he began to just reminisce with travis and you know and and and just begin to tell us about his condition and how the doctors said there was another family there from his church a woman who had lost her 16-year-old son to cancer and she was a big advocate uh there for uh cancer research and she was there and her husband was there and i asked her they believers yes they go to my church and and so we just i just began to listen and begin to tell us you know a little bit about his diagnosis and you could tell on the side of his neck there was a growth about the size of a grapefruit just massive growth off of his neck and that was just one tumor that he had in his body many more that you couldn't see and and i began to just even before we went there to the uh to the the man's home i just in the vehicle right there with brother travis so let's just pray right now get our spirits right before we go and speak to this man and so you know i just was waiting on the lord as you do and just feeling just waiting for the holy spirit there in that moment just to maybe say something that i could say to help him or to to get his faith in the right place you know it's really hard often for yourself it's very easy to have faith for other people but when it's you and you're the one it's much harder to you know to have a positive attitude let alone faith to believe god is going to do something for you and so a lot of times you encourage you try your best to encourage that person and you remind them the word this man knew very well you know was a bible theologian knew that knew the bible very well the verses i would quote to him i knew he knew but sometimes god just uses something just to give a spark of faith and begin to speak to him and a lot of the things i began to tell him was right out of this message what cancer isn't brother travis begin to testify a little bit about uh you know he says you know brother he says marcus i'm just going to cut to the chase you're at your end of a lie here at you you know the end of your life the doctors have told you not going to be here much longer so it's not a time for me to mince words or you know and just beat her on the bush i'm just going to come right out and tell you that you know and man brother travis i tell you what he just began to witness to this man the message of the end time and the end time truth and and just begin to witness to this man how god had changed his life and he found a real living god and a real true living savior and and uh man just was bold if you everybody i told him afterwards i said man if i was ever in a a foxhole i'd want you on at my back um just a person you just could count on and uh and and and so we just begin and i begin to tell him how that cancer that was there in his body and i began to say marcus you know the the doctors they're you know they they use the only tools science has given them and the research that they have and and if they could go in there with a knife and they could cut out all of the cancer then great that'd be that'd be wonderful and they'll do their best to you know to do what they can do and and then i said now but you have to remember those doctors only look at a physical uh they look at the flesh the physical outward realm and they deal in that outward realm their scans and their pet scans that they that they have are all dealing not looking into another dimension they're looking at the dimension that you see and what i see and i said they deal with the they deal with the body i said but i want you to understand here that cancer is just a name that science has given that disease but and i said i also want you to realize that that tumor that's on your neck that's just a body of a life that's living inside of you it's a spirit and i said because cancer is a life it's another life that's not your life that is sucking the life out of you and trying to destroy you and if it could have its way it will destroy you and it'll kill you and i said so when i pray for you i'm not going to do like the doctor i'm not praying at that outward physical thing that i see on your neck i'm going to speak to the life or the spirit that's hiding behind that tumor and you remember the random this morning we read about it when he comes and he says you've got a heart trouble you've got a heart condition yes brother branham that's right i do and he says you're even living with it now and he says oh it's a lie and he says they've told a lie about you he says they called you a witch a man that's confessing a divine healing and the woman says that's right he says you're not a witch sister you're a child of god go home and be free what was he doing he was going beyond the heart condition that was the outward external evidence and he was exposing the spirit that was hiding behind that heart trouble and when he did she was free and so brother branham says notice what cancer is he says it sets up another life now look the pollen from the male to the females are tiny little germs so they can i cannot see it it has to be seen through glasses the first little thing looks like there's a knot tied in that little cell starts in the spine begins to develop he's talking about how life begins and the seed it begins to germinate and the egg and then he says then from there you gotta he says the spine begins to develop and cells and every seed after it's kind dog after dog human after human foul after fall so forth according to the metal and female now if you'll notice that little germ begins to swell and it forms and that was you one time begin to push out cells push out push out cells until it becomes nine months of age born then it becomes an adult woman or man and here you are today come from one little germ just developing cells sell on cell that's how it begins now if you'll notice that line over there says no now for instance a cancer comes from a bruise and it's a growth too so is tumor cataract or we could spend hours on what it is now those let's say cancer first it's a teeny little cell and it begins to develop cells and it doesn't have any form it just goes anyway spreads out with legs some wrap around and some like rose cancer and red cancer and black cancer sarcomas cancer different varieties of them but they're not any certain way because they are spirit and spirit has no form do you know that a demon spirit has no form except the form or life or the host that it dwells in you say how could a man go into a school of little elementary children go in there with a gun and kill children and begin to shoot people that wasn't that man that did that the man was just the host or the body of a spirit that had and infiltrated that man's mind he may not even have realized that he was under demonic control and brother branham says i prophesy to you in the name of the lord this world will go completely insane you say a cancer spirit yes sir i can prove it to you that it's a life and the devil now as old-fashioned as it seems to be but there's not a sickness in the world but what's caused by the devil sickness came from the devil sickness is a direct end result he says a direct or indirect result notice sickness now this is a fleshly this is a a something he's speaking about in the flesh sickness came from the devil sickness is a direct or indirect result from sin maybe not your sin but something you inherited aha something you inherited before we had any sin we had no sickness after sin came then sickness was the attributes of sin now watch this cancer now say on my hand now there's none there now there could be some day well there it is then if it's a growth comes on that hand a cancer or whatever it may be it's another life it's developing a different cell though it is a cell but it started from a life just like you started before that little germ that's as far as we can tear your body down to that one single cell that little germ is a tiny little cell just beyond that cell is a spirit because it's got a life well that life came from god for you but where did this life of death come in your body which is called cancer who brought that there that's the devil now jesus called it a devil and by being a minister that's the terms i take notice what the bible says notice listen what brother adam says today we see a man that's deaf and dumb the doctors say well his vocal cord is dead his hearing over his eardrums the nerves died what caused it doctor well i don't know it just died some fever done it or something well why didn't the nerves die all over see it just died there now jesus said that it was a deaf spirit the doctor says the nerve died jesus said a deaf spirit did it notice now jesus said that it was a deaf spirit is that right that when the deaf and dumb spirit came out of a man he could speak and hear now it's just like a transparent band around my hand shutting the circulation off you notice these people come up on the platform here's the deaf and dumb walk off speaking and hearing see what happens a man comes here he's deaf you've seen it night after night he can't hear a woman she's looking around in the years notice if you go to this tape in healing there's a man in the end after brother adam gets through preaching this and the prayer line is a man who's completely deaf and brother brandon begins to talk to him and he has the man up there trying to uh get you know tell give him sign lane or to uh he brother branham this man is completely different brother brandon actually when he tells the man gets real close to him he says now sir now i'm going to pray for you he says sir can you hear me can you hear me and the man can hear mumbling maybe something muddy and he i don't i don't and no i could no i don't i don't and the the man that's there with him on the tape brother brandon says okay well let's just begin to pray and brother brandon begins to call out and he speaks and says now you spirit that's got that man that eardrum and you're pinching that nerve i speak to you in the name of the lord jesus christ let go of that nerve and brother branham gets in his face and says sir can you yes sir i can hear you now praise the lord i can hear what you're saying now brother branham just like that a deaf spirit is cast out leaves the man and now the man can hear listen what jesus says in mark chapter 9 when jesus saw the people come running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and death spirit notice not disease not dead nerve now a spear can kill it that is what deafness is but a spirit calls that jesus says thou deaf and dumb spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him then it's an unseen force just like a transparent ban around my hand now notice how brother branham describes this with a transparent band you got a band around my hand and it's cutting the circulation off brother branham says no matter how much salve you put on the end of this finger it's got the circulation shut off and it can't get well until you move this band you see remember what brother branham says there's a reason for everything and what is a spirit you say well that's just my temper well that's a spirit well i was just i was just born that way don't you believe a lie of the devil there's a band that's got your circulation cut off and until you remove the band as brother branham says no matter how much salve you put on the end of this finger you've got to remove the band you've got to remove the curse you've got to know what it is that's why i love even at our at our we had a youth camp just about to have one here coming up and we had one last year and at the prayer line there was many you know they have many camps and youth youth meetings and they'll they'll take young people and they'll pass them through a line where there's ministers i'm thankful for that and there's camps that have too many young people and that's the only way you can pray for them but we did it differently uh back home and we actually a brother minister said brother matt i've noticed in prayer lines it's important for the people for the young person to say what their problem is to say what their need is to speak because when you speak and when you identify you expose the spirit and as they begin to speak what was it they were using their voice to say i'm not that's not who i am my depression is not me my addiction is not me the change that's that's a band that's around my life and we watch night we watch night after night god deliver people from those spirits brother branham says until you move this band well now that band in this case i'm talking about a deafness is a spirit an unseen person and what that thing is cast away of course that gives a nature he says that gives nature a chance to operate and then they begin to hear now lung cancer it begins to develop a body gets larger larger it's got one alternative it's got one alternative take your life this is how a complex starts say oh brother we're talking about cancer yes we are spiritual cancer you say i'm cancer i don't you know i don't have any kind of disease in my flesh oh but let's look beyond the flesh because remember there's another part of you than what you see in the mirror and you watch what that what that spirit will do remember we're preaching about deliverance how do you get free from this there's a part there's a reason for everything brother branham says it's got one alternative take your life now all the natural is a spiritual as i said you believe that do you now the cancer come into this store place or this bruised place and he took a body and he begins to suck on your blood one purpose take your life the doctor can cut it out if there's one speck of it left it'll start right there growing again now the thing happened in the way if the doctor could operate and take it out that's very well that's good he'll take it out now on the doctor's way of destroying my body or your body if you as a cancer will be just to diminish me from the earth that's all now the way of divine healing it isn't dealing with that body at all it's dealing with that life that's in that body are you here tonight you're catching this if you was a cancer and i was a healing he says and i was healing the earth of you being a cancer i call your life out of you well there lays your body your body is just as natural there as it would be if the life was in it it's laying there in every feature and everything now many people don't understand divine healing that's the reason they never get their divine healing they don't understand it's deeper than what you might see that's why brother branham says you've this is what happens to him when he develops this complex and it begins to build it up and now he's gotten so calloused and so indifferent a minister as a a a prophet of the age and he's developed such an attitude the prophet seventh angel messenger the prophet to the latest in church age and he's developed such an attitude that he's ready to leave the field and stop preaching all together because there's a there's a complex that's being built in his life you've got to loose the band you've got to become free and let the channels become cleaned out how do i get free brother matt how do i get free of that of that problem you let the lord come down and heal every single part of your being that cancer starts off brother branham says starts off with just a little cell and then it gets it gets struck it gets hit it gets damaged and he says then it backslides and he says then it lays the betting ground for life and if you continue to feed it and you continue to feed it as brother adam talked about that black dog and that white dog you continue to feed it it gets stronger it builds more life and more life and more life and now that life is living off of your life and it's trying to destroy you you know what that that spirit that complex wanted to do to god's prophet it wanted him to take a detour now remember what we said not backslide not to go off into sin but just deviate a little bit from the word to deviate a little bit from the path or the plan of god that he had for his life and i just as i sat there i was reading this these quotes from standing in the gap and i thought my goodness here the prophet of god is preaching to us telling us about this standing in the gap he's telling us about this complex that he's developed and here it is june 1963 and i thought to myself what would have happened had brother branham took in that detour what would have happened had he succumbed to the pressures of his own remember his own justification of how he was justifying that and rather than letting the lord change him from that from that place that he was at he just decided i'm good i'm going to settle in right here you see why it's so important what we said to you today you've got to constantly be being changed you can never settle or stop you can never let something sideline you or put you on the side i don't care what it is or what you want to list here today you've got to move on you've got to continue to move you've got to continue to live you've got to continue to go because if satan can accomplish anything that he that he can in your life may not get you to turn around and do a u-turn but it'll get you to take a left turn when god says no keep going straight child don't go that way and oh i just say here today lord would you send your word to expose the devil how many could just raise a hand and say lord i want to be free of any cancer that i've got building in my body right now i want you to deliver me and heal me of any cell spiritually speaking of anything in my life that's not according to your word i want you to set me free from it we prayed the prayer of faith for that man laid my hands on marcus begin to call out to god said i'm going to pray for you maybe in a way you've never heard prayed for and i began to speak to that demon spirit me and brother travis called on the name of god and i could feel the anointing just drop in that room as that man's faith you can feel was accepting of that doctors gave him i testified to him i said you know hopkins lymphoma stage four there was a little sister we've got in our sister church in louisiana who was t i was testifying too and i said she was diagnosed also with stage four hopkins lymphoma he said really he said you got to be kidding me i said no we i said here she was in a little she was in a church service and she began there was diagnosed ass and each because he had just showed me his pet scans he brought up his phone said mary his wife had showed me the pet scans and here's marcus and you could see his pet scans of the cancer just completely eating his body and i said that's i said let me show you her pet scan marcus so i pulled up the testimony from brother tim pruitt's church there if you don't know the testimony of sister elena butts i'd get i recommend you to go and find that video and watch it it's just wonderful and you could see the pet scan of sister elena and i showed him i said you see this here here's her and i compared it to his almost looked identical and you could see the cancer and sister sister elena's body and i said you know marcus i said that woman was prayed for that sister was prayed for she was sitting in the service and now i don't know why you know not saying this is something that everybody's got to do but she began to to to ponder how that david danced before the lord when he seen the ark of the covenant coming back to jerusalem and i said and the lord just struck something inside of her heart and said get up and john get up and dance uh run around the do a jericho march run around the the uh the the sanctuary so said that sister got up she began to run and no one else was running no one else was jumping she began to run around the sanctuary and just praising god and praising god i said you know what god did for her marcus god supernaturally healed her of that stage 4 hopkins lymphoma the doctor said had no chance and you'll never live she's living today cancer free you know what that did that brought his faith up just a little bit just where he could believe the word god is no respecter of persons friends i got a text just last week from his wife hallelujah big capital praise the name of the lord marcus is cancer-free hallelujah what was it there was a life trying to take his life there was a life trying to suck the life out of his life and if satan could do anything to you he'll try to destroy you in any way that he can remember that's his goal is to destroy you to annihilate you to deform your mind of your thinking brother branham brother branham uses that and says that life of that cancer and you hear at the end of that message as he begins to call it even to that death man i testified of today now you may not have sp you may not have a you know an issue with any of these diseases cancer or deafness or tuberculosis or heart trouble you know or anything maybe you do here today i was testifying just thinking of sister connie she told me even right at the end of the service today she was cancer-free and i thought you know the god who could heal a physical cancer surely could heal something down inside of your heart the god who could deliver and set someone free of stage four hopkins lymphoma if he's a physician that can do a work on the outward body don't you think he's a physician that if you would open up your heart to him tonight and say lord i open up every door and every avenue i open up every come on friends can you do that here today i open up every channel lord to you i'm not going to hide any of it i'm going to open up every closet could you stand to your feet today with your hands raised and say lord i open up every avenue to you right now bow your heads with me if you could say lord i open up every channel i want to i want to be i want as brother branham gives the vic the brother gives the vision and he says you were different brother branham you looked different you were changed what was it his heart had been healed and i wonder if maybe something inside of you you could say here tonight with a hand head bowed eyes closed if you just play something softly for me and you could relate to god's prophet here tonight maybe i didn't call out your specific need that you've got upon your heart or what's on your mind right now but maybe you could identify you could say i too brother matt just as brother branham says pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost out there in that complex god did this gave this service even here tonight i believe the lord jesus has spoken specifically maybe to you here tonight and you just want to raise a hand and pray that and say lord i want everything that you want to give me and i'm not going to surrender any of it to the devil i'm not going to allow him to steal from me deceive for me something you have given me and i claim it in the name of the lord jesus i got uplifted hands and i claim whatever i've lost whatever satan has tried to steal from me and rob remember all that that woman needed was god to expose that lie in her life and she was free just like that and so tonight satan has been exposed and i raise my hands and say lord i accept my healing at whatever level you want to bring my healing maybe it is your physical body here tonight and you say that part of me needs it just raise a hand and accept it maybe it's healing in your mind or your spirit your emotion your memory your reasoning somewhere in there that you know satan is robbing you from you just want to surrender and say lord i give it to you right now i want that feeling as the prophet of god says give me that tender sweet humble kind love of the lord jesus will you restore it to me lord lord you see these hands up all over the building i didn't do that lord i didn't do that lord your word did that these are believers of your word lord they're believers of your promises not mine i'm just here right with them i got both my hands raised lord i'm just like any anyone that's got their hands raised you see us here tonight lord we're in great need of a physician a physician with tools that doctors don't even have a physician with microscopes where you could look down into the innermost part of our being maybe something that's affecting us here today that something way that we can't even dig up we can't even remember somewhere in our past but god i believe you've been with us every moment there was an angel that was watching over us and protecting us and wooing us and calling us to yourself so right now lord god i pray you'd do a surgery on every heart that's in here under the sound of my voice would you come and do a supernatural work lord in the hearts of your children i pray you'd clean out every channel let the flu be opened up tonight jesus we want to be changed we'll get to next year we'll get to next week we'll get to next month and we'll still be in need of that change may i always be able to change lord god that's my prayer as i raise my hands with these individuals here tonight may i never get stuck may i never get in a rut in a ditch that i can't get out of that i'm settled may i never settle or get stuck or get get satisfied or content with where i'm at as a believer let me always want to say lord let me grow in the grace and the knowledge let me grow in the wisdom let me grow in the love let me grow in your peace let me grow in the lord i want all that you want to give me lord jesus i receive it now

restored the life that is yours amen brother matt that works taking a moment and talking to somebody and contacting their spirit had a sister come to the house one day i knew nothing about her but she asked my daughter to bring if she could come over and we could talk with her and so i began to talk to her in mama said um but but she wants to be prayed for i said yeah let me just talk to her and in a few minutes just begin to realize and see not a vision but god just began to tell me what was going on in her life without me knowing and i began to see the tears run down her eyes as those things began to be exposed and we were able to pray for her right then and god delivered her and i watched her life grow in christ to be a fine wonderful sister it just had to be exposed and when it's exposed be willing to say i'll let it go i'll give it back let go and let god have his wonderful way [Music] let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way your sorrows will

tabernacle god cares for you you mean you mean everything to him so much that he gave his life for you to restore you back to that fellowship appreciate that lord we thank you for today things in our own lives as we looked at him and maybe we've we've been afraid for them to be exposed maybe we'd think well that would ruin my image i've carefully built this image up around i've i want everybody to know that i am a christian but lord you've gone down inside and said there's some things that are troubling you there's maybe we wonder why something like this might flare out a little bit and how that reaction would come from maybe a little bit of anger and something will say lord i don't want to do any and today lord you said let's go down to the root of it let's go down to the cause of it lord as you know how to do and you know how to expose but you do it for a reason not to shame us not to embarrass us not so people could laugh and look but for deliverance but to be set free for healing to be restored back to that fellowship without interference lord yes lord to walk with you to talk with you to hear that same voice that spoke to brother branham said speak to that storm i'm
