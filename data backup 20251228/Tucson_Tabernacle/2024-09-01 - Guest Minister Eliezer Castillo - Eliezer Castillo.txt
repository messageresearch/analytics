like a river attend my way when so Rose like sea Billows roll what my Lord thou has told me to say it is well it Is Well with My Soul though Satan should buff it though Satan should buffit though Tri should come let this bless Assurance control that Christ had regarded my heless estate and hath shed his own blood for my soul oh it Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul sing it again it is well let's all stand to our feet oh it Is Well with My [Music] Soul it is well it is well with my soul my sin my sin oh the Bliss of this glory is thought my sin not in part like beat like beat like punch is nail to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul oh he sing it is well [Music] Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul let's sing it again it is well it is well amen hallelujah with My Soul [Music] It is Well it Is Well with My Soul amen what a beautiful song Amen I I believe that's each and every one of our prayer that we can say it Is Well with our soul um there's a verse there where it says that though Satan he he buff at me I just asked brother uh brother uh Evans what that means and he says it it's to beat and what that's what the devil does is he's he's going to beat us he's going to try to put things in our minds he's going to hurt our body he's our our body is going to be sick or we're going to be tired in our lives there's going to be things going through our minds but even though we go through all of these things it is well in my soul that's the amazing thing God has that reserve for himself that little place that little hidden spot and that's why we come to church and that's why we want to serve the Lord because God can protect your soul even though you've gone through many things in your life God has res reserved your soul for himself and we can sing it as well let us bow our heads Heavenly Father what an appropriate song it is Father just to come up here and to know Lord that you have the control and though we go through many things Lord each and every person they have their own little battles their own little trials father but if we can realize that when we accept you father when we accept the Supreme sacrifice of Jesus Christ and we accept your Holy Spirit father you H have reserved us and protected us father and though this body is beat down though things come in our lives and they go in out of our Lives father yet we can be assured father that we are standing in un an unmovable Rock father we're standing in your word we're standing in your sacrifice that whenever all of the things are going on in this world they're crumbling away they're uncertain we can sing this beautiful song It Is Well with My Soul father I ask Lord that you just put that peace in each and every person here this morning Lord we're all going through something doesn't matter how spiritual we are if we've just given our heart to the Lord if we've been serving you for years father we are all going through something Lord and I just ask that you touch each and every person bless the word that is about to be read father and just I ask that you just take control father forgive us of every trespass every transgression that we've committed even just this morning Lord we ask that you just put us under your blood and and take control with your spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen what a beautiful song Amen I love that we can um listen to these songs and I'm sure we've listened to them for years but I think the key to worship it's not just a ritual maybe it seems like it because we do it you know in the beginning of the preaching after the preaching but if you take that personal in your lives you take every single song and you apply it to your life then just singing isn't just singing you're you're worshiping and it becomes a testimony in your life and um so it's such a beautiful thing just to let go and to Worship the Lord if you'd like to turn with me to a very um simple scripture Proverbs 23:7 whenever you have it just go ahead and say [Music] Amen Proverbs 23:7 and and um I'm going to I'm try not to hold you too long and um just such a simple thought in my mind that I I just want to just relay with each and every one of you and I pray that the Lord um blesses us through his word um so the Bible it says for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart heart is not with thee let us do a little prayer before we sit down lord we just read your word we commit this service into your hands we ask that you take preeminence thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen let us sit and um just get comfortable um I honestly I didn't have a a title until I literally was walking up I I didn't know what to call it so I just um titled it the battle for control and um the scripture is showing that whatever we think we are so as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and um that's a very simple um scripture I'm sure those that haven't even heard that scripture before they understand it because what we think that's what we become now I I got a question for each and every person who who's thought something bad this just this this past week we all have but let's not get scared because it's not just a thought that just comes in that that forms us into the person we are thoughts come and go sometimes there they call them intrusive thoughts right bad thoughts come and those bad thoughts they go and those aren't the thoughts that we're talking about we're not talking about just something that we accidentally think we accidentally think something wrong about somebody or we actually accidentally think something wrong about ourselves or whatever it might be those thoughts they come and they go and we have to understand that those thoughts those are alien thoughts amen me meaning that they're they're not coming from the source within us a lot of times it comes from certain circumstances and they come and they go but what this is talking about it's a I just learned this word let me see if I can say it's a contemplative thought to contemplate to to let it relay in our mind all the time and we we allow a a thought to just sit there in our mind and we almost create it as a habit and we just think things these these things then we begin to be formed by the things that we think and this is just not for for Christians but this scripture is actually talking about somebody that that is deceitful to somebody else and he's saying as a man thinketh in his heart so is he he could say Come on come eat with me come sit down let's have a good time but his heart is not with you so he he's he's doing something deceptive but his heart shows him who he is his thinking shows him who he is and and that's what our lives they are a result of what we have in our minds what we allow the things to come in I I was studying I'm not going to talk about it but I was studying about media and and media is a medium or a a middle place of information so there's a source there's a middle place and there's the receiver and we have to think about what kind of media are we taking in and I'm not just talking about the news and I'm not talking at social media but I'm talking about words and and things we watch and people we talk to what are we taking in and those things we're taking in we're taking into our thoughts and we allow those thoughts to sit down and make a nice um little room there in our in our mind until we become those very thoughts that we think so we're not um you know we ask God for forgiveness for the thoughts that we think we ask God for forgiveness for for when we get angry or when we get some kind of thought we go to the Cross right away and we allow the Lord to wipe that out we go out out of that thought and we keep going that's not what forms you it's the things that you allow to sit there and um we know that that's as simple as that is that's how this whole world was taken over by by somebody going into somebody else's ear and giving deceptive words and and and brother bam said that he that that the serpent went he spoke to Eve and he took control of the whole entire world it wasn't by force it wasn't by a legion of angels it was by allowing somebody to be deceived into thinking they were doing the right thing that's true amen so he goes over there tells them this great thing they accept it in their mind and then they do it and because that was done the whole world went into chaos sometimes we have to look around our world we say okay where is this chaos coming from where is these things and a lot of times it's it's because the result of the thoughts we allow in in our minds so he didn't go face to face even even you know this is my mind you can take take it or leave it you know it's up to to you but just by the way I see the word it said that that Satan drew his tail and Drew the angels in and if we've ever heard brother Brown he said it was the tale he told so it was him talking wow it was him maybe miscuing or skewing the word of God and saying No this is how it really is and people accepting it to the point where that was the war it was a if you want to call it a political war we when we think about wars we think about cannons we think about swords we think about artillery but these are Spiritual Beings here so what was it he said it was a tail he told that Drew the angels and and he was kicked out we can we can think about it we can try to imagine it we can imagine with swords I could even imagine it as a political but we don't know is it was a spiritual battle right but we know that it was a tale he told and people accepted it in their minds and it changed them it changed them from a good condition to a bad condition even when when U there's a story or it's not a story but it was a scripture in Jude I believe in Jude um uh let me see it's in Jude 8 where it talks about how there's there's filthy dreamers that defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities so there's words speaking evil and then after he says all of those things then in verse 9 he says Yet Michael now he's he's Shifting the the the scene and he's saying Yet Michael when he was contending for Moses's body and disputing for Moses contending with the devil disputing for Moses's body he res restrained himself from saying accusations and and the the people when they think about that scripture they'll be like man they had big old sores they had their wings out there but it was saying they were contending and disputing this is a discussion they're having and and and what the devil does it says that that people which are are anointed by the devil they say they speak evil of dignities what the devil will do because he will will speak evil he doesn't care he doesn't have no respect of God so he will put thoughts in people's minds that are evil and and even though the devil he'll he'll play dirty and do those things Yet Michael refrained himself to even accuse the devil to even speak evil that sounds like a like a a battle of words or or political battle and but the devil he don't care he he will put thoughts he will put words and he will hurt but um that's that's how the devil he he took over that's how the devil takes over and and um and that's how he takes over people's lives is by attacking the mind he he attacks the mind um there's a message that brother brandham preaches is called the greatest battle ever fought really good message especially if we want to understand you know um inside of us what's going on in in US brother brandham he preaches a really good message about what's going on that man is a Triune being a soul body spirit and and he he says something there where he says that that God picked a part of a man and same picked a part of a man and and and and God took the heart yes Satan took the mind right and he didn't take it he didn't take it so that he can be there nice and comfortable because our soul It Is Well with My Soul that is where eternal life stays so he doesn't want the mind he picked it because he doesn't have no rights to our soul he has no rights to my eternal salvation to who I really am so he picked the mind and he be began to attack in it wow and and he explains this scripture I mean in this message how how it this this great human B I mean this Angel battle dropped down to earth and became human battles and the battle was in the mind wow now I want you guys I'm going to try to paint a picture and I want us to picture it that there's a battle and and battles and Battlegrounds they're not pretty to look at there's fox holes there's these Bob wi whatever those barriers are there's there's great tanks there's uh marks on the ground because of the the missiles and the explosions and there's it's just a horrible sight it's a battle and and and brother Bram said that there's a battle going on today that's in the mind and it's it's that's why no matter how saved you are how secure you are in your soul the mind is always going to have to fight there's always going to be something going on in the mind always it's never as far as I know there's never going to be peace until we're changed until we go with the Lord because the devil has the rights to that mind and he'll go and he'll attack it and and um just like I said he chose it chose that mind and it created a battlefield and and you have to think about it kind of like in a in a different way that I'm sure he studied it I'm sure he knows just like people you know people will study the mind and what they'll do is they'll create social medias they'll create um casinos based on our human nature right so that it'll draw us to that if a man can do that imagine Satan imagine the things that he will do to cause us to fall The Avenues that he'll do so he he's he knows the human mind he knows our habits we they he had Google and uh YouTube have nothing on Satan you know I don't know if anybody has had a conversation about oh man you know um I've been thinking about a buying a boat and this this and that oh what kind oh bay liner and this you know you have a good nice conversation you know nobody else is there and then all of a sudden you go to Google or you go to YouTube and it's a nice Bayliner boat and you're like what what's going on government's hearing me or something who knows but I know people have experienced that before what about saying what about when we confess the wrong thing because our confession is a strong thing and what about whenever we go and we say we're unworthy or or we always seem to open up the wounds that never heal and we become victims and we create ourselves to be victims and the devil's saying yeah just keep saying that keep doing that I'm going to step on that wound I'm going to keep working on that it's that that power of the devil knowing what we confess and then he attacks those things um what's amazing is is he's attacking the mind but what does he want right that's what he wants he wants you because the mind if your soul is secure All Is Well with My Soul right All Is Well with My Soul he's wants the soul and amazing thing Jesus he talked about the eyes being the light of the body body people they'll say oh that's the window to the soul we've heard brother brandham talk about it we've heard other people say window to the soul and it's not just that we see something and it's a window to a soul but if you've ever heard of that scripture how it says um as a man looks upon a woman and lusts after her he's already committed adultery just by looking now he didn't say as a man lookth upon a woman he has already committed adultery that's the eyes right but there's something that happens with the eye it's a connection to our mind and our spirit where when we look like I said we all have thoughts every single day even brother Brown had a cross there in his in his uh in his car if a woman would walk by he'd look at the cross right we're humans we're humans but it's whenever we contemplate and we begin to allow those thoughts to sit there and to brew which is called lust and we look we lust committed adultery so it's it the the eyes and the mind they're associated with one another brother brandham says that the gate to the soul is the Mind said that in in spoken word is the original seed that the gate to the soul is the Mind wow he also said that the mind is the womb so it it our minds they're a fertile ground you know what I I I really like that um um whenever I I would speak and I would have an interpreter always it was in Spanish I would read certain scriptures there was a scripture in in Genesis that um I would I read there's other ones that I've read too like in Exodus where it would talk about the womb there was one I think I believe it's in Genesis um I can't find it but it's in Genesis 20 I believe 20 and 19 or 17 and it's talking about how um Abraham goes to this Kingdom there was a king named aimc and he sees Sarah and uh he wants to take her as a wife Abraham's like yeah that's my sister take her he was scared right what God did he he closed all the wounds of the women of the land and and and and so whenever everything changed and God said hey Abraham go and pray for ABC God went to AMC and he said hey you're doing the wrong thing you're a righteous man but if you don't um stop doing what you're doing you are going to be annihilated so of course he was a righteous man he he gave him back Sarah but Abraham prayed for him so that the wombs would open up from the women well that word in Spanish there's um a word called viente I I can't really say it right but then in in uh in King James version they it's called or reain of alera version It's called matrice it's a matrice right brother so if you ever read it in the Raina valeta version It's going to be called a matrice not a VI and um matrice in English now I don't this sounds funny but the word in English and the Hebrew if you go to the Hebrew it's actually called Matrix so matrice is Matrix in Spanish so um the reason why I say that because the womb is a matrix and and a matrix is a something that that is allowing something to form within itself it's a it's an atmosphere where something can grow and form so that's that's what a womb is or a matrix is something to allow it to grow and and brother bam said that our mind is a womb and we allow something to sit there we allow it to form and to grow right so so we allow these things if we allow a thought to come in if man you look at a woman you allow that thought to come in instead of ask for repentance or turn around you you form you begin to form something that's why the things that we watch you have to be careful yes sir the things that um were're seen on on on the phone and on the TV we have to watch out because if we watch it enough we become that right so uh this is um very very very strong stuff and it is saying that the mind is the gate to the soul so first just so I can paint the picture you have the Mind Battleground and in that mind there is a gate there and there's a fight there and there's a fight to get into that door there's a fight to get in there in in Revelations it talks about Jesus knocking at a door to a heart why he wants to get in so there's a door and guess who can open it the devil can't open it God can open it that's how God made us he gave us sovereignty within ourselves so that we can say hey I accept this thought or I reject this thought I accept the word or I reject the word it's up to us to open up that door that is in our mind and that door it says it's a door to your soul that's who you are this is I I've spoken about it before this is just flesh and blood but the real you is in here and and and and there's a battle for control there's a battle to to enter into that and the devil he don't want control so that he can make something prosperous he wants to wreck us and send us to Hell send us to the place he's going that's what he's trying to do God he made it for himself he made it for us um and I think about that and I think about like thoughts and and and you think about it you know we we look at the message we look at the word we look at the Bible and it show that in the beginning there was a beginning right and John he writes it perfectly it says in the beginning was the word and if you go to Genesis 1:1 it says in the beginning God created and so he spoke it was the word and that word created everything and that word actually created beginning of everything so before that it was a thought and that word expressed the thought wow so so and God thought for eternity he didn't think just for a little bit and it makes me realize that sometimes we have to think before we speak be because because look at what if God spoke rationally or irrationally if he spoke without thinking but everything he spoke he thought about it and whenever he began to speak from chaos came a Garden of Eden came Beauty came beautiful things and and a lot of times whenever we have to check our thoughts we have to check what we're thinking before we even speak yes that's good amen we have to know what we're thinking because sooner or later as a man thinketh in his heart so is he one of these days the things that we think we're going to manif it in our lives in our words in our what we do that's why sometimes we can't have the victory sometimes we we just don't know why we can't just kick that habit well we keep going to the same thoughts we keep allowing that same thing to enter into our mind and we open the door to it we let it sit there so uh there something that we we really we we have to watch it we have to be careful and um in Genesis 65 you don't have to turn with me but it says that that God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of the heart was only evil continually so we we think you know we accidentally think wrong things we got got to kick it out but here God saw the wickedness of man and he saw that every imagination to imagine means you grab a thought and you make a world out of it right every imagination of the thoughts that Hebrew word is a Hebrew word called yer and means to form or to create it actually another word for it is figuratively is conception now we're talking about a womb here it's conception now the other time that this word is used it's another word called Yar which is basically the same and it's in Genesis 2:7 where it says and the Lord formed man formed so it was a creating process God Yar formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and there was a man there and that same word is used when it says every imagination so we're forming something within our minds we're forming something every time we think every time we allow something to sit there is there is something growing within that Matrix growing within that womb until gives you give birth right and then we'll see the manifestation of it we'll see what's going on with that um so the womb in the mind is not just an analogy but but it's a spiritual womb it's a spiritual womb and and why did he create it it's a betting ground for him so that he can place his words in you and we accept the word and we become just like him that's why in in uh 2 Corinthians it says when we look upon That Glory we become That Glory also I in I believe it's in Hebrews or in John 1 John it says that that one day we'll see Jesus and we'll be just like him so in seeing or or looking at the glory looking at the word we become that word we become formed our character is formed that's why we have to watch the things that we intake the things that we watch the things that we hear we allow in our mind because we'll become that very thing amen so that's why God created us we are a betting ground for his spoken word for his this word right here so every time you open up your Bible every time you you come here and listen to brother um Evans every time you come to church and worship you're you're creating and you're forming a character Church isn't to to save you we come here because I want to be more like him it's either this or I can sit in front of a TV it's either this or I can go out there with buddies and do whatever amen and what is that going to do to me amen what kind of investment is that going to give me I want to come here and I I I want to grow spiritually that's why we come that's why we were created the way we were created a as a seed so that God he can place his spirit in you and you can walk like him you can talk like him you can be like him you are the manifested word why because you you take it in you take it in until you become that so so we don't it it says that um there there's a scripture where it says that in Ephesians 612 says we for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of dark uh rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places we're struggling we we're fighting and um here let me see I don't know if I missed something here but so so there there's a fight going on in in in our body the Bible says that we are like a walled City so just to show you the picture again there's a Battleground in our mind and there's a door or there's a gate and the Bible here it says in Proverbs that he that is slow Proverbs 16:32 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty he that ruleth his Spirit than he than that taketh a city and then here in Proverbs 25:28 it says that he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down without walls so the picture in our mind is a Battleground and there's a gate and and you are a walled City brother brandham said that that wall or that fortification is the word you you Build That Wall by what the things that you take in that's why we can build walls against one another they're called complexes right we can build fortifications around ourselves that person's not going to hurt me again I'm not going to go through that if they they do that I'll never speak to them again what what do that's a wall but when we take the word that becomes a wall and the only way to infiltrate or to get into that wall is to open the door and that's your free will that's you allowing whatever to come in and to come go out I remember the the Pharisees they asked well um they says when is the kingdom of God um when should it come Luke 17:20 and 21 and he answered them he says the kingdom of God cometh not with observation verse 21 he says neither shall they say Lo here loow there where is the kingdom what church is it what denomination what belief system where is the kingdom is it is it a special kind of people is it a special kind of race where's the kingdom he says neither they shal say Lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you so now we see the picture when you accept Christ there is a kingdom within you and you're fortified that that City or that Kingdom with the wall of the word and the only way to get into that Kingdom into your soul is allowing somebody to come in by opening that gate but outside of that Kingdom there is a battle going on day in and day out amen for AIS there's a battle every single day to get to who you really are to get control to possess everything that you are to possess your happiness to possess your peace of mind see the devil let him burn everything down let them hurt my body let them turn people against me right let them even mess my mind up my soul is secure why you're fortified am so we're wrestling against that and every single day there's a turmoil and there's a fight over that City it's not a your this kingdom is not a democratic Kingdom it's a kingdom it's not a democracy where oh well let's have two opinions no there's no opinion only one there's only one king that can live in this Kingdom and that is Christ Jesus only Christ Jesus it it's it's not something where we can talk about we can reason when you allow another king to come in you cannot serve God and Mammon at the same time you cannot serve God and the devil amen once the devil enters in he's got control what hases he got control over he's got control of your conscience he's got control of your memory he's got control of your emotions he's got control of everything and he can just move it the way he wants to he's in the control room now and and and and we are are sold under that but when we allow Christ to come in we fortify all the walls we make sure everything is good the devil can't come in doesn't matter and and we're not wrestling against one another well that sister told me this that brother he looked at me wrong doesn't matter doesn't matter I don't fight against flesh and blood I I'm fighting I'm fighting against these Spirits I'm I'm fighting against thoughts every High thing what does that scripture I wish I could say it right but but it says cast down every High thought every evil imagination everything every imagination that exalts itself higher than God cast it down don't even let it sit because once we let a thought sit then we will the Bible says that this word imagination means conception we allow it to be conceived we allow it to grow to a point to to where it's going to you're going to give birth you're going to it it's going to come out of your life and you're going to say how how did I allow this to happen see the devil what he's going to do he's he's going to hurt you at your work he's not going to let you sleep you try to you try to go to sleep and you wake up Tire more tired than you did when you fell asleep wow he he he will attack your home he will attack your body he will attack everything but he doesn't want that he doesn't want your house he doesn't want your even your flesh he wants you he's fighting every moment and every inch of ground if he can gain as much as he can he will wow why because he wants wants you he wants you he wants to wreck your life but when we accept Christ we accept the blood we accept what he says about us and all of that then we can accept his spirit let rain come let Sun come let everything come it doesn't matter let this body crumble I know where I'm standing I can still sing this song well brother you're going through this well didn't your family do this well aren't don't you have this cancer don't you have that all is well with my soul why cuz I I have an anchor in here I met the master thank God I've met Christ amen All Is Well with My Soul well you're dying you're in your death bread All Is Well with My Soul that's the life I want to live I I I prosperous out there doesn't matter if the devil has my soul if the devil can control and send me to the place that was designed for him I don't want any of that I I want a place to where if it's going to be heartaches or if it's whatever it's going to be but I can be secure in Christ Jesus standing in his word amen and we have to realize that if your gate is closed your mind is closed it doesn't matter how much the devil hits you he's harmless he's the B brother Brown actually said he's almost harmless if he doesn't have a body to go into yeah so even though it seems even though it seems like oh man it's just I'm going through it it's hard he doesn't have power over you am he does not have power over you until we accept the words he has for us Jesus there was one time where he says my SP my words are spirit and they are life so the words that he speaks there's a spirit behind it and every time we hear his word preached behind this Pulpit reading the Bible listening on your phone or wherever you are you are in taking a spirit you're receiving Spirits which if it's the word you're receiving him but when we allow the bad thoughts intrusive thoughts people to say things and you accept those things well we're we're going to be in a horrible condition I I'm I I think I've said it before here but how how brother brandham he discerned that woman he realized that she had a spirit over her and he said why because there was a lie that was told over her that she was a witch there was a lie there was words and she accepted it she wasn't a witch but yet the spirit was over her now now my question is what do we think not only that what do we say about one another what do we say about ourselves brother what do we say about our family what kind of spirits are we letting out what kind of things because the Bible says that that we have a high priest that that is waiting for our profession or confession so every time we confess every time we speak the word or we say what he says there's a high priest or a spirit that goes forth and begins to work on your confession and then there's a scripture that says the death and life are at the power of the tongue so sometimes we don't have the right confession sometimes we don't have the right words and we and there's either going to be life coming out or there's going to be death coming out and let me tell you what there's a lot of betting grounds that are there to receive it and what do we do we re destroy one another we destroy ourselves when we because we as a betting ground we receive those things and then we manifest those things so we ha we have to we have to be careful and what the devil wants to do just like the Bible says th those people that don't have a rule over their spirit is like a city Without Walls when when the Devil comes in we've seen it many times maybe somebody experienced it in their lives when the Devil comes in he'll tear everything down he'll tear everything about God down he'll cause us to be angry at the very God that loves us he'll tear tear the word down tear everything down and create his own kingdom within us till we are helpless like I said till we begin to create different walls there was the word now we begin to create walls of complexes walls of anger walls of depression things that people they cannot penetrate people cannot they cannot even get close to us no more why because we have reserved ourselves so much and we're in such a mess yet when everybody sees us we have a nice little smile we look happy we look good but there's a termoil going on why we're we've allowed the devil to to ravish this Kingdom we've allowed the devil to enter in and take control of our emotions and take control of the things that that we hold dearly we're so we're so adamant of of saying hey don't drink don't smoke but but what are the things that we're intaking in spiritually what are the things we're allowing come through our mind and we're just we don't care and we don't know why we're in such such a mess why there's somebody sitting at that control tower that shouldn't be there and now we have Christ knocking at the door if anyone answers if anybody opens the door I can clean up I can clean up the house I I can I can remodel I can help you sometimes we find ourselves in that condition where where we're all messed up in our mind and everything yet we try to keep it together we try to look like Christians we try to look like Sayan people but we don't need to try to try anything we need Christ how do you open the how do you how do you let him in open the door all you do the only Power that you give Satan or God is to open to accept and many times we've accept too much trash in our lives we accept too much doubt accept too much things to we're all messed up but accept Jesus see what happens well my my finances didn't change my family is still the same but how's your soul how's that it says first seek ye the kingdom everything else will be added on first seek the kingdom don't worry don't try to fix yourself don't try to dress like a Christian don't try to act all nice that's all hypocrisy seek ye the kingdom first Let Jesus enter in and change that Kingdom change that world that's inside of you then you don't have to try to act you don't have to try to be it just comes out sometimes you you have a little Character defects as long as I filled with the Holy Ghost and God guides me I'm going to be who I am that's who God wants us to be be who we are and God will fix all those little defects all those little things it's not a restraining it's not an arresting of trying to do something that's what the law tried to do and it failed and it wasn't that the law failed but we had the wrong Spirit to even accept that law that perfect law so you had a bad nature trying to accept a perfect principles of God it'll never work it'll never work trying to come to church and trying to be this or trying to be that it'll never work we need Jesus first we need his Spirit God is so good cuz he will give you that spirit amen we've heard it many times he's more willing to give it to you than we are to receive it maybe because we have a wall of doubt we got to break it down the Bible it says second Corinthians as I'm closing very um quick message but 2 Corinthians 104-5 it says for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal dressing like a Christian don't make you a Christian on coming to church don't make don't save you so what is it they're Mighty through God pulling down of strongholds a stronghold can be either two things it could be a fortress or it could be walls that you're imprisoned in and here it's talking about strongholds that that that have wrapped around your mind and the only way you can break those is not carnally is not trying to be but it's only through God then you begin to break down those walls that say tries to put up in your mind casting down imaginations cast every single thing every habit everything that that is is binding you cast it away and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity ity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you can win this war there's always going to be a battle out there in your mind but as a thought comes Let It Go an evil thought comes don't feel guilty that it came just cast it out say that's not even mine I don't want that I don't accept those thoughts that's something that that it needs to be instilled in us today we see too many people in depression too many people stuck in their own mind to the point where somebody wants to end their life why because they could not get out of the thoughts that they had there was no way out there was a stronghold but brothers sisters Jesus paved the way for us he made a way so that we can be free and though everything that attacks us it doesn't matter because we are secure safe hid in Christ as long as you're hid in Christ the devil say ah you're not saved I'm not going to even acknowledge that thought oh well this or that oh well look at your family family well look at your condition look at where you're at I don't care what the devil says I don't care what what any thought that is contrary to his word I cast it out every thought that tries to put itself before God I cast it out get every thought and it says bring it into the Captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ take it to Christ some something you have a doubt on something that you're struggling take it to Christ and he'll take control over it let us stand to our feet as the musicians would like to come up as we pray give this service to brother Daniel let us bow our heads and I just want to ask each and every one of us even though maybe we've been serving the lord for 30 plus years or we've just given our heart to the Lord or we've been in and out I just want you to put your mind on Christ right now think about him everything that you're struggling you give it to him and don't doubt say oh well I've tried this before I it never works no believe in Jesus he has power still today he's still the same yesterday today and forever his power has never changed amen you need something from him accept him accept his healing accept his salvation and walk in it once you confess yes Lord I'm saved then walk in that confession amen yes Lord I'm Healed walk in that confession well you you feel the same you act you're acting the same doesn't matter God is going to take control just give it to the Lord whatever it might be whether it's for you personally for your family for work for something spiritual something natural just give it to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we commit ourselves unto you father there's nothing in this world that can put us into our right mind but you father there everything else will will try to throw Band-Aids and and cover things up but Lord you are the one that can give us a heart transplant you said the only people that can go into this kingdom are the ones that are born again those that are changed Lord I I ask for those that are are thirsting for for an experience with you Lord that that you give it to them Father and though maybe they don't feel no sensation yet they believe say this day I stand on your word I stand on what you promised me Lord for those that are not feeling to well those that have family members that are sick Lord father we commit them into your hands with Faith Lord you promised us that by your stripes we are healed father you are obligated to your promises and we stand in your word father any other situation we put it into your hands we ask that you just bless each and every person whatever they're going through father lift up this Church Father Lord that it may be a safe haven not these walls but your spirit father may come down and help each and every person the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and [Music] amen I need it oh [Music] like a river my way and S Rose like sea below [Music] whatever my love thou Hast taught me to say it is well it Is Well with My [Music] Soul those say should buff though Tri should come let this bless Assurance [Music] control that Christ ha regarded my help bless State and ha shed his own blood for my soul oh it Is Well with My Soul Lord thank it is well It Is Well with My Soul amen is it well brothers and sisters with your soul this morning it's a question is it well with the souls that are here this morning is your relationship with Christ is it well I love what our brother said do you appreciate our brother Eli oh what he said about what he said about God and about how that womb is there and in the negative side that we can allow this in and it starts to grow in this womb and eventually it gives birth and it gives birth to sin it gives birth to doubt it gives gives birth to awful things but then brothers and sisters there was something before before the found foundation of the world I was in his thoughts I was in the thoughts of God you were in the thoughts of God and then eventually in the and the world was in the thoughts of God and the universe was in the thoughts of God and then there was a day he said let there be light and there was light and it was manifested those thoughts were manifested and then there was a time when me when I came to the Lord wow and I was in his thoughts and I was in God but there was a time when he said let there be life come from this this man or this boy or this woman or this girl and then it was manifested and it came forward and it can be here today brothers and sisters this could be the day that that womb gives birth to a son or a daughter of God that it becomes real don't let the negatives come in to that womb of your heart as our brother said God chose the heart Satan chose the mind and this battle going on in our mind but there is something over on the other side that Lord I am in you I am I am one of of God's children let it come forth let life come forth if you have on your heart to be baptized today is a good day to do it don't let it pass do you need to be baptized to be saved no do you need to be baptized the the thief on the cross wasn't baptized and he was saved do you need to be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost no Cornelius received the Holy Holy Ghost before he was baptized but do you need to be baptized to be a disciple of Jesus Christ to make that decision Lord I want to serve you I want to represent you here on Earth do you need to be baptized in that for that yes and that's where there is a name associated with baptism it's not it's not baptized in titles there is a name a associated with this because it represents Christ it represents Jesus that's why we are baptized in Jesus name Lord I want to be your disciple here on Earth I want to represent you here on Earth and that's why I want to make this decision to be baptized Romans chapter 6 it says this it says what shall we say then shall we continue you in sin that Grace May abound as our brother was saying here this morning the thing the that that our minds can can Harbor all of this sin but shall we continue in this sin that that Grace May abound we know the Lord is there no God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death we are buried with Christ Christ was Christ died on the cross he was put in the Tomb therefore we go to the Waters of baptism say Lord here I am I am dying to myself I am going to go into these Waters like you went into to the tomb and then I'm going to raise again and it represents the death burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ who is raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life that is baptism now I am a disciple of Christ in front of everyone here I am making this decision I want to be baptized I want a change in my life I want a renewal of the spirit Here I Am Lord and I want to be baptized in your name not in the titles I want to be I want my name Daniel Evans associated with Jesus Christ on that day and on this day I am associated with Jesus Christ today who else here is associated with Jesus Christ I hope every name every hand is up I am with him I am with Jesus Christ if you can take your seats brothers and sisters if there is a desire in your heart to be baptized if you want to make a decision today now is a good time to do it as I said do you have to be baptized to be saved no that's not scriptural do you have to be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost that's not scriptural either but you do need to be baptized to be part of Jesus Christ here on Earth you have to make that decision saying Lord here I am I'm your son and I take on the name of the son of God and I represent him as a disciple of Jesus Christ if the sisters sister uh sister Gara if you would go to the back and the sisters we're going to we're going to have to go to our baptism a little bit different because of the construction if the sisters would meet sister Gara here in the back of the building and if
