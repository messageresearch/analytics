========================================

I um I was talking with my uh my grandmother this morning God bless her she's she's streaming in and she uh she's just you heard the prayer request her nerves were were um just out of out of sorts and just struggling sometimes we get like that and what we don't understand is those things are normal it's it's normal for us to go through these the these fa phases of ups and these phases of downs and there is just something as sister Jessica is saying there is something that's within us that is just crying out to something over on the other side it's something that the Apostle Paul I believe it was he said it's something behind the veil it's something on the other side of the Veil and as when I was thinking about that scripture the other day I was I was thinking what is that really mean Beyond the Veil or on the other side of the veil and it's something that that we go back to the original Temple and there was the holy of holies that was that inner Sanctuary that that Mercy Seat where the Ark of the Covenant was you had the ark was a a wooden box and then on the top of the Ark was what's called called The Mercy Seat with with two cherubims on the top with their with their wings touching on either side and there in that once a year the presence of the Lord would come down and it would just be for that one high priest once a year that would be able to go into there and experience the presence of God and now the Apostle is telling us that he's saying that there is something Beyond the Veil and it's like if you're up against a a curtain or a wall and you put your ear up to it there's something there that's speaking to you and with with this gospel that that the song says come Jesus come there's something in us that just longs to to have that what's behind that Veil have that that voice that's speaking it Lord I want to know you better I need to understand you Lord I it's I'm going to die if I don't have you that longing that we have to that being that Spirit that's over that's over on the other side Psalm 42 says that it's a deep calling to the Deep it's something that that all read it psalm believe it's Psalm 42 Psalm 42:7 says Psalm 426 it says oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore I will remember thee from the land of Jordan and the hermit from the hill of misar deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy wat spouts it's waterfalls all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life do we really know who that God of Our Lives is do we really we all come to church we all call ourselves Christians we all say we're Believers but do we really know that voice that's on the other side of the Veil do we really understand do we really have a relationship with that God that's speaking us to us from the other side brothers and sisters I I believe that he wants us to know him and just as sure as there is a voice over on the other side of the veil and the other side of another dimension calling out to us there is also another voice from Satan that hates us and we'll do anything in his power and he has great power to prevent us from going over there that he's doing everything that he can because he wants our souls and he'll do anything that he can and if he knows that he can't have our souls then he'll try to take our joy he'll try to take our happiness he'll try to ruin our lives just like sister mine was talking the prayer request about about your son and now he wants to do what's right and here comes Satan seeing that and if he can't have the soul he wants the joy he hates us and he's going to do everything that he can to keep us from that Joy of Jesus Christ that love of Jesus Christ in um Jesus's first public sermon the Sermon on the Mount Jesus says some things that really no one had ever heard very very deep teachings and let's turn to Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 and Jesus is still preaching he's he's gone through a a fairly lengthy sermon and now he says some things that are a bit frightening Matthew chapter 7 verse verse 21 it says this not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so not everyone that claims Jesus Christ not everyone that claims that they're a Son of God not everyone that claims those things is going to enter in to that place but only he that does the will of my father is what Jesus is saying many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in that in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in my name Jesus is saying in the name of Jesus Christ they're saying these things and then he's going to say depart from me I never knew you therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and does them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and and it fell not and it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto the foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings that the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes so here's Jesus saying he say and this is his first public sermon and he makes a statement like if you don't do what I say then you're going to be lost and many will come in my name and say have we not cast out devils and done these Mighty works and I'm going to say I never knew you depart from me and then he tells it what he had preached earlier he tells about what things what he was commanding us to do and the people listening to him and they were things that seemed very simple but they were things that I see very very few people on this day doing James chapter 1 verse n verse 19 now James was a follower of Jesus Christ he became the pastor of the church in Jerusalem after Christ had ascended James 1: 19 says this wherefor my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness that means overflowing wickedness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soul Souls be ye doers of the word and not hearers only for if any deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass for behold he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless the widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world so what James is saying he's saying that Jesus taught these things Jesus taught that we should prefer our brother and and and and a few of the things that I'll mention here in a moment and he's saying that don't just be hearers of the word don't just listen to it but you go and you do it and Jesus himself said if you're not going to do what I say you're going to be lost and I'm going to say depart from me you're the work of iniquity you're going to say come before the Lord you're going to say Lord have I not believed you have I not cast out devils in your name have I not done all these things and he's going to say no you didn't do what I told you and then what James is saying here when he says looks in front of a glass James is saying that you are looking in a mirror when you're in church probably and you're looking in this mirror and you're seeing yourself and you're saying Lord I need to improve what the brother was saying and and quoting the Lord Jesus and that I need to improve in my life and then you walk out of the church and as time starts to go by you forget what manner of person you were before and then you go right back into everyday life and the feeling that we might have in church that feeling of condemnation I need to do a better job it leaves and you forget what you looked like verse number 26 it says this I'm going to read the um I'm going to read The New International Version let's start with verse 26 with James 1 says this those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rain on their tongues deceive themselves and their religion is worthless religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless as this to look after the orphans and the widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world it's pretty simple it's as I said we come to church we receive correction we see ourselves in the mirror that we need to do better we go right back to the life of criticism of everything outside of ourselves and then time goes by and all of a sudden you look at yourself and wow I'm the same person I was five years ago I'm the same person I was 10 years ago I'm the same person I was 20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago what in my life has changed why have I not turned a corner and it's because we become complacent in what we believe and we're ignoring ing many times we think that we're great we think that we have this great Revelation and we ignore what Jesus said he said Matthew 5 he said you have heard that it was said the people long ago you shall not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment but I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or a sister will be subject to judgment do we believe that Matthew another one says this in Matthew there for if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you leave your gift there at the altar and first go and be reconciled to them and then come and receive your gift if someone has something against you you are to go to that person if if you've done no no wrong you have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and to for tooth but I tell you don't resist an evil person if anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn it other cheek Also if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt give them your coat as well if anyone forces you to go one mile forces you to go to mile not you're walking and you're greed and you're enjoying it but if anyone forces you to go a mile with them go two miles with them give the one who asks you and don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from from you you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I tell you to love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you this is Jesus Christ God made flesh speaking that you may be children of your father he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and S Reigns on the just on the just and the unjust if you love those who love you what reward will you get are not even the publicans doing that if you greet only your own people what are you doing more than the others don't even the pagans do that some says publicans some translations say publicans some translations say say Gentiles some translations say pagans the one I just read it's Sinners don't the Sinners do that too be perfect therefore even as your Father in Heaven is perfect these are the commandments of Jesus and he says if you are not doing these things my Commandments then when you come before me I'm going to say Department from me you that work iniquity I never knew you these these things right here that well teaching teachings of Jesus and you say well I'm higher than that I understand more I I have we have a much deeper understanding now but we don't the fact is we don't if we're not doing these things that Jesus commanded and he has many other things then we are not being what Jesus commanded us to be and we run the risk of coming him to him in that day and saying Lord I believed your message with all my heart I came to church every Sunday I did this and this and this and he's going to say what you didn't do what I told you to do you had every opportunity to open this book and read the words and read and all the other words and you didn't do them how many of us have we driving on the highway merging in and here comes this guy behind us and he's trying to get us I do it every morning merging on the AA Road under the freeway and inevitably the guy behind me two lanes coming together to get on the highway the guy behind me tries to get in front of me fires me up but bro we can't we got to let them have it what is it going to cost me maybe maybe one second maybe two seconds we're Christians when in our we're in our cars too those things count I use that because it's an easy example for us all to think about it's not just a sister or a brother in church that you might have something against that you're not even going to go to heaven if you don't get it right first by the way that's a promise but it's not just that it's the people that we meet every day and if somebody does us wrong be a Christian about it we want the Deep things let me tell you the Deep things these are the Deep things these are the most important things we look at we look at the Lord there's three there's a beautiful set of three words in the Bible and I believe it's in first John's one of John's Epistles he says this he says God is love that love of God that's there how that it just overflows in all of us who have sinned against him and forsaken him and done all that we've had and that we've done in our lives and he just loves us more and loves us more and takes care of us because he knows that one day this is my child and he's going to repent and we need to have the same Spirit as him and we need to build this foundation on a solid rock and that rock is this word and the revelation of this word and that's where we need to build our house on of this life and if we build it on something else that house is going to fail as I read Lord Jesus saying let me tell you about we're going through the Book of Daniel and we we just finished up brother L is going to give us a summary on Wednesday but let me tell you a story in This Book of Daniel that shows a perfect example of a man who had a weak foundation and then God brought him around gave him some character and gave him a strong Foundation was one of the greatest testimonies in the Bible and it's not even one in the lineage of God's people it's a king and not just a king one of the evilest kings that we have ever seen one of the most ruthless kings that had one of the worst tempers one of the most um narcissistic kings that you'll ever read and that's this man Nebuchadnezzar what an awful person he was Nebuchadnezzar didn't have a foundation in his life but there was some good in the man and what he did is he has this bad dream he hears about this Prophet named Daniel Daniel comes and interprets this dream to Nebuchadnezzar and not only interprets the dream but tells him his dream so then Nebuchadnezzar sees that this man is something this man is great so what he does is in the very next chapter he builds this giant statue of gold and he tells the people to Fall Down and Worship this statue maybe like he was like he was doing because of where the it lays in the scripture and because of the things that Nebuchadnezzar said it's very obvious that this statue that was built up in the plane was a statue of the Prophet Daniel brother brandom said the same thing that it was so he builds this statue and he says now when you hear this sound you fall down and everybody here you fall down and you worship this statue like I am and he lifts this statue up to a Godlike thing because Nebuchadnezzar didn't have an understanding he didn't have that um that that strong Foundation of God so he builds this up he's happy everything's going good so there's these three young men Daniel wasn't forced to worship the statue because it was a statue of himself of course he wouldn't have to but there were three young men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who had a strong Foundation so when they were forced to worship this statue they said I'm not go we are not going to do it we would rather die than to worship anything but our God they had a firm foundation so Nebuchadnezzar loses his temper gets all fired up we know the story fired up he fired up the the furnace seven times hotter and he takes Shadrach meach and abedo and he says now you all we're going to throw you in there if you won't recant if you won't worship the statue they say no God's able to deliver us but even if he doesn't Deliver us we're still going to worship God and if God changes your life even if times get hard you're gonna say even if my life is ruined I'm still going to worship God and that's that's the attitude that these young men had he gets them there they throw them in the furnace this big flame comes out of the furnace and it it kills the soldiers that are with them Shad um Nebuchadnezzar looks into this Burning fiery furnace that was used probably to melt metal and it was seven times hotter than normal and he sees four people walking in there and he says hey didn't you put three like yeah well there's a fourth one in there and then the Gentile says Ah he looks like the Son of God how he knew that I don't understand right but he had that Revelation there was something good about about that man so he goes and he pulls him out and he says this Daniel chapter 3 verse 27 and the princes and the governors and the captains and the Kings and the counselors began to gather together and they saw those men upon whose whose body fire had no power nor was a hair of their head singed neither was their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo who have sent his Angel and delivered his servants and trusted them and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God therefore I make it agree that every people nation and language would speak anything against the Miss against the god of Shadrach mhach and abedo he still isn't there yet he still doesn't have that Foundation it's this other God it's this God of these great men that did great things the God of this Daniel and he was giving reverence to this God and not knowing that he had not accepted that God himself his foundation was weak that's why he's saying it's their God because he didn't know him and how many times do what us all of us we say oh it's the God of this great man or this man did these great things or our pastor does this or priest does this or whoever it is does this these great miraculous things he knew God but Nebuchadnezzar and US often we don't know the same God but instead we put it on someone else and truly do not know him we know he did great things we know he's powerful beyond measure but do we know him do we know that voice that's on the other side of that Veil therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language would speak anything aiss against the god of Shadrach mesach and abedo shall be cut into pieces and their houses shall be made a dungill because there is no other God that can deliver after this sword then the king promot did Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon so he knew that there was something powerful and he believed he said a decree he was like this their God is true but he didn't know that God himself he did not understand that he his foundation needs to be built on that God and not just rely on the foundation of these other people so then he goes on in the next chapter and he has a dream and this dream is about very very it's it's a very hard dream same man Daniel comes and interprets the dream he tells him he says Nebuchadnezzar he says you're going to lose you're going to lose everything he says you're going to be like a beast in the field so then Nebuchadnezzar some time passed and then he's out and he's looking out across this great Babylon the king and he says look at this Babylon which I have built and his pride welled up in him and this then the prophecy that had come forth the interpretation of the Dream came forth and right at that moment because that Pride welled up in him because he didn't understand that he didn't have that Foundation that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego had that Daniel had because he didn't have that he fell and it was the grace of God that he fell he lost his mind went out into the field for seven years he was there his Nails grew out long crawled around like a cow slept in the field woke up in the morning and the Dew was on his back his hair got really long men crazy can you imagine what the people said can you imagine how embarrassing it was to him this was Nebuchadnezzar our great king and he's out there eating grass and and and out of his mind for seven years and then what was going on I believe is God was building that foundation not on Sand but God tore him down so that that Foundation could be rebuilt and built upon a rock Nebuchadnezzar then his mind was restored to him and then he had the honor of being the only Gentile King and and really probably the only Gentile that has his own chapter dedicated to him in the Bible and it's his testimony it's testimony of how I failed and how I how I pride welled up in me and yet God had mercy on me let's go to Daniel 4 we'll start with verse 29 this is the king talking this is Nebuchadnezzar giving his whole his own testimony he speaks in third person because a lot of the Kings used to do that Daniel 4:29 says this at the end of 12 months he walked into the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon the king spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for my for the house of the Kingdom by the might and of my power and for the honor of my Majesty while the world was in the king while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy TW Dwelling Place will be the beasts of the field he's giving his testimony about this is what happened to me and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times seven years shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high rule in the Kingdom of men and giveth to whom he whosoever he will the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from all men and did eat grass and his body was wet with the de of Heaven till his hairs were grown out like e eagle feathers and his nails were like Bird's Claws and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven now brothers and sisters it's no longer the god of Shadrach mesach and abedo it's no longer the god of Daniel it's no longer the god of Paul it's no longer the God of this Prophet or that Prophet or the god of brother brandom or the god of anything it's no longer that I lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding returned unto me and I blessed the most high and I praised and honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to [Music] generation and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say to him what doest thou and at the same time my reason return to me and for the glory of my kingdom my honor and brightness return to me and my counselors and my lord lord sought unto me and I was established in my kingdom and an excellent Majesty was added to me now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of Heaven no more another one no more there's many there's multiple of them now I honor the one true God because in those Hard Times those past seven years none of us have gone through something like that he learned who God was he learned to trust God and his ways and his judgments and to those that walk he said now I Nebuchadnezzar praised and extolled and honor the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abas he was Nebuchadnezzar now is testifying now I have this Foundation now I know that there's one this one true God and now I have a relationship with him and everything was restored to this man but he couldn't see it before he couldn't see he gave honor to this God because he had seen his miracles and he had seen his servants he gave honor to him but he didn't know him himself his foundation was sand and it fell the house got destroyed and out into the field he goes and then rebuilding this Foundation he comes back and now he there's only one God and I know him now my brother he said tell me we talk about the Lord and and there's Nebuchadnezzar couldn't see the importance of knowing this one God he didn't understand and my brother used to say like a blind man you can put up two fingers and say how many fingers am I holding up four no how many fingers am I holding up two no how many fingers am I holding up 14 no he doesn't understand he can't see and no matter how mad you get at him no matter how upset you get the man can't see because he's blind those scales need to come off of our eyes and we have to admit like Nebuchadnezzar did humble ourselves Lord take this blindness away help me to serve you help me to understand Lord let me let me know you better like this man did like these men in the Bible these women in the Bible Lord let me know you better because I don't know you all I know is a church or all I know is a Creed or an idea I need to know you all of us everyone under this roof needs to have that attitude because we're not there we are not what we should be we should be better and then there's times that the Lord like this man Nebuchadnezzar there's times when the Lord will let us if we are his child he'll let us fall and let us come to complete ruin to show us that your foundation is wrong and then build it back up and I wondered I always wondered I've seen people fall into sin I always wondered why why do some humble themselves and come back and others just fly away there's two stories I'll tell there was a man that I knew that he's married and children and uh his nephew had a girlfriend and so he allowed this girl to come they allowed the girl to come stay in their house well he ends up having an affair with this young lady ruining his marriage ruining his life and he goes and he says instead of repenting to his wife instead of making it right this was his opportunity to leave and to live a life of sin so then now he's free so now he starts going to the bars starts drinking starts running around the guy's in his was in his mid-40s starts starts just doing terrible things ends up just being a a total nothing and loving sin and even and and then he became he turned against the faith that he was raised in he he didn't just turn against the message of brother Brandon he turned against it all he left the whole Faith to serve himself I look at that that man and I I I think why because that sin was in you you never had a foundation you grew up in all this but it was never built strong you sinned you made a mistake terrible mistake but you made a mistake now what are you going to do about it and that's so often with us we'll make a mistake we'll do something wrong and then what proves it doesn't prove that we're not a Christian what proves if we're a Christian or not is what we do about our mistakes is if we can get up and then we can serve God and say I failed I messed up I want to read a testimony of my grandpa PA's cousin and uh I think you'll enjoy it and let me this is another person that did the same thing that made the same mistake but he had a foundation in his life and he turned his life around he was allowed to sin if you could put up the the quote brother the bram's telling this story he says this brother Ram says I was sitting in a room and I had to hurry out there my wife said now get to this little girl this or this little woman she had two or three little children and I walked in where she was and the only thing I the only the only thing I'd seen her these couple times just know that she belonged to the Methodist Church Main Street Methodist Church in New Albany and she was sitting there holding her hands like this and she said and I said what's the matter sis brother brandom had prayed for her in a prayer line earlier um not that day but sometime earlier and it didn't work and she was terrible with her nerves she was she was losing her mind and she said oh I don't know brother brandom she said I guess I'm just crazy and I said I don't think so you don't talk like a crazy person to me so I had her to get up and and stretch different you see and till I could get her off of that thought I said let's take a little trip and let's go back before the world began let's watch the world come into existence before God had made his first star and so forth like that so he starts preaching Jesus he starts preaching God to her to calm her mind and to raise her faith in a few moments I felt the angel of the Lord pulling me into this Channel and when it did I seen a little black car running like that right across my room and said were you ever in an accident she said no sir see now on a platform I have prayed for her and let her go on see but I had I had her before me and I watched again just a minute the first thing you know here it come I seen a vision break then come right straight in it caught me no way of getting away from it then I said I see a little car you're sitting by a blond-headed man and there's an automobile coming you pass it and there's a big light it's a train and there went the vision she let out a scream and jumped out under the floor and fainted so the vision went on and here it was when she got married just before her husband went overseas just a few weeks she was a young woman he went to war and he went overseas her being a just girl she started running around being Lonesome and she started running around with another man and she went out in a little car with him one night and lived untrue to her marriage vows and on the road home was almost killed by a train told her all about that what she did and then when she raised her up in the floor she began screaming to the top of her voice wife came in there and said why what's the matter she said oh brother brandom don't you tell nobody I said I thought you told me you were a Christian she said I am she said I've confessed that to God years ago I said it wasn't God you sinned against it was your husband your marriage vow you was a married woman I I said you'll have to go and make that right with your husband if you ever if you ever get well she Saidi can't do it it'll break up our home she said' I've got three children and she said my husband would leave me I said now lady I've done all I can do she said you know there I said you know there isn't a psychiatrist in the world that could pull that out of you that's way back in the Gable end of your soul you're just subconsciously think of it so you got yourself in that condition I said' that's the whole thing now there is the truth and and you know it's the truth there's no person in the world but you that you that man and me that knows this now she said that's right but said I just couldn't make it right I said well now that's all I can do she said oh you're going to leave he said yes ma I said yes ma'am

I'll just die I just started just started like that and I happened to look around and seen something forming by the side of her and looked and there stood a blackheaded man combed his hair over kind of sideways kind of wavy a little older than she was I said is your husband a black-headed man she said yes sir I said kind of tall yes sir I said isn't he a deacon in the church she said yes sir I said he works for a chevolet company doesn't he she said yes yes sir I said he has the same thing to confess to you no wonder brother Johnson can't have a Revival brother Johnson was their Pastor in the Methodist Church no wonder you can't have a Revival no wonder the spirit of the Lord won't won't move in the congregation there's sin I said look at here I said your husband when he landed in France he had taken a girl and told her what he did and said now there's a woman works in the office and she was wearing a pink dress and she was in a Green Chevrolet car no more than three days ago and he's guilty of the same thing she said no not my husband and I said well you all better get things right you better call them up so me got to talking to her and persuaded her to do it and she went and called her husband they got in the car and met on the road she got in his car and she said now I want to tell you and she confessed all to him and he was looking at her and said now didn't you want to go out with this woman at the office there two or three days before that and you were in a Green Chevrolet car and she was wearing p a pink he said how did you know that where have you been and so she told her so she told her so she told her where where it been he said honey that's the truth and I will admit it's the truth and if you'll forgive me I will forgive you and will raise our children and start a life right in a few minutes here they come back up the steps tears streaming down their cheeks aha Satan lost his hold then see now there's where it's at see now that settled but as long as that sin was under there no matter how loud you scream or how hard you stomp or how much oil you pour on or how loud you pray or how easy you pray or whatever you do the devil will stay right there because there he has a legal right as long as you have unconfessed sin that's right that was my grandfather's cousin who I used to talk to on the phone and he never wanted to talk about that he said no he he says I'll talk about my Ministry he said but I won't talk about that that's personal it's family Things Not only was he a deacon in the church but he also became pastor of the church and had a great ministry in the New Albany area he had when he was faced with sin and he had fallen he had that foundation and he made it right and the other one didn't two foundations one fell and one stood strong closing turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 remember Nebuchadnezzar looking at the other holy man looking at Daniel or Shadrach mhach and abedo and saying their God and I follow that their God but it needed to become Nebuchadnezzar's God 1 Corinthians chapter 3 says this and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ he says I fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you these are the people that sat in the book in the church with their notebooks listening to the Apostle Paul the man with the greatest revelation of Jesus Christ on Earth at that time the man that pinned most of the New Testament the man that solidified the deity of Jesus Christ he was the greatest of them all and and here they were they were the ones listening to Paul and Paul says I fed you with milk because you couldn't stand meat he's telling them that you still aren't able to for you are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and striving and divisions are you not yet carnal and walk as men for while one says I am of Paul and another I am of apollis are you not carnal for saying that I follow this man I follow that man remember this is the greatest man besides Jesus in the New Testament in my opinion speaking and he's saying you're you're carnal because you're saying you're following me who then is Paul and who then is apoll but ministers by whom you have believed even as the lord gave to every man English Standard Version says what then is apollis and what is Paul servants through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each the only thing we are is a vessel through which you believed the first church age messenger the messenger the Ephesian Agee the one who was present when the white horse rider started writing all of these deep things in Revelation he's saying that my only role is to be a servant through whom you have believed that doesn't lessen himself that lifts up Christ I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase there should be no division never division between any church any so-called Christian church or any denomination or anyone who claims Jesus Christ and I'm not talking about local churches I'm talking about any church that calls themselves Christians there should be no no division because our job is only to introduce someone to Christ as Paul said listen I'm nothing my job is to introduce you to Christ and so's Apollos over here so then neither is he that planteth any anything neither is he that WTH but God gave the God but God that giveth the increase he's saying I'm nothing other people elevated him to a god I believe it was on Mars Hill like they like Daniel elevated neb or Nebuchadnezzar elevated Daniel to a god a God is infallible and that's what makes him a god now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own according to his own labor for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry that's a field you are God's Building so you're God's field field and you are God's Building he's building this foundation in you according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the the foundation and another build it there on but let every man take heed how he builds there on so the Apostle Paul he's built the foundation just as a concrete mason will will pour the slab and you got to have your subgrade right you got to have all your compaction right you got have your Steel in your in your concrete and you build that and then the the framers come in and they build the house but imagine if they built the house and it didn't fit the slab imagine if you're putting the 2x4s over in the gravel beside the beside the concrete it won't work but you build upon that Foundation that was laid for other Foundation can no man lay than is laid which is Christ Jesus that is the foundation let's skip to verse 18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seems be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise how many arrogant and prideful people would say I know I'm right I know I'm right I know this is the truth and nobody can tell me any different that was Nebuchadnezzar the Gentile Paul's saying and it's probably offending n90 90% of the people he's writing to in that Corinthian Church he's saying don't deceive yourself you may think you got it but it's foolishness for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men as Nebuchadnezzar did for all things are yours what matters is Christ and he's about to say what matters whether Paul Paul or Apollos or sephus really three of the greatest men in the whole new testament sephus is Peter whether Paul or Apollos of sephus or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours if you have that foundation and you're Christ and Christ is God's I say it a lot musicians can come a close there is nothing that matters in life other than introducing someone to that Foundation Building that Foundation which is Christ really the greatest of them all the Apostle here he says I'm nothing but I'm just a tool in God's hand to introduce you to Jesus Christ we see the two men the one his name is Wilber Shane um which is is my U my grandpa's cousin uh cousin-in-law and then this other man and we see one took the opportunity to run away and that house failed the other one as humbled as he was and as low as he got he humbled himself and then God restored him not only to be a deacon but God restored him so much that he eventually became a minister and led a church for many years became a wonderful man and that's us we fail we mess up but let that be the foundation that we're building and that Foundation Let It Be Christ and not some other man not somebody else not a pastor as I said not you got to have your own you got to have your own relationship there amen and the good way to start that Foundation is to be baptized according to this Bible according to acts 238 according to the Book of Romans where we go into that water and we are making a public confession that now I accept this man Jesus Christ I want to take on his name name I want to be part of him I want to be one of these Christians that this Bible talks about I want to be one of those people I'm going to go into this water I'm going to be baptized I'm going to be put underwater I'm going to come back up and that represents a sinner that is me being washed clean by the death of Jesus Christ that's what baptism means that's why it says Washed by the Water of the word that's why it says that we were we were dead in the Book of Romans we were we were dead and we went into the grave and we came back up a new creature that's what baptism is we take on the name we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ because we want to be associated with him Christian you're not being baptized into a church you're being baptized into a body into a body of Christians so when you are baptized and there is someone else who believes in Jesus Christ there is someone else who has also taken on this name you are Brethren it makes you a brother it makes it makes you a Christ it doesn't make you a Christian it shows that you're a Christian when you're baptized and it shows that I believe in the blood of Jesus Christ that will wash away my sins and that Foundation gets built and nothing nothing will hinder that Foundation if it's strong and it's in Christ if it's built on the words of a man if it's built on if it's built on your mother if it's built on your father if it's built on your grandmother if it's built on anything else but Jesus Christ it'll fail but if it is built on him it'll always stand strong and let me tell you something you can live your life studying him and studying his word and you can't even scratch the surface of how great he is you can't even scratch the surface of the love that that man had and the love that he still has you can't and he is always willing to take you back brother Manny can 43 years man and he chose him at 50 years old to deliver deliver I remember I was reading my Bible one time I was really down it just made a big decision in my life and I opened up the Bible to the book of Acts I was repenting really down and I I looked and it said Saul Saul why persecute us without me it's hard for you to kick against the pricks I said Lord I just don't understand that what does it mean the Lord directed my my eyes over to the margin and it and explain what the Pricks was it was actually a a tool used to prod cattle and then the Lord showed me this is what I've always done to you I've always tried to get you to move in this direction but because of your head strongness you always kick back at me and it took just cleaning the Slate until he was finally able to deal with me and push me in the direction that he wanted me to go and that's the Apostle Paul here he had his religion he had his his rules he had his his Torah he had his understanding and it was not right and here he Paul is and he's kicking and kicking and kicking and persecuting and persecuting and persec finally the Lord put him on his back and says why do you persecute me and he didn't know he says I thought I was doing right but he wasn't doing right he was sinning and every time he would sin God had give him a poke and he says who are you Lord and he says I'm Jesus the one that you're persecuting and then Paul went and was baptized it's a good first step brother if you want to go if there's anybody else to be baptized just go back and and see the the brothers in the back the if there's a sister that you can see the sisters in the back and then we'll bring you up and and baptize you as I said it's a good time to build a foundation [Music] Josiah Jesus at the center of it all [Music] Jesus at the center of it all from beginning to the end it'll always be it's always been you Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus at

getting feedback up here there we go it's nice that um I mentioned that scripture that I have planted apollis watered but God gave the increase so what happened was come on in you're Christian right here so what happened was our young brother here was you're at a youth camp am I right he's at a youth camp and you're driving home from uh from the camp from the church camp and the pastor was talking to him about being baptized and it Spurs something in his heart the Bible says that in Acts chapter 2 it said that Peter preached those words and they were cut in their hearts and then they asked they said what must we do to receive the Holy Spirit and Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what happened to our brother here the the pastor was witnessing to him and it cut his heart and he felt that he wants to be baptized and take on this name of Jesus Christ am I right say something you believe in the Lord Jesus yeah to chur Christian what's your last name Christian can't say loud enough but um brothers and sisters this young man wants to serve God he was witnessed to seed was planted water the seed sister ala you watch it grow going to be he's going to have a wonderful life hold my hand right here a Christian by your own confession I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] brothers and sisters God bless you appreciate as always seeing a soul coming to be baptized in these Waters is something that's very scriptural and it's a glorious day as I said on Wednesday night that um the angels in heaven are rejoicing when one person comes and is baptized like this and we Rejoice also with the angels sister Alba and family I believe that up up in the in the in the Realms that are not known there is a jubilee going on that another Soul has come to Christ God bless you brothers and sisters I I just say up here uh remember
