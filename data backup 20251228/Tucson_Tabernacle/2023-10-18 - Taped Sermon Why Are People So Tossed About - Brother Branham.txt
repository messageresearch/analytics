amen I read that today and I said I just want to share that we and ourselves have no good to offer but in thy light I receive my light and I appreciate that from the Lord so we have some prayer requests and then tonight we'll be listening to the second half of why people are so tossed about so and those you've you've heard and youve followed through I'm brother Billy Paul I check for an update today I didn't see any updates but continue to remember brother Billy Paul and the whole family and the whole family of God because of of who brother Billy Paul is so and then some of you have may may have heard but Brother Don Reagan's daughter um Erica Parker passed away and she left four daughters my daughter Elizabeth um I believe knew her with friends and she said uh she's probably in her early 40s so let's remember the the brother Donnie Reagan and the family and the church and all those affected that by that brother Bobby figurella Jr was supposed to be going in for some MRIs they found some more spots let's remember remember him my brother-in-law Nathan he had been with us here a few months back we prayed for him but he has gotten quite sick they had to do a lot of surgeries they told him they were going to probably have have to amputate his leg but they were able to say that he's right about 60 years old pray that God turns his heart back to to him so um my daughter Sarah she says the is has been helping her a lot she's been able to eat better but now it's giving her some severe headaches and and the nerves and has been in a lot of pain but our God Is A Healer she saw the you heard her testimony the other day even her new doctor say you're nothing but a miracle and about 5 years ago the another doctor told her you're nothing but a miracle and hey we serve a miracle working God so my older brother Fred we saw saw him on Sunday they were having the lunch same place we did and he had had that esophagus C cancer and they removed his esophagus Al together take the stomach and tie it up here it's how they do that so when you start eating you start digesting so sometimes it gives them and he told my dad he had been in some pain so again we pray for them but we ask God to get a hold of them and to turn them back to him so and then also let's remember our pastor brother Daniel as he's down in Mexico till through this weekend and I know that while he's there in talking with him it's he's not out by the beach having a good time that's not brother Daniel he studies he he he seeks the Lord and and he prays for us all so if you'll stand with me we know that all things are possible I'll testify that I know that all things are possible we work has slowed down quite a bit and today there's only 4 hours of work and so you know but I know a God who could take a penny and do a whole more a lot more than it can do I can do with a million he's able to multiply he's able to do so our confidence is in him let's just pray Lord we we commit these prayer requests these these folks these families our brother Billy Paul brother Donnie Reagan's the family that is left Lord in the passing of a daughter and a mother Lord and to each one Lord that has a need and every hand that is raised saying Lord I need I need more of you so Lord we commit every one of these requests to you every desire Lord but mostly a desire to just draw closer to you Lord as we see what's happening today in this world and how much there's so much fear and so much anger and there's so much frustration but Lord you said you wouldd watch over us you would keep us Lord as you've protected Israel through all these years Lord because Lord you watch over your children Lord so we commit the rest of this service as we listen to the the second half of this message why people are so tossed about Lord but our anchor is in you Lord we commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen As we sing only believe the the second hand only be [Music] only be all things are possible [Music] only only be only be all things are possible only now your confession is oh Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you you may be seated for all things was given to Christ all that God was B into Christ was poured into the church that day you that I your father father all the privilege that the believer has they only could accept it said brother R you've got a picture here under consideration but how do you get to it that's the next thing how do we get into there brother brand here's the way they come and the pattern oh I'm a Christian brother brand I've been saved I've been baptized I enjoy the blessings of God you're in now outer of course but say day I I am my ups and downs my worries my toss my tumbles I wish I could live a Victorious Life well you've got to get out of the Court you got to come in now what was the first thing the courts represented justification outside there was where the people come in all Israel no other but a circumcised Israelite and come into those courts the defil you remember when they Paul brought Timothy to the temple and said they polluted this holy place by bringing the Gentile in in the courts they must be absolutely Justified people regenerated men and women who accepted God and God eternal life dwelling in them they must be that to be in the courts then they come to the first Altar and the first altars where they burnt the sacrifice and where the Lord met them there in forgiveness of sins and cleansed them from all their unrighteousness and the burning alar the brazing altar burnt the Beast and the blood from the Beast that was the second court and now as they left that second Court sanctification they entered into this consecrated life entered into the presence of God and while they were in there there were they had all these glorious things it was very beautiful type that in there and anything dead come in lived again did you ever think of that they took Aaron's rod and laid Aaron's rod in the presence of this holy place and when they did in one night's time amen it bued Blossom and yielded Alm in one night's time think of it in the presence of God this old dead Rod laying there in the presence of God bed Blossom and yielded arms in one night what was it then what kind of Rod was it it was an Alm tree rod that's where You' taken it from the stick was off of an Alm tree and you are a stick Sun kind and you're you was taken over the branch of humanity which was God's created son in the beginning you may be fallen dead alienated from God but by that in creation you were created to be a Son of God Amen you may bounce around and be respected and honored out here in the courts but if you ever get into that glorious place and hid away with God you yield what you're supposed to do take a dead sinner alienated from God without hope without Christ and put him in the presence of God in this great glorious Tabernacle in there he will yield forth fruit of the the Holy Spirit love joy peace long suffering the dead Rod buted him for but it had to have Refreshments had to be refreshed the nature was refreshed it the for it had to have a it brought forth an odor a perfume the blossom then the next thing it brought forth was fruit and every Christian comes the same way when he comes into the presence of God first he has to be refreshed the Holy Spirit has to take a hold of the man and renew him and make him another person thank you Lord the Holy Ghost comes in just the Freshman the Holy Ghost comes in the quiet of the hour you know you go out of the morning real early when the de is on the ground the D Falls just before daylight usually sometime in the night and the hustle and bustle of the world is gone to bed after everything's asleep did you ever go out early in the morning and you go out early and see how everything's so fresh just real fresh early in the morning why the old Earth has been hit away for a while and it's refreshed and did you ever come in the presence of a man or a woman who had hid themselves away from the world it's a refreshening to talk to them they refresh themselves they begin to come to alive and you ever going to the Rose Garden early in the morning or up and down the highway here real early when the de is on the ground and it holds that odor of the honeysuckles and so forth the Locust blossoms je just like a Christian who's hid himself away with God in the Stillness of the night or some word come forth the next day with a fres a notor life a pleasant place to be somebody you like to talk to somebody that can encourage you somebody you got confidence in your neighbor over there how you love to talk with her see that's the freshest the oldest and the next thing it yields fruit and everywhere the Holy Spirit comes that always plants the seed of God and yields fruit another great thing of entering into this place is a place where you can have confidence you can believe here's a woman laying here stretched on a stretcher this morning in a serious condition well if God doesn't touch her she'll die she's age she's an old mother gray hair wearing Glass is very Godly looking person I shook her hand talked to her a few words a few moments ago want to come in now she's laying here perhaps her doctors done all he knows how to do but he can't do no more and she's fallen and the ankle and ribs and so forth and a complication things she told me which was wrong with her and things that she didn't know also but There She lays in that kind of a state well being in that kind of a condition and tore up like that now what can we do for her is to bring her in the Blessed presence of the alls sufficient refreshing Holy Ghost amen that can take this tailess away from her as a doctor V good as he could be trying to tell her that maybe there's nothing more I can do but we lift her into this place amen well you're old when your days are about spent that didn't mean one thing to Abraham when he come into the presence of God at 100 years old he believed God and considered not his own body now dead but he was in The Presence of Jehovah who promised me Hallelujah yes that's a lady only in the seat dying with a cancer sure to die nothing else left but to die if we can only get her nobody LED Aaron in Aaron walked in because he was invited in because it was told to him by Jehovah he had the rights to go in amen when Jesus died in Calvary he ripped the veil from top to Bott to give not only high priest but to everyone that comes approaching God has a right into the holiest of holies she has a right the lady here dying has a right here sits Mrs Weaver somewhere sitting over here dying with cancer a few years ago eat up little bit of arms she had a right to the tree of life she had a lot of right to come in behind the veil and when I had to hold her from reeling from one side to the other I baptized her in water right here hallelujah she lives today because she had a right she accepted him believed it and I think somewhere to building in the back I see Mr Morgan perhaps Mrs margan sitting there that sit right here on this seat holding her up dying with cancer no hopes far but Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and we brought her out of that stale condition where our husband told me was setting present now that he played golf with the doctor and he said the cancer wrapped around her intestine s like a tree roots all H is gone but the Holy Ghost amen brought her into the presence to the refreshing and brought her behind the veil dropped the curtain behind her don't care what the doctor says no matter what anybody says the veil dropped and shut off every unbeliever thank and she reached over the Golden pot of God and said by his stripes I am healed and she started eating it the next morning it was still there to eat the next day was still there to eat that's it not look around wait till it falls again to the next Revival but it's Everlasting Eternal sitting there waiting and she's still eating from the same pot a man what was it getting her into the refreshing get the veil dropped around her so she won't listen to what the world says but listen to What God Says amen go in by by the blood go in by the anointing anointed walk right live right hold your head right until you enter this court I don't say any man does this that or the other how you're a baptizer which way this way what church you belong to God by Sovereign Grace gives the Holy Ghost to them he desires to amen that's why these people they walk humbly before God God by Grace give the Holy Spirit they live where they live they're consecrated they love the Lord they believe in they living every way every day in his presence no matter what comes or go where the river Rises or where the clouds are hanging low no matter what it is they're still living in the presence of the game what is it all you wasn't heal that's just to make believe the veils drop they don't even hear it they're in there coming to life amen Ying buds talk to him a little while you'll see there's an order of Saint about them their conversations is season with salt not talking about their neighbor or trying to fuss about something's been done this way or that way but their conversations of Christ and His glory that's where they're living yielding freshness yielding the orders of the new life of the Blossom and bringing forth fruit every day other saying you know I know she was healed I know he was healed then why can't I be healed certainly you can brother only thing is get the anointing of the Holy Spirit what is it brother B take God at his word for by faith are you saved and that's through Grace and not by works no midal motions no stir up no speaking with tongue no shouting no nothing by faith walk into the presence of God say Lord God I come solely on the of your word and I believe you you say brother brand would you believe in shouting speaking in tongues yes sir but you're putting the C before the horse come to Christ first come to Christ first let the Holy Spirit just take you over start eating from the Mana that it's good today it's good tomorrow it's good all the time every day I want you to notice another thing about this The Peculiar of the light the believer walks in when he's in Christ peculiarity of it now the three courts the Justified man out he he walk by daylight someday you have gloomy days you get it I see this God bless you some days are gloomy some days you wonder where it's really worthwhile to serve God or not you're walking in the outer of course sure you're eating Mana sure you are a Believer sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven truly well what kind of life are you living every day old guy oh I got my dinner for today I told him about it I cussed him out I could never God for me sure he will certainly he will you're a child but what kind of Life are you live my don't you hate to live that kind of life up and down the struggl in a pool day at night back sliding back to church back sliding back to church this that apologize for this over here this other fellow is moving right along than see what kind of Lights he walking in according to the weather it'd give the light outside the gloomy the foggy the halfway then a bright day then a gloomy a Fogg and a cloud over the sun that's the way the regenerated Justified man lives is that's right that's all the light he has to walk in when he's just walking by that he said I come to Christ brother Brown I join the church I put my name on the book I I'm trying to live the best I can well bless your heart brother I appreciate that God appreciates that if you believe he that Hearth my words and Believe on him and sent me has everlasting life you're my brother I love you but oh brother BR my ups and down oh I'm the most miserable person I have to fight every day oh but that's where you're walking that's all right then said well I want to go a little deeper well he comes into the court now what's in there there's seven golden candlesticks by the holy place and it's given life the candlesticks are given light that's to the man who quits his drinking quits his smoking quits lying quits stealing prats his neighbor right good to his wife or her good to her husb husband the same way man or woman the believer he's come into a place where he's quit all of his meanness which is through the blood with sanctification he's called to a new light and he walks in there he don't have to walk by that light out there he's got a better light he's walking by the light of seven golden candlesticks which is burning olive oil and the olive oil was representing the Holy Spirit the fire was the baptism which BR baptized you even baptized out in there with the Holy Spirit but you're not here away yet you're not behind the veil here he is he's walking in these seven golden candlesticks there's many light much light in there but there's days when them lights get dull there's days when them LS smoke and the light's not so good there's times when them lights have to be relit again and you have to borrow a little from the neighbor to Light One Candle to the other one it's still not a good light where thankful for but it's still not the right right brother see it it's still not the right life you say brother I've spoken tongues I've shouted good wonderful but let me tell you something different all right he's walking in this light it's an artificial light it's not the light of the Sun the light of the moon the stars the man in the justifi of course when Night comes he has a very dim light just the Stars maybe a Pale Moon a lot of flying clouds he's in awful face but the man up here at the altar who keeps himself under Consecration and says Lord I I'm going to live right by you I'm the Deacon in the church or something other I'm going to live good to my neighbor I'm going to try my best to do better lord well he's living in a better life his lights sell them go out but they do smoke up and they have to light one for from the other but the man who walks beyond that and goes in when the world is shut off when the veil drops around him amen Down Under the Locking of the wings of the Chan the great Shina Glory hung under there it never got them it never went out and the man who lives in the presence about under the veil lives in the Shak Glory I don't care if the storms are raging where the clouds of the Moon don't shine and the Stars don't shine where the candlesticks goes out that doesn't matter he's living in the shakana glory and under the power of the Holy Ghost it didn't go out at night it didn't go it's kind of a kind of a Mystic line kind of a soft glowing light and the believer at rest walk through around inside the veil this sh kind of Glory where the pot of Mana was where he eat daily never get out he eat from the Mana oh he had not old worry in the world everything was taken care of God was over him listening to him pray answering his prayer not only that but he's living right in the presence of the king God in the sh Glory every time anything would start up like that it couldn't get to him he wouldn't listen to it he couldn't the wines of the world was on the outside if you ever come into Christ my friend every into a place where the world is dead where the whole whether your children are this or whether your mother's this whether your daddy said this whether your pastor said that whether the doctor said this or that you don't even hear it you live only in the sh Glory walking and living in the Pres presence of the king every day is sweet in your soul my all is well all is well there's nothing can harm you oh what a place oh I think of that little song I've crossed the Riven Veil Hallelujah to his name I'm living in the presence of the king living cross the rid veils where the glories never fail I'm living in the presence of the king I'm walking in the light the beautiful light come where the D Drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world thank you Lord thank let him hide himself and let me lose myself and find it Lord in the let all self be crucified let my neighbor gossip let the this that of the other be gone I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence I have moved in there Lord I never desire to leave again I trust your word what you say there's where I want to be drop the veils around me Lord and I can only see Jesus alone and live and walk and die in him there you are on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus stood transfigured before the apostles when they looked up they seen just Jesus alone they said they seen Jesus only standing there oh God hide me in that place hide me or in that place or other veils will dropping I see nothing but Jesus himself I don't want to hear the Fantastics of the world I don't care where they got atomic bomb or they got a Jet Plane where the new Chets look better than the Buicks it doesn't matter the thing of it is I'm walking and living with Christ daily to have pself and the veils are dropped around and I am and he and he and me that the storms rage my anchor holdes within the veil can't tell you why we have a lot of storms on the seas in these days but I'm thankful for an anchor that holds steadfast within the veil when she are rocking and look like every Moon would Center to the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil I've anchored in the veil I've Anchored In Jesus the storms of life I'll Brave I've Anchored In Jesus I fear the Wonder wave I've Anchored In Jesus for he has power to save I've anchored in the Rock of Ages God help us this morning to enter into that inner life quit staying out here where you're tossed about by every wind of Doctrine every little thing comes along and don't you know the Bible says in the last days and how man will come and be like angels of light in the last days how they would take revenge in the devil's ministers are angels of life don't you realize that Eve was seeking new light when the devil talked to her and caused every graveyard to be out here caused every insane institution caused every penal Farm caus every death every sorrow every starving baby every dying mother she was searching for something new she was looking for something and she could do find knew oh God take me back to sh kind of Glory take me into veil with you I'm satisfied with Jesus Lord let me lose myself and find it in you get into the in Vil over all these HS of the world the Bible said in the last days there come a famine upon the Earth not for bread and water alone but for hearing the true word of God and people who go from east from West and everywhere trying to find it yes us that hour is here Jesus how do I we share when men are putting themselves up like gods and wanting to be glorified are people saying oh doctor so and so and big so and so oh Paul said I had one fear that is except you would try to worship me instead of the thing that I'm preaching I'll never come to you with enchanting words of man's Wisdom but in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that your hopes should be built on that that matter today is a horrible day the people are scattered abroad I stood a few weeks ago where there was a a big tent erected not sling God forgive for a man said he could cast out evil spirits which I have no doubt with that but evil spirits are not cast out but cruel indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love I stood by a little lady the other night where a husband fix the leave and marry another woman very fine known couple I looked at her she said oh I'm going to leave brother Brown I said don't do it sister don't said oh my husband his ministry will be ruined us what can I do I'm going to New York I'm going to get me a job I said don't do it don't do it sister what can I do brother R I said go up to him so I found the lady's picture and I broke it up and I done so and so I said that I I see that but I said go to him and put your arms around him say sweetheart no matter what you know I still love you that'll do it right a young fellow come to me not long ago he was a Pentecostal it seemed too many of these meetings and he goes in his wife is a staunch Luther she said well I guess you all went out and shouted last night so I guess she was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night he got on the floor said God cast I cast The Devil out of her I cast The Devil out of her almost a divorce case man ofine man he come to me and he said brother BR we're going to have a divorce I guess so I just can't get that devil to move out of her I said brother you're going at it the wrong way I said when she starts like that say all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her just see how much you can do for her said brother brandom well how would I ever get the devil out I said you do as I say and just keep praying in your heart I said God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two or three weeks later he said my home's revolutionized he said my wife is a different person I said which is the most powerful screaming and kicking and stalking or putting your arms around in love God is love the world ever since by faith I saw the stream thy flowing wound Supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die right the man calling me said This Woman's got a three Devils said one of his name is Jess and the other his name is V and just call the other anything and intelligent people sitting there supporting that meeting by the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds said one of them's green the is blue and other's pink oh God oh God is something wrong don't let that happen God those people that struggling so hard to try to get to the kingdom of God and they flocked by the hundreds to listen said Tommy rck you know why they've never been inside the veil that's one Sure Thing If ever been in there there no different than that my sheep know my my voice a Str yes sir you might go all kind of emotions and carry on everywh and call in the name of religion the heathens do the same thing but give me a consecrated life that's dead and rose again in Christ Jesus who lives in the Shak Glory with the love of God around him that's the person I believe is going to be there put me beneath the veil ear the blood of the Lord Jesus take all your gifts that you have in the scripture the devil can impersonate every one of them but he can't impersonate love because love is genuine the devil can't love that's one thing he can't do and when you get to a place that you love one another and all the world is dead and if you love God I was talking to a woman the other day that was just balling me out like everything she's going to almost give me a weapon I was sing with another man and she said you start across this place I'll call the sheriff I said well sister dear I was only I said we're Christians we would do she said Christians there is no such a thing real nasty and she was balling us out terribly I said but lady there is I said don't you believe in Jesus Christ she said well I believe in him but not in people I

you're going to walk in the presence of God Walk Right with the right anointing what would be the right anointing according to the word love peace Joy that's the anointing walk like that until God just raises up the curtain and takes me in and shuts all the world around me will you do it raise your hand by God's grace you'll do it thank you and God bless you do that friends I tell you it'll beat every emotion or every gift or anything else that you could seek if you'll just find Christ that way to your heart that's what help me I laid my daddy on my armm seen his hair drop down he looked at me went to meet God I see my brother y struggling the veins cut his neck broken the blood flying from his mouth I looked at my wife and she said I'll meet you just across the border y her Billy I laid my hand on my baby and the next day see his little legs jerking I said bless your little heart sharing Daddy I'll meet you on the other side my anchor held it's not based Up On Emotion not nothing I felt or nothing it's what God said about it I believed it it's all these 23 years of my Ministry now it whole just as tight today if not tired she gradually windes against the cross because it's pulling me closer to it all the time God grant each one of you have the experience of living a close consecrated life see listen closely now before close on that it isn't a blessing that you receive and shout and glorify God those things are good you're eating Mana that isn't it that's what I'm talking about this morning it isn't whether you raised up and spoke with tongues or whether you shouted run up and down the building that isn't it that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about that Hiway life in Christ where all the time day and night you just live in him that's what I'm talking about now he's here I wished I was a Healer this morning if I was I'd heal the sick people I can't heal sick people I'm just a man but the Healer himself is here the Lord Jesus now if I the Bible said the affectional fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much the in affectional fervent prayer of a righteous man a bail much the Elijah was a man subject to like patience as we are he prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain and it didn't rain for three years and six months then he went and prayed earnestly again in the heavens give rine Prayer Changes Things I can't change it you can't change it it's prayer that changes him God told a man one time he's going to die set his house in order sent the prophet up to tell and the man turned his face to the wall and began to cry and asked God for 15 years longer to live and God changed the course give you 15 years now what is it prayer now we're changing the subject just for a few minutes I don't get to be with you I'm hoping to be here next Sunday again the Lord but I uh I want to this morning when I come down wife said are you going your horse and everything I said I promise I'm going anyhow see look I want to tell you something I I know that prayer this is to be my first time praying since something was ministered to me that you understand God knows it's true see to ever pray for sick people it won't be in the public as it used to be well of course in these Church meetings it will be like this but I mean in another category that we go in now but this I do know I have confidence I've watched all along now if I would like to trade places today with some man who preached the gospel if it would be the will of God for me to be a preacher I'm not much of a Preacher because I'm not educated and I I don't know too much of the word and things so I can't preach but my work is to pray for sick people and I noticed in the in the services and different places just what prayer does what an effect it has how many takes Christian life the magazine Christian Life did you notice that astounding article in there by that medical doctor in Chicago or I believe it's wheat n noise they asked him they said Do You Believe In Divine Healing is there such a thing he said now you've asked me a question Divine Healing what do you mean Miracles or or healing he said healing certainly you pray for the sick and said the sick gets well then there's a miracle and it vanishes right before you said either of those said I certainly believe in that but said now these bloodless Cults such as unitarians and Science and things like that said I don't go for that but the blood of Jesus Christ will heal anytime that was a medical doctor see and they know that and then God set some in the church to pray for the sick God set some in the church to teach some to be different things is that right he does that and through this he gives different gifts sometimes to people that don't have nothing to do with it not a thing with your soul salvation but in this knowing that he call me to pray for the sick people I just want to to for your confidence and God knows in my heart I mean not a person but I want to just show you something look around across the country what's happened just draw it in your a mental picture in your mind a few minutes just look what happened up here the other day you all heard about that old psum down in the jungle down there come out there chewed up with the dogs or something all broke up and why would Jehovah of God to something that don't even have a soul a ignorant possum and bring that psum and lay it right at my door and me so dumb God I didn't know it it laid there 24 hours and I was sitting in my room and he said like a lady she's laid 24 hours for you to pray for her waiting for her turn and you haven't done it yet little Rebecca there was in the I walked out and I said Heavenly Father you forgive me I didn't know that and I pray you heal this pum that's all I said and the old psum raised up and looked at me gathered up her babies and just to say thank you sir without even a limb walk out the gate and down the road see a ignorant possum certainly God led her there don't you believe it how did he lead BOS were throw his look across the country of the hundreds through dreams and visions and how it's all being then that makes me know this and he met me there when he stood by my side and he said you were born in this world to pray for sick people said your ministry starting it'll sweep the world around and it has look at the healing campaigns Millions around the world is healed now I couldn't take it certainly not but I started it by God's grace and it flowed around the world this great Bible I said him the other night oh it's been other night few months ago where's a bunch of ministers gathered together these healing campaigns each want us to tell a personal experience they didn't even know I was around I setting back at this great Stadium my coat pulled up like this a hair piece on my head little pair of dark glasses on you second there listen one of them walked up the platform said well my Ministry is about G on I didn't know what to do and said a little humble fell come along brother Brown that started me other walked up said well his brother testified so was it me said I Pastor a little church and I went over one night and said they started I sat there and cried cried just got up and walk out of the building I couldn't stand it no more he said this I thought God it's it's exactly what you said would take place exactly well here I am this morning friend I'm very poor servant of the Lord I I fail him in so many ways that I'm ashamed of myself I I feel unworthy to to even minister to his dear sick children but I don't I don't look to my worthiness because I have none I look at what his grace is one see it's what what what he is to me and what I am to him I am his child he's my Lord as my hands are not clean but his are I don't minister with mine I only try to yield myself to him that he can Minister through me I'm very glad that I've lived in this Veil for the things of the world when he said you can't do it why you're crazy something went wrong with preacher random up there look at him why he's gone crazy when I had that ministerial meeting over there at the Jewish hospital and that group of men said there and how they tried to tell me I said well you're losing your mind well you can't do that you pray for Kings I said that's what he said make any difference what they said it did it anyhow God did it he never looked at my ignorance my ignorance could have never produced it but it wasn't my ignorance it was his grace he was the one done it in that grace alone I trust this morning as I go pray for this dying woman and for others not only you're God's servant too the prayer the affection fervent prayer the congregation praying your ladies a woman laying on a stretcher here this morning

place and brother NE and I will be ministering and laying hands on the sick as they pass by this side going to their [Music] seat some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the Spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read said the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable years to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the Blind and now we would think if such anointing was only been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing ing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building screaming holler but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing anointing is not emotion anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what H Hallelujah that's what's here now you might not be able to understand it as you walk here you might not be able to get but I challenge your faith to this you come and believe what I told you and watch what happened amen just dis believe what's been told and see what happen the anointing of the Lord is in the temple or Tabernacle this morning amen let us pray as we go [Music] father what he's done for he for you [Music] arms he paron you it is no SEC what God our heavenly father sister coming to the altar felt led to sing that song just then you were speaking to her she kneels she's praying as Hannah in the temple give her to the desire of her heart dear God we love you pray father that you have pardon give her those things that she asks for as she kneels broken up weeping knowing that is no secret what you can do for your God and all powers in Heaven and Earth is given into your hand so may you brush away her tears just now comfort her with thy nail scar hard hand and say daughter thy faith saves thee may she go in peace and be made whatever she desires today granted father for Jesus sake we ask it you love the Lord isn't he wonderful had a glorious time here this morning in this Fellowship have you just felt his presence just something around you saying well I'm with you don't fear the little boat can't rock or Do no harm how you feeling mother good that's fine the lady that was on the stretcher say she's feeling good now aren't we thankful for that our lord Jesus she's going to come back and be with us and set in the church and rejoice and praise God is that right now I believe next Sunday we just have all kind of people want to testify about what happened today don't you believe that now what do we do stay in the glory Walk In The Light walk step by step with him ever holding to his Everlasting hand the Eternal blessings of God resting with you knowing this assurance that God will not promise anything that he cannot do see Mo Abraham when he was old he he didn't care about how old he was he knew that God was was able to do what he said he would do isn't that wonderful well now God doesn't die God is from Everlasting to Everlasting did you ever think that when your spirit leaves you if you is in a gas chamber if you in a bottom of a well Bottom of the Sea wherever it may be when your spirit leaves you water fire nothing can hold it moves right through the villing and it's like a vapor it hangs Earth alive it can't die it's got eternal life it can't perish then when you die and your loved ones are Weeping they think you're dead but you're not you're still a living up here the old body is f faded away but it's pued down in the ground all the atoms and things that you once was is broke up and gone back into the the cosmic light and and petroleum and whatever it was gone back into the Earth and someday the great king of these spirits will come Jesus coming from glory in in his body amen and he'll turn loose the power of God and every person that's in him there are bodies and atoms will start going together the cosmic light will start making up and in a moment's time every person that's in Christ will be changed and made a young man and woman again standing on the earth amen think of it never to get old never to be sick never to have a heartache or weary what do we got to worry about we just walk in the light of God don't we isn't he wonderful
