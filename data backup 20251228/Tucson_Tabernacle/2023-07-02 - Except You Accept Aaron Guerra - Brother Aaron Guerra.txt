cost of the camp but please if you want to go and you're interested in going please sign up on one of the sheets that we put out there if you can't afford it don't worry about it we want you there

try to put together a Mount Lemon picnic in the next next couple weeks um friends I want to tell you too thank you for all the kindness that our congregation is showing our visitors when they come it seems like people are greeting them and reaching out to them and I think if there's as I've said before if there's somebody that you don't recognize or if there's a new person that comes in the church

lost his power Lord until that day when it's all over lord we appreciate that no Lord we just invite you one more time Lord to be preeminent have your own way Lord as we yield to you in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you God bless you amen you may be seated um I I remembered something and I didn't give it to brother Daniel but brother brother Bobby figured oh a junior as you know he's had had the cancer in his shoulder and just here recently they they go to and they check on him and they found two spots in his lung I spoke to brother Bobby um I guess it was Friday night oh no it was a Thursday night and they're not sure what it is but they're looking at it so let's remember the Figaroa family Bobby that's I've known Bobby since he was he was born I've known the family for many years but Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever so also brother Lyle sent us a text or Whatsapp he sent me a picture yesterday of the seven mountain peaks as they were passing up onto Idaho of northern Idaho but today 51 years ago July 2nd 1972 Tucson Tabernacle in this building had their first service and dedicated 51 years ago today so I don't know brother Ed you were here were you not at that time I don't know if anybody else was here and brother Ronnie brother Dave hey amen from from day one brother Merle I think my wife or you guys were you here no okay I know some of them but 51 years this place has been and God has never failed appreciate that I'd like to share something with you I mentioned to brother Daniel that I would as he spoke this morning about something that didn't go the way somebody thought it should so they criticized it and put a stop to it but God is sovereign he can do something the way he wants to do it we just have to say Lord I Surrender I yield I was just a young boy maybe 16 17 years old we attended another church in town at the time the pastor had left they had just lost their daughter a seven-year-old daughter to leukemia I believe she was seven somewhere around there and the associate pastor was ministering that morning in about halfway through the ministering the presence of the Lord came down into the church and a brother jumped up and ran up to the Altar and said I've got to make things right when he did that others did that I know I was there my wife was there I don't know if anybody else this would have been around 1976 77 78 somewhere Mountain there and people began to cry and come up to the altar and begin to to make things right before God to the point that people stood up and went to each other and made things right with each other right there this went on for 45 minutes to an hour I know I came up because there was things that I needed to make right with God when I stood up and turned to walk back to my seat I looked up and there were some folks still sitting in the congregation with their arms crossed very unimpressed very upset so the pastor was out of town and they called the pastor and they told him what happened the next Sunday they had a visiting Minister and he preached a sermon entitled warming yourself with a painted fire because you see most of us had come from a Pentecostal background and when we came into this message all sudden we wanted nothing to do with that but God had moved in that place but because it reminded some of the Pentecostal the church they refused it and I remember for the next couple of months there was so much confusion and so much hurt even in my own life I spoke with the pastor later and he said the Lord showed me this was going to happen but an evangelist could not handle it and I thought to myself if you knew that was going to happen to your congregation why didn't you stop it there were many who did not serve God anymore after that if and I'm saying this because I know this for me just because it doesn't come my way doesn't mean it wasn't God we have to say Lord have your own way and when it was spoke with brother Daniel we had he had mentioned to a ministering I asked him how do you want to do this and he says when you feel that you have something of the Lord just tell me and we'll do that and and so we we contacted him and said I have something on my heart kind of explained it to him then he said well I'm ministering something similar to that on Sunday morning and you don't say really you say God is in charge you know and and how many times will have a brother Minister and then somebody will come through and it's on their heart too so I began to just just talked to the Lord and he asked me what the title would be and it's kind of a play on words except you accept and I told him it'll be the law and the grace of the word except because you can go into the scripture and it says accept you do this except you do this except you do that and it's the truth but if you go and I'll get to there where he says except I go through this father there will be no salvation for them he put himself in that very place so let's just look at see the grace of God to us that first quote there who do you say this is in 64. I believe the brothers have it there see there's many of the things that has as we're approaching the new year that I wish I could I could forget about but I know that I've confessed them as wrong to him and he put them in the sea of forgetfulness and he won't never remember them no more even if you remember them he doesn't now see we're not made that way we'll always remember we can forgive one another but we can't forget about it because we are made different but God can forgive it and forget it he can just wipe it out as though it never was see because he has access to that sea of forgetfulness but we don't just think of it that God cannot even remember that we ever sinned think of that choir you young folks what if what about that God don't even even remember that we ever sin see he can forget the whole thing and never will be brought into memory anymore wouldn't that be something and if I could end this that I could do that too wouldn't it be wonderful to just be able to put it out and but I know a God who can then our sister just sing I know one who can and he says forgiven cleanse washed not there anymore now brother Daniel had asked us he put it out on WhatsApp to listen to the message of Grace and I trust you did it was a wonderful blessing but from that message the message of Grace God's grace cannot be bargained for neither can it be talented into its Sovereign Grace nothing in my arms I bring simply to the cross I cling naked wounded I just come as I am just as I Am Without One Plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bids me come to thee o Lamb of God I come you don't make yourself ready to come to God you don't clean yourself make yourself holy to be acceptable to God you come and you yield yourself to God oh Philippians chapter 1 verse 6. being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ there's a peace there's a rest there is is more than just physical rest it gets down into the soul into the heart of man and you can say is he's got it all under control he said it therefore he's got it under control Isaiah 61 1. the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings under the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound that was Isaiah speaking but I can take God his word and apply it right here to myself so taking the word except to accept something now we know David in Psalms a man after God's Own Heart that's God's testimony of David a man after God's Own Heart and that's because he could say I'm sorry I was wrong forgive me when the prophet Nathan came up to David and he began to tell him there was a man who had a hundred sheep and there was a man who had one and when the man who had the hundred sheep his friend came over and and he wanted to make a feast for him he took the lamb of the man that had one and he in in the prophet's telling David said then go back to that man and take his life what for what he did and the prophets of David you're that man you had 500 wives yet you took another man's wife not only did you take another man's wife you had him put to death now nowhere in there does it say David began to make excuses it was because of this it would no he said father forgive me I'm guilty of this and you know here it is he's saying he's he's now speaking later in Psalms David says in Psalms 119 108. accept I beseech Thee the Free Will offering of my mouth O Lord and teach me thy judgments here's David crying out accept it receive it I'm doing it back to you and then in Genesis 3 20 we know Jacob has run from his brother after he deceived his own father and his brother and stole the birthright took the birthrights the birthrights that gave you everything we know that his brother despised it but still Jacob was a thief but he's coming back and he knows Esau is going to be looking for him and he says this and say ye moreover Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us for he said no he's telling them to tell he saw this I will appease him with a present that goes before me and afterward I will see his face pre-adventure hopefully I pray that oh God let it be that he will accept it of me have you ever prayed to God that way sometimes as him Lord would you accept this would this we do it we're asking God to accept it why because we want to please him we don't want a disappointment Lord accept these prayers Lord accept the Cry of my heart and he does you know now that's that's that inner nature of a man a a human person crying out for help because we know without him we've got no chance one more in that Genesis 32 26 and and and going into the from accept to accept and Jacob says and same are over no I'm sorry it's Genesis 32 25. 26 I believe I gave that and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hull of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of his joint and he wrestled with him and then he says and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go accept thou bless me Jacob put that demand before the angel of the Lord have you ever gotten to before the Lord where it means so much to you Lord I'm going to stay here until I hear from you and sometimes it's one day sometimes it's a half an hour but it could be months down the road I've shared this with you a good friend of ours a young man he had high respects for the family a Pentecostal and we were part of that his father was well known he was the way they did it he would write the Sunday school lessons that all the churches use but this this he was older than me but he's a good young man and we we were on our way on a camping trip he was in the military stationed in this little place good friend of my parents and we stopped to visit I spent a little time with him and his wife I was my early teens at the oldest and we were sat down and at the table he they were talking and he was talking with my father and they were talking about the blessings of God and he began to tell my father an experience he had and he said I fasted for 40 days brother Larry I fasted before God and he spoke to me brother Larry you know what he said he said Richard I am not subject to your fastings that's a lesson to learn we don't make God do what we want because we've done this we do this just to Humble ourselves before him not to say Lord I did this therefore you owe me but God I am dedicating myself to you I as a Young Man heard that I was probably no more than 12 years old maybe younger and it caught my attention that God would speak to someone like that and he still does he still does so we'll go into Matthew and we'll take that word except and in the word except if you look into the definitions and some of the descriptions there is no other way except this way not giving you three or four options not give me a saint accept and this is Jesus speaking in Matthew 5 20. for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven oh man that just put a damper on everything didn't it because who could perform the law nobody nobody could but he did say that except it it's it's greater than that except it's better than that in Matthew 8 18 3. there the next the next verse there and and said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven is getting tighter is getting harder it's getting stricter except John 3 3. Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God the word except is used quite a bit in the New Testament except except except John chapter 6 we'll read verses 44 and 65. no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day I'm not saying that this is a scripture this isn't right I'm just telling you it's what the scripture says except there are no exceptions 65. and he said therefore I say unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father now let's go to acts 15 1. you know that scripture and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren it said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved except except if we're not careful it becomes except you don't see it my way except you don't follow it this way except you don't do it this way there's only one that could say except and that's God himself and even in the Book of Revelations two and five remember therefore from whence Thou Art Fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent now it also tells you there is a way how many just just being honest how many have have done something and then spent a long time being miserable because of what you've done well a few of you to admit it but all of us have you know but after it's been made right what a peace and a joy comes over that what a lifting of a burden I've shared with you what happened at Old Tucson once it was taken care of it never condemned me again did the memory go away no but the condemnation did it's been made right he says you know so this except except you do this if we're not careful and we'll be honest about it maybe God dealt with brother Jonathan about something in his life and brother Jonathan made it right took care of it I know you've never ever had to do that brother Jonathan I'm just using you as an example all right and like that and and after you've taken care of it all there's a piece that comes with him but brother Jonathan you cannot preach that as a Doctrine you cannot stand up and say you have to do it like me I just had to do what God told me to do when we try to form and make everything conform to how we see it okay and and that's where the problem comes when we start to say if it's not done like this it's no good if it's not done like that it's not right there was a brother and he gave a testimony and he stood up before a group of ministers and this was quite a few years ago we were there and God told him to leave the church he was at which is a good wonderful group of Believers and to go join himself to an organization and we all had the same reaction I'm sure as we heard it we said huh no way but he said I listened to God and I went to that church and I began to attend that church and I was able to reach some there in that church for salvation now you would say oh I don't know about that but to those who found Christ through that praise God that that man listened to what God said to him I understand what I'm saying you know if you were lost in sin maybe you were in a bar maybe you were in a bad place but God sends someone down to where you were at and reached down his hand her hand and Drew you out thank God for sending that person to that place wherever it was and and I know this because I've stood there in my own personal life and judged others by my standards and I'm not saying all my standards are bad but none of my standards are going to give me to heaven it's going to be the grace of God for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God brother Branham is is is there and he goes to that little restaurant and he walks in and he sees that woman with the two men and all that's going and he tells the God how can you stand this destroy them just get rid of it all and God says come outside step outside over here let me show you something and he begins to show him that vision of those sins coming up towards God and those are brother branham's sins and the blood is keeping him from being destroyed when brother Branham sees that Watch what it does it turns his whole heart and he goes back in with a whole different attitude he comes up to the lady and he begins to talk to her and leads her to Jesus Christ in a place where they're drinking and smoking and partying where did God meet you he met me in my self-righteous place that I was at when I thought I was okay and everything was all right I think sometimes that's the hardest one to get to I don't need any help Lord I'm doing well I'm okay I go to church Sunday both Services I go to church Wednesday I listen to a message I wonderful praise God for that but that's not going to save you it's his grace that it's already done the work it won't be too long tonight so if we go to Matthew chapter 26. verses 35 through 42. watch this Peter Peter there's something about Peter though that Peter was not afraid and talk to talk to Jesus and go right up to him and sometimes that person gets sent by everybody else you go talk to him you go tell him you go yeah I I working in in the work that I've done um I on several of the different positions I I was never a manager of a whole department but I managed a portion and we had a monthly meeting when our our regional boss would come down from Phoenix and I always attended the meetings we were supposed to and and I took notes because I was a manager and then I would have to you know inform those that we were working with and there was a group about four or five that were always poking at me because I was the only Hispanic in there and in in the Management Group and and they were Hispanics and they would accuse me of wanting to get in and I'm going to just say it this way with the white people okay I was raised in elementary and Junior High School where our street was the only Hispanics all my best friends and I'm gonna I'm gonna say it this way we're white I don't have any problems with that uh honestly they were my best friends it was never an issue to me until I come to Tucson and I started having people tell me you're not white you're Hispanic okay I never had a problem with that every time I look in the mirror I realize that too but they're friends I have no problem with whoever they are our neighbors were were Oriental we got along fine there's no problem in that but they would poke at me poke at me and poke at me and then after the meeting was over and they were going to have to answer for it what did he say what did he say what did he say so one day I said you're going to the meeting I'm not telling you anything you're going to sit in the meeting and learn for yourself I can share what God has done for me but until you meet him for yourself then your testimony becomes real you're not sharing somebody else's so here's Peter Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet I will not deny thee now if you were here there not where you are today and know what the scripture says you probably would have because you would have been like the other likewise also said all the disciples amen I'm with Peter Peter spoke for all of us amen then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto his disciples sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder and he took with him Peter and two and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy and then he said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me be a support you are the ones that I've shared my life with you you were the ones that I've sat down when nobody else the things that I begin to open my heart before you now would you just help me would you be my friends here and isn't that nice when somebody said I'll pray with you I'll stay up all night and remember something when we were just a young family with me and my wife and the kids and and we've been me and my wife both we we just opened the door to a few things and it didn't take too long where we were not going out and smoking and drinking but things in our lives had changed and we both sat down one day and said we've got to do something about this lest we be find ourselves outside all of a sudden I called I think was six or seven families in the church then and I said tonight at seven o'clock me and my wife are going to go before the Lord in prayer because there's things going on in our lives we opened the door a little bit now there's things in our house in in our physical home and in ourselves that should have never been there okay and I said would you pray with us so at seven o'clock we went into prayer both me and my wife and to whatever time it was in the next service every one of those families came and said thank you for calling us for prayer because we met God for ourselves also and God dealt with us and God became it became work with us we had to say hey we need some help you know so here Jesus is knowing what he's going through knowing what about he's he's about to face and he's asking for his closest friends would you Terry with me would you pray with me and then in verse I'll read verse 39 I believe that is and he went a little further and he fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but is thou wilt I'm looking at this father is there another way we can do this without the shedding of My Blood The Taking of my life yeah and he cometh unto his disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour what if on that next Wednesday some of those families would have come to me and my wife I'm sorry brother Aaron but we forgot and we weren't praying what if that what if that had happened but there was a group of people we didn't tell him our story we just said we need prayer they got to praying seeking God and God heard but here Jesus the son of God is saying looking at his disciples who has just spent time with and here they couldn't stay awake they were tired they were all so human okay they weren't angels you know they had this they had to set themselves aside for this too and then he tells them watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak I'm sure they told him Lord we're going with you we're going to follow you we'll go all the way up there with every intention to do so he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done that's the one except in the Bible that speaks of the grace of God except I do this there is no salvation so he said I will and this is there this is what you must accept as the accept because without there without him ex they accept I do it there would be no selfish I don't know if you've ever looked at it this way but as I was looking except I drink it there is no forgiveness he had to come to that place himself I am willing to give it up for them for all those everyone that John 15. one through five I am the True Vine and my father is a husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth root he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit you might be saying Lord that hurt a little bit Lord you cut me off a little bit here Lord you trimmed it here Lord you did that when your hearts are saying Thank You Lord you're doing what is best for me to magnify you now I I never I've never really done this my dad was when they were young and they'd moved from Texas to California there where we lived was the the Italians owned a lot of the land there and the grapes were for wine that's where California's oldest Winery was in that neighborhood right there nothing to be proud of but it was there and my dad and them they went to to working in there because that's what they were in that was pruning the grapevines um I think Dad said it paid like 35 cents an hour but when gas was five cents a gallon that's not that bad but it cost pruning clipping cleaning now the man the men that were pruning the men that made like Dad said the 75 cents an hour they knew what they were doing it wasn't just cutting anywhere just clipping anywhere there was a way to prune the vine so it could produce to its maximum so when he comes down where you're at and he begins to prune he knows what he's doing and except he does it you won't give fruit or your fruit will be minimal but he wants you to bring forth my fruit he says that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you then he says abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me okay now the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine so when they go to pruning they prune off that portion that will never bear fruit again in fact it's gathered and bundled and put into the fire but you don't need that portion that he's pruning off of you that's where you understand because you realize in order to be in part of that except you're in that vine he's going to prune it to produce Jesus Christ and that which is in my life that is not Jesus Christ like needs to be pruned off because they accept you abide he says you cannot bring forth the fruit he says I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing though I give myself to be burned Paul said in Corinthians though I give all away and I have not love or charity it profiteth me nothing might make you look good might have you in good standing amongst the people but if you're not producing Jesus Christ the life of God then he said it profiteth me nothing so I I just want to go back guys today will be nice and short if if he comes in and he says I want you like this except this let him prune It Off I want you like this and and he does different ways of pruning um just like a a mother and a father have different ways of raising their children um and the children learn the difference between Mom and Dad real quick and and as as husband and wife raising the children you have to do this together you can't you can't get it twice a guy run to Daddy because Daddy's has a lot more grace for me I don't know if that works that way Daniel because I don't I never had a son what Daniel is saying no you're it's easier to run to Mama okay did she just pinch you for that children learn that you know and and Sarah's here today I asked her one day we were driving home together and I said tell me something about Dad and Mom that that you I don't remember the exact wording that meant something to you she said that you and Mom were consistent if you said no then Mom said no if Mom said no then you said no I couldn't go to Mom after you told me no to get something from her now me and Mom didn't sit down and and talk about this it's it's how we raised the family to say we did everything perfect no but there's something about that when when we can look to our father and say Lord and know that he's going to be consistent he's not swayed by my feelings he knows what's best for me um I really can't use this that example but brother Silas is sitting right behind Daniel there and that's where my dad would be and I'd be sitting where Daniel is and if my dad didn't like how my action worth I felt it right about here either like this or like this now dad didn't mean it to be mean he's trying to teach us trying to teach us to be respectful in service be respectful in church to grow up to be to to be good people you know what I'm saying that's what he meant by it but Daddy's this and Mama's this usually we're in two different levels daddies you felt it for a week mom you felt it for a couple a couple of minutes it's just just how it kind of worked but but their intentions were to raise children who would be respectful who could be good citizens but most of all to love the Lord Jesus Christ when God comes and he does the trimming and he does the work he does it for your very best and he's the husbandman he knows what he wants from his Vineyard and he can get the mass production everything that he has seen so when it gets hard and it gets tough and you begin to think and you begin to feel I can't do this no more remember that he said except I do this to his own father you and I would not be here today because he took our place he stood where I should have paid for my own sin and he took it upon himself there was a law acts 15 1. don't you realize what Moses said don't you realize what Moses did except you do this and there was a Grace that except I do this that's the grace of God for us musicians can come up oh God rich in Mercy God rich and Grace nothing nothing that you've ever done is too big for God to take care of now I wish he would take some of the things out of our memory but that's not part of it you just have to say Lord I've confessed it help me that's just bow our hands except you said I go and give myself for them and you said not my will but thy will be done father oh the grace and the love of God the mercy that we wrote my life Lord where would we be today help us Lord think of that that Pharisee in that public and as they were there praying and the Pharisee looked up to God and he said I'm glad that I'm not like this man here I do this this and this I tithe I do this I go to church and Lord foreign there on his knees was crying out forgive me have mercy
