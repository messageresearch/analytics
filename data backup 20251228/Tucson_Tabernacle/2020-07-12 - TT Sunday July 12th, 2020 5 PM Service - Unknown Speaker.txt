go buy house but it's in you so appreciate that this this evening so we do have a couple of requests to bring to your attention our sister Martha Peterson she said to remember sister and Rhiannon Murray she's requesting prayer she's experienced a fever and feeling achy with a headache so let's remember sister and Rihanna and you know last Wednesday I believe it was with the template in a prayer request for his mom and when he got home he remembered her her body or her legs were hurting and when he got home she was standing up washing dishes just having a good time and she says you prayed for me I didn't even know God touched her anyway so there wherever sister Andriana is today we're just believing that and also we got news yesterday that a a good family friend passed away I don't know I know sister Amalia knew them and maybe some of those that went to the Spanish Tabernacle years ago a brother Frank Madrigal he was a mechanic and he went around helping everybody fix their cars and something happened to discourage him and his family and it kind of went away from the Lord and believe us four daughters and three sons and brother Frank adopted my dad as his as his dad here in town because his parents lived back in California and all and he they looked at my dad and mom as grandpa and grandma the kids did and Naomi their oldest daughter called my dad yesterday or the day before said dad had passed away and that's he had cancer it's about 65 years old and as I thought about him when we the girls were younger and they were getting their cars and there was a something wrong with it he would tell dad tell him to bring it over and I'll fix it he always expressed a lot of love to her family and considered us part of his family so I know that his family his wife and grandchildren and daughters are missing him strongly today Frank mother God is his name and let's remember them and if you have a need in your saying Lord I have a need and I'm trusting and believing that you know let's just bow our heads it and and talk to him in faith not in a begging pleading oh dear Lord I need you but Lord I just know that you're cool I'm confident in this I know in whom I have believed Lord we come this evening we've heard a couple of requests we've seen the hands raised and maybe there were those that didn't raise their hands but in their heart there has something and we go to a river that never has ever nor ever will run dry hard the ever-present water from the rock or debt is you and the mighty God family in Lord and sister and Rihanna here both Lord the needs that were were written and read Lord in asking you to be merciful in comfort in healing Lord and father each hand in each heart represented here you know what is and those that are listening in and maybe had raised their hand at home or wherever they might be ministered to each one as they as they have need Lord let them remember realize reacquaint however it is to remember that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord we thank you for me we give you honor and glory and we thank you brother a prophet brother Graham taught us to thank you when we have asked and just to thank you for it and believe that it's our sword and we do that today Jesus Christ amen you know it's it's something when when you go with I hope so you're approaching meant will I qualify do I have enough but he paid a debt he took care of it also and speaking with brother Lyle just a little bit before service and I just had her brother man had mentioned some things and we had to talk in a little bit in him the words to this song came to memory we've never sung it but it's how big is God how big and wide his vast domain to try to tell my lips can only start he's big enough to roll this mighty universe yet small enough to live in within my heart and I thought this mighty God who created this whole place who holds it under control takes care of all made himself a little baby in Mary's womb so that he could live this life to understand you and me oh when I survey brother Peters saying that wonders cross do you love him today now I was going to honor somebody and she walked out on me if somebody can get sister Martha Peterson to come back and I'd like to to give honor to where honors do I don't know where she she walked out with Kenneth but she coming back in I was I'll start here happy to have sister Grace and sister Lily back and there she is I told her today if nobody else said thank you to her I wanted to appreciate her for the last two weeks playing the piano for us and she says she enjoys that and she loves to do it and when you listen to her you couldn't hardly tell could you she does but then sister Lily told me she said she appreciates so much that sister martha is here and confident fact she told me she says she should have played since I just got back today Joe we're back to service but I just wanted to say thank you to sister Martha and to all our musicians as the musicians because I've done it for a long time - thank you for you singing and responding and together we make joyful noise unto the Lord so let's stand and sister Martha I didn't mean to embarrass you but if I did I did so but thank you very much god bless amen so the Lord has put something on brother Lyle's heart and and God knows exactly how to deliver it and just take one moment of liberty I was talking both him and brother Peter and I encouraged both of them in the time they've administered I've tried to encourage them if they felt something to seek God's face and I was I can't say I'm a proud grandpa because I'm not really his dad or grandpa of them but I adopted Peter as my son adopted son when he came back you know brother Peter and brother Eddie were born and raised here I mean Peter said you were about 12 when you left somewhere around there so you were about 10 or so when they left they were they were part of the church here and when he came back I said I would take care of him and made sure he got fed and all and I said it was a there was a motive behind him I didn't want his dad coming after me and so he said he was gonna call his dad one day and he was gonna tell him that I wasn't treating him right and when brother Jerry got about a half an hour away he's in a column say I was just kidding but just finished coming and get him to come back but I've appreciated brother Peter in and and watched the growth and the expression and you know having a family now and all in it I told him I'd it wasn't me doing it but it was a glad to encourage him and I can say the same thing for brother Lyle I just tried to encourage them and if they have something and I just I'm not taking credit for it but I'm happy to see that God has done something in their lives and I appreciate God's goodness in disgrace to all of us had it not been somebody who reached out just took your hand or encourage you or gave you smile or lifted up you up but thank God for those that have done that so drawn on on God today and God will speak to you so Amazing Grace how sweet the sound Amazing Grace how sweet the all it's a diary I once was lost but now [Applause] I was praise God Oh praise God [Music] phrase Bray's baa racecar racecar praise God praise God praise God praise [Music] you know we're told me two habits the praises of his people and this morning we heard from our pastor Matt Watkins about being your dwelling place for God if we could sing that one more time please [Music] [Music] I praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] our friends car praise thank you all very much as always it's a privilege it's an honor to be here with you tonight I want to thank you for being here whether it's physically through streaming or some future time through archiving you know we live in a time of unprecedented technology freedom of and access to information and overall economic prosperity were privileged to live in a nation that allows us to worship God without being directed how to were punished if we don't do it exactly that way but we also live in an era of unmatched skepticism toward God the ethics and morality of how we ought to live extreme peer pressure especially on our youth to conform to some mold that either ignores or rejects God one that at best diminishes him to a role of a force of the nature or politicizes them to advance some agenda a weapon often used for discounting this is discounting the Bible as science well my burden this evening is for the young people our topic is the reliability of the Bible in the face of science and the focus of the investigation will be the story of Joseph tonight and next Sunday evening I have a lot of material so yeah that's a lot and that's just tonight so I want to get right to it this will be in the form of a sunday-school lesson it's not preaching it's not teaching doctrine but sharing my heart first while we're still standing let's pray without the Lord's guidance without his help without him being here without you drawing on him we're wasting our time Lord were not here to waste our time Lord we've been worshipping you and song in and praise and in prayer and that is certainly no waste but Lord these next minutes Lord I pray that you'd help - scoundrel Lyle Johnson did you step aside Lord take control take control of what I say take control of how it said take control of how its heard Lord speak to us tonight we're depending on you we cannot do it of our self we thank you because we accept it and we believe you in Jesus name Amen I want to read from two portions of Scripture if I remember to turn this on looks like it's on there it is it moved thank you I have to be a little bit patient here the first verse is the opening verse of the entire Bible Genesis 1:1 in the beginning there was a beginning in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and again from the end of the same book of Genesis and Joseph said unto his brethren I die God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware unto Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and Joseph took an oath he made the promise of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and he shall carry up my bones from hence so Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old they embalmed him he was put in a coffin in Egypt please be seated a coffin in Egypt would a strange way to end a book that begins with her grandeur in the power of God to create the heavens in the earth and ends with a tender personal note on the care of the body of one of his children brother Branham called Genesis the book of beginnings in fact the Hebrew name for the first book of the Bible but a sheet translated in English as Genesis is also the first word of the Bible that's translated in the beginning brother Branham told us in 1952 he is really the church he said now the book of Genesis is the seed chapter of the Bible it's the beginning to where Genesis means the beginning three nights later he said I've been studying Genesis now for two years it's the beginning to going forth the same chapter have you ever wondered why Genesis 15 chapters the foundation of the entire Bible the beginning of it all two votes 13 of those chapters more than 1/4 of its entire content to the life of Joseph Joseph I've been thinking as I mentioned the burden of the young people about our graduates this year in 2020 students in high school going on to university the pressures that they face in our modern Western society a society replete with attitudes that dismiss and ignore or even ridicule and condemn our faith a society with education thrust focused on science technology engineering mathematics again our topic is the reliability of the Bible its historic accuracy the title for this evenings portion is Joseph's foundation I think if we want to be honest with ourselves with each other with our children we have to ask the question how trustworthy really is the Bible in this age of modern science does does pure science contradict objective biblical narrative as were often told or are they actually complimentary with each supporting and reinforcing the other now when I say pure science I'm talking about investigative and experimental results I'm not talking about somebody's interpretation well this means that or that happened because I'm talking about the observation itself that to the extent possible science that's stripped of the biases of the scientists if I say objective biblical narrative I'm not talking about somebody's commentary somebody's interpretation somebody's feeling about what something means but to the extent possible the biblical text stripped of the biases of the reader as well as of the translator given that the foundational text of the Bible is Genisys what about its historical reliability and that for the story of Joseph's Joseph's specifically to say well brother while why are you picking Joseph well in addition to occupying more than a quarter of the entire book of Genesis the story is filled with meticulous attention to detail Joseph's story lists a large number of events spread over many years it gives us a unique opportunity to investigate the historical and cultural content against history and science because these are the tools the weapons that will be used against our young people I really appreciated brother Matt's message this morning about the precision of the Bible regarding the wilderness Tabernacle if you're building something you've got to follow the blueprints including the fine print the footnotes vague descriptions and references won't cut it my pastor said I heard no that's not good the details are important they can mean the difference between success and failure a solid building a one that collapses under pressure Paul tells us and first Thessalonians he says prove that means test test all things test everything hold fast to that which is good that which survives the testing well this begs the question what can we test how can we test it apart from the Genesis narrative itself are there historical records or archaeological or other scientific evidence that we can use to support or that calls into question we have to be even-handed we have to be fair calls into question the biblical account Peter tells us sanctify the Lord God in your hearts be ready always be prepared at all times to give an answer to every man that asks you don't push but respond a reason for the hope that faith evidence of the hope that is in you with meekness that's gentleness backed by strength and fear this is not teller but respect reason don't argue or let me tell you something no no respect don't talk past each other we see so much about today have a conversation engage in humility and respect meekness is not weakness it's not temerity Jesus was meek he was near too weak nor timid in st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 22 Jesus quotes Moses when he's asked master what is the great commandment in the law jesus said thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind love the Lord with all your mind the battleground is in the mind we touched on that when we spoke last time here Paul the one who told us to test everything he tells us in Timothy studied but that means invest time effort study to show thyself approved unto God not approved to yourself not to your peers a workman we're talking about work effort not vacation it's work your mission should you decide to accept it that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings just arguing and talking past each other they'll increase it to more ungodliness strife angers discontent you got a study you got to take it in you've got to own it make it yours or don't accept the mission and prepare to be ashamed I don't have an answer go talk to my pastor unable to answer unable to give a reason Joseph do science and history provide evidence to support or do they contradict the biblical text of course we're not gonna find a blood stoked torn multicolored garment and Rita a label that's engraved in or embroidered somehow that says oh this coat was a property of Joseph son of Jacob resident of Canaan 1900 BC no we're not gonna find that we're not going to discover a cache of credit-card bills or bank transactions in his name we can't go to Syria or Iraq and check the Bureau of Vital Statistics and pull a copy of his birth certificate for the Mathew we won't find his passport with a visa stamp saying they entered Egypt on such-and-such a day is a foreign worker no neither will we locate a bill of sale for one battered Canaanite teenager named Joseph if we go to Midian and a station alight spice traders we're not going to find a receipt for him in the slave markets of Egypt no we have to look someplace else if we could find any of these things if we could how would we know they're not forgeries how could you be certain what we will be able to do has established the context and then looked for and examine evidence that supports or refutes the biblical account we have to recognize that if you're given evidence different detectives may come to different conclusions based on the same evidence their conclusions may be biased so might ours let's be honest we often see what we want to see we find what we want to find we see that all around us these days with protests about racial inequality or theories about the origin of the novel coronavirus brother Branham told us that when you come to a meeting you get what you came looking for do you expect to hear from God is that why you came tonight you will expect to hear some guy rambling on about something you really could care less about or something to criticize that's what you're gonna find it's often hard to recognize much less separate ourselves from our biases but biases are not there is objective truth and we'll find that in the Bible as well but for example let's just say that the temperature in this room is 74 degrees okay we can measure that it's subjective now we might question the calibration of the thermometer but we can agree that within the accuracy of the thermometer that it's 74 degrees and even if we can't agree if somebody says huh I think it's 87 and somebody else said oh I'm pretty sure it's 62 that doesn't change the fact that it's 74 now you might say it's too cold I might say I feel a little warm those are other interpretations of the temperature those reflect our biases and our preferences but they don't change the temperature well in a similar way as we gather evidence from the Bible and from other sources to the course of this evening and next Sunday evening we need to recognize biases we need to evaluate these things not be selective not avoid the hard questions well before we can search for witnesses outside the Bible to substantiate or refute the Joseph story we have to determine when did he live we have to establish his place in the timeline of history his chronological context so that's what we'll start now the Bible text doesn't explicitly say Joseph was born in 1843 ad or 29:17 BC er that it doesn't say that 25 years ago a little personal note I worked with several people from Japan I asked one of these friends from Japan when were you born you scratched his head for a few minutes and then he told me he had to think about why did he have to think about it the Japanese calendar is based on the reign of the current Emperor Hirohito for example rain from 1926 to 1989 this is known as the Showa era if my friend would have said I was born in Showa 33 wouldn't a man anything to me he knew that so he did the math to tell me when he was born but if he'd have said Showa 33 in and I knew to add 1925 to it then I'd realized a brother Aaron that he was born in 1958 have to do a little math based on the context of his statement to me in order to move it from the calendar of his culture to the calendar of mine while we're talking calendars up I'll suggest don't give too much weight to the dates that you find in the margins of your Bibles these are typically derived from a fellow archbishop named uh sure published back in 1654 there the years that are for example in the Scofield Bible I sure did the best he could with the data that he had in 1650 three hundred and seventy years later we have more data we can get more accurate well our modern calendar the one we use today is known as the Gregorian calendar it was named after Pope Gregory the 13th who introduced it on October the 4th 1580 - you don't have to remember that date this calendar includes leap years and it fine Tunes them to align as closely as practical with the solar year as it was understood in 1582 nowadays we not only have leap years we even insert leap seconds in order to get our clocks and our calendars is accurate because we know how to make them you can be sure that in Joseph's time and Moses time they didn't know how to measure things as accurately there was no world standard for calendars all of which makes determining dates and ancient times challenging exercise some people devote their lives to solving these puzzles where do we begin well Jesus gives us a clue whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and do with them I'll show you whom he's like here we go he's like a man which built in house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock when the flood rose a stream beat vehemently against that house it was stood it was founded on a rock nothing could shake it but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation just started building magnificent beautiful house same as the other one but when the stream hit it it's gone knocked over couldn't withstand it the old testament is anchored in time it's time foundation it's the exodus that amazing spring day that began on the evening of the Passover and ended with a nation descended from Jacob walking out in broad daylight out of Egypt out of slavery out of captivity we read in Exodus 12 the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt not just visiting wasn't a holiday the soul journey was quite a long time might have been a few centuries even is that what it says no no the Bible specifies us very precisely it says it was 430 years that's something we can measure maybe that's something we can test it came to pass at the end of the 430 years there it is again wasn't a mistake it wasn't a misprint it's being said twice even the self same day it's not a lot of wiggle room there it came to pass that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt well there hasn't been found any record in Egypt of the arrival of this Canaanite clan so we don't know when this was now another reference in Genesis God he the Lord said to Abram know of a surety that thy seed your descendants will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them longer than they like no it's precise it says they'll serve them for hundred years that's another pretty definite number and that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance that's the Exodus this is an advert I point to the Exodus well nobody has found and revealed any way that they've discovered a record or Egypt of a date when on this day ferrozzo and so made all the Hebrew slaves we don't have that so and there's there's not a discrepancy between the four hundred years and the four hundred thirty years they lived in Egypt for 30 years before their immigration status of temporary resident was revoked well we'll talk about that next week but let's go forward in time then from the Exodus if we can't find something back to see what we can find first King six and it came to pass after maybe 200 or 500 years no no it doesn't say that it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year not after four hundred and eighty years in the four hundred eightieth year you can hang your hat on it after the children of Israel will come out of the land of Egypt that's the Exodus in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel and not just a fourth year but in the second month he began to build the house of the Lord he was laying a foundation Solomon's Temple construction date isn't known in secular history but we do have definite evidence that he did build a temple Egyptian history was recorded from papaya in Temple and tomb inscriptions and stalee and so forth own records victories there's nothing about the exodus Egyptologists like that Professor Bob Brier that Heather and I took to 48 less lecture course while we were during our stay home stay safe period a couple of months ago he told us quote the ancient Egyptians didn't record defeats they had a different conception of history than we do so you won't find a record of this defeat much less when it happened recorded in Egyptian history we'll have to try and find it's another way well what's going on what's going on could God be giving us something to test and hold fast if it's true with these precise durations of 480 430 and 400 years something to help us hang on to under unwavering attacks on the book that forms the foundation of our faith we're building a foundation now it's strange the foundation in time for Genesis is found in Exodus now as we go forward here we're gonna be getting a little bit technical I can't avoid it skeptics aren't gonna accept a hand waving argument they want something that they can research something they can evaluate frankly so should we now if there's no record outside the Bible for the Exodus and there's no link in the Bible tying the date of the exodus of something we know in secular history like there was a giant meteor that struck and killed all the dinosaurs or something then we have to find another specific event that we can reliably tie to the exodus we just read one the laying of the foundation of Solomon's Temple when was this fortunately an historic event occurred very near the time when the temple was built the Bible lists that event and it's also attested to in secular history confirmed by archaeology and and other things and there's two accounts of this in the Bible let's read first Kings 14 that came to pass and the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ah let's read the same account a little more detail and chronicles it came to pass it in the fifth year of King Rehoboam we've got two witnesses here that Shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they transgressed against the lord with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt these folks from these different places right and he took defense cities the walled cities that belonged to Judah and he came to Jerusalem we have a name shishak it doesn't just say Pharoah like the president or the king we have a name it's the first pharaoh that's actually named in the Bible how convenient just when we need it the linkage is once again tied to Egypt first the exodus from Egypt now an invasion of Judah by Egypt we learned from the chronicler that Shishak took the walled cities of Judah and then came to Jerusalem if if you read the further text in these two accounts you'll see that Rio Boehm ransomed to Jerusalem and she shacked it and destroy the city well Raya Boehm is one of Solomon's kids one of his children we can pin down his reign relative to Solomon's the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years and Solomon slept with his fathers he passed away he was buried in the City of David his father and Rayo bow of his son reigned in his stead ah we've got something we can synchronize to here we can go to shacks invasion if we can figure out when that is hint we can and go back five years from that to the end of solomon's reign the beginning array of booms go back 40 years from that to the beginning of solomon's reign and then go up four years within solomon's reign to laying the foundation to the temple sad a little confusing it would have been just a whole lot easier if somebody would've just use accurate consistent solar calendar but where's the fun in that I hope you can see that that little timeline that I did for you because I really worked hard so I want you to be able to see it but but but here's a timeline I do to help you put all this in perspective now since we're dealing with years BC before Christ according to Pope Gregory the numbers increased the further back in time we go so that's why the arrow points to the left now I put an anchor symbol I think this thing has uh maybe it's I got to figure out how to use it it's got a laser on it somewhere the green button you're right it's the green button okay we have confirmation we have two witnesses okay so I put an anchor symbol up here by the invasion of Jerusalem because that's our anchor into secular history and I put an anchor here at the Exodus because that's the anchor of time in the entire Old Testament it's the time foundation well you say well that's nice by the while I still don't know what it was oh oh sorry I put some ears in here to make it a little bit easier okay it's the same information but with our channel interstates shishak of the Bible is show shank one of secular history two ways of stating the same person's name you've got to understand this guy's name certain Egyptian hieroglyphics and it's translated into Hebrew or Aramaic or into Greek and then finally into English and the Spelling's kind of diverged a little bit it's the same guy okay and and don't worry there won't be a test in fact at the back of the church I've got this timeline and a couple of other bits of information some notes for you to take with you if you wish after service it's just one side of one page next week we'll get the second side filled in so but I don't want to put all that information in this time you might not come back next week so there's not going to be a test okay as might be expected the evidence for show shanks invasion is anchored in history by archeology the major item is an engraving on a wall that's part of the booba site portal and gate located in Karnak which is an ancient Egyptian temple complex it's a place where pharaohs routinely boasted of their accomplishments and stone carvings so that no one would forget the portal lists a number of towns in Israel and Judah that show Schenk conquered but it doesn't list Jerusalem the Bible lists Jerusalem and how robomen ago she aided it not being captured so this lies perfectly he was there he tripped a lot of walled cities he did not take Jerusalem because Jerusalem was ransomed so we have very good synchronisation here between history and the Bible and and there's also a little stone fragment here of something called a stellae which is just a stone slab that these guys had he wrecked to say look what I did okay this one is found they tell Megiddo tel is an old mound that's left over from a place where people used to live and they got tired moved somewhere else so until Megiddo in Israel this fragment lists show shanks name and and a little part of fragment of a typical fir onyx statement of how glorious he was but its presence buried within the town of Megiddo indicates that he was there and they're north of modern Israel so show shanks invasion was a 925 BC that year of 925 is attested to by multiple sources lots of people whether they believe the Bible or they don't it's considered very reliable so this implies then that the date of the temple construction was 966 okay now the 966 date it fits plus or minus a year why because it says in the fifth year of Raya bowl was it the fifth year and one day was it the fifth year and 360 days it was somewhere in there so there's a little uncertainty when the Bible says Solomon reigned for forty years was it 40 years in zero days was at 40 years in six months was the 39 years and ten months and just rounded to 40 years we really No so there's a little bit of uncertainty here but we'll use 966 if you're going back 3,000 years that's pretty precise well this then places the exodus where we've been trying to get to all this time 14:46 BC that's the anchor for the Old Testament 1446 B see if that's true Jacob and his family then joined Joseph four hundred and thirty years sooner in 1876 BC that's going to prove to be a very important date so again I place the anchor an exodus at 14:46 we go back in time to jacob we go forward in time to the temple because the exodus is an event and a date where there's a lot of skepticism controversy misunderstanding and because it's the anchor and it's so important within christianity in the secular world were going to spend some time on that now solomon the one who built the temple he admonishes us we've read in proverbs 25 these are also Proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out so this was added into the list of Proverbs and Hezekiah steamed about 200 years after Solomon's time that weren't written down at Solomon's fine according to this note let's get on with it it is the glory of God to conceal a thing God's not gonna spoon feed us he expects us to grow up but it's the honor of kings to search out a matter sort of like study to show thyself approved to God or test all things ork jesus said Luke 11:9 seek and ye shall find what are you gonna find if you don't seek not a lot so like an archaeologist we have to be prepared to dig like a scientist or a Christian we have to test and in our case trust the Holy Spirit to in the right direction as I mentioned we're going to be spending actually the remainder of this evening on exodus verifying it's date and the things around it from outside the Bible as well as in the Bible to help us nail that date down well brother while it's gonna take a while can't we just skip all that ad 430 and 480 come up with 910 back that off from the construction of the temple and get on with Joe no no we can't because the Bible doesn't do that the Bible answers anchors it to exodus that's the anchor the the the Hebrew calendar when these guys left Egypt what did God tell them in exodus 12 to let this month be the first month of buts for you they started everything it's all synchronized to the exodus so we have to confirm if we don't confirm the exodus and that 480 years that we want to go back or the 430 years it's just a number that's just a number it's as good as any other number take your pick well foundations are necessarily time-consuming to lay some of the work just gets tedious but Jesus reminded us if the Foundation's weak building's not going to stand it'll collapse well we want a solid foundation if we're gonna go out and confront the world and have these people hammering at us with science coming from this direction and that we have to have a solid foundation so let's do it Paul told us to test proof all things he's he didn't suggest it he didn't say by the way if you have time you might want to consider this is a New Testament commandment we need to find things in the biblical account that we can test against science and history and archaeology to confirm or invalidate what that this happened in 1446 since Egyptians don't like to record defeats we don't Rock kind of find a record of by the way under this pharaoh there were a lot of frogs in the mosquitoes be just really bad and then it got dark and then the river turned to blood we're not gonna find that it's not there so let's listen the events that are listed in the Bible for which we might be able to find some evidence to help us test the state well brother Peter I came up with six on my list the the Pharaoh at Moses birth had a daughter that's something we might be able to confirm the Pharaoh at the Exodus had Hebrew slaves that made mud bricks with straw okay the Pharaoh when Moses was forty somehow failed to execute Moses who was wanted for murdering an Egyptian official hmm the firstborn of the Pharaoh of the Exodus died never made it to the throne the Pharaoh would the Exodus rode in a chariot - damn chariots then did he cheat at chariots the Pharaoh of the exodus is likely to have drowned in the Red Sea oh well since Pharaoh is a title like President or King we have no name for the Pharaoh of the exodus in the biblical account so we have to determine if we can who was the pharaoh in 1446 BC well Egyptian history we find lists of pharaohs but their reigns how long it that's all a little soft it's a little mushy it's it's it's it it's hard to know for sure it's like trying to pick up well like to try to pick up a water balloon or something that's uh that's not too full understand that serious Egyptology the study of Egyptian history the ability to decipher hieroglyphics and read these things on the walls and Karnak this holy began with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone when Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1799 it's only been a little over 200 years that anybody has been able to read this Egyptian stuff anyway similarly archaeology only changed from the Indiana Jones style of treasure hunting to trying to understand the times in the context starting about the mid 19th century also just about 200 years well it turns out that 1446 BC falls in the time of what is known as 18th dynasty during a period known as the New Kingdom in Egyptian history the Pharaoh in 1446 BC I get to keep hammering that date I'm sorry but maybe I'm not sorry Bella keep hammering it anyway seems to be universally agreed as being a guy named Chuck Moses the third well there's a problem many of you have seemed sussel be Tamils 1956 classic movie The Ten Commandments the Pharaohs portrayed as being ram assists the second ram assists the great tradition often if not usually identifies her I missus a second is the Pharaoh at the time of Moses well what's the problem he reigned from about 1279 to about 1213 BC that's not 1446 that's an error of about two hundred years of the Bible statement of 480 years before the temple foundation is to be believed well what's correct was at 480 years what was it Rama sees what's going on we read an exodus therefore they did set over them task masters to afflict them with their burdens they weren't very nice and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pick tall men Ramis or numbers 33 they departed from ram isis in the first month on the fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the children Vizier went out with a high hand in the slate of all the Egyptians what's the problem there was no city named Ramius in 1446 BC it was given this name by ravishes therefore the reason it goes the Exodus had to happen under a missus or even later so the 480 years is incorrect the Bible's unreliable itself contradictory got you throw it out not so fast cities and towns get name changes from time to time I remember Heather and I we saw the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 2000 when we were in New Amsterdam I mean Manhattan I was at New York City city and place names may change at some time during the writing or copying of the scroll of Exodus the scribe may have replaced the name of the town Moses departed from with the name of the town or city that the readers of that day would recognize ram uses Justin mean it was called by that name at the time of the Exodus now there's definite evidence that scribes did this sort of thing to help clarify it but for example Genesis 23 Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah died in Cuba the same as Hepburn in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to mourn for her weep for her here we see that Sarah was buried in Korea album the town was later renamed Hebron at the time that Genesis was committed to writing or when it was later copied the notation that it was now known as heaven was included and Abraham's time when he buried Sarah he'd never heard of everyone it was carrion agua well the same principle applies to the city a place called rye mrs. Jacob comes to Joseph we think from our timeline in 1876 BC and any event regardless of whether you think it was Ramius or not it was hundreds of years before the exodus and therefore had to have been hundreds of years before Bram uses so say brother Lyle scribes may have come on really that that's a little weak don't you have anything better than that oh I'm glad you asked yeah as a matter of fact the Bible let's get back to Joseph's story or get back to it the one that we hope to get to right pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren or come unto thee okay we're saying this is 1876 and it's certainly well before the time of Ramses the land of Egypt is before thee and the best of the land make thy father rather to dwell in the land of Goshen let them dwell if thou knowest any men have activity among them make them rulers over my cattle you know any Cowboys okay what do we have going on here so Pharaoh Pharaoh Pharaohs commandment sorry wrong button and the land of Goshen let them dwell that's what Pharoah said yes no yes okay good I'm glad you agree let's go to the next verse a couple of verses later Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out for before Pharaoh and Joseph places father his brethren that gave him a possession in the land of Egypt and the best of the land and the land of Ramy seized this Pharaoh had commanded I thought he said I thought we just read it it was Goshen Bram II seized the land of ramasees did not exist as that name hundreds of years before Rama seized it didn't this area known as Goshen was in the Nile Delta it was not Rama seized in Joseph's time but it's consistent with the passage in numbers 33 stating the Exodus started when departing from Rameses so while the names of the places being called promises in the biblical text it first appeared to be a problem for a date of 1446 they aren't what did we read from the Proverbs it's the glory of God to conceal not to destroy to hide you gotta dig it out to conceal a thing in the honor of kings to search it out bottom line you can't use a city or a region name to establish a boundary for the time of an historic event in the Bible if it existed or not that's one thing the name of it that's something else well there's another issue related to the date of the exodus that some people really love to bring up and that's about a fellow named Akhenaten if the exodus happened under ramasees the second is many contend then it was in the mid 1250 s bc we've established when Ramses was Pharaoh well the century earlier than Rama sis was this guy named egg Naughton he's called a Heretic Pharaoh he said there was one God he abolished the polytheistic religion of Egypt and he tried to convert Egypt to a monotheistic religion worshiping only the Sun God Rob well not as reformed it and last his son Tutankhamun King Tut reestablished the old polytheistic religion now if the Exodus happened under amesys the argument goes then moses hanging around the palace heard about this heretic guy and got the idea of one guy monotheism well Abraham was a monotheistic guy but but Abraham didn't establish a religion he beside a circumcision but he didn't establish a religion he didn't establish Judaism but but Moses did a religion with prayers and worship and altars and preachers and methods of sacrifice and dietary restrictions and dress codes in central Texan and Tabernacles with very precise dimensions as we heard this morning Moses did that but if the exodus is at 14:46 BC that turns the tables now Moses did this a hundred years before ignorin and Nick not maybe heard the rumor in the in the palace of a suppressed story about how a pharaoh was defeated by this eighty year old guy with a stick under one God so he thought that's pretty powerful maybe I'll go ahead and make a religion about that it it blows out the argument that Moses got this from McNaughton well there's another problem the New Kingdom Pharaoh 14:46 taught Moses a third as we've said now many Egyptologists place his reign of 54 years which apparently was starting at age two and they say well it started in 1479 be seen he died in the spring of 1425 BC this is based on information found in the tomb of a military commander named a Menna hat ma vu there's no test it's okay they paid his death which the inscription says was in his 54th year of reigning on the thirtieth day at the third month of the season for ret they say as 11 March 14 25 BC one of the very few pharaohs going back that you'll find where they nail a date why because it's a conflict with what the Bible says so they want to nail it down right and his accession when he came to the throne was on the first month of the season Shemin one day for which I'm sure you've all worked it out as a 24th of April 14 79 BC this is one of a very few Pharisees who's dating has known this accurate so if he didn't drown in the Red Sea in 1446 he died in 1425 so the Exodus maybe it's a fairy tale but at a minimum the timeline seems to be can't trust the Bible for history well okay Egyptian chronology who is a pharaoh when how long did he rule when you try and go back 3,000 years and more things get a little bit uncertain but in the Psalms we read the heavens declare his righteousness all the people see his glory I got up at 4 o'clock this morning to see the comet I don't know if and if you did that but it was kind of cool that all the people see his glory Psalms 19 the heavens declare the glory of God the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto day uttereth speech night and tonight show with knowledge there's no speech nor language or the voice is not heard everybody can see this guy well these days these days we have tools that can help us pinpoint times and events in history if we can tie these historically attested events to certain types of astronomical events this is similar to how we tied show shank into the Bible if we got some astronomical think we can tie we can nail down the particular Pharaoh at the particular time plus or minus regarding that particular event well it turns out just coincidentally that there's a three and a half thousand year old papyrus called the eber's one we're talking about which I come out a sheet of paper that's three and a half thousand years old and this records the sighting that's why it's a rare piece of paper right it records the sighting of an astronomical event called the heliacal rising of Sirius now the heliacal rising of Sirius happens every year but it occurred according to this papyrus this particular time on the ninth day of the third summer month of the ninth year of a men attempt the first now a men attempt the first is identified for this now he's the second Pharaoh the 18th dynasty he's Tut Moses the thirds great-grandfather we're getting pretty close okay got your shovels we got to do a little spade work here we got to get this foundation laid we got to make it solid I'm gonna spend about five or ten minutes now getting some getting a little technical it'll be worth it stay with me heliacal rising of Sirius if you can't see it that red arrow there that's pointing to Sirius the Sun happens to be below the horizon there behind the pyramids a heliacal jackal rising is the first appearance of a star in the morning sky now now some stars like the Polar Star doesn't matter you can see it any time of the year it's up there right but but Sirius is the brightest star in the sky after the Sun its position when viewed from the earth is such that it disappears it's washed out by the Sun for a period of time and then it sort of comes out from behind the Sun and then you can see it just before sunrise so it's the first visible sighting of Sirius just prior to sunrise after Sirius has been blocked by the brightness of the Sun due to the Earth's orbital position now and Egypt this is a very important observation because it coincided with the flooding of the Nile River everybody need you to live along the river but when that River rose sometimes it rose as much as 46 feet so we talked about RepRap watch out for flooding here in Tucson because it rained 3/10 of an inch we're not talking about that we're talking about 46 feet ok so it's important to not get caught on that flood the Nile flooding we knew the topsoil provided an irrigation this made Egypt one of the most reliable producers of wheat and grain in the ancient Near East the Niles 4,000 miles long it gets its water from the mountains of Central Africa near the equator so we know right Pope Gregory helped us out on this that a year's about 365 and a quarter days right so we put in a leap year every four years to get things back on track the ancient Egyptian solar calendar was 365 days they didn't have a leap year the result is at an annual event like for example the heliacal rising of Sirius it slips in the calendar by a day every four years six hours a year okay that's the characteristic of the calendar it's not a problem with the earth of the orbit or the length of the orbiter so this slippage in the Egyptian calendar is known as a suffix cycle it was first realized and calculated in 1904 just a little over a hundred years ago the result is that every one thousand four hundred and sixty-one years that slippage will bring things back to the same date and time again okay this is getting Jessica Brother wild bear with me bear with me the event is it's similar for us let's bring it to ourselves the moon has an orbit of a little over twenty nine days but our calendar has months of 30 or 31 days typically so what happens in 2020 this year in March on March 24th there was a new moon at April it wasn't to 24th it was the 23rd on May it was a 22nd and so forth it slips okay in 2021 when we get back to March the new moon won't be on the 24th it'll be on the 13th oh the next time that we'll have a new moon on March 24th isn't twenty thirty nine okay you're getting glassy-eyed let's take a break let's play a game we're gonna play a game called pretend okay now that's a little too juvenile for you we're gonna do a thought experiment that's what Einstein called it it still just pretended right here's the game okay everybody with me you're a future archaeologist you find an inscription someplace it says in the fourth year of President Trump the new moon occurred on March 24th now now from from the context of this record you're able to to note that that this inscription somehow was talking about the first half of the 21st century somewhere between 2000 and 2050 so you ask your Android watch hey Google give me a list of New Moon's on March 24th in the first half of the 21st century and it comes back and says 20 2014 13 9 okay so you know on that that he was either elected in 2016 because that's 2020 - for because it's the fourth year right or that he was elected in 2035 because that's 20 39 - 4 but if you know from another source maybe you found a copy of the Constitution or something that federal elections are only held in even years well you can rule out the 2035 date and pin his election being in 2016 so you're using that slippage of the calendar to help you nail down when some event in history occurred assembling clues so similarly this recorded observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius can be used to resynchronize the dates of Egyptian history and what we call the New Kingdom the error around the time of the Exodus with our modern calendar but to do this we have to know another piece of information we have to know where the sighting took place we have to know the latitude north or south of the Equator or the observation occurred for I'll give you another example this year 2020 the heliacal rising of Sirius here in Tucson will be seen on August the 3rd that's just a couple of weeks from now brother Matt Beaufort South Carolina is the same August the 3rd but if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area Reno somewhere in that latitude it'll be August 11th 8 years 8 days later before you'll see if you live up in the Seattle area it'll be August 19th latitude matters and of course in Seattle that's only if the skies clear ok well here's a a map that's really hard to see but this is Egypt and I've got two arrows there if the sighting that's recorded in the days of tech Moses great-grandfather was in Memphis which is up near the Nile Delta then this sighting took place in 1537 BC you don't have to remember that if the observation took place in Thebes further south than it was in 1517 BC that's called below or the south chronology this is called the high or the North chronology these two locations are marked on red here now most scholars of Egyptian stuff agree that the sighting was most likely in the south and most of the references you'll find if you look things up and the New Kingdom and Egypt will use this low chronology sometimes they identify they're doing it sometimes they don't know it's probably not going to be a big surprise to those of you that are still awake but the high chronology which was accepted by only a small minority of scholars syncs up perfectly with the Bible while the low chronology far more popular doesn't is there some way that we can decide it so some way we can know which of these is correct we can't say well this one syncs up with a Bible it's got to be correct because we're talking to people that don't accept the Bible's accuracy right that's their whole argument remember we're dealing with our youth being told science in the Bible do not agree the Bible's philosophy is to religion it's not accurate for historical purposes so it's no more valid than Hinduism Buddhism Islam or atheism rampant skepticism okay this is the June 18th 2010 issue of science May 2010 10 years ago information in here that was not known 11 years ago 2010 our calendar right what's what is it this issue of this magazine reported findings of an unprecedented investigation by Oxford University using something called radio carbon or carbon 14 we'll talk about that in just a moment using these dating methods on more than 200 organic plant based sample seeds and things like that that could be directly associated with various Pharaohs we found this Pharaoh and in his money we found these coriander seeds or something like that and in cooperation with a large number of museums to get all these samples because these are very rare and very valuable and working with other scientists in Europe and Israel and what did they determine I know this is really hard to see I'm going to point it out ahead of time this is a minute f1 this is the guy that we're talking about with this heliacal rising of Sirius this blue line you see here trust me it's a blue line that's the low chronology this red line that's right in the middle of this gray bump right in the middle of this little bracket down here that's the high chronology okay well the gray bump is the result of the radiocarbon dating as you get closer to the middle where it Peaks up is more and more certain more and more samples and they ran millions of tests on each of these samples what what is this showing that the high chronology the red line is the right one it aligns with the science that was done one decade ago nobody could know this they could only surmise it or my PS my pastor said or I think or I believe or it might have been it is the high chronology rigorous scientific research supported the biblical narrative of the time of the excess but not until 2010 in Romans Paul tells us is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me every tongue shall confess to God Oxford University just did that right this is well documented peer-reviewed science these researchers put this information plus other research together in this book that was published by Oxford in 2013 seven years ago seven years ago 15:37 BC is just 11 years before Moses birth in 1526 if the Exodus was in 1446 when he was 80 okay I don't know what this does for you but it seems that God placed a worker he placed it in the sky and a piece of paper that survived 3,500 years and some guys too so that they could come together in our day and be decoded to mark the central event in time of the entire Old Testament the Exodus okay we're laying foundations this is a two minute trust me you can set your watch maybe two and a half minutes an explanation of what does carbon-14 also known as radiocarbon what it is what it means for dating these kinds of things that dr. mcfadden feel free to jump in and correct with Peter's PhD is in carbonyl carbon this element 12 carbon 12 on the periodic table of the elements you recall this when you memorized it from high school chemistry I'm sure all of you said oh yeah carbon 12 I see that our upper atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic rays this releases neutrons this results in the formation of a tiny amount of carbon-14 which is a standard plain old carbon atom with two extra neutrons that got smashed into these combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide co2 this stuff the winds atmospheric currents bring it down to the surface of the earth and what happens plants down here bring it in through photosynthesis all that high school biology stuff that you need you to learn here it is okay so it's absorbed by these plants as long as they're living and doing photosynthesis what happens when the plant dies it's not doing photosynthesis anymore okay carbon-14 is rare but it's formed all the time this way but but for every one atom of carbon 14 there is one trillion a thousand billion a million million regular plain old carbon-12 atoms so this stuff is pretty rare in fact it was only discovered in 1940 eighty years ago 1939 nobody knew it existed okay now carbon-14 is mildly radioactive so no if you've been in your garden at night you know plants don't glow in the dark so either will you if you eat your broccoli okay but but carbon-14 decays to carbon-12 over time it has a half-life which means that if you've got a pile of carbon-14 half of it will become carbon-12 and about 5730 years okay if we know what the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon-12 was when a plant was alive and then when it dies and stops absorbing that co2 we measured the ratio of a carbon 14 to carbon 12 and the remaining plant material that we have these seeds that came from the mummy or something then we can measure that ratio we get an idea when the plant died the method is statistical in age remember that great bunk wasn't just a line it was a bump because there's there's it's statistics it says well there's a 90% chance at this and a 50% chance at sis and a 10% chance it's this okay so and what do I mean by that if you go to Betsy Betsy Ross's scrapbook and take a piece of cotton from the flag or something that she made and try and carbon dated it's not going to come back and say dink dink dink dink July 4th 1776 it's not going to do that but it'll save somewhere between 1760 and 1790 or or or perhaps between 1772 1780 it'll really help narrow it down we know that it wasn't in 1600 this time goes by science gets better and better at using and understanding the limitations of carbon-14 and time to wake up we're done with carbon-14 okay now what's just any irony in this it depended on the science and the technology of our day 21st century not 20th century of our day to decode this marker this day of skeptics it took a combination of astronomy and plant biology and atmospheric physics and particle accelerators and radioactive decay and celestial mechanics and computer modeling notice if you resynchronize the löwe chronology dates by the 20 years that this implies Tut moses 1/3 will have died and 1445 not 1425 Egyptian records indicate his death being in the march/april time of year same time of years the Exodus 14:45 1446 one year of potential discrepancy when you're going back three and a half thousand it's right inside our plus or minus one year window bull's eye the he boosts up cited mean to wake up the baby the Hebrew scribes who copied Moses record had no knowledge of future calendars they made up a new one Exodus 12:12 this month will be 12 - this will be the first month of the year for you your time anchor your foundation fresh start no knowledge of astronomy or or Suffolk cycles or radio isotope decays required God said you start counting now God knew what he was doing when he anchored Old Testament chronology to the Exodus and left us a marker to be decoded 3500 years after the event when we most needed it when society is really getting adamant about how unreliable the Bible is couple hundred years ago people still generally accepted it now they don't and now we can use their very tools they're very methods to show that it's right god forbid paul writes let God be true and every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged Christianity is silly trusting in the Bible overcome when thou art judged I love this I can't prove the Exodus but I can see it almost impossibly precise correlation between the Bible's account and what science and technology and archaeology and history and ancient Egyptian records tell us it maybe it's just a coincidence it's just serendipity right now we got a look at the other kind of evidence that says maybe this isn't quite that precise right there are some lunar sightings that are recorded in Egyptian records at dealing with the absence of seeing a thin Crescent at the new moon we're told this has a 25 year cycle based on interpretations of what that means and relying on the accuracy of the observations whose techniques were not all that certain of in the reign of tech Moses the third some not all but some Egyptologists that accept the high chronology they argue that he didn't as he didn't die in 1425 but we have to use a 25 year offset not just a 20 year offset and so he died in 1450 they say other Egyptologists of fit some other lunar observations especially associated with the Battle of Megiddo and suggest he died in 1447 or 1448 what's going on first of all all these are a very tight cluster around 1446 and we're going back an amazing amount of time but how did they make this fit well they make it fit by adjusting the range of his father his grandfather or this guy didn't really start on this one for 13 years it was 12 okay since the knowledge of the lengths of many of these rains are not known precisely and have to be inferred from little bits of archaeological stuff historical fragment ori evidence it appears to be cheating but it's not really cheating it's part of detective work as part of trying to reconstruct what happened from the bits of evidence that you have here and there and how much do you trust this evidence versus that evidence and so forth as you get more evidence you look back you see if you made an error how does a new evidence fit evaluate to reliability the evidence this is just the so-called scientific method it's the Bible method it's what Paul told us and Thessalonians test everything evaluate reevaluate if new evidence appears it's a sort of thing that brother Branham meant I believe when he said that we should not end our list of what we believe in a period but with a comma he said this many times I'm going to give you two examples verses from 1955 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said now if you can believe what you believe in and your faith with a comma instead of a period saying I believe this and nothing else if you put a comma if you end it with a period I believe this plus all the rest God will show me now that's the way to do it I believe this that I have is the faith I've got this part and I'm ready to learn something else that God will tell me and teach me then you've got an open heart and the Bible said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another the blood of Jesus Christ God's Son cleanses us from all unrighteousness what a beautiful scripture skies eternal teachings walk and the light move make progress learn don't sit don't sunbathe the second example is from thy seed shall possess a gate at his enemy in 1962 he said now watch you'll never win the opinion of the organization one person no sir when they've got their rule set we believe this period if you write up your doctrine we believe this comma it would be different a period means we believe this you've got to come to this and sign this paper or that's it but if you say we believe this comma plus as much as we can learn from God we're open to the Holy Spirit things are going on brother yes it's gonna be different now remember the whole science of archaeology the study of Egyptology are only about two hundred years old they came into being at the very time the skeptic started seriously calling the Bible's historical authority into question now there's still a lot of uncertainty in dating many pharaohs the lengths of their reins in this book there's a quote on page 27 it says the Egyptian historical chronology is perhaps best summed up by professor kitchen in 1991 and his classic paper historical and archaeologist oracle and archaeological chronologies if egypt have long provided a backbone for establishing time scales in world history and archaeology however they do not provide that backbone easily or with uniform exactitude bottom line for the Exodus we appear to be at most four years off after three and a half thousand years and likely within one year now science cannot conclusively dispute this state nor can they absolutely confirm it but science tells us it's eminently plausible and our time anchor to resynchronize the calendars this rare preserved papyrus recording the annual helical rise of Sirius happened less than a century before the Exodus Justin get much better than that well brother Lyle is there any other evidence to tie the reign of Tut Moses the third to the Exodus well let me refer to that the list of six items she had there okay here's one what about evidence of brick-making by hebrew slaves I'm glad you asked it was the right question look it's just synchronized right with this one of our checklist items was Hebrew slaves making mud bricks we read the Bible verse about that earlier this is a part of the wall of a tomb of Tut Moses vizier of his number one right hand guy his construction manager these guys built a lot of magnificent structures and the construction manager is a pretty important guy Breck Mary so there's a mural of Semitic and nubian slaves making bricks the text on the wall of the tomb indicates the slaves were prisoners of war from Nubia that's to the south on Africa and Cyril Palestine that's where the Hebrew people lived right this establishes that during the reign of Teck Moses third there were in fact Hebrew slaves making bricks was strong that aligns with the Bible story yeah what's this about prisoners of war well this is before the Geneva Conventions okay Kings routinely went to war they captured people to work as slaves prisoners of war now from about 1650 to 1550 BC right this is before the Exodus Jeep Egypt was conquered and ruled by a group known as the Hyksos not a lot is known about these guys but it's in the period between Joseph and Moses when the New Kingdom began the area that includes the Exodus Egypt was once again ruled by Egyptians anything or anyone they took from the hexose including slaves was war booty so calling the Hebrew slaves prisoners of war is not inconsistent with the biblical narrative well another checklist item was at the fair word the Exodus had chariots to tuck Moses the third have chariots well there's a famous text that tells us of his first military campaign when he was about 21 years old and and this this I'm gonna read you a short little quote here it's a paraphrase from this from this ancient document along with other supporting information was published in 2016 four years ago by National Geographic and a issue called the most influential figures of ancient history the Pharaoh defied his advisors and surprised his foes by surging through a treacherous mountain pass to mount a deadly direct attack on Megiddo he rode up front during that perilous advance to show that he trusted in the gods to protect him in his troops and indeed all made it through the pass unscathed then he entered the battle at Megiddo quote on a chariot of fine gold decked in his shining armor Gaza lling and intimidating his opponents okay most Pharaoh's commanded their troops but they didn't lead them in fact of the time that I spent researching us I didn't find another one that conclusively led his troops this guy rode in the front and he had a chariot well why is it important if he rode in front let's read from Exodus the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon dry ground the waters were a wall unto them on to the left hand and on the right the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared in the egyptians fled against it in the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in midst of the sea the waters returned covered the chariots the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came in to see after them that remained not so much as one of them in other words they drowned well Moses celebrates after this he's pretty happy guy and so were all these other people that that came through the Red Sea right so what is he what does he say the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath he cast into the sea as chosen captains are also drowned in the Red Sea the dread depths have covered them they sank to the bottom as a stone and a few verses later for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea there's another account of this that's in the Psalms there's lots of accounts but we'll just stop with this one to him this is Psalm 136 to him which divided the Red Sea into parts for his mercy endureth forever and made Israel to pass through the midst of it for His mercy endureth forever but overthrew Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red Sea for his mercy endureth forever okay warning for little kids the next image might be a little bit disturbing because it's a picture of a mummy's head okay so just want to warn you in case you want to deal with that but this is a head shot a pet Moses the Third's mummified remains this is the man who whispered Moses and God 3,500 years ago in Egypt they say wait a minute brother a while if his army sank is a stone how could we have his money well Exodus 14 thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore bodies float you can be sure the Egyptians are going to locate and retrieve the Pharaohs body right he's considered a God by these people now close reading of the biblical text doesn't unequivocally state that Pharaoh drowned the verses we read they strongly suggest that he did if he was riding in the front of his troops he most certainly did okay well what about his firstborn that was on the list Exodus 11 Moses said thus saith the Lord about midnight will they go out into the midst of Egypt and all the firstborn of the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even did the firstborn of the maidservant behind the mill and the first one of the beasts Egyptian history records that Tut Moses thirds firstborn son and then and had the guy that was going to be the Pharaoh pre deceased him his son died might have been during the plagues we don't know the dates unknown it's suggested that it was some years before but his son his firstborn died well what about the daughter of Pharaoh that saved him as a boy who was Pharaoh then how does that tie him well here's another one of these hard to read timelines here we see a timeline of the Pharaohs from the Sirius observation I don't that's not serious like not funny but that's serious like the name of the star that's right there until the Exodus where our timeline is anchored and there's the pharaohs and then attempt the first Tut Moses the first son Moses I co-taught Moses the third the guy we're talking about and the end of Tut Moses the third okay the pharaohs listed in their dates are based on historical records and the best reconstructions that Egyptologists can do and take into account the high core knowledge II that was confirmed by the oxford university a minute tip the first rains for twenty-one years until about 15 26 now the length of his reign is known it's documented in lots of places in Egyptian history as being either 20 years and seven months or twenty-one years and we know that the ninth year of his reign included the year 15:37 BC from the helical rising of Sirius so his son Tut Moses a first takes over around 15 2016 so about 15 13 the length of that rain is disputed well Tut Moses the first this guy that's raining in 1526 he had a well-known daughter from a royal wife a mozi that was the name of his wife she was a pharaonic ancestry her father was a pharaoh lot lots of Pharaohs in her in her background the daughter's name Hatshepsut now he had a few sons as well but had ship suits the only daughter that I could find listed in any of the of the places I was able to look so it's quite possible but it's not certain but it's quite possible that she was a daughter of the Pharaoh that rescued Moses as a baby now about the start of Chuck Moses ones reign we read Pharaoh that's Tut Moses the first charged all his people saying every son that is born you shall cast into the river and every daughter you shall save alive now he's only the Pharaoh in 1526 the guy with the daughter if the Exodus happened in 1446 if the high chronology was in 1537 okay well we know the story would happen from the biblical narrative Moses is born he's hidden for three months then he sent floating down the Nile in a basket and Miriam his sister's watching to see what would happen and it says the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her matey's walked along by the river side when she saw the Ark among the flags of kind of a weed that grows along the river she sent her maid to fetch it and when she opened it she saw the child to behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him she had compassion on him she knows the edict kill all the male Hebrew children she knows that you declared compassion on this guy she said this is one of the Hebrews children then said Moses sister to a Pharaoh's daughter shall I go and call to the inner city Hebrew women that she nursed a child for thee that's pretty bold but Pharaoh's daughter was was pretty young at this point but I think she's between 10 and 13 years old and she's not really shocked to see him Hebrew nearby they've got lots of slaves around here maybe just thought choose another one of the servants well we know the story the child Moses grew and she Moses birth mother and wet nurse brought Moses under Pharaoh's daughter and Moses became Pharaoh's daughter's son and Pharaoh's daughter called his name Moses she said because I drew him out of the water so here's this this young very young woman with compassion an act of kindness who was she Shep suit would have been about ten to thirteen years old at this time that's based on her age of death determined by examining her mummy and so forth it's not unusual in these days for a thirteen-year-old a woman to have a child and notice that everyone in the royal house at this time is Moses this and Moses that Tut Moses went up Moses to tuck Moses three her mother's name was I'll mosey right so she just called him Moses well how did Moses escape Egypt at age forty when Pharaoh wanted to execute him for killing an Egyptian Fissel official that's on the checklist and in fact it's the only remaining item now for something that I think will really surprise you it really surprised me when I dug into it and realized that when I was looking into these chronologies and trying to see how this stuff fit together and you can go ahead and wake up now because we're coming to the end okay so last of the evidence we'll talk about for our foundation for tonight but back to the timeline but with Moses added to it the events again on the top of the timeline are historical the events below the timeline are biblical and this is a statue of hatshepsut in her adulthood so Tut Moses the first ranged until about 1513 Tut Moses the two rains until about 1499 and then tete Moses the third rains for 54 years remember he came to the throne at age 2 he's not going to be a very effective Fero at age two okay so what happens in Egypt when this kinds of things occurred they had a regent a person that acted on behalf of the Pharaoh that basically said Pharaoh says do this Pharaoh says do that maybe he said googoo gaga we don't know but we're told that Pharaoh said this or that and this regent calls the shots until the Pharaoh is old enough and powerful enough to be Pharaoh in his own right now Hatshepsut perhaps Moses adoptive mom possibly we don't know she becomes region and her stepson she had no sons she had a daughter and no more children she couldn't have children after that her stepson aunt and her nephew took Moses the Third's only two years old when his father her husband dies well 13 years later she's still calling the shots Tut Moses the third is fifteen or sixteen I'm sure he has an opinion and I'm sure that he's expressing it he's a teenager right but at this time right here Moses kills an Egyptian a minor official of some sort and he has to flee Egypt Hatshepsut is still co-regent until her death eight years later or so when she's in her mid to late 50s perhaps as old to sixty which is why I put her birth in around fifteen thirty eight making her 10 to 13 years old when Moses little Reed shake basket was floating down a river so for a large fraction of her co-regency in fact she took on the title of pharaoh well let's read Exodus 2 when Pharaoh Thutmose is the third heard this thing the killing of the Egyptian / Caesar he sought to slay Moses Shep suit we got to get this guy she wants to kill him right maybe he's a threat I mean this guy's 15 or 16 he's sitting on the throne but he's only 15 or 16 but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh perhaps he's allowed to escape by that other pharaoh Hatshepsut and dwelt in the land of Midian he sat down by well it's plausible that had ships it was a person who saved Moses life as a baby she certainly fits but it's certain that she was sitting on the throne when he was a 40 year old Hebrew accused murderer of an Egyptian official a Hebrew who was not executed for his crime Hatshepsut snuck in a countenance Moses killing an Egyptian official he is after all a Hebrew but she doesn't want to punish him as a Hebrew and kill him she'd been unique position on all of this stuff she's taken care of him for 40 years she has no natural son adoptive mother or not Moses lived in the panelists and hatshepsut doing quite well do you think that a well known around the palace guy like Moses his space is sort of everywhere could really evade pursuit by a determined Pharaoh in order to avoid being punished for this murder especially if the Pharaoh really wanted him killed so unlikely perhaps it's possible maybe it was something like you're really gonna fix Moses I'm gonna give you a three-day head start something we don't know we can only speculate but hatshepsut seems to have intervened here bandages and Moses flees not for his life but with his life she saved his life perhaps for the second time from a feral impose death test all things hold to that which is good well we've checked every item on our list we're closing now I'd like to invite our musicians to come having laid this foundation I think we've pretty well established sat 1446 is the date of the exodus we can now move to the time of Joseph we'll have many many events in his life in Egypt to examine and see if they synchronize with Egyptian history and culture speaking of time of course we've just run out so we'll do the concluding part of this next week be prepared for an amazing journey through the Scriptures in parallel history science and culture I realized tonight was laying bricks building foundations watching concrete dry ok but here are some of the questions we'll ask an answer next week can we verify the 430 years before the Exodus date for Joseph that dates very important who was the Pharaoh whose dreams Joseph interpreted can we identify this guy and if we can can we understand why this Pharaoh was so agitated about those dreams was there some special connection there why did the butler remember about Joseph being able to interpret dreams all of a sudden what was the triggering event I'm sure Pharaoh had a lot of dreams at different times what was the triggering event that caused him to remember how did Joseph become a father to Pharaoh how does that work is there any evidence about seven years of plenty followed by a seven-year famine Egyptians aren't going to record the famine but is there evidence that says that's what happened why was Joseph able to bury his father Jacob in Canaan why wasn't Joseph able to be buried in Canaan himself how well do modern science Egyptian history and Egyptian culture mesh with the biblical narrative of Joseph do they actually support the Genesis account well answer these questions next week oh I gotta give you a teaser I got to get you back in here right I'm gonna close next week with a personal testimony about the Joseph of Genesis wait a minute brother while he lived almost 4000 years ago yeah you heard right a personal testimony but you have to wait a next week to hear it so as we end the season being serviced and brother Aaron comes I'd like us to sing how great is our God mm if I can I how great is our God how great is His Word he's the greatest wha that ever was he rolled back the wall of the mighty Red Sea and he said I will your trust in me can we trust him can we trust this coracle accuracy the Bible how great is our God how great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was worth he won't actors love the mighty red sea and it said as I was talking with brother while before he came out little bit I asked him a question but he didn't understand the question that I asked him so he told me what he's gonna preach what kind of went over it so I heard it twice he gave me shorter but I was asking him us what makes you look at things this way and he heard it as what are you gonna say but I'm glad there's people that will take a chance and look or or the gumption whatever you want to call it to go and say hey what makes this work what makes this happen brother Branham says this and it came to me as you think they are going to come very close to finding the secret of life so that means they're looking that means they're wanting to know now if man can find the secret of life they're gonna say I don't need God I can do it myself the BAM says but he'll put a stop to it because he's the only one that gives us life and I sure do appreciate he did say one other thing that I will have to I don't know maybe see the opposite side he said a two-year old Pharaoh really couldn't do a whole lot I know a lot of two-year-olds that can keep us going all day I happen to think of my grandson Asher about that Abel and I said boy boy they really can give us some but I praise God that he's got everything in his hand and in his control I believe God I believe God it shall be done just as he said oh I believe God [Music] even as I said [Music] look up and say leave look up they would come up in a prayer line brother Brandon would be there and you know as he's talking to the folks he says you know what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for him then he would say he's here and they would become appraised and he would look emesis now your name is and this happened in your life and what was he doing he was going back and showing him that this God knew all about it and he was giving them faith he was giving them that to be able to believe in hold when God opens the word and makes it real to you and you can show you from every angle that he's the same yesterday today and forever then you can stand it a critic and like he said you don't have to be harsh you have to be mean you can just say hey the Word of God and science of course has to back it because God laid all the laws out God knows every language he knew what writing was he knew so God has had his hand in it all and I appreciate him I did if you saw me walk out there I got in a phone call and it was an emergency brother Tony Ramirez he lives down on Mission Road to south towards Green Valley along the city at the mountains and there was a lightning strike yesterday and a fire started and they've been warned that they may have to evacuate it is headed in their direction so he called me and asked for prayer brother Tony and sister Mary are little in the elderly side and it physically is hard for them I have not heard back from him but let's keep them in prayer I know there's the Cardenas family was living right next door to them that used to attend church here I don't know if they still live but their folks out there so just trusting the Lord would keep them but you know that God is the same yesterday today and forever if he can say Levi pay tithe through his grandfather great-grandfather Abraham then he knows exactly what happens so and I appreciate let's stand amen he is Lord he is Lord every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess I want to do it willingly today Oh [Music] though he has risen from the dead [Music] [Music] time Jesus [Music] he's my lord he's mine [Music] oh he is my lord here's my lord [Music] he has risen from the dead and he is my lord [Music] every [Applause] [Music] ah gee surprise [Music] and I just asked this question how many have have you would it was race hand would say I've had somebody come back to me and say prove it show me in the Bible where it says that show me in history where it shows that give me a scientific proof I've had people say y'all you can't prove that you know I had a man tell me that when the Apostles died all they God did in his manifestation died with them but I have proof living proof that Jesus Christ is alive the same yesterday today and forever so let your life be a witness of a Living God not an argument of spirit not of I'm going to fight with you but look at what he's done her brother there was was baptized today made a comment about TL Osborn who had said he had gone to India for two years to try to witness to try to tell in the India about Jesus Christ and the people just saying well we have our Bible we have ours and and TL Osborn came back and said III was a failure because God did not vindicate in other words they didn't see God moving and what this man was saying but when brother Branham walks in all the different accounts and stands before all these religions and he said but I will show you if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he will back up what he says and he did it over and over and over he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let him indicate your life as a Christian that's what I want for others they say well it must be because you're a living witness a living testimony of just Christ the same yesterday 10 let's bow our heads Lord we thank you that that no matter what man would look that they're gonna is going to come a day that they're going to have to say you are Lord and their tongue is going to have to confer a gratitude in our hearts to know you as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Lord Father we've just won not to make ourselves known but the true Living God we made known amongst ourselves Lord and let it be known Lord as they would say there truly is a Christian one that is like Christ Lord thank you for what we have heard today Lord I'm a it just may grow in our hearts even more so lord I want to know you more I want to draw closer to you I want to be more like you Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen brother man I'm gonna ask you to sing this and am persuaded that he is able to keep is he not able to keep [Music] [Music] leave it and am persuaded that he is a to keep them we Chuck me unto it against that day I know now why God's grace price but I know my heavily and persuade we truck me to against that day I know they stay believe me [Applause] within my my Emily and immerse way and [Music] to me and to and Nonna spirit come wingman [Music] in Jesus three [Laughter] No my Emily [Music] we gasps every time I want to sing and I have I have a hard time getting this started so brother man today God bless you God be with you this week that your life testify of a Living God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we'll gather together on Wednesday Lord willing if not I'll meet you in the morning amen what a day that will be when
