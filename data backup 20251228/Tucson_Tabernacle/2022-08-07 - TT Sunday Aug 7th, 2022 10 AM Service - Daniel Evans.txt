time [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen it's something about that song and as if brother matt was leading anything that what a friend we have in jesus you might think of the best friend you have somebody has been dear to you somebody's been precious to you and you appreciate that friendship but oh what a friend to having jesus we were driving coming into service and sister martha peterson said you and your wife looked like you were in a serious discussion as we drove by and i said where i was we were talking about the events of today and how everything seems so much closer than it has but we know who has it all under control so there doesn't have to be any fear or any nervousness about it in fact our hearts should be crying out even so come quickly lord jesus but as brother matt had us and he went to that chorus what a friend we have in jesus above anything or everything he is the one that cares most so we have a couple of requests to bring to your account and i kind of bring this up um a lady well known to our family on my side of family and my wife's her name is ali hauser she is she was a manager at pima college and a good percentage of the my wife's side of the family my girls worked under her over the years through pima college through the bookstores my daughter naomi worked for many years under her she had suffered breast cancer and and had gone through that some years back but just she's retired now and just recently she had mentioned to my daughter that she'd been in a lot of having a lot of stomach trouble they took her into to the hospital and naomi told her that they told her that just to go home enjoy the last couple weeks of her life is what the doctor said so we got to thinking about the time of getting to know them and this may be a little strange but i'll share it [Music] when naomi was just just a baby my wife's first cousin was shot and killed in a fight and of course that's that's hard to take and there were no grandchildren and he was the eldest of the family at the funeral there was a wreath that said love you daddy and nobody knew what was wrong well my wife's cousin and this lady ellie had a little child and the family didn't know and we might look at that as wrong but there was a little girl in the family from her family and the son who they grew up and we all got to know now you would look and say well yeah but i don't like how that happened but god had a reason for and why because i remember the comfort it was to my wife's uncle and aunt to have a child from there but now ellie they've given her that but i know a god and how many know that god how many know him personally he is more than able you know to raise one to take him up you could already be in the grave and he can call you out so we just remember that family it affects my wife's side the family and the houser family and a lot of the workers from pima college and there's also another young man that requested prayer in a situation that he has and we won't mention the names or anything but he was on my heart last night and this morning somebody approached me he said remember this young man so god knows the need there and if he'll stand with me you have a need we always have something lord even if i can't put it in words i'll raise my hand lord because i need you need you more than ever before lord we we come not as a hope looking to maybe a a man-made god a god of our own imagination a god of our our how we would like a god but to you the living god and we place all our cares upon you all our troubles lord even job said man is but a short time and full of troubles lord and sometimes they seem to overtake us but our hope is built on nothing less than jesus christ and his righteousness and what a friend we have in jesus you see every hand raised every heart here lord remembering the hauser family and all those affected on both sides lord for comfort for strength lord even for a miracle today lord i wonder they would have to say only god could do this lord this young man in need of prayer for a decision that he has to make lord we ask for mercy and leadership in his life today lord and each hand raised lord would you meet with him lord for he ask it in jesus christ's name amen oh heal me o lord and i will be saving and i will be saved heal me o lord and i will be for you the one i pray [Music] you are the one i just think he has agreed to do that so that's looking at those plans and then brother jordan sent me a whatsapp early this morning and about having another prayer meeting like we did thursday friday saturday from 6 to 8 p.m and it's something that we had talked about we just hadn't set it up so the 18th of august through the 20th of august thursday friday saturday from 6 to 8 the church will be open for prayer like we did last time you come and pray and then you leave and you're done and we'll have the church open and then having on the sunday the next sunday having communion and and washington service something we've not done for a while and folks have been asking so let's plan on that if we would could and just see what the lord would have for us and then just a a reminder we're still working on the the details of september the fourth the first sunday of september a lot of the folks will be on out of town with the wedding of brother enoch peterson so we're still looking whether that service will be canceled or will we be able to all the musicians song leaders and sound will be gone basically so we're just looking we haven't officially canceled that but we're looking at that possibility so those are some of the things coming up for the month of august but god is good brother dan mentioned talking with him a little bit and you ministers know how the middle of the night you wake up and you wonder is that what i should be ministering is that what i should be doing and i did something i don't do often on a saturday late afternoon as i took a nap because i want to be able to sleep through the night and i was about five o'clock i woke up at one o'clock in the morning i don't think i've ever taken such a short nap i mean long nap but when i woke up brother dan brother ohio came on my heart i said i don't know if they're awake at this time lord but would you just settle in their heart that it's okay he told me that's about where he was wondering lord is this but you know that's a call in a sermon of god's heart is lord what will help the people what would be good for the church you know and and so when you know we're going to have a wednesday night service a sunday service if you wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning say lord remember the minister remember the brothers because sometimes they're still awake at that time asking lord is this is this what you want so trusting that the lord has something for us how many believe that lord and i'm willing to receive what you have for me let's stand now amen amazing grace how sweet the sound brother branham said there's nothing like the grace of god he said when you get over the other side you'll find me over there still singing amazing grace how sweet the sound [Music] amazing grace how sweet the sound always saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now now let's praise him for that grace of god in our lives praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] what better thing could we do with every breath that we take then praise god it's good to see every one of you out i like seeing some of these empty seats filled let's turn to ezekiel chapter 36. i've been been traveling a little bit again but aaron and the brothers made the announcement last week where aaron had something on his heart to preach on sunday morning and then there was a testimony service on sunday night and i accepted an invitation to go up to phoenix and minister brother mcgary's church over the weekend and it was it was a nice service but i i feel bad that i missed the testimony service but i went back and i watched it ezekiel chapter 36 and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen and friends that mean that word heathen it's it's also translated as nations outside of israel it doesn't necessarily mean idolaters it just means those that are outside of israel and outside the jewish race which ye have profaned in the midst of them and heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for i will take from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then i will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols while i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god i will also save you from all your uncleanness and i will call for the corn and will increase it and will lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase of the field and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sake do i do this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded and the desolate shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of of all that passed by and they shall say this land was desolate it has become like the garden of eden and the waste and the desolate and the ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that which was desolate i the lord have spoken and i will do it friends no matter how bad you've sinned no matter what you've done the lord says i will restore and you will be a testimony that to anyone that has ever known you let's pray lord jesus what wonderful words i have just read lord the anointing on your word is wonderful i pray that it stays in the congregation this morning father may our hearts be opened and may our hearts not be not stony but be soft and gentle and ready to receive whatever you would have in jesus christ's name amen god bless you my friends you can take your seats it's good to

always has something good for me in the morning and and she said something that that really struck me the other day she said brother daniel she says i pray every morning that the lord fills me with this holy spirit and that touched me so much i thought about paul and paul paul said i died daily and it just it blessed me so much and she said not only do i pray that the lord fill me with his holy spirit she said but i pray that the lord fill this whole building with his holy spirit and then she said i pray that the lord fill this whole university of arizona campus with the holy spirit i

have to get her to sing more often brother dominique i really appreciated that testimony my brother and how the lord had had brought you in to the word into the message and brought you into this church and uh it was it was a blessing to me i liked i liked what he said i wrote it down he said this he says he said when he sees a believer he can spot him and he says when he sees him he says i know you he said he said i'm trying to be down with you brother we're trying to be down with you too man god bless you and you know brother donna meek preach this gospel whoever you're around my brother preach it from the house top you know you said you wanted your family to come in wherever you are my brother witnessed to this you know the bible teaches us jesus taught us in matthew chapter five he said you are the light of this world you know and then he talks about you know that song this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine it comes from matthew chapter five and it says you don't light a candle and put it under a bushel and hide it he said you light that candle and you let it shine so my brother you let that shine you keep doing it my friend don't cover it up keep letting it shine spread that light god bless your loyal heart keep it up i want to encourage you my friend whoever you're around talk about this message talk about god talk about what he did for you tell them how your candle got lit god bless you um you know the paul said this he said he said christ gave himself for the church that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word and i you know the it's been raining lately the monsoons and we've had a good monsoon like we had last year and i always look at the desert in june and in early july and it just looks so dead you know i look out there and the plants are dried up and they're shriveled and there's been such a drought in the southwest and and then you put a little bit of water to that desert and man oh man it greens up those cactuses swell up the flowers start coming out and everything starts looking like it's alive and that's how a christian is we can go without water for a long time we can separate ourselves but the lord starts putting that water on us and and you see that just start to bloom out i was listening to the rain last night i was up all night i couldn't couldn't sleep and and that rain was coming down and i was thinking those cactuses are just swelling and and the lord's just blessing his his desert and his plants and and he's also blessing his people i i had it on my heart really strong to preach on the book of malachi it it was something that i've been wanting to preach for a long time my wife can testify to that i keep saying that i'm going to preach on this and and i had everything ready and and i sat back in my chair brother aaron on friday night and i had a sermon ready and i was studying and i thought wow usually i'm late late saturday night preparing for my service preparing for my sermon and and i just felt good i woke up the next morning and i had this book of malachi on my heart and i just couldn't wait couldn't wait to preach about it to the church and everything that's in that book it's so deep and it it just it ends the old testament and the old testament just builds and builds and builds to this capstone and it talks about that there would be a messenger come and introduce the lord jesus and i couldn't wait to to um preach on it and stephanie i was walking on on saturday and and we were talking just rejoicing over the word and rejoicing over the lord jesus and and something told me don't don't preach on it you know preach on salvation again and you know friends it's so hard it's it's so hard to know what the lord wants you know he's he's he's there and we think oh just ask the lord it's not that easy and especially when you stand in this hallowed ground right here i never want to make a mistake i never want to say something that's wrong and i may say something that's completely right but it may be out of time it may be not the right time to say it and yeah a minister has to be so careful you things come to you and it says oh that sounds good and it gets you excited and and you want to you want to preach about it you may you may hear somebody else minister about it or whatever it might be and then there's no anointing there and it just fails and you look back and you say lord how did i how did i mess that one up and it's because it sounded good and you thought oh this will this will be good and you didn't consult the lord enough about it we have to be so careful of that even though it could be 100 right it could be at the wrong time to bring it and that's how i felt about ministering on on this book of malachi and felt like no he wanted me to talk again about salvation and again about the lord jesus i spoke last time about the hebrews and how they came out of egypt and they went up to caitis barnea and they failed there then 40 years later they went over the jordan and they conquered all the land and now caleb he faced these giants and he conquered them because he had god with him and he put his trust in god and then i brought it down to matthew chapter five jesus's first public sermon and how jesus got the people together on the mountain he already had he already had notoriety he had already been healing the sick and he had been preaching from house to house but this was the first public sermon and he brought things that no one had really ever heard and he raised the bar and and he said that that these things that i preach that's something like like marriage before in the ten commandments it says if you commit adultery then you're in danger of hell but jesus raised it up hi he says if you just want if you just desire someone besides your spouse you're in danger of hell and he raised this bar up and he really he hit he hit the ministers and these battles and i brought these battles out that we have these battles are in our minds friends and i said that caleb had this battle of flesh and blood where he saw these giants he pulled his sword they went to battle and they beat them with god's help but today we have it much more difficult than caleb had because our battles these giants that come before us are in our minds and they're constantly working at us there's two things constantly pulling us there's god pulling at us and satan pulling us all the time and it's our choice which way that we go in ephesians 6 12 paul said this he said for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places the stakes were higher the stakes are raised and the lord jesus preached this sermon on the mountain and at the end of his sermon he says be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect in matthew chapter 7 he says this he says enter in enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there will be that go in there at because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there will be find it what a statement in in these these battles that we fight as i said last time the stakes are very very high matthew chapter 5 let's review some of the things that our lord jesus said he said verse 20 thank you my brother for i say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven ye have heard that it was said of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire that word raqqa means you're calling somebody name you're calling him a fool or you're calling him a worthless person or an insult so friends if we just say an insulting word we put ourselves in danger of hell it's a serious situation you can see how jesus said few there will be that find it but thank god that he gave us this word that we can refer back to this and do our best to live to live this life we were after last sunday i ministered to brother aaron mcgarry's church and then we went up to the mountains the white mountains for a few days of rest and we got an airbnb up there and on the way up we went into payson and there's a walmart and payson so we go in there and we're going and shopping around me and stephanie and daniel we're shopping around looking um for the food that we were gonna bring with us and uh there was this fella with um a turnaround collar and uh he was in the produce section and and we were there and i i wanted to make conversation with him and i i asked him i said to preach this morning and uh because it was sunday or sunday afternoon he said he says yeah i did and uh i said so did i and um you know i was in jeans and a t-shirt and you know it changed when we were going up there sunday late afternoon early evening and um i i talked to him for a moment and um i said he says i am episcopalian and i thought that's good and he says uh he says we're the third largest group in the world 90 million people and i said i said goodie says where'd you preach this morning i said well i said at a church in glendale um and he said he said oh that's good he said who you affiliated with and i said oh it was just a non-denominational christian church and he said he says no no no he says i mean i mean who are you affiliated with and then he goes into his episcopalian thing and kind of looking down at me speaking a little bit insulting and my sermon came back to my mind when i was preaching here and i was saying don't say raqqa don't say raka don't say raka and and he was he was talking about you know how good he was and and how great his church was and and you know we're the third largest and and i was again i was singing don't think don't say raqqa don't think raqqa don't think raqqa and he said and he said you know we're the third largest and and what i wanted to say is well that's good that's a bronze medal i'm too bad you couldn't get the goal maybe you'll be promoted to catholic one day you know but i didn't say it but i wanted to say it but my my sermon was back at me and then we we said our goodbyes and it wasn't the most cordial thing and then stephanie was there and she was like wow that was really rude and i was thinking don't say raqqa don't say raqqa don't think raqqa don't think and i didn't and i didn't say say it to my wife and thank god that i didn't and and you know i don't know that man he's he's a servant of the lord has dedicated his heart his life to preaching the gospel and i don't know him we got off on the wrong foot but i'm glad that i didn't even though my nature wanted to i'm glad that i didn't have that more spirited conversation with him matthew again chapter five let's go to verse 29 and if thy right eye offend thee offend means causes you to sin pluck it out and cast it from me for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and if thy right hand offended me cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast to hell let's skip to verse 44 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despise fully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and the good and sinneth reign on the just and on the unjust for if ye love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than the others do not even republicans so be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect notice how high jesus sets that bar and it's something that as christians as a as i said in the in the last sermon that i preached aim small and miss small aim for perfection do everything that you can to attain what our lord jesus has set before us and then our mistakes won't take us too far off the way there's no way as paul said all of sin and come short of the glory of god there's no way that we can be perfect but we should try for that perfection but the blood of jesus christ does make us perfect and that is the whole christianity the whole story of christianity my brother christ is the mystery of god revealed he's the mystery through the old testament and he is the one that can make us perfect i have a uh my cousin ronald evans uh he passed away from covet about a year ago he's got a son and uh the kids little how old is luke is he like 10 daniel he's like 10 years old and i'll tell you what i don't know if i've ever seen a cuter kid than that kid was when he was little he's built like a cinderblock you know and he's just this big kid and big old teeth and big old smile about as cute as you can be and a few years ago we had we had what's called creations in jeffersonville we had this creations class it's like a sunday school class and what they did in class is they made a little box and this box had a a red filter over the top of it so when when you would put that red filter over the top of it you couldn't see anything that was underneath it and they were teaching the kids how that this red filter over the top it it was like the blood of jesus and it you couldn't jesus god couldn't see the sins because of this so this little kid luke he was he got crossed with his mom and uh he got in trouble and he had to go sit in his chair that that was the punishment and the little guy you know he was he's mad i think i think it was candy i think he wasn't allowed to have candy and he wanted the candy and he went and he sat down in his chair and he was he was mad he was upset that he had that mom stuck him in this chair and my cousin ronald he uh he peeked in the door and he was looking at him the kids was pouting there and he gets up and he goes to this box that he had made in sunday school with the red filter over the top of it symbolizing the blood of jesus christ and he opens the top of that box and he says mom is so stupid and then he closes it puts that under the blood he knew what he was doing but he stuck it right up underneath there even the even the kids understand they understand what the blood means now that's not how we're supposed to do it but he was like five years old at the time so but as sweet as you can be and yes that blood does cover our sins that matthew 5 48 says be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect another translation of that says you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect and he he preaches this message on the mount and you see the prophetic nature of our lord jesus if you look in in the old testament you have these books they're called the books of the prophets i believe they start in isaiah and they go all the way through to the end to malachi and every single book most of them kind of do the same thing they kind of have the same order what they do is god will bring an indictment against the people and then he will bring encouragement and he'll say that but i have given you a way out but i have forgiven you and if you look at jesus's sermon on the mount that's how it is except jesus does it backwards than than what the prophets did he does it a little bit different what he does in matthew chapter 5 is he brings out first the encouragement and then he goes and he brings out what i ministered on last time which is this really high bar matthew chapter 5 verse 3 the beatitudes jesus says this blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled that's the key statement friends that's the key blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for the promises they shall be filled you know we look at who was there when jesus was preaching this and there were pharisees and sadducees there were there were all these different classes of people there were people that didn't just were coming to see what was going on what was the crowd there were there were the the minister group over here some of these more self-righteous ones and then there were sinners that were in this group that were repentant there were sinners that had pure hearts that knew that they had done wrong sinners like mary magdalene sinners like peter and these different ones they knew they had done wrong but they had a repentant heart they had a soft heart and these other ones these these pharisees and sadducees they had that cold and stony heart and when jesus preached this you know these words that he preached and the beatitudes you know they must have given him hope or her hope they must have brought hope to the people that you can be saved no matter what sins that you have i told the story some time ago and there's there's many here that probably weren't there on that day about an experiment that was done in the 1950s by a harvard university professor and what this harvard university professor did is he took a bunch of rats and these rats were domestic rats and these rats were wild rats and he took these rats and it was a bit of a morbid experiment i i admit it but he took these rats and he placed them in a bucket of water each of them and these rats swam around for a few minutes and some of them up to 15 minutes and after a few minutes each rat died and he said okay he said i'll do the next set so he takes the next set of poor little rats and he sticks them in the water and they start swimming around and after a few minutes they again start to sink and right before they drowned he picked them out and set them on on a towel and clean them up and let them get their composure back and then none of them would have lasted over 15 minutes and then he takes them and he puts the ones that he took out back into the water and they started swimming and they started swimming and they continued to swim not for a few minutes but they swam for 60 hours and he says this ricker richter recorded in his notes after elimination of hopelessness the rats do not die they had the hope that someone would grab them out of this water and save them before they had no hope but listen to the hope that jesus gives blessed are the merciful verse 7 for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which pers are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake that's the most difficult thing in the world today friends is when if you want to be an lgbtq or any other letter in the alphabet if you want to be that then people will lift you up and say oh he has courage or she has courage but why when i say i want to be a christian why do we get met with oh you're a bigot or or you or this or you're can you're cast out why are we met with that connie if we went to work and we we came out with some strange thing that we were we'd be accepted and patted on the back and say yeah you know go but because we're a christian it's something different we don't want that why is that it's because this world is against god's people this world is against the message of the hour it's against that and it wants it wants to promote standing up but by standing up with these other people you're actually conforming to their way of thinking in the christianity way you're not conforming christianity way you're following the lord jesus verse it says rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under the foot of men you know those that cook you can use spices or you can you can cook your food in oil and if the spices are rancid if the oil is rancid it ruins the flavor of the food and jesus is saying that he's saying that if you're a christian then love should always flow from you but never lose that soft heart never become that stony heart and he says this you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid i i think about as i was reading that scripture last night i was thinking about this woman that was a vile sinner she had as the bible says that she had had five different husbands married and divorced and married and divorced and and back and forth and then she was shacking up with someone that wasn't even her husband was just some other dude that she was with and she came to this well she wasn't even the same race as jesus was and she comes to this well and jesus asks her he said he says bring me a drink and she looks at him and she says listen there's segregation here and we don't we don't fellowship with one another because we're of different races look at how jesus crosses those racial boundaries even and he says and jesus looks back at her and he says this is a saint john chapter 4 he said if you knew who you were talking to he said then you would ask me for a drink and he said he said and i and he didn't say he he didn't say i but he said if you knew who you were talking to you would ask him for a drink and he would give you what a drink of living water and it must have struck something in this lady you know gave her gave her a little bit of hope saint john chapter 4 verse 13 it says this i'm sorry and she responded she said she's she says she's there with her her bucket and she's going to send it down the well and he says you would ask me for a drink and she said sir you don't even have a bucket to send down the well and he says this he said whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again pointed at the well there but whosoever shall drinketh the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water i shall give him shall be a be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come here to draw and then jesus goes on to solidify this that he is a prophet and he he tells her about her living wrong and then this woman she drops her water pot and she runs back to her city and she starts telling everyone about this lord jesus she starts witnessing to everybody look what the lord has done look at look who this man told me who i am he told me everything about me is this not the messiah look who god chose to represent him it was not the proud pharisees and sadducees it was this woman that was nothing that was wasn't even allowed to even fellowship with the the the virgin women that went out it was her that god chose and then she became this light of the world and she witnessed and she is the one that led how many people to the lord jesus but the main thing is she changed that moment that she met jesus her life changed and she became a light she became a witness back back to matthew chapter 5 verse 15 it says neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth life unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven how many people friends will come to the lord to if you show a change in your life all of our witness and everything that we say it doesn't mean anything unless we are producing a life and then when people see that then you'll see souls comes to the lord when i was working in the ministry in indiana i got a call from a man and he had been watching uh brother branham on youtube and he had listened to the sermon titled the token and he called and the receptionist he said i'm seeking the lord to the receptionist the receptionist called me and she said this man is seeking the lord would you like to talk to him i said sure picked up the phone i said this bro daniel evans she or he said i need the token. he said i need the holy spirit we started talking a little bit more and he asked me he said how do i receive this holy spirit that i've heard about and i i told him i said well if we go back in the book of acts peter had just given this tremendous sermon on the lord jesus and talking about how christ died for our sins and then the people it says they were cut in their hearts and then they came to peter and they said lord what should we do or peter what should we do and then peter said those mighty words in acts chapter chapter 2 verse 38 he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive that gift that i've been talking about you shall receive that token so this this man his name's adam this man he started praying and and he asked me he says i need to be baptized and he was in pennsylvania i called him minister brother that i know in pennsylvania baptized him in the name of the lord jesus and his life changed he lived a rough life of crime and drugs and and and just really bad life he was about my age and he had a friend named joey and this friend saw the change in adam's life and he said i want to be i want what you have just joey's life the change he became the light of the world this sinner man so joey had committed some serious crimes he got into organized crime and he was in deep trouble trouble they had a sting operation i think there were i think it was drugs or i think there were some murders involved but they had arrested 41 people in this operation joey was one of them so he joey goes to adam and he says i don't know what to do i'm a christian now and he says i did these things he said i'm guilty he says what do i do adam says well he says we pray adam called me up and he says let's pray for my friend joe and he told me the whole situation i said okay and we prayed and brother adam kept on his way of serving the lord and he called me i don't know it was a year later whatever it was and he told me he said remember my friend joey and i said yeah he says remember the sting operation and and and them being uh being tried for this and and being going to go to prison i said yeah he said there were 41 people indicted he said 40 went to prison and joey said i don't know how it happened he said the judge had mercy on me threw it out he said i was guilty but it was because of adam's witness of what he did i look at uh look at my son there daniel and you know i pick on a pick on him sometimes and but he made me proud the other day he makes me proud every day but he was he was talking to some believers in jeffersonville and he was talking with a brother that's about my age that that has children that have gone wayward and daniel was was telling him that that they need jesus they need to be in church they that they can be forgiven for these things they can come back and the brother was was listening to him and daniel after that daniel told me he said he said dad he said aya i didn't know why this brother's my elder why was i talking like that and and the brother was teared up and the things that daniel were saying was was really an encouragement to him but what daniel didn't know at the time that there was a young lady listening to what he said this young lady was a sinner she had long since gone into the world and had the scars of the world but she had a soft heart and as she was listening to daniel talk it was speaking to her heart about this lord jesus and about how i should be fellowshipping and about these things and daniel was kind to her while the other church folks weren't accepting of her they would cast her out say she's doing this this and this and this and they would turn their head from her but she had a desire to be right look at the difference between the pharisees and the sadducees over here and look at the difference between mary magdalene over here you could be standing over here with this cold stony heart living a life above reproach but then over here you have a sinner girl who was a prostitute mary magdalene and yet she was god's seed and these other ones were too good for it and here is this young lady this young lady gives her heart to the lord jesus that daniel was talking with and you know what she said she said daniel the difference is you were nice to me she said you cared everybody else just cast me out i thought amen what is a christian's job in this world a christian's job is to reach out to those and i look at some of those people and i think how much better are they than i am they may be a homeless person on the street they may be a sinner girl they whatever they may be i look at them and i say who in the bible do i want to be like i want to have that soft heart that these people had that that young lady had daniel i want that soft heart willing to take correction willing to move forward in this gospel let's go back to ezekiel ezekiel chapter 36 what a tremendous message this is verse 23 and i will sanctify my great name which is profaned among the heathen remember that heathen is just the people which ye have profaned in the midst of them and he then shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes they see the change in us and that means everything to them you are the light of the world don't let that candle go out friends for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then i will sprinkle clean water upon you have refreshing water and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your idols i will cleanse you will i cleanse you don't worry about everything that you've done as jesus said these people would come to him he didn't tell him you're doing wrong he said don't do it again a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them i think about that blessed young lady prostitute that had heard about this man jesus christ and she had heard that this man is the messiah and this man can cleanse my sins living as bad of a life as you can live she went and she took the money we don't know exactly probably how she earned the money but it probably wasn't respectfully and she bought this expensive alabaster box of perfumed oil and she summed there was a gathering going on at a pharisee's house and she goes she sneaks in somehow and she sees there the son of god she recognized him the priest standing over here in the corner didn't she recognized him she goes up to him and she just can't contain herself i've sinned i'm a sinner and she falls down and she's washing his his feet she's kissing his feet the tears are coming out of her eyes washing jesus's feet and you know the story they didn't when they brought him into the house they didn't wash his feet they let him sit there with dirty feet and embarrassed him they wanted to put him down these priests but here comes this precious little lady and she's washing jesus's feet with her tears and she sees and she's probably embarrassed she takes her hair and she she cleans off the dirt off of his feet with her hair and these men that were standing there these ministers they're looking down and they're judging this poor little lady who was doing right and they were the sinners she was the saint they're judging this little lady and jesus perceived their thoughts and here she is god bless her loyal heart she didn't sin anymore after that jesus says this mark chapter 14 verse 9. i'll tell you what i can't wait to meet this young lady jesus says this verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout all the world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her praise god this sinner lady he says you're up here mr pharisee and sadducee but they're going to be talking about this for thousands of years and they're going to be glorifying what this little lady did and she is going to be recorded in history as a saint of god and what are you going to be recorded as who was the bigger sinner the lie who is the bigger sinner that was there he wasn't that sister we all have sin we all come short of the glory of god but who was the bigger sinner it was simon the pharisee standing up against the wall and judging and not this blessed little lady right there that had a soft heart a repentant heart we should look at ourselves do we have that heart do i have that heart do i ask for forgiveness for my sins do i come before the lord as a sinner ezekiel chapter i'm sorry let's let's go back to ezekiel let's go to verse 28 and you shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god i uh you know i think about that priest talking to me and and it's he came to me in the in the arrogance of a priest and i'm a sinner you know i and how many things do i do wrong and i saw that stony heart and lord i don't want to be like that i never want to point my finger at anybody you know the old saying you point your finger out you got three fingers pointing right back at you i never ever want to judge never want to point my finger never want to sin and of course we don't we don't want to sin but never be against people i will also save you from all your uncleanness and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good listen to this and shall load yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations how many of us so regret our sins how many of us look back at what we have done and we hate ourselves for doing them that's god's will that shows that soft tender heart look back and and see the sins that we we we did and we look at the blood of jesus christ and say it's washed clean but i hate myself for anything wrong i've ever done i hate it and sometimes it's hard to get over that but it's not bad that we hate that friends because we still did it don't ever forget your sins may be washed in the blood of the lamb but don't forget that you still did them and someone else paid the price for you amen it's uh i gave a i was teaching a bible study in in jeffersonville with some of these boxers that daniel um that we started this this christian outreach and i was telling a story that what christ is and christ is like a friend that say you committed a crime say you stole something from the church say you sold the offering from the church or you did some some bad crime and then a friend that you have when the police come to get you a friend steps in the way and said no he didn't do it i did it i'm the one that stole this money from the church i did it and you look and you say no brother you didn't do it i did it and then that that man says no i did it i will take the reproach from you i will be the one that answers i will be the one that everyone hates i will be the one that is blamed for your sin when this man didn't do anything he was completely without sin and yet he took that sin for me i still sinned but by the grace of god jesus took that sin for me he answered for me and i i love myself for anything i've done wrong but it makes me love him all the more brother jordan i love him with all of my heart for what he has done for me i'm sorry to get emotional yeah i love the lord let's skip uh let's skip to the last verse verse 36 then the heathen those people that are watching you friends those people are watching me then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places that the plant that was desolate i'm sorry let me read it again then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it no matter how bad that we've sent friends no matter what we have done if we have that soft heart will make it fresh jesus will rebuild whatever wrong that we have ever done there's a there's a story that many of us are familiar with that uh about the magic flower and there's a man that he's out and and he's out in the wilderness and he finds this magic flower this fairy tale and this this flower speaks to him and says i'll give you whatever you want whatever you ask for and he picks up the flower and he says i want all the riches in the world he says i want to be rich the flower says okay so he the mountain that's there opens up a door opens up the man walks in and he sees gold and riches and jewels and everything inside of this mountain and he lays the flower down and he goes in and he takes some some some of the the gold and stuff and he goes to leave and the flower says don't forget the main thing don't forget the main thing and he says oh yeah he says maybe i should go get this other kind of goats he goes back inside and he gets this other stuff and he goes out and and the flower says don't forget the main thing and he says okay and he says he goes back and he looks and he says you know what i'll do is he says i'll take a rock sample of where i am right now so that i can get my way back to this place back to this treasure chest and he takes it and and he starts to leave and then the flower there says don't forget the main thing he says whatever and he leaves the door closes behind him all the riches close inside the mountain and the man had lost everything because he left the main thing he left that flower inside and it was gone forever and of course the flower is christ brother wilson we can find a message and be really excited about it and see how god can do great things in this modern day but don't forget the main thing don't forget jesus christ in all of this we can see that god can send a prophet and we can see mighty works done we can see the red sea parts but don't forget the main thing and we can have all the riches we have we all have cars and we all have air conditioning and we have these things but don't forget the main thing don't leave christ it all comes from him all the goodness of god comes from our lord jesus friends we should have that fleshly heart that sweet heart that that that not condemning not thinking that we know more than the next person but willing to let the holy spirit lead us willing to be corrected and love correction love it when it comes because that just means that we're going to get that much closer to god i uh ephesians 4 32 says this and i'll close and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you forgiven you if sisters if you could come the um the instruments be tenderhearted loving one another and never never forget what the lord jesus has done for us never forget the main thing never judge that sinner because you don't know who that sinner is and never cut them all the way out either they haven't sinned so far that the lord can't bring him back he's he's more than able never be like those pharisees but be like that precious lady with the alabaster box be like mary magdalene who was willing to take correction be like that that sinner woman that was caught in the act of adultery and jesus said you that is without sin cast the first first stone be like those precious sisters in the bible friends if i could be anything in the world if i and the lord knows my heart if i could be anything in this world it wouldn't be a successful scientist that maybe helps with with whatever in science it wouldn't be to be a successful minister that i could fill up a church i promise you if i could be anything in this world i'd want to be a christian just a christian wherever i am lord let me be a christian let me be someone that [Music] represents the lord jesus friends do you have that same desire we can get deep into the message i i wanted to preach a deep message on malachi where there's so much but that's not the deep things christ is the mystery of god revealed he's the deep one he's the one that has made all things right he is this mysterious man this melchizedek that was in the old testament he's this mysterious jehovah god that was there in the old testament he is the one that spoke in the old testament and he became flesh that's the deep part that's what i want to be and the other things will fall into place i uh if i could be anybody i wouldn't be one of those pharisees i wouldn't want to be any any of those men i would want to be one of those disciples that were willing to take that correction friends if that's you raise your hand i want to be a christian with all of my heart and everything that's in me again i go back to jesus's sermon on the mountain he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen let's uh brother aaron if you could come help me sing this uh maybe the song hallelujah that uh brother matt saying at the beginning i um friends this is these are perilous times this is a very very dangerous time that we live in if we so much as say raqqa if we so much as say one word against someone we put ourselves in danger of hell these these this message that the lord jesus brought it's serious and it goes right in line with this message that ezekiel brought but he will create in us a fleshly heart and not that stony heart let's stand [Music] bower heads listen to this music play this hallelujah oh god help us lord you
