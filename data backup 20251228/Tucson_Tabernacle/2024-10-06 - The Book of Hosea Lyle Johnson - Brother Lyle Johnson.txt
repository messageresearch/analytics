at sundown began the Feast of trumpets before we do or say anything more let's approach the Lord one more time and start this portion of the service Lord Jesus we're gathered together Lord in Your Name Lord with our Brothers and Sisters in Christ you are the one that can save you are the one that does heal Lord we are so grateful that we can know you in this hour father I pray that you would

come forth and draw us and draw us and draw us some more we thank you we thank you Lord Jesus amen I was going to ask you to sit down but I see you've already taken that so but I can't let this opportunity pass regarding this Feast it ties in so perfectly with the message of the book of Hosea that we'll be reviewing tonight Feast of trumpets Feast of trumpets what is the trumpet a chofar a chofar what is a chofar a chofar is is a horn from a from a kosher animal that the marrow has been pulled out and it's used and when the when the chofar is blown it's always blown either Straight Ahead or to the right never to the left remember in the New Testament judgment Jesus those that were on the right hand the hand of Mercy the hand of Grace the hand of Love they made it in the ones on the left not so much so when the chofar is blown it's always blown to the right I'm not very good at this I practiced a little bit today and Louie our dog got very upset with me [Music] if anybody is good at this my apologies Feast of trumpets from the IM Israel website I just like to read this little bit the Feast of trumpets known as yum turu is a festival which revolves around hearing the blast of the chofar connecting with God and repentance this day is also commonly called rosha Shana the head of the year of all the feasts the Feast of trumpets is the most concealed and shrouded in mystery whereas the other festivals commemorate an event from Israel's history or have specific religious purposes around them God's people were not told the reason to celebrate yum T Rua in the scriptures they were simply told to gather together and blow the chaar but the sound of the chaar when it's done by someone better than I elevates the hearts of men and women with the sense that the king is coming the most prominent activity of this day is the blowing of the chofar the ramshorn there are over 100 chofar blasts heard throughout the prayer services culminating with a final blast being known as the last Trump this Regal sound is a call to repentance that reaches the souls of all who hear with each blast denoting a sense of Spiritual Awakening but based on biblical Clues and ancient tradition Jews believed that God breathed life into Adam on this day in the days of the Bible this was a date on the calendar when the Kings of Israel were crowned and took the throne the resurrection of the dead and complete in gathering of Israel are also tied to the Feast of trumpets and Jewish Tradition at least today the Jewish people see yum as the day when the bridegroom will will return for his bride the prophets foretold Joel to from the complete Jewish Bible blow the chofar in seon proclaim a holy fast call for a solemn assembly gather the people consecrate the congregation assemble the leaders gather the children even infants that are nursing let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride the bridal chamber Christians see the biblical holy days as foreshadows of the work of the Messiah what he has accomplished and what he will accomplish in the future while the spring feasts Passover and so forth look back at yeshua's first coming the fall feasts look forward to his second coming after Pentecost there's a long summer break before the next biblical appointed time this is prophetic for the time in which we live now since messiah's atonement this long period of time will suddenly come to an end when the blast of the trumpet sounds followers of Jesus see yum as the future day when the last Trump will sound Yeshua will again set his feet on this Earth the faithful will be resurrected and the long awaited king of Israel will sit on the throne of his father David in 1 Thessalonians 4 we read for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with a chaar of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then when we we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord the Feast of trumpets is also called yum hesha the hidden day because it's the only holy day designated by the Lord to be kept on the new moon and ancient Israel citing the small sliver of the new moon could be challenging and unpredictable unlike the other feast days no one could precisely calculate the exact day or hour the festival could begin that's why even today two days are reserved for the feast in case the moon isn't visible on the first night when the disciples asked Jesus what will be the sign of his coming he told them of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of Heaven nor the son except the father alone Matthew 24 this saying is one of the reasons why some Believers connect the Feast of trumpets with yeshua's [Music] return let's stand together and sing together the last portion two verses in chorus of it is well with my soul my sin oh the Bliss of this glorious thought my sin not in part but the whole is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul oh Lord haste the day when my faith shall be sight the clouds be rooll back as a [Music] scroll the Trump shall ReSound and the Lord shall descend even so it Is Well with My Soul it is well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My [Music] Soul thank you so much praise the lord it's Shai it's the Feast of trumpets I just couldn't let this night pass it's October 2nd it is the night the sun just went down this is the start back to the book of Hosea or actually not back but forward this evening as we continue our series on the books of the Bible our portion is the book of Hosea the content of Hosea is shocking yet comforting in our Christian Bible Hosea is the first of the 12 books of what we call the Minor Prophets The Final section of our Old Testament minor just means that although they left us written prophecies the the length of each preserved writing is much less than that of any of the Major Prophets like Isaiah or Jeremiah or Ezekiel while we don't know the exact years when Hosea wrote and prophesied we do know that his ministry was contemporary with Isaiah Micah and Amos hosea's marriage life directed by the Lord was intended to shock to secure the attention of the people and to illustrate how God perceived their conduct and demonstrate his love compassion and mercy the attributes we associate with Jesus of the New Testament are clearly declared and the Prophecies of Hosea you may already realize it but one prophecy of Hosea reference in the gospels does not appear to be a prophecy at all that's probably a good place to read for our opening verses Hosea 11 the first two verses it's the Lord speaking when Israel was a child then I loved him singular speaking of the nation and called my son out of Egypt and now speaking to the people as they called them the more the prophets spoke to the people so the more they the people went from them from the prophets and their calls for repentance and righteousness they sacrificed unto balim and burned incense to graven images yet this recitation of the history of the Hebrew nation is also a prophecy about Jesus turn with pet to Matthew Chapter two The the context here is that the Magi traditionally linked to Daniel which we just studied have seen a Heavenly sign while they were in the East and have come to the Roman province of Judea looking for the young child born to be King Herod the Great called them told them to search find the child and report back to him but they left the province after finding Jesus without telling Herod and when the Magi were departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise wake up get up take the young child and his mother and flee run for your lives Don't Walk Don't Wait flee into Egypt and stay there until I bring the word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him so Joseph no no Joseph arose he took the young child and his mother by night that very every night this was a serious warning he loved his family absolutely trusted what the Lord had told him and departed into Egypt recall that they couldn't afford the the the good offering for the sanctification when Jesus was born so they offered the doves because they were so poor but now the Magi have left them gold now they have the funds they need just at the right time they need those funds to escape to go to Egypt and to stay there as long as they need to stay there God always provides he always works at both ends he brings it about and the family was there in Egypt until the death of Herod the Great that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son it was a prophecy please be seated we we just read that referenced prophecy and found it was in the book of Hosea we'll touch on this again but but first you're probably asking who was Hosea when did he Minister what do we know about him Hosea 1:1 the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea the son of beri in the days of Uzziah yam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah and in the days of jeroboam son of joash king of Israel and by the way for the young people there were some quizzes in the back be sure you've got that it might help you stay awake in fact if you see me falling asleep if you could bring me one at that point then I'll stay awake too so take a look at this who were the Kings during hosea's time so from the opening verse we learn that Hosea anyone know what Hosea means salvation Hosea prophesied in the mid 700s BC you see that in the don't look at the laser L you see that here in the middle since one king of Israel is named but Four Kings of Judah we ascertain he prophesied to and probably in Israel at least at the beginning of his ministry but ended it in Judah so the Israeli King that is mentioned is on your left jeroboam II and the Kings Uzziah yam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah are listed on the other side and you can see that right in the middle of all this is the Assyrian captivity where the 10 tribes are exiled so his ministry included the time of the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom we don't know from which tribe Hosea descended we know nothing of his father except that Barry was his father's name my last name Johnson with in other cultures and eras inform you that my father's name was John except it wasn't it was Reynold so Hosea would have been Hosea Ben ble or Hosea Bary it's a cultural convention before we dig into the book let's look at an overview of its topics these are the major sort of headline topics that I found in one of my Bibles we'll touch on each of these as we proceed through the 14 chapters of the book I need to tell you in advance that what the Lord required of Hosea is shocking and there's some pretty plain language in its descriptions I also want to point out that many of you this book is nothing but Doom and Gloom I indicated the topics that lead to this perspective by highlighting them in read as you can easily see the majority of the book is about accusation and judgment by God due to the people's continual willful Disobedience and especially their unfaithfulness toward the lord yet scattered among these are topics that indicate Love and Hope and Redemption highlighted in gold and even the topics coded in red there are pleas and Promises related to repentance and hope Hosea is in fact an amazing affirmation of God love and grace and compassion for his rebellious and sinful people the two topics left in white deal with hosea's actions as As We Begin The Narrative portion of the book consider that Hosea represented the Lord God and his wife represented the descendants of Jacob called Israel this is made clear in verse two we begin with the story of hosea's marriage his three children and what they represent let's read now from chapter 1 verse two the beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea the Lord said to Hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great H whoredom departing from the Lord what Hosea is to marry a woman who is Unfaithful and this is by command of the Lord the Old Testament uses this word Edom to describe faithlessness toward God it compares the the faithful sexual relationship between husband and wife with the worship of the Lord not replaced by or in concert with the worship of any other God or gods in our time we use a similar compar speaking of the Bride As the Christians faithful to and solely to the Lord not mixed with worship of Idols relics icons Saints prophets Ministries and the like this is at least part of the reason that sexual immorality was so harshly judged and condemned under the law why a person can be a murderer and repent and become or remain a minister but one who is unfaithful to his marriage cannot verse three so Hosea went and took Goomer the daughter of deim this again is a naming convention so she was Gob deim which conceived and beam a son and the Lord said unto Hosea call his name Jezreel for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of juu and will cause to Cease the kingdom of the House of Israel and it shall come to pass at that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel Jezreel means God will seow like a farmer not like a seamstress or God will plant but here the Lord isn't emphasizing the meaning this slide shows the valley of jezrael and its location in Israel please notice the markers I placed on the map this is in Northern Israel all the activity with Hezbollah right now is taking place uh about at the very top of the screen not the screen that's displayed with the physical screen the bottom of those curtains so this is in the northern portion of Israel Jerusalem on this map would be Jerusalem's probably right about here in this map can you see see the Temple's right there okay so the markers I put on on them at the the red oval circles the valley of Jezreel you can see it Southwest of the Sea of Galilee the arrow labeled with a numeral one points to the location of Nazareth where Jesus was raised and you can see where the local population wanted to throw him down from a cliff it would have been into the valley of Jezreel Arrow 2 points to the town of jezrael where Ahab and Jezebel lived where nebo's Vineyard was located you remember the story of The Vineyard Arrow three points to a town called megiddo and that suggests the other name for the valley of jezrael which you may be more familiar Armageddon the avenging of the blood of Jezreel upon the house of juu refers to the events of 2 Kings 10 where Elisha sent his Messenger to anoint juu King and J who then extracted Vengeance on Jezebel and others in 2 Kings 10:11 J who killed all who remained of the House of Ahab and Jezreel with all and all his great men and his familiar friends and his priests until he left him without a Survivor well back to Hosea verse four goes on to predict the conquest of Israel by Assyria which took place 30 years after the death of jeroboam II Hosea lived to see the Fulfillment of this dire prophecy but notice noce this doesn't mean that God is saying he will destroy all the descendants of Israel or Jacob the the house means the political entity the the dynasty the idolatrous kingdom that is what will cease to exist the kingdom will cease to exist with not the people they the verse five indicates the destruction of the military power of the northern kingdom and the same as J exercised that power eradicating ahab's Dynasty or house verse six and Goomer conceived again and bear a daughter and God said to Hosea call the baby girl's name L for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel but I will utterly take them away if you read this verse in various translations you'll say I will no longer have mercy uh be unloved I will no longer pity the the root word is raim which means compassionate so to have compassion love Mercy have pity all these nuances all these meanings of this word seem to apply here and that's why various translators use different of these words in English to describe this so be very careful when you read this in verse six God is Not declaring he will no longer have compassion or Mercy on the descendants of Jacob the people of Israel but that he will no longer have mercy or care or pity on their political institution the idolatrous kingdom established after the death of Solomon the phrase is the house of Israel same as you read in verse four the Lord is underscoring that the northern kingdom will be destroyed as a political entity and that the people of that house its residents or citizens will be scattered utterly take them away not utterly destroy them they'll be scattered contrast with the next verse seven but I will have mercy that word Rahim upon the house of Judah and will save them by the Lord their God the Lord is still their God not the idols at bethl or Dan that the first jeroboam set up and will not save them by Bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by Horsemen in other words I will intervene on their behalf I will save them supernaturally the prophecy is that the political entity called the house of Judah what we often call the kingdom of Judah or the southern Kingdom would be saved preserved not by military might but by the direct intervention of the Lord himself there's such a contrast between the northern and southern kingdoms one receives Mercy the other does not one is consumed by idolatry the other at least for a Time focuses on worship of and obedience to the Lord Israel is conquered and its population scattered during the reign of its final King fellow named hosia not to be confused with Hosea and this is during the Reigns of ahaz and hezek in Judah did you recognize in verse 7 what we read when we took a look at the book of Isaiah a couple of months ago we saw that in hezekiah's reign much of Judah had been conquered by the Assyrians Jerusalem was under attack by an overwhelming military force but Hezekiah went to the temple to seek the Lord not to his military to seek a strategy Isaiah 37 we read Isaiah speaking therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saeth the Lord for I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake verse seven that we just read in Hosea then the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the syrians 104 score score is 20 so four score is 80 185,000 and when they the survivors arose early in the morning behold they were in the midst of all the dead corpses in the first book verse of the book of Hosea he stated his ministry continued into the rain of Hezekiah it's very likely that he lived to see the Fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy back to Hosea verse eight of chapter 1 now when goer had weaned Lama she conceived and bear a son then said God call his name Lo am me for you are not my people and I will not be your God L am me literally means not my people loow means no you ask a child to do something and they say l no they're not going to do it LO means no or not um means people and the E suffix makes people become my people thus Lo am me is not my people why this name God refuses to be identified with those who do not worship him and him alone it's not a permanent sance or relationship as we'll see this brings us to a place in the scripture that I found a little surprising the last two verses we show of chapter one of Hosea that is verses 10 and 11 aren't in the Hebrew Bible the Hebrew Bible ends at verse 9 but those next two verses are part of chapter two of the Hebrew Bible so the Hebrew Bible has two more verses in Chapter 2 than we do because they felt apparently that they tied better with chapter 2 well don't worry I won't be going verse by verse through the whole book but the first portion of the book I think merits this close scrutiny in order to more carefully comprehend the prophecies that make up the bulk of the book going on to verse 10 after these people are going to be scattered the Israel Judah so forth he says the Lord speak speaking still yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people that is L am there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the Living God the Lord goes on in this prophecy to assure that in spite of estrangement caused by the unfaithfulness of the people God will fulfill his promise to Abraham that his descendants will be as the sand of the sea in Genesis as the stars of the heaven is the dust of the earth Israel here is Jacob and at some future time rather than Lo Ami they will be the children of God this tells us that the relationship between the Lord and the descendants of Jacob will eventually be restored the sin forgiven we'll get back to this verse in a moment verse 11 then shall the children of Judah this is the Lord speaking again then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of Jezreel here we see that the descendants of Jacob shown as peoples of two kingdoms will be gathered together under one leader and now the meaning of hosea's firstborn jesrael is not simply symbolic of the valley of jezrael but God will plant is reinforced by stating that they will come up out of the land they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of God will plant there's going to be a harvest not Doom and Gloom but promised restoration not an easy path to be sure but one whose end will be glorious the next topic Israel's unfaithfulness punished the first half of chapter 2 through verse 13 begins with the Lord telling Hosea to plead with the nation to abandon its unfaithfulness otherwise the Lord will punish the nation and its people the descriptions are rather graphic the first section reads the conclusion of it in anyway verse 11 after he's had these very graphic descriptions I will also cause all her mirth her happiness to cease her annual feast days her new moons her sabbaths and all her solemn feasts the feasts and celebrations demanded under Moses law cause them to seee I will destroy her Vines and her fig trees whereof she has said these are my rewards the wages that my lovers have given me for my infidelity failing to recognize the harvests and the goodness of the Lord were gifts from the Lord to his people I will make them a forest Tangled thickets and the wild beasts of the field shall eat them they won't be tended anymore and I will visit upon her I will will punish her for the days of balim wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgot me sayith the Lord baalim sometimes we look at that and say balum and we think that it's some God of the Canaanites or something as a kid I always heard this word as being the name of a particular Canaanite god it's incorrect baalim is a Hebrew word and is a plural of Baal which means Master Lord owner that's why the text said Israel burned incense to them them them is a plural not to be confused with some of the preferred pronouns demanded by the gender confused of our time the Lord is really angry with Israel for idolatrous Behavior worshiping all sorts of things rather than worshiping the Lord and he's sad that the nation has forgotten him the second half of chapter 2 starting at verse 14 is this next section the Lord's Mercy on Israel it tells how the Lord will Mo back to himself the nation that has left him after he visits his punishments remember the Lord's discipline is intended to teach and to correct not to destroy this is so beautiful I want to read this section not so much to dissect it but so you can hear the voice of the patient forgiving gracious and merciful god the one we love the one we try to serve verse 14 therefore behold I will Allure her I will woo her I rewin her back again and bring her into the Wilderness and speak comfortably kindly tenderly unto her I will give her her Vineyards from there and the valley of acho for a Door of Hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be at that day sayeth the Lord that thou shalt C me ishi literally means my man my husband and shalt no more call me b Ali My Lord for I will take away the names of baalim the pantheon of false gods out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name and in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things on the ground and I will break the bow and The Sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely I don't see sister Rachel Peterson she may be here she may be streaming she may be in a different room but when I read that verse I can hear the voice of sister Rachel's grandfather brother Harrison Phillip singing there will be peace in the valley for me someday he used to sing that many decades ago in the Tabernacle and I whenever I read that verse the verses in Isaiah that say the same thing I just there's just a little tape or something that plays in my head and I hear Brother Harrison singing that and it just brings a smile to my face and I will be Troy unto me forever forever yay I will bet try unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies doesn't that sound like our future relationship is the bride of Christ God isn't after a her Solomon not the example will be one with our Jewish brothers and sisters at that time oops wrong button I will even betro thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord and it shall come to pass on that day I will hear sayeth the Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the Earth and the Earth shall hear the Grain and the wine and the oil and they shall hear Jezreel they shall hear God God has planted and I will swow her unto me in the earth that planting again and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people you're are my people and they shall say you're my God what a promise what hope Mercy love before we look at the next chapter recall our opening verses a part of the historical background of the Lord's complaint about Israel was referred to in Matthew's gospel as a prophecy concerning Jesus brother brandom used that verse to explain that scripture can have what he called a compound meaning well this last verse of chapter two is also a verse with compound meaning along with verses 9 and 10 of the first chapter let's read from Paul's epistle to the Romans chapter n he's telling of his heartache for his people Israel their inability to recognize Jesus as their Messiah Romans 9:22 what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy Mercy which we had a for prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he has said also in hos that's Hosea this was from the Greek so it's spelled a bit differently I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it's a come to pass it in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God let's see this compound meaning just a moment we just read in Hosea about God and Israel Paul says this applies to Gentiles too look Romans 9:25 and Hosea 2:23 I've highlighted in in yellow these particular matches Romans I will call them my people which were not my people Hosea I will say to them which were not my people Thou Art my people and her beloved which was not beloved I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained Mercy recall the daughter named Luma the root raahim means compassionate love Mercy the are saying the same thing Paul's writing in Greek Hosea wrote in Hebrew or what about verse 26 the whole verse it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there they should be called the children of the Living God Hosea 1:10 the second half of the verse it shall come to pass that in the place that was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them you are the sons of the Living God so we as Gentiles can claim the same promise of forgiveness grace mercy and ultimate Redemption the Bible is consistent with this theme from Genesis 1:1 and the Old Testament through Revelation 22:21 in the new Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever his word is consistent are we ready for chapter three yeah okay let's go Hosea redeems his wife Rec that hosea's marriage and its problems were directed by the Lord to represent his relationship with Israel this chapter is only five verses so let's read the Lord said unto me go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look to other gods and love flagin of wine that's a little strange I'll I'll leave this on the screen so you can follow but I'm going to read from the NIV translation I think it makes it a little clearer the Lord said to me go show your love to your wife Goomer again though she is loved by we'd say living with another man and is an adulteress stop right there the penalty for this under moses' law is death Leviticus 20:10 says the man that committed adultery with another man's wife Goomer even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death but Hosea is not asked to kill her and her boyfriend instead he was asked to love her as the lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes raisin cakes King James flagin of wine the Hebrew is grapes pressed together you do that you let get the juice ferment you get wine otherwise you get raisin cakes raisin cakes were a food that was used in a lot of pagan Worship in Israel at that time most translations say raisin cakes but not sure that it really matters which one it was I'm certainly not going to make a Doctrine out of either one so I bought her back to me for 15 pieces of silver and for an Omer of barley and a halfer of barley it's the price of a slave we're not told how hosea's wife came to become the slave possession of another what we are told is that he is redeeming her like us she is bought with a price and I said unto her Thou shalt abide for me many days Thou shalt not play the Harlot Thou shalt not be for another man and so I will also be for thee in other words it'll remain in seclusion for some time our relationship will be strictly platonic during that time and now the symbolism is explained for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a King Without a prince without a sacrifice without an image without an ephod the the Priestly uh vest without teraphim teraphim are household Gods it's a plural little idols and sounds like the diaspora from about 135 ad and including modern times afterward shall the descendants of Israel return return this means to turn around in other words they will repent and seek devote themselves to the Lord their God and and David their King referring to Jesus Son of David King of Kings and shall fear tremble in awe of the Lord and his goodness in the latter days that's the day we're living in next chapter chapter four The Lord accuses Israel chapter four is a description of the offenses of Israel it's focused on those that dwell in the northern kingdom as we read in h chapter 4:1 15 though thou Israel play the Harlot yet let not Judah offend and Come Ye not un gilgal neither go ye up to beavan nor swear the Lord liveth so he's separating the northern and southern kingdoms here this was written then in the reign of jeroboam 2 as Hosea listed at the beginning of the book Israel is still a nation Judah still under a righteous King punishment coming for Israel in Judah chapter 5 tells Israel and Judah that punishment is coming to both Nations do to their infidelity Israel and Judah are unrepentant chapter six opens with the plea for repentance but Israel and Judah will not let's read the first few verses the first three verses are Hosea pleading with the people the subsequent verses are the Lord's thoughts and musings over the sad state of the people and note that in verse four when we get to that and often throughout Hosea the the name of Ephraim one of of the tribes is used to represent the Northern Kingdom of Israel Hosea speaking 61 come let us return unto the Lord he hath torn he will heal us he ha smitten he will bind us up after two days he will revive us the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he will come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the Earth but these rains spring and late summer Reigns are necessary for a successful Harvest this is an Agricultural Society Hosea is telling the people that they will be blessed of the Lord if they will only repent and truly follow him and and now the Lord speaks Oham what shall I do unto thee Judah what shall I do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning Cloud as the early duw it goes away the worship the lies reflecting obedience are insincere therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments the judgments of the Lord upon them are as the light that goeth forth for I desired Mercy not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings Jesus Jesus quotes this in Matthew 12:7 but they like men have transgressed the Covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me chapter 7 continues the theme of Israel and Judah being unrepentant we'll we'll move quickly through most of the rest of these topics excuse me please read these chapters at home Israel will reap the Whirlwind chapter 8 tells of the continuing sin of the people their worship of Idols forsaking of the Lord he declares that they have swn the wind but they'll reap the Whirlwind there'll be a harvest the Lord will punish Israel chapters nine and 10 describe the causes and the punishment that the Lord will perform the Lord's love for is Israel chapter 11 contained our opening verses like many of the selections which describ the Lord's complaint to Israel yet offer hope through repentance so this section whose theme is God's love for Israel describes his complaints yet offers his love let's read a few verses from it here when Israel was a child then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt and as they called them the more the prophet spoke to the people people so the more the people went from them from the prophets and their calls for repentance and righteousness they sacrificed unto baalim and burnt incense to graven images I taught ephriam also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that I healed them I drew them with cords of a man with bands of love I was to them as they that take off the Yol on their jaws I laid meat unto them these verses may be a little confusing but it's speaking of leading them out of slavery in Egypt eypt through Moses cords of a man and laid meat on them Mana in the desert they they were living in a land that could not possibly sustain them by his grace he shall not return unto the land of Egypt not going back to slavery there but the Assyrian shall be his King why because they refuse to return return means repent so Assyria will conquer the northern kingdom because they refuse to repent and return to the Lord and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his branches and devour them because of their own counsels and my people are bent determined to backsliding from me though they the prophets called them to the most high none at all would exalt him would exalt the Lord how shall I give thee up Ephraim how shall I deliver thee Israel how shall I make thee as adma how shall I set thee as zeboim my heart is turned within me my repenting are kindled together my heart burns with anger however I will not execute the fierceness of my anger I will not return to destroy Ephraim for I am God not man in spite of their fickleness and insincerity in spite of their forgetting that I rescued them from slavery that I fed them in a Wilderness that could not support them I won't destroy them because I'm God I'm not a man the opposite of say Nebuchadnezzar skipping to the last verse Ephraim compasses me about he surrounds me with lies the house of Israel with deceit but Judah yet ruleth with God and is faithful with the Saints the the holy ones the chapter ends with a suggestion that at the time of this prophecy the northern kingdom had not yet been taken by Assyria there was still time to repent though the Lord knew they would not the next section is the Lord's indictment of Israel and Judah chapter 12 is more of the Lord's reflection on the state of Israel he again reminds them what they must do verse six therefore turn thou to thy God keep keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God whenever it's convenient whenever you're in church whenever you're having morning devotions wait on thy God continually by the way when you read chapter 12 read chapter 13 you'll see a reference to the East Wind what does that mean the East Wind when Heather and I lived in Israel we learned that the name for the East Wind was hamim the context is that this wind blows in from the Arabian Peninsula it's hot and very very dry it dehydrates and desiccates if you're not careful it'll take the very life from you so when they refer to the East Wind in the Old Testament this is the context I just thought you wanted to know that the Lord's Relentless judgment on Israel chapter 13 is not just a reminder of what Israel lost but a warning to us in our day of following the same path let's read the first six verses when ephriam spake trembling when Ephraim spoke people trembled they should with fear he exalted himself he was a power in Israel but when he offended incurred guilt to the worship of Bal he died now they sin more and more they have made them molten images of their silver Idols according to their own understanding all of it the work of the Craftsman they say of them let the men that sacrifice kiss the Cales to kiss the idols the consequences therefore they shall be as a morning Cloud as the early due that passes away as the chaff that is driven with the Whirlwind out of the threshing floor and as a smoke out of the chimney they'll become as nothing yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt I took you from the land of Egypt and thou shalt know no God but me for there is no savior beside me I did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled their heart was exalted therefore they have forgotten me these two verses in particular are a warning to us when things were hard when we lived in a Land of great drought people turned to and trusted God like verse five but for many years now here in America and many other places we lived in a Land of Plenty like verse six as a nation we are filled we speak of our president as the most powerful man on Earth the leader of the Free World our nation's heart has become exalted and therefore the Lord warns us through Hosea we as a nation have forgotten the Lord but we can also identify with verse oh Israel thou Hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help this is true not just for Israel in hosea's day but for our nation for ourselves our help is in the Lord the last section the last chapter is is a plea to return to the Lord we we'll get into that what lessons can we take home from Hosea I I think the Final Chapter a plead to repent to repent to turn to the Lord I think that that should be the take home it's only nine verses so let's read it I'll try to separate the voices of Hosea and the Lord this chapter takes a form of a conversation between Hosea and and the Lord oh Israel return unto the Lord thy God thou has fallen by thine iniquity take with you words and turn to the Lord say to him take away all iniquity receive us graciously so we will render the sacrifices of our lips Asher shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in thee the father findeth mercy and with that the Lord says I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him I will be as the Dew unto Israel he shall grow as the Lily cast forth his roots as levanon his branches shall spread his Beauty shall be as the Olive Tree his smell as Lebanon they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall Rive is the grain grow is the vine the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon Ephraim shall say what have I to do anymore with Idols repentance I have heard him and observed him I am like a green fur tree from me is thy fruit found back to the voice of Jose in the concluding verse of the book who is wise and he shall understand the these things prudent and he shall know them for the ways of the Lord are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein i' like to invite the musicians to please return I trust you've received something from the Lord through the reading of his word this evening and that you're encouraged to read the short book of the Prophet Hosea one of the reasons I like to read so much from the Bible on these evenings is that my words will fail I may say something incorrect maybe many things but God's word is true it's reliable I'd like to close this portion of the service with words from David found in the 19th Psalm verses 7- 11 just like Hosea 149 the ways of the Lord are right and and also in this particular uh few verses of uh of the 19th Psalm it mentions the honeycomb and some of you may be aware but the traditional snack for this evening although I neglected to bring it and I apologize is slices of Apple dipped in honey let's stand to our feet please and and let's sing this together if if you don't know it I can't sing anyway so sing along the law of the

right into the book of Hosea when I read it he loved us he cared for us even though we fail him many times but he says you know what you're still mine I care for you I'll straighten you out I'll fix

of his of of both sides we've we've gone against you yet you've called us back and um I still am amazed how brother Lyall and brother Daniel can do this but to each one God allows you to understand and see what he want to do so he looked beyond my fault and he saw my need how many appreciate that of him you know that I look at myself in the mirror and I always say this to my wife I said why did
