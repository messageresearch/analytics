[music] [music] [singing] [music] [music] The [singing] redeemer, our savior, [music] [music] I [singing] love thee, my Jesus. [music] Let's pray. Evenly [music] Father, we love you tonight because you first loved us and tonight we are here to express this love to you. We need you. I believe that your [music] presence is among us. I can feel the leading of your Holy Spirit through the song. I know that tonight you're going to speak [music] to us. We just want to open our hearts to receive your [music] words. You know, oh Lord, I'm not able to talk to say something good to [music] your people. I just need your presence, your help. Bless us tonight [music] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I think we are glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; The last weekend we were blessed uh went to Tukton, Arizona where brother David was preaching. It was a great blessing. We can see our brother David is a blessing for the body of Christ. and since last week. God bless you, brother Billy. But the Billy doesn't know exactly what I'm I would talk about what my sermon tonight, but I think the introducing song is my preaching tonight. God bless you. Uh last week God was was dealing with my heart about the relationship I can have with God and I just figure that this relationship is just based on love. He loved me and he sent me his word that become like a love letter. Uh tonight my sermon is the love expressed. &gt;&gt; The love expressed. God express his love to us &gt;&gt; and we express our love to him. And we're going to take our Bible in the book of John. We know the scripture. Job chap uh John chapter 3. [snorts] John 3:15 and 16. The Bible says that without a belief in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Lord Jesus, may you open this word for us tonight in Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. And very often when we talk about the love of God, we talk a lot about his kindness, his mercy, his good, rich of mercy, good of good, rich of goodness and slow to anger. But tonight, you know, the love of God, we have the song we love to sing that say that the love of God is so great, is so far that if we can use the sky like a parchment and every man can be a scribe, &gt;&gt; we couldn't talk about the love of the love of God. and express all thing about it. &gt;&gt; And tonight I want to take one side because I think that the love of God is like a diamond with many sides. And I want to take one side of the expression of the love of God to us &gt;&gt; and this side is we're going to take our Bible in the book of Hebrew chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12. Uh let's start with the verse 6. Hebrew chapter 12 verse 6. For whom the Lord loveth, he chneth and scourge every son whom he receiveth. &gt;&gt; If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons. &gt;&gt; For what son is a whom the father chneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are patus, then are ye bastard and not sons. Furthermore, we have are the fathers of our flesh which correct us, and we give them reverence. Shall we not much rather be rather be in subjection unto the father of spirit and and life? For they verly for a few days chenet us after their own pleasure, but if for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness. That's one of the way God can express his love to us by chastening us. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Sometime we are just walking feeling like God is not seeing everything we are doing. &gt;&gt; Like everything is good. Even we are in some evil things. &gt;&gt; We think that God is only a grander. &gt;&gt; He loved us. He can do nothing to us. &gt;&gt; But the Bible say that if God loves us, &gt;&gt; he will trust in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because he want to do something bad on us, &gt;&gt; but because he want to bring us back to him, &gt;&gt; to bring us close to him. Amen. Uh brother Banam says he in the door of the door preach uh December 1257 because when God ching us is knocking at our door &gt;&gt; to bring us back to him &gt;&gt; to have a relationship with us. &gt;&gt; And Buddham say is uh the power of six he said now you notice that he also give an invitation and said be zealous &gt;&gt; for those I love I trust them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the little coach and correct and weep and he said be zealous and repent. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now he's not speaking to sinners. &gt;&gt; He's not speaking to sinners. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when we are talking about the church is not a building. &gt;&gt; The church is you, &gt;&gt; it's me. So when Jesus when the love when love the Lord say that he just those he love is not talking about the sinner. &gt;&gt; Sometime the devil can tell you that you are a sinner. You are chasting because you are a sinner. But if you know your position, &gt;&gt; if you know who you are, &gt;&gt; if you know really your relationship with the Lord, &gt;&gt; you know that you are not a sinner. &gt;&gt; Even you are chasing is just because God is knocking at your door. &gt;&gt; God want to bring you back to him &gt;&gt; to bring you close to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said [snorts] he's speaking to the church. Be healed us of him and repent from our lukewarm condition that we are today. Some of us become just lukewarm. But God want to bring us back to him &gt;&gt; to do something for him and say now we notice he said I stand at the door and knock. [snorts] What is a person knocking at the door for? Is trying to gain the entrance. He has something that he want to speak to you about it. &gt;&gt; So God is knocking at your door because he has something to tell you. &gt;&gt; He have something about you. He has something he want to put in your heart. And but when I'm say in modern events are made clear by prophecy preach uh I think in June 12 55 June 125 paragraph 168 eight. He said, "I'd shock you if I tell you that just about to repeat again." The Bible said he was on the outside trying to knock to get in and nobody would let him in. He that I love I chasten and rebuke. I sc him. I shake him down. But it because I love him. &gt;&gt; God do it because he love you. &gt;&gt; The devil can can say that he's doing because God forsake you. &gt;&gt; Is not true &gt;&gt; because he say that he won't forsake you. &gt;&gt; That's right. God promise that he won't forsake you. &gt;&gt; Even you are chesting it because he love you. &gt;&gt; He say open up and let me come in. Yeah. Could not remember I didn't want to get in the church. It he the individual. Amen. &gt;&gt; It not about the church the building &gt;&gt; but it about the individual. &gt;&gt; Sometime we can pass through the trial. We are struggling but God can let us go through some trial &gt;&gt; just to bring us back to him. He said he couldn't get in the church. They had him locked out only organization of all of them. is his church age that he was on the outside the church put out, refused, rejected because he was only manifested in the temporarily in the other churches in the form of justification so forth. But in here, the age that coming now is the full manifestation of the vindication of Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't want us to look like the people of Luther age, &gt;&gt; like Pont people. But we have to come back to our real position in God. &gt;&gt; Come back to the image of Christ in our life. &gt;&gt; The full manifestation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So the world can see and testify that Jesus is really the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is looking for each one of us to do the job &gt;&gt; to testify that is alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometime if we are not doing it, it can put us in chastising so we can come back and live like the Christian. You say, "Oh, I'll admit we got a lot of impersonator, but examine the first one, the original. &gt;&gt; We are from the original seed of God." &gt;&gt; And we have to express it. And sometime I say God can bring us to some trouble something just because he want to bring us back to him. &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the book of Job chapter 33 Yeah. Job chapter 33 verse14 Bible say for God speaketh once yeah twice yet men perceive it now in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep fallth upon men in slumbering upon the bed so God can talk to us to dream &gt;&gt; to vision and listen. Then he openeth the heat of men and sealth the instruction that he may withdraw men from his purpose and hide pride for men. He keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the swore. He is chatting also with pen. That another way God can talk to us. He's chatting also with pain upon his bed. And the multitude of his born with strong pain so that his life above bread and his soul dirty meat. His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen. And his bones that were not sick stick out. Yeah. If so drove near unto the grave and his life to a destroyer that God can do it for us. &gt;&gt; But it's wonderful our God. Verse 23rd, he say, "If there be a messenger with him, an interpret interpreter, one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness." I can say the preacher, the pastor, if God can find him with him, then he is gracious unto him and safe, deliver him from going down to the pit. I found a ransom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So through the word &gt;&gt; God will bring you back &gt;&gt; and he say his flesh shall be fresher than a child. &gt;&gt; He shall return to the days of his youth. Amen. &gt;&gt; He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him &gt;&gt; and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render unto men his righteousness. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So don't look at only what you are passing through today, &gt;&gt; but look at the one who make a promise &gt;&gt; that will never forsake you. He can take to he can he he can he can talk to you by a dream, by a vision, but he can talk to you through his word, &gt;&gt; to the preacher to bring you back to him. Andam says he in the beginning and the ending of the gentle dispensation preach September 1st 55 paragraph 35 [snorts] say the word of God is the lamp unto our feet that we should be guided. Then it's the light that follows the pathway that lead us from victory unto victory. Now before you can have a victory, there has to be a battle. &gt;&gt; And if there's no battle, there's no victories. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we ought to be thankful &gt;&gt; for the battles and the trials &gt;&gt; and it's God giving us the opportunity to have a victory. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Don't that make you a little bit better now? &gt;&gt; If you are in a trial, be happy. &gt;&gt; Be thankful to God. is trying to make you an overcome. &gt;&gt; He's trying to give you a victory. &gt;&gt; See the battle come along somebody saying something bad about you. Sickness come unto you. Maybe God give you those light affliction that it might heal you and show his favor to you. Let you let you see what he means by it. He loves you. &gt;&gt; The old shepher story that was told he there in Jerusalem in the holy lands of a shepherd was pecking and a sheep and he said what you packing it for? said it's got a broken leg. Said how it do that fall over a cliff said no I broke it leg. &gt;&gt; The cher broke his leg. He said why you c shepher you break that sheep leg say no I love it. is through the expression of his love. &gt;&gt; I love it and say it was going a way and I couldn't make it mind me. So I broke its leg so it could give it some extra intention so then it would love me and follow me. &gt;&gt; So God can God can chasten you so you can have more attention from him. &gt;&gt; So he can take care of you. seeking every close to him. He say sometime God has to let us break down &gt;&gt; just a little bit &gt;&gt; in earth to give us a little extra intention &gt;&gt; that our love our God love &gt;&gt; sometime God has to let us break down &gt;&gt; just a little bit in earth to give us a little extra intention to get us up on his lap &gt;&gt; to w us up in his bosom. &gt;&gt; When the doctor said nothing can be done, then he take us into his basm. &gt;&gt; Say, see, I love you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you get well. See, &gt;&gt; oh, doesn't that just make life a little bit better? Oh, he's so great. &gt;&gt; He's a marvelous shepher, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That our God. &gt;&gt; So if you are in a trial, the D the devil will say that where is your God? &gt;&gt; God forsake you. You are not a son of a daughter of God. He will tell you it. Just tell him back I have my name in the book. &gt;&gt; He never forsake me. &gt;&gt; He will bring [clears throat] me back. &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the book I think it the book of Psalm. Yeah. Psalm. I'm thinking about something. Uh, yes. Excuse me. I'm trying to find it. I think it's Psalm 89. Yes, Psalm 89. God is talking about David, but we're going to start at the verse 28. But you know that it about David he's talking about. He say my mercy will I keep for him for ever more and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to and endure forever and his throne as the day of heaven. [snorts] If his children forsake my law, if you forsake the law of God, and walk not in my judgments, if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments, then will I visit the transgression? He will do it with the hold and the iniquity with the stripes. [snorts] Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not earthly take from him, &gt;&gt; nor suffer my faithfulness to fail, &gt;&gt; my covenant will I not break, &gt;&gt; nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. &gt;&gt; The devil will say that he forsake you. Tell him I'm the son of David. &gt;&gt; I'm the son of God. &gt;&gt; I can be chastined &gt;&gt; is the the expression of my God's love. But I know he's doing that because he want to bring me back to him, &gt;&gt; to bring me close to him, to help me to le upon him &gt;&gt; to believe that everything I need I can find in his hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime you can do everything &gt;&gt; and God just use his mercy upon you. Sometime God will chasten you. &gt;&gt; We know the story of Samson. Samson was born for a purpose &gt;&gt; to do something to deliver the people. And we know that one day Samson went together. He saw an allot. Samson went to her. Samson stay with the allot all the night. And the gathered people closed the gate and was trying to kill Samson. Samson was in the sin with the island but God give him strength and power &gt;&gt; to put out the gate of Gaza &gt;&gt; put on his shoulder and go with it. But the same Samson &gt;&gt; when he deal with Dala, &gt;&gt; it will not the same. &gt;&gt; God let the Philistine people to pull out his eyes. It was terrible. It It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that God forsake Samson. But God was chasting Samson for a purpose. &gt;&gt; So you can remind that he was born to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was born to do something for God. &gt;&gt; It was born is not a sinner. It's supposed not to deal with the sin or with the world. But Samson knew that he was a son of God. Even in this condition, &gt;&gt; he knew that he was a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's something we have to know. Yes, &gt;&gt; we have to trust &gt;&gt; to believe that we are the salt and the daughter of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; And if God say if God say that his word can quicken us, &gt;&gt; he will do it. So Samson in this condition he knew and he pray he believed that God can have a possibility for him. And what says in [snorts] just one more time Lord preach January 20th 63 [snorts] paragraph 103ami is talking about Samson, the condition of Samson. He say, "Revenge me, Lord of my enemies. Revenge my eyesight." They poked it out, "Lord, and here [snorts] I stand." Samur also knew there was a possibility &gt;&gt; that God might once again hear him. &gt;&gt; Sometime you feel like oh God is no more answering my prayer. Be like Samson. &gt;&gt; He's my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he doesn't answer today, he will answer tomorrow. &gt;&gt; I will stay there &gt;&gt; until he will answer. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't answer tomorrow, he will do it after tomorrow. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't do after tomorrow, he will do it next week. &gt;&gt; Just keep believe. Samson also knew there was a possibility that God God might once again heal him. Even in his conditions, there was a possibility. Oh church, there is a possibility regardless of all their doing. &gt;&gt; Regardless your condition, there's a possibility that God can deal with you. &gt;&gt; God can deal with your heart. &gt;&gt; God can talk to you. God can resolve your problem. He says as we hear today so much so many so many made decision decision decision means a stone a confession as I have said before what good does a stone do if you haven't got a stone m &gt;&gt; there with a sharp wood to cut some stone into a place stone for the building. &gt;&gt; That's why we are the pastor. We bless God for brother David who is a really a great blessing. And the Bible says what good does it to do to make decision if you still let the woman and the men remain as they was and just join the church. It's about stone that not shape into nothing. What we need is a stone mer, &gt;&gt; a man with the word of God, a vindicated power to prove that God sent him to shape that church and cut off the worthy thing and shape them into the stones of the sons and daughters of God that go into his building. certainly white. Oh my. He knew the possibilities that there could be God would heal prayer. If we could only do that tonight. Jesus said when he was here on earth, John 14:12, he that believeth on me, the work that I do shall he do also. Jesus said or the Bible said in Hebrew 13:8 that was quote a while ago Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever. So even your condition even you are shed do like Samson there is a possibility God have something for you it doesn't mean that God forsake you sometime preacher can put it on You say that oh you are ching because you are a sinner. We just read that when Jesus was say that that love will chasten he was not talking about the sinners it was about the church &gt;&gt; it's about you &gt;&gt; it's about me. Don't keep crying but believe that Jesus God will made a promise. He will take care of you &gt;&gt; if the musician can come. So tonight as I say the love of God can be expressed in a several way in many ways sometime it lies like Job. Job was not a sinner. God testified to the devil that nobody on the earth was like Job. But look at what Job passed through. He lost everything. He was trusting. It was not easy. I believe that nobody among us want to be like child. Even we know the end of the story. Even we know that after the trials God blessed him twice. &gt;&gt; But the trial is heaven. If you are in the trial, if you are chasting tonight, God want to tell you that is because [music] he love you. &gt;&gt; He want you to come back. He want you to do something for him. He want you to love him more. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to express your love to him. So in our relationship, God our father is showing to us his fatherhood love and we have to express to [music] him our sunship, our daughtership love to him. If we can bow our head. Lord Jesus, how you love us. We know [music] that we are nothing. We could do nothing without you. I know some some some of us passing through the trio.

[singing] But I [music] will boast in Jesus Christ for his death and resurrection. [music and singing] Oh why should [music] I [singing] [music] answer? Oh my [music] I know with [singing] all my God. Oh his word has made [music and singing] my way. Sing that last verse again. And I [music] will not close. Oh, no power. Oh my go [music] Jesus Christ [singing] and resurrection.

Oh sh Oh, [music] and to the fiercest ground. [music] Oh, and what are we trying? [music] Golden [music] I stand [music] in Christ alone who to our flesh full [music and singing] of God inless praise this [singing] king of love [music] and rightous sto [music] on the cross that Jesus [music] the breath of God was [music] for [music] The Christ through the ground his [music] body.

Amen. and we'll invite our pastor [music] at this time. Amen. Lord bless you tonight. I trust you're all looking forward to our meetings uh this weekend. Uh we just ask you to reach out to uh yeah all our church members, everybody that you know and then encourage them to come on the Friday and Saturday night and maybe get here just a little bit early to help our deacons with seating and just kind of move up to the front. And uh I really enjoyed tonight's [music] message. You know, that's what gives you real Christian strength, that you can go through the test and the trials with victory, knowing that God's for [music] you and that he'll get you through and that makes a strong church. Amen. Pray for Matthew. He just got done preaching [music] three meetings and he's helping us with the meetings this weekend. The Lord will strengthen him. And we thank Billy and brother Andrew for preaching this weekend. It was uh really good and and [music] we had a good time in uh Tucson. I think the Lord was fruitful there. [music] And then one other thing I'd like to ask is that all the single brothers that drive, [music] if you would park on the back of the lot, the lot will finally be all cleaned out. Every st is available so all the young brothers and everything you park back there. You know what I mean? Like the last spot back there is just for you. Okay. So, praise the Lord. And you have the spot next to him. And then I think you get the message, huh? You love the Lord. You know, I thought this weekend I just my heart is hear ye him. I I'm really anxious to what the Lord has to say to us. And as our brother so beautifully uh laid it out there is that it's individual. So God will certainly speak to our hearts. So let's bow our heads and ask the Lord to bless our [music] services. And uh and then also one [music] other point if anybody has a little time tomorrow uh we need to have some brick stacked [music] and we certainly if you can help us just give us a call. So let us bow our heads. Our gracious heavenly father, as our brother spoke that you stand at the door and you knock because you have something to say to us. And father, may we hear when you come by to speak and you come by to knock on our heart. Father, may our spirits be to a spot that, Father, we listen and we receive what it is that you have for us and the direction you'd like our heart and our spirit to [music] go, Father, that we would improve our Christian walk because we know that you're preparing us for your soon coming, Father, for the rapture as we would believe and look up for that we'd be translated from this dimension to another. And we're just trusting, Father, that that you would help us this weekend move closer [music] to that rapturing condition and that rapturing faith. Bless each of us, Father. Let none of the trials of the enemy keep us from moving forward. May we not doubt your love for us, Father, but may we be ever true, knowing that you laid your life down for us, and that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of your hand. We ask you to bless us now. In Jesus [music] precious name we pray. Amen. Let's sing this song as our dismissal. [music] There's nothing like the presence of the Lord. God bless you. Amen. Oh, there's nothing [music] [music] like the presence of the Lord. [singing] There is nothing presence [music] by the presence. The presence [music and singing] of the Lord. I am free [music and singing] in his presence. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I am here [singing] in his presence. For I forgive. [music] [singing] I'm not the same. I [music] am changing. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Hallelujah. [music] Heat. Heat. [music]
