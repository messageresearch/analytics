serious the decisions get and the greater the consequences and so we we know that God has it all in control we know that God has his hand over his elected and God's given us a promise for our children so let's just bind together with brother Tommy and just ask God to move on the scene and to change hearts change Minds change lives that his will would be done would you do that would you join

about seven months he's in the I.T field and he's he wants God to move on the scene and to open a door for him so thankful he's he's not a God who only opens doors he's a God who closes doors because I've needed doors closed before because I would have walked through it but God being a the great Shepherd the Great Captain knows how to open and he knows how to close so I just pray that God would give him peace and then this time may he find the mind of God for his life and just lead him to that right job amen God knows how to do things we just also want to make mention that the Sunday school

meet that are just wanting to carry the work of God no he doesn't God understands Our God understands all languages matter of fact on the day of Pentecost my brother everybody understood in their own language maybe this will maybe this will be the evening but we one thing I can tell you about this church brother is we can feel the spirit and so you can pray in a language and we might not able to

blessing to come to the pulpit with my granddaughter singing Lord that's a blessing I thank you for it father I thank you for those that have come out tonight to hear your word father may they be strengthened may they be encouraged May our understanding be enlightened May our purpose be clear in God's word and Lord lead us we really want to work on your behalf father is reading and looking at some of the things in Nehemiah father they were a people that had a mind to work father and we want to have a mind to work for your kingdom father we're building up a spiritual man Lord strengthened on the inner man Lord we're just wanting so much more of you we ask you to bless us tonight and just be a wonderful Enlightenment to us in strength we ask these things in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen let's just uh turn back to Nehemiah just for a moment and uh we'll read the the scriptures and uh we're going to kind of uh backtrack a little bit but I just trust it'll be a blessing to you and and just a fortification and so we're going to go back to um uh the 17th and 18th verse of the second chapter of Nehemiah and he said here he said then I said unto them ye see the distress that we are in and I think that's a wonderful scripture for us recognizing our condition that was a great Enlightenment the prophet said that we had to recognize our day in this message and you know you'll never seek help unless you can recognize your condition if you don't think you're sick you're not going to go to the doctor if you think that you're you're good you're not going to ask for any change if you think you're right you're not going to seek after any knowledge or truth but if you could realize and and see the condition that we're in the distress that we're in then we can go forward he said you see the distress that we're in how Jerusalem life waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach then I told them of the hand of my God which was good unto me as also the king's words that he had spoke unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for the good work God bless you may be seated to kind of go back over not everything we said this morning but the things that we talked about the necessity of building a wall so I want to play this evening for you 18 minutes out of the message the God's power to transform how many believes that God's got power to change things amen that that that's that's what we count on and that's what that was their testimony when everybody said oh we want to jump in and help they said no God will provide for us he says this is our inheritance and we're not going to share the glory of God's word with anybody you know this is for God's people and and we know that this word is for an elected people we're going to start and of course you have the ability to go back and listen to the whole message it is a a great message it's very uh strong and very uh uh you know very powerful but we're going to start in paragraph 58 and I as we're listening to this the reason I want to play this portion of tape so that we can really understand what it is that we're building our wall against and that's what walls are for right they're to keep out the enemy they're to give distinction they're given to give Clarity uh I think most of us probably have fence around our property and the reason we do that is it's the it's the line that says this is this is what I'm going to take care of this is what I'm going to mow I I love it when I go down the street and two properties will come together there's only this much space between their driveways but one guy will mow half of it you know what I mean because that's his line you know what I mean now you know he may have mowed it one day for the other guy and the other guy might have come out hey don't mow my lawn you know what I mean I'll mow my lawn when I feel like it you know and uh so we don't know all the reasons but I think what we've got to really understand is that there's lines of Distinction there's clear cut lines of Distinction so we we want to see what it is what is what are we keeping out why are we building the line what's trying to come in and I thought there's really no better way for me to express it than just it just takes 18 minutes for us to listen as the prophet describes what is is happening in our generation and and why the walls are being built and I think you'll enjoy it uh you know brother REM says it says many many things in just a straight forward teaching voice just says it out there it's it's just matter of fact and I just think the bride lights up at it so if you have a device uh uh I I don't like that word device it just got a bad feeling to it but if you have something that you want to read along with or look or Mark uh your pad of some sort uh feel free if not I'm sure they'll play it up on the board but just this is preached in uh in let me give you the date for sure it's uh 1965 911 1965. it has significant and isn't it okay tell me that 911 didn't transform our whole country I started having to take off my shoes when I got in an airplane I couldn't drink water no more you know I had to go through a metal detector all kinds of things change and and in the direction but I want to just talk uh uh there there's just a a few great things that took place in this time uh this is right around the time that uh sister Florence I'm trying to think of oh no the Full Gospel businessman's shakarian she had passed away and and brother Branham had prophesied that she would in fact I believe he even spoke the hour in which that she would go away and everybody in the church around and everybody they stood up and prophesied that she would live and they called the blessings of God down and and they prophesied and and with tongues and interpretations of tongues and and everything just and I I remember you know Billy Paul asking his father I heard this story myself from them and and he said that I asked daddy about it you know how brother Billy would talk and he said she's it's going to happen just the way God showed me and it did just the way of God children that's how sure this Prophet was of what he was teaching and I appreciate that he wasn't ashamed to preach what he said so he'll mention that in this or I'll read a quote containing about but just sit back and just think as we listen to this what am I building my walls against how treacherous is the enemy that's trying to get into my life and what is he trying to do to me and I believe I hope it'll bless you so let's just listen together to these next 18 minutes it won't be long God bless you Jesus Was His only begotten son he was begotten by a woman but Adam was right straight from the hand of God in the creation Now the headquarters with his his son and his son's bride overall it looked so perfect there was a a man the head of all of it his own son and his bride and every seed was perfect The Palms and the Oaks and the grass and the birds and the animals and everything was in perfect order with the Commandment of God don't change your nature bring forth of its kind every seed oh don't you never be perverted into a pawpaw tree see Palm don't you be perverted into something else but every seed after his time and he he watched it through the times that it spoke the word and his great creating power had formed these things that come up and even the man and the woman and they were their head because they were the they were super to all the other races and he put them also under a care of the same thing that he put trees animals and so forth his word they must not never by no means break that word they must stay there don't never take anything from it or add anything to it you must live by this word and as long as that creation would have existed like that sister sha Karen wouldn't have had to have went this morning as long as it would have stayed like that God's Great economy it's what we believe that we're headed back to we're going back to that spot that place or that seventh morning God looked upon it all and he said it's good I'm pleased with it I'm glad I did it and it's all now under control and I put trust in my son that in his wife that if they'll make them ahead of all of us that they'll watch over it all and see that it's all right that everything will bring forth of its kind now he has the power to do that God then said well if it's all so good and it can't be anything else because it's my own desire it's the way I want it and I spoke it that way and my words has brought it just exactly the way I wanted it and there it is it's all good so the Bible said God rested the seventh day from all his works and everything under control to bring forth of its time now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was he is transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would be it cannot move from there it's Channel just exactly right so with everything and the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so uh just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that our desire to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power the make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I wanted to be God has never changed just the same today as he was then God's determined to do something do it nothing's going to stop him he'll do it now after it's all so well and set in order God felt assured now that this would all be all right and then when he did then came in the enemy I'm go to God Gave power to transform and I'm going to call this fella with power not to to create again but um he had power to deform not transform but to deform not anything deformed is taken from its original state there's something that's gone wrong with it some years ago on patrol going up through the corn fields uh I would think of a there was a land brought off of a tree and it fell over on a stalk of corn and the stock was tying its best to get up straight like it was supposed to be but it was deformed because that something had happened and uh stick was laying over then we'd find a wild creeper in the field which many of you man here maybe some of you women could come from Kentucky the women uses the whole there his thing as a man a get out in the field with the with the hole we call the old gooseneck hole and chop the The Creepers out or if you didn't get those Creepers out where the corn was in the roll like this then that creeper would reach over grab a hold of that car and wrap itself around gradually so easy so slowly that you hardly tell it was rapping and finally gets stronger and stronger and it pulls that corn to its deformed pulls it against itself wraps it around its own Vine deforming it from what it was to something else yet it's corn but it's deformed corn and we are all still in the image of God but but are so deformed as sons of God of God that walked contrary to his word and to you the way that that he had us and provided for us to walk setting something the world twists this out of the way pull us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God the Deep farmer I know this seems to be rather strange to speak of it in this way the the D form but that's what he was he deformed our perverted pervert needs to be changed over made something different and uh deform is the same thing that it's been brought over deep armed and made in a another way yet is still the same seed but it's deformed now we find that this deep farmer has also had same amount of time to defarm as God had to transform he planted his seat or never planted his seed he in the Garden of Eden since that time he's had 6 000 years of deforming the seed of God the word of God the deform it make it something different when he the first time that Eve listened to him and got herself just one little phrase remember first Satan quoted that scripture just as clear as they could be God has said that ye shall not eat of every tree in the Garden of Eden see you shall not eat of every treat and uh remember now he said yes we may eat of every tree but the tree that's in the midst of the garden we mustn't even touch it I'll watch him in his message twist that word just a little bit and saying he said for God said that if we do this that day we die he said oh surely you'll not die see he was a a man he said you you do this now and you're you're kind of an ignorant people you really you don't know all things but if you would only partake of this then you would have wisdom you'd have knowledge you know right from wrong and be like gods you if you'd only partake of this wisdom that I have I know but you don't but it's all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from God Divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom I don't care how much science we have and what more education it's of the devil I'll prove it to you Lord willing in a few minutes it's of the devil civilization is of the devil just got through preaching on that all culture in the Earth all the powers of Science and everything is of the devil it's his gospel he preached of knowledge in the Garden of Eden and he's took that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of God and now he's had 6 000 years to do just exactly what God did only in a perverted way it took the same amount of time to bring his own Eden in now he's got to eat in here on Earth and it's filled with wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science never did God ever cater to such and I I want you to watch him in he did this and because it he was a man of worldly wisdom now it's hard to say this it's it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of the Angels just behind the mountain the other this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid it's being revealed as God promised the Revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by God that is right God as I have said before in a message God doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he's his own interpreter he says it'll happen it happens that's he he confirms it that interprets it a few years ago when we Pentecostal people when the other churches told us that we were crazy we could not the Holy Ghost is the thing passed but we find out that God's promise was to whosoever Will and now we know different see that's just little by little this thing has opened up and now he promised that the Mysteries that was hidden those all those Church ages would be revealed right at the end time and it lets us know now we are at the end time we're here now now Satan is the author of civilization he is the author of science he is the author of Education you say is that true all right let us read in God's word now Genesis 4. and let's go back and just see for a minute I know I may if I get too long brother Carl will probably tell me but uh Genesis the fourth chapter in the 16th verse goes ahead telling here in the beginning what God did in order to place the curse upon the man and the woman and all that they was to do not the curse on them but tell them what would happen to curse the ground for Adam's sake and we find out here now that Eve had a pair of twins and one of them was of Satan and one of them was of God now you say oh no brother bran just a minute you find me one scripture anywhere that says that King was Adam's son I'll show you in the scripture where it says teen was all that evil one not Adam now notice when she conceived here we begin at the fourth chapter first and Adam knew his wife and she conceived in Bear King and said I have gotten she said now I have gotten a son from The Lord of course the head of you no matter if it's prostitute or anything had come from God see because that's the seed it's a law of a seed it has to bring forth whether it's corrupted seed perverted seed or whatever it is it's got to bring forth anyhow it's his command and she again bear his brother Abel no more knew him Adam knew his wife and she bear came and also bear Abel twins Satan was with her that morning Adam mad at you and you see the big bust in the paper here I believe in Tucson now that woman bringing forth a colored child and a white child at the same time she lived with her husband that morning and the man that afternoon and the man would take care of it the white man say take care of his own child but the colored man would have to take care of his own see I know that in breeding of dogs and so forth it certainly will if it's in a few hours afterwards this proves them now the show where civilization come from now let us read Genesis over here uh uh in the fourth chapter of Genesis again and see where the 16th verse and Cain went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the east side of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enough and he built a city and called the name of the city after his son Ina civilization storm Dr Scofield here in my Scofield bible says the first civilization notice then he be got sons and they made organs and music the next one be God's sons and he began to do other things wonders build cities and and make uh instruments of brass and all kinds of things see that's what he did become the first civilization which was Canaanite he's done the same thing down to the ages now let's get there with the 25th verse and watch what's the next was and Adam knew his wife again now and she bear a son and call his name Seth for God said she has appointed me another seed instead of Abel who came soon and saith and to saith to him also there was born the son and he called his name Enos and then began man to call upon the name of the Lord out of the safe side not the Canaanite side see that great intellectual that we also hold to what's communism today what's their God it's the intellectual science what are we doing anyhow why are we living consider these words today do you want to keep going I don't care I'll sit here and listen to the whole thing I mean this is life to me you get the point right civilization education those things are of the Devil he's a what he's a deformer amen so he said he said we're still the Sons and Daughters of God but we've been deformed so the the civilization and education and Science and all these things is is changing us from what that we're originally can do or if I could say it in another way it's hiding from us and keeping from us the power that we really have and so God's got a power and I think that uh we should be looking for that transforming power the power that can change us the the power that's within us to to be able to uh cause that change and so uh we we know that that he he just he laid this out in this great part because he wanted us to know that one came from one side and one come from the other and we're living in two Edens now right we're living in Satan's Eden right the God of this evil age Satan's Eden uh we're we're just at that time so what what are we building a wall between we're building a wall between the word and Satan's Eden that's what we're doing we have a place that we're living a place that we're protected a place that we come into he said education's fine he said but if it goes contrary to the word of God at all forget the education stay with God's word stay with God's word so we we so I wanted to point that out because that's the the thing so there's got to be something that makes that that Spirit come alive and so I'd like to just read this if I could he said and and you can put this up it starts at paragraph 103. if I was going to read it I should have probably just played it but it's my bad is that what they say my bad okay good anyway I want to be cool he says uh here notice the type of the two Edens so closely typed together till almost deceive the very elect that's why it's important that you understand you're elected okay because if you know you're elected then you know you're not subject to it you know I mean you've been set apart from it you don't have to go with the trend you don't have to go if they say oh if you don't go this way you won't survive yes I will I'm elected I don't care I I'm separated out I I got a different promise I live by a different code of ethics I live by faith I don't live by sight I live by promise I don't live by situation I don't live by perception I live by promise I live by God's word that's the first thing he emphasized right what we listen to whatever you do live by this word live by it you can trust it you can stay with it live by it get close to it that that's what we're talking about when we talked this morning about strengthing our hand in the work because Paul told Timothy Timothy study to show yourself approved know what he said know what I taught know the things that I've been opening up to you good to understand the understanding that I'm trying to give you understand you try to get people to think a certain way people go to business college people go to law school law school they want you to think a certain way don't believe anything you hear ask questions about it no matter what story they tell you pick it apart get to the facts you know what I mean it don't matter how sympathetic or how emotional you are the judge isn't going to rule on your emotions he's going to rule on the law you've got to present your case in the law you've got to have facts you know okay and and if you if you're in a trial and and you say a certain thing and it's not clear it's ambiguous in any form the other side will will stand up because I object to that it's hearsay it's it's subjective or you're badgering the witness any any kind of thing like when prophet of God preached his first sermon you remember he tells the story he said all the ladies were all crying on the front and everything and he said I was all puffed up and now I thought I really did a job and he said I walked into Brother David said how'd I do he said worst I ever heard you know he said oh the wind went out of myself he said what do you mean he said bill he says that remind me of the time in court and this attorney was just boohooing on he's finally the guy couldn't take it up and he already said your honor how much longer are we going to listen to this you know he said bill it was great but there wasn't one bit of word in it that pet the thing so what what are what why are we our wall that we're building what are we trying to keep in our lives we're trying to keep the word in there we're trying to keep the Word of Promise alive we we've got promises the god gaveth there it was called the promised land in Shadow and type right it was a land that he promised the land of milk and honey of good land a land that could provide a land that would support him they came back and brought the evidence of that lamb great big great leaves and and and the honey and fruit and everything and they said it's everything that he said it would be oh but there's a big old Giants in that land Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to take it because this is as I redist just think of it here he says the two Edens he says in Matthew 24 24 said that it would it would be that way but I want us to stop for a few moments and to consider these two Edens and the one thing especially how the Bible tells us that God's word did produce that Eden and how God's word warns us that the other Eden would come that's something a great statement isn't it if you take time to read them he said God made the one Eden and he warned us that this other Eden was going to come right he says now we also know that there has got to be another Eden if we would also listen to The Prophet Paul in second Thessalonians the second chapter I could read it if you wanted to he who exalts himself that day will not come of the Lord until that man of sin be revealed who who sits in the temple of God exalting himself above all that is called God so that he as God is worshiped as God why what what was inside of those walls of Jerusalem it was the temple our place of worship right that's that's what we're we we've got we we don't want to worship a false image the Trinity is idol worship we don't want no idols right we want to worship what he is I don't want to worship a man-made image of Jesus some brothers were telling me today at lunch about uh some of these Productions in these Hollywood Easter programs that were going on and all the light flashing and everything and they call that God that's not God has never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever and so he says and think of that he says now Isaiah the prophet said that he saw Lucifer in his heart through a vision under inspiration of God saying he would do that Isaiah 800 years before Paul or approximately that now here 800 years later Paul sees him comes to his position no one is its head up his Eden his scientific Eden with his scientific world with his scientific bride Church all under the word of knowledge great seminaries great great decrees educational programs listen brothers and sisters each one of us is going to walk that road that Florence walk I ask you in Jesus name to consider this not consider me I'm your brother that isn't it consider the word that I am speaking of God's Bible and look through perfectly Vindicated in God's Own word in the age we're living in where we're at so what do we know what's he just talking about he's talking about the deformer the deformer has never been working like he's working now look at oh can you see it this is supposed to be the age of as it was in the days of Solomon Gomorrah well he's deforming human beings I mean forming our children and and and and it just it just kind of deforming this and deforming that and taking this down and taking that down like I said this morning he's trying to do away with all the lines everything's so ambiguous that you can hardly find God you know with what's right and wrong is hard to understand I mean our thinking has been deformed I mean you know this is just a reality that we live in they they decided that they would never they they would no longer prosecute any theft under 800 dollars did you know that certain States if someone would go into a store and start stealing things they're told not to interfere and you say well why would they do that do you understand there's a thinking behind it and they're thinking behind it is it it's a it's a form of equity so if the people that don't have steal from the people that have then they are now in they've got something that they have and now they're in a more Equitable position it's it's a deformed thinking you know let's make everybody equal let's spread it around let's just do it and say it's a way of thinking they feel it's Progressive they're trying to save a dying universe right well they they they they might call it the uh the green New Deal they don't have their own new deals for this Earth how many knows what's going to happen to this earth it's going to burn I do not have environmental anxiety because I had a prophet tell me that the bride would not go into the tribulation amen I've got a ticket it's inside of me it's the power to transform me out of this before it burns God's got the power to transform he's got the power to take me out he's got the power to keep me he's got the power to make me be able to live and be his son and his daughter I'm looking for that power because I know it exists I know the power is within me to overcome it's in the seed and if all's I got to now is look for the spirit that quickens the seed it would be so close it would deceive the very elect you say the rain falls on the just and the unjust yes the rain falls they both jump up and shout but I'm looking for the one that's sure if I shout that's great but I want it to go beyond the shout and make the seed in me come to life the word come to life in me amen and so we we see it he says he said the age that we're living in now these programs are absolutely Antichrist in themselves now he has got to have an Eden he said he would do it here is the simple word of God saying that he would do it and here we're looking right out and seeing him do it we're watching them do it I mean it's it's insane we're watching them do it they want to do away with gold they want to do it with money they want to do away with cars they want to put everybody on batteries I don't want to be on nothing that runs out you know what I mean remember that big freeze we had and all the electricity was shut down we had a lot of them gas Savers stuck in Houston well I'm not trusting any of that the main thing I don't want is I don't want the spirit cut off I don't want him to deform me or I can't hear from God where I don't look for the spirit that's why you've got to get in the spirit you've got to set up time the carnal mind is against God but the spiritual mind is life and it's liberty you take away from the thinking of this world and understand that there's another mind it's a spiritual mind it's a word mind you've got to tap into it that's what charges your battery got to be charged up we've got to walk in the spirit as he is in the spirit we kind of get into the spirit of the of of the city that we're living in of the land that we're living in where the temple is of worshiping and and having a life set aside for him and and touching on the promises and living by the promises and looking to the promises to be quickened I I want the promises of God transformed from promise to Vindication in me and made flesh that's what I mean I want to see the promise come from seed to fruit yes to exactly what it is that he said I was here to become right that's what his power is his power is to transform us to become what that he put us here to become and what did he put us here to become he put us here in this day you and I that's sitting in this room to become that statue of a perfect man to become in the image of his son with all these virtues that was his attributes on display and to be capped with the love of God shed abroad in our heart that is not offered by the deformer the deformer offers compromise he's a mixer let's mix a little of this with a little of that you know what happens when you mix a little of God and a little of the world together what you get you get religion I don't want religion I want the reality of the seed that's in me [Music] I want what it was that the prophet of God talked about he planted in everything in order the seed that's in me that he planted to bring forth what he had in his mind for me to be that's what I want to make contact with sure that's what I want the spirit to Quicken that's what I want to come in life I don't want to transform into a religious form I don't want to be transformed into a conformity but I want to come to that image of that man that he told me that that he had in mind for me because I'm his workmanship foreordained unto good works that I should walk in them so I want to seek what are those works what would you have me to do what attributes do I have well Lord I know you've put me or for a reason I know you put me here for a purpose I know that you love bring that alive in me make that come out in me I'm gonna wall out all these other things till I make contact with that and I'm gonna I'm asking you to reveal that to me and give me the revelation of it that I can walk in it in confidence amen then I can walk up to somebody and say friend I you look like you're down you look like you're heartbroken you look like you're under a lot of Burden I'd like to pray for you there's promises in God's word God said he's a present help in the time of trouble and and I want to be there for you and not be embarrassed but you know Satan's always that oh if you go do that you'll be a fool or they'll reject you you know he's got all this mind battle before you get there I want to overcome that battle I want to possess that gate when he says doubt I want to say word when he says stop I want to say wait a minute the word told me to go I want to tell him to get behind me [Music] you say well can I do that yes you're made to do it you're created to do it you're the same creation that was in the garden that had power over all the things and everything was set in order and you were to look out after it we just heard him say it but something's deformed us right and we know what that is don't we science education civilization he's the creator of it all and now we're absolutely being called out in this hour to be Overcomers let's just read on just a little bit these programs are absolutely Antichrist in themselves now he has got to have an Eden he said he would do it and here is the simple word of God saying that he would do it and here we are looking right and seeing him do it he has done it with his intellectual scientific denominational bride he is going to take head one of these days in a world Council of churches that will be set up and will be with him trying the people not because they're bad people they were planted in straight row like corn but Satan sold the creepers called science research education doctor's degrees sometimes they won't even let you in the Pulpit unless you can produce a doctor's degree from some Seminary somewhere it's all wrong so what were those things they're creepers you understand so if we can build a distinct line remember what he just talked about you got to hold them out hold them out if you don't hold them out they'll wrap you up you'll still be the corn but you're so deformed you can't be recognized anymore and I think that's what's happened to the church is we can't recognize ourselves anymore for what that we really are we've been defeated and lied to so much by Satan remember God can't lie but Satan's the father of Lies there's no truth in them that we don't recognize ourselves and that's one of the things we've got to do we've got to recognize ourselves as the elect we've got to recognize our calling we've got to recognize that we have heard the voice that we've heard and it's a trumpet it's not an uncertain sound it's calling us to something it's not calling us to sit back and say I believe William branham's the prophet of God well that's like knowing you got a mailman but never opening the box I mean you can keep stuffing the letters in the Box you know what I mean until finally he puts a little slip in there and says they're all down at the post office well that's like this Kevin quote stuffed on you everything's stuffed in you and then finally saying well there's a whole 1100 tapes over here no you've got to start opening them up you got to start reading them you got to read those promises and when you hear a promise of God you ought to sit there and say Lord send the power that transforms this from promise into life then we'll start claiming our inheritance all right we'll start taking back from Satan what what he squatted on have you ever seen so much controversy that's going on out there in the news about squatters you know sometimes I think I just ought to quit reading the newspaper they're squatters everywhere squatters squatters they move in on your property and they sit in there and they live in there and you hold the title deed he doesn't have any right on your property he doesn't have any right to your possessions he doesn't have any right to hold your promise from you but you've got to like the prophet of God said you've got to go out and twist it out of the greasy hand of the enemy look that code up you got to take it from him amen you got to say it's mine I'm elected to it I'm called to it I'm ordained to it there's a seed inside of me that's calling to bear this fruit and you can't deform me from producing these fruits of the spirit that I'm supposed to have amen I want him in my life amen amen I want a love I want to be patient I want to be kind I want to have temperance I want those things I want to have them on displayed I'm not saying I'm there not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be I thank God for that but I want Christ to live in me and I'm not going to set be beat down because the accuser tells me I haven't obtained yet the promise isn't the the obtaining the promise is that there's a power there that will transform me so that's what I'm seeking I'm not looking at my failures I'm looking at a power that can take me from my failures to my big my victory that's what I'm looking for that's what I want to con come into contact with that's what I want to have an experience with God's power to transform God's power to change things that's what I'm looking for all those guys that started building that wall they said God will provide they were looking to the grace and mercy and power of God to have them to be able to perform the task that they set forth to do and no matter how the enemy come against it they were going to do it whether they had to work with a tool in one hand and a sword in the other Satan you want to stop I'll fight you with one hand and I'll claim the promise with the other Hallelujah he said he says and it's all wrong not the people it's the programs that's wrong you know the prophet of God said Leslie rest reading me the quote this afternoon he says when your brother offends you never hold that against your brother it was the devil that did that in fact a lot of people wouldn't do the things they did if it wasn't for the devil and some things we do ourselves were not too bright a lot of times and we try to blame it on the devil but he's not that dumb you can strike that from the wreck he said it's all headed up again he said the whole program's wrong and now what's it done it's all headed up again and brought up the whole entire world through a bunch of hybriding perversion of the Original Seed of God to another dark chaos right now how many she's the chaos you know you got to be and yet the word of God says be careful for nothing you know if you're living God's words you don't have to be careful if you tell the truth you don't have to remember what you said last time the first scientific Christian is what honesty just be honest just tell your friend say friend I really don't like you but I'm praying real hard that I do well sometimes you can just be quiet but I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad you're here God is mindful of us you say is that scripture for today he said it then but while he was saying it he was storing up all this food for you because you were the ones that's going to need it I wish I had that quote he says I'm saying all this stuff now he says but there's a generation coming amen right well you wanted to say who that generation is I'm that generation I'm the generation that came after the message left all right I'm the generation that had to live off the tapes I had to live out of the storehouse would I wish I would have been there possibly so but I accept where God put me blessed is he who believeth and see it now right I'm happy to take the blessing prophet's reward I'm happy to take that I'm so glad he's mindful of again that he can still move upon the face of the conditions right all this condition all this perversion all this science he can still move upon it he can still move upon the chaos in other words what's he telling us it's dark it's bad but church I can still move on you I can still move through you I can still use you you can still be a Shining Light you're still my elect lady you still have a calling I still have a work there's a seed in you I want to transform Lord move on me yeah amen move on my condition you say I'm back said move on my backslid I've got doubt move on my doubt I've got bitterness move on my bitterness move on the condition because there's a seed in me that's crying out there's a deep in me calling to a deep that you promised you would transform me into the seed that I'm supposed to be I'm so glad for that face of the condition he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride that's the call I'm listening for sure you say well I I want to work go work in that you want to be at the engineer you want to be a rocket scientist no problem don't talk to me about Rockets be like talking to a canary but it's okay but don't substitute the calling of God the calling of the little bride the calling to Perfection the calling to a statue of a perfect man the call to the image of Christ the call to the Capstone don't let none of these things deter you from that no matter what you're doing whether you're in construction whether you're in sales whether you're in medicine whether you're in medical whether it no matter what field you're in you're trying to manifest Christ in that field no matter what you are or where you are we let our light shine that our good works might glorify Our Father in heaven we are not shortened any wise if God be for us who can be against us so we're we're looking for that okay this this calling that the call of the little flock that's a good name for a sermon isn't it the call of the little flock Hallelujah which would be his bride notice here again how perfectly these churches type are these Edens God threw a seed of his word yes how's he going to do it through the seed of his word how's he going to call this bride through the seed of his word it's almost like saying the bride was in the seed you were he knew you right sure the color of your hair is the color of your eyes exactly where you'd be the statue would be in but believe me you haven't surprised God you think any of you have surprised God you are such a little surprise for God that he died for your sins before you did them now that's somebody that knows the beginning from the end it's got a time for restoration he's got a time for everything sometimes we think people are away from God their backslid even God takes the permissive will and works it to the perfect will we have a God that's in control all he wants us to do is to start removing the deformer out of our life he wants us to build out walls against the deformer quit listening to the lies of the enemy start telling Satan to get back to where he's belonged and for us to start taking our position in Christ simple it's simple who's making it complicated your brain because that's where the battle is you've got to start winning the battle in your mind he gave you the weapons over the Mind battle if God could give you any better weapon he would have done it sure what did he give you he gave you his word doesn't matter if Satan appears of an angel of Light give him a word test the word will expose him every time he said God threw a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit right that's what we're looking for we're not looking for Sensations those Sensations are good I like to get happy I like to laugh you know someone says something that's funny I you know you like just to laugh and I like to laugh until I have to yeah Catch My Breath we call it snorting I like to do that I like to just get excited and and and just thank God you know I was talking with Ron Peterson the other day we just got done talking about the time that we pulled the car over on the side of the road and was just running around that car shouting the Praises of God and everything he finally said to me says you know Brother David I think people are going down the road thinking that we were chasing one another to kill each other and we started getting dizzy going one way so we turned around and ran around the car the other way we just got excited about we were elected as years ago on Flagstaff we realized we weren't in California what we realized that what he brought us out of what he had transformed us to was God done transforming us no but praise God the power of transformation was working that's what I love so he planted the seed right God through the seed word and there's only one thing that can Quicken that word and that's the spirit the spirit is the purpose for which God planted the seed that's the spirit of the seed the spirit of an orange seed is and orange that's the manifested fruit of the orange now if you came to my house and asked me for an orange and I gave you a seed you would say well brother McGarry that's not what I wanted I said oh I gave you thousands of oranges what are you griping about that you have to put a little labor into it you have to put a little work into it you've got to do a little cultivation that's what we're like God gave us himself in seed form he's our father he put a seed in us which is him in a form that can grow into his son and daughter marriage and the Earthly was all a tight didn't you hear what he just said in the message he said sure this seed came from God because the seed had a law it would bring forth of its kind so if God threw seed put his seed in it then that seed has to produce God hallelujah it can produce nothing else but you got to keep the deformers out you've got to build the wall out you got to water it yeah you can't keep digging it up he said you don't plant corn and and go out there and dig it up you got to let it run its course and the Sea of God is running its course in the elected some of you might have been planted later or sooner I don't know that I know there's an 11th Hour worker I don't know what hour was assigned to me maybe I'm a seventh hour worker you know but I remember there's one thing that they were called workers there's no 11th Hour slouches there's no 11th Hour bums there's no 11th Hour lazy Christians it's given to those to be adopted that are about the father's business but I'm excited you say well I haven't been about this business what you need is a taste of the quickening power that's what you pray for you pray for Revelation you pray for the touch not a touch for something that only lasts for a service or two sure and we've got to have that I like worshiping the Lord don't you know that song we sang today you know uh I love you Lord You Know listen oh I wish we'd just sing that for 10 minutes sometime so she she just likes to put it on her radio in her car and just listen you know I I just like it it's like me I put that song on there is a blood I just play it over and over again wear that thing out because I can't wear the blood out I might as well wear the tape out we like that right but these things we will do if God so permits but let us move on to perfection so look at what he says he said God through the seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken that word and that's the spirit for it is the life Giver to the word that's what we want Lord I've got the seed I recognize my desire to overcome now Lord I need the life-giver give me the life that brings This Promise alive in me for your healing for your deliverance for your overcoming for your peace of mind for your loved one for your children it don't matter what it is there's a life Giver Amen to the word it's the power to transform that word a promise to reality I like it amen I want it Is For Real it's for whosoever will how many member of the prophet of God said that just in what we listen to you for whosoever will I will That's The Vow I will I do that's our marriage vow with him I will I do will you have them will you hold them will you keep them I will I will I want his will he said for it's the life-giver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is Hallelujah right so my part when the life in the word that's the word that he put in me the seed is the life of the word meets the life of the spirit that's when he takes his spirit and quickens let's Quicken mean s alive that word a promise that's in you it'll produce whatever the seed is oh my God you like that yes yes does anybody want to shout Hallelujah it's good stuff is life it's glorious amen I would I would tell you the run but you'd break your neck and that's just how crowded it is but we're going to have some Running Room pretty soon so you just feel get ready but don't run without the spirit now let's add a little bit of sobriety here for a moment and let's turn to paragraph 188 and we'll close him because we're still talking about the walls of our life and why we're building in it and what is inside the city for the believer and he just makes this quick statement in 182. he says in paragraph 182 he says so it seems to be now so hard for people to Humble themselves to the word of God they just don't want to do it they'll handle themselves to a Creed of a church but not to the word of God now let's jump over to paragraph 88. and so don't let anybody tell you that it's any other way than what the prophet said the prophets didn't even understand what they were saying Moses didn't miss anything Isaiah didn't miss anything none of they just said what God told them to say they didn't even know why they said it right they didn't understand it you know just like in the scripture where the the scripture says the world was without form or void well we understand that more than anybody I mean man people were looking at it from this side of the word and they said it didn't have any form or void it was in the world well where was it now we get Revelations of the seals and we step over on this side of it and we say it's in the mind of God he knew it from the beginning of the end and then when he moved upon it it started taking form when he moves upon the seed it starts to come to life so you say I pray for Revelation yes Revelation is The Enlightenment that you know the seeds for you now pray for the spirit to move upon your revelation amen and bring it to life well this is a great sobering thought there is a line you can cross now why are we talking about walls because we don't want to cross the line don't go outside the city I believe there was like I don't know I forget who it was the Bible character but he's in the Bible he'd done something wrong took somebody's Vineyard killed them and those things like that and he was safe as long as he stayed in the city and did David tell joab is that but he told him he said you know make sure this guy doesn't live all the days of his life I hope that gets you encouraged to go read that Bible story and I think a donkey or something got away and he got so greedy and possessive that he walked out from under the protection that God had provided for him and he crossed the line good and he lost his life you know there was a prophet that God told them to go prophesy and he said go prophesy don't stop return don't stop the talking and another Prophet came out appearing as an angel of Light and gave him a big sad pitch about you know I know you're hungry and tired and everything why don't you come rest with me and all those things and he said oh that sounds like a good idea you know that just must be the Lord no the Lord don't tell you the two two different things and usually God speaks first so he goes down and sits down and everything and so thankful brother we're in such wonderful Fellowship it's good he's just fellowshipping with this guy then the guy stands up and prophesies I told you not to go you're gonna be dead the guy's done what did he do he crossed the line we've got predestination down that we think predestination allows us to do whatever we want whenever we want to do it well you may not lose your predestination you just must lose your life be totally fruitless and be saved by fire how many wants to choose that option any takers you'll still be there you'll have a life with no service you'll have a life with no fruits you'll be consumed by fire and saved by fire but you'll still be there you talk about choosing the lesser of two evils I don't want to go that way so I want to take heed right this is for us we have it on the boat there there is a line you can cross you know that don't you now ministers both here and out on the telephone land where this broadcast is coming across the Nations do you realize that When You See It scripture and you won't do it God won't always heal oh you'll go on be blessed so every one of Israel they lived right on in the wilderness and raise children crops and blessed and everything but every one of them eternally separated from God Jesus said so oh yes God will bless you right on but you're you're gone certainly that's what the Bible says now that's what he says notice you can cross the separating line do you believe that Cain did that's a good thing to add in our balance prophet of God said we've taken Grace and turned it into disgrace we want to be careful you say well what happens if I cross the line be quick to repent cry Abba Father come back to him right away Lord I didn't mean to do it never never never make an excuse for sin if it's sin it's sin if you did it repent he's just and faithful to forgive you but when you try to butter it up and try to explain it and try to do it then you've broke down your wall and now that Spirit has free access to come back and forth the next time you'll come up with a better explanation and a better explanation and pretty soon you'll give yourself a reason and all of a sudden you know you get one of these remarks God don't care whether you drink or smoke he loves everybody people have Fallen away from this message which had blessed them gave them influence they've seen Miracles done through the message they had and they let one little seed in one little reason in and they crossed the line that separated them they tried to get in there and reason with them and he's smarter than you are right he's given us an answer he didn't say I had to understand it he said I had to believe it and I do I can't explain the cloud where it come from and everything I don't know all what you want me to know from science how are you gonna get a scientific answer when Satan is the author of Science and he's a liar and there's no truth in them all I know is what he said he said God left the sign in the cloud turn it it's the what I said in in Services is the time the white wig supreme authority amen it was where it was right it's a way the way he described it so I can just see the prophet on the phone hello NASA I need a rocket shot up out of California February you'll do that for me right that's more ignorant did anything that they don't have anything in them to believe with they cross the line right and they go on being blessed but they're goners and I believe God says these things because Peter said be sober and be diligent right because he's provided for us an entrance into the kingdom of God it's a can we just read he said he says let us just turn over here a minute in Hebrews 10 6. let us see if we if that is right quick the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter I believe the 26th verse I got it wrote out here just a minute if you'll bear with me let's just read it a minute all right here we are for if we will for at least for if we sin willfully that we've received the knowledge of the truth after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but certain fearful looking for the judgment and the fiery ignic nation which should Devour the adversary don't give room for him build a wall keep them out no matter how smart he is you know just be dumb enough to believe God's word amen God didn't come to the rich of this world he came to the rich in faith that's thus saith God's holy word if we disbelieve willfully after we've seen it and heard it then we've crawled Weaver across the line there will never be no more forgiveness for it you have crossed the line oh you say God still blessed me oh yeah remember Israel the borderlines when God gave them a promise over in the Holy Land in the land it was good of milk and honey and when Moses set out Caleb and Joshua and the spies to go over and spy out the land and brought back the Vindicated evidence the Ten of them said we can't do it we're unable look at the difficulty there will be fanatics we've got these little bitty things to fight with look what they got we can't do it we're not able to do it boy aren't we fighting the Giants in the land we can't be that Christian can't have that Faith to lay our hands on our sin we can't cast out those devils look at how big those devils are crack and alcoholism and sure demons and Cancers and all kinds of stuff he's just got the land possessed and what do we got we're nobody we got two or three four four hundred people 500 people maybe we got a mega church with a thousand people that's nothing there's 20 million Catholics in the United States numbers where's our power In The Word of Promise why did Joshua and Caleb say look at their response in Joshua and Caleb said we are more than able to do it God made the promise Glory so what are we looking for we're looking for the transforming quickening power of the spirit right that brings that promise to life in us that we will act upon it and call those things which are not as if they are now we're fanatics bye amen now we start testifying to things that haven't happened yet yes amen praise God my family saved praise God for brother such and such praise God for this praise God for that people say I don't see none of it that's okay what did he say that nurse he said brother Branham here look at the chart yeah there's been nobody that's only had 13 pulses per minute in their heart or whatever it was yeah that Old Saint got up and walked over there he didn't yell at that nurse he put his arm around her because he wanted her to have what he had he says sister I understand you you're looking at the chart all right we're looking at a promise and we believe God is able to perform that which he promised amen that is faith and faith is a gift of God it's the quickening power that he gives you to bring the word of God alive in your life it's in you in seed form the deformer has kept the quickening power from getting to it Daniel had to pray and pray and pray because Satan withstood the angel but who prevailed when there was nobody worthy to open the book who prevailed amen when we looked like we're a mess who's going to prevail is he going to have a bride yes is she going to be without spot or wrinkle yes am I a part of it yes do you say well you have a couple wrinkles praise God's got an iron and and we are more than able to do it God made the promise and remember they turned back that was that Katie sparnia they turned back and became wanders in the wilderness and every one of them died it was lost eternally Jesus said so don't cross that separating line see you know to do good and don't do it not to you it's sin that's why we are what we are that's why we build the line walls that's why we're called out that's why we're separated sisters that's why you don't cut your hair you dress wholly you live clean brothers that's why you don't partake of the world you look after the sisters you look after your children we take our post to duty we stand in our Watchtower and and we let our light shine we have a gate that's open the Sheep gate you know can you go back down you know the next gate after the Sheep gate the fish gate that's where you go fishing for Souls you have a way for them to come in and then you have a gate you fish for them you know you know what I think the next gate is I think it's the dung gate that's where you clean all the stuff out of your life and we could just go through all seven of the gates a horse gate you know what I mean power of God just different types and rubber bands that horse means power now you're all wanting me to go through the gates you know I mean you got Bibles yeah you know maybe we'll go through one or two of the gates and and uh everything you know I believe there's a gate that's called the Damascus gate and that may not be in in uh nehemiah's time but when I read about the Damascus gate what do you think I thought about Paul being on this road to Damascus right and that's the gate that brought the gospel to the Gentile now that's just me reading the Bible you understand I don't have a prophetic Ministry and I don't know I'm just saying that there's a lot of inspiration in the scriptures so Lord bless you we love you let's have a good week uh Tommy has spoke the rain away so I'm going to join my faith with his you know what I mean and and I just know whatever's ahead of us he's in control but in a way if our if our trusses get dropped off this Tuesday uh we're gonna have to nail them all they're going to drop them off singly 100 of them and then we've got to put them together so if there's anybody that can swing a hammer you know if you if you have the hammer I've got the nail or you bring the nail and I'll give you the hammer I don't care but anyway we hope they're dropped off if you can come tomorrow afternoon tomorrow evening and help us spread it's a Tuesday evening and if it's raining just put on a rain suit and uh we'll work forward and if we do have service next Wednesday night everybody will have to park in the far parking lot because the first two these first two parking lots around the building are going to be shut down so just get used to going to the second entrance going in and parking back there anyway you think we can do it amen you think we can become in the statue a lot of things fighting against us a lot of big alley-oops out there but what is he he's a bluff we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus we can all do all things through Christ Jesus that's within us if the same spirit that was in Christ dwell in you it'll Quicken your Immortal bodies God send that transforming power I'm looking for the transforming power I'm looking for the quickening life that brings that seed that's in me you say brother McGeary if you reached maturity potentially but there's a power yes because there's a promise that he that started the work in me would finish it till the end and that's my story and I'm sticking with it God bless you [Applause] Lord let's all stand I like that there's a promise if there's a promise then there's power the power of transformation now let's see that Psalms 34 I sought the Lord can we do that or a few more comfortable praise the Lord I enjoyed the word today isn't that wonderful just to have the word broke to you we can feed on that and it's not just for today you can feed on that tomorrow you can open

privilege it is to have one on the Watchtower saying don't cross the separating line [Music] think of that young lady brother Branham was having a Revival in a Baptist Church and the Holy Spirit said go talk to that young woman hear the prophet to the age God directed The Prophet back said young lady God's calling you and she said if I wanted somebody to talk to me he walked away the Lord said go back and call her again and he went back and she refused third time outside the church she said if I wanted somebody to talk to me I'd have somebody more sense you know God's calling to you tonight let's don't cross the separated in line let's don't think this is just by chance our pastor going to the storehouse and come and say don't cross the separating line because some of us are on the fence some of us are thinking about things out there but I say oh God I want to take heed to the message of the hour because it was just three or four years the prophet saw that young girl she said oh I I could see my mama's soul fry in hell and it wouldn't bother me a bit because what happened she didn't heed the message of the hour I say oh God thank you for your call tonight Lord may I be sensitive
