========================================

words speak to me show [Music] want to me a witness [Music] me [Music] of these [Music] defeat [Music] compassionately [Music] oh anyway [Applause] [Music] show me what i've never seen before [Music] you can take what's wrong and make it [Music] me man that's our desire this morning to be his reflection this morning amen brother david junior if i could just come and open our service in prayer [Music] just go before the lord together gracious heavenly father we come before you lord knowing that the only approach we have is through calvary there's no worthiness that we would bring of ourselves there's no works there's there's no words father that would grant us audience with you but you sent your son he suffered and died that we would have an approach to you father our confidence is in that price and that sacrifice this morning lord that [Music] you knew each heart that would be gathered here this morning father and as we've tried to incline our hearts to know your will and your thoughts lord we don't know each need that would be represented here lord but we know you care about each one father to the ones we may not even be aware of there could be even those in their car now or those who will leave immediately after service it doesn't matter how small we may see the need father your love towards us is so great that you care about each one lord if we could just seize upon that how much you love us this morning that you desire to feed us that you desire to show us your will and lord we want to have the eyes to see grant us eyesight lord is there's many things that would try to move upon our hearts and swayed us one way or the other we believe there's something ex for each individual that would order our footsteps lord that we could be moved by the things of your kingdom lord there's so much trouble in the land but you said you'd be a comfort you'd be a refuge lord there's that hiding place that this message has provided us in this day we're so thankful for it this morning father lord we want to thank you for your goodness and love that's kept us lord how you've been so long suffering that you haven't rewarded us according to our iniquities but father you've deemed us to be your own to be partakers of your righteousness so lord we ask now as we've gathered in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ that you take complete control of the service father lord we rebuke any hindering spirit any lying devil father may we see us as you see us lord jesus so with that father we ask you to have your will and way now we commit each part of this service to you giving you all the praise and glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen amen good to be gathered in the house of god this morning amen it's certainly happy to be gathering his presence i know this morning it feels like it was an hour too early it feels like certainly welcome all our visitors as you invite better mike for our song reading and man god bless you good morning we're gonna read psalm 73 this morning this is one of a collection of psalms that wasn't written by david this is this is a psalm of asaph and if you remember asaph was appointed by david to lead the worship in the tabernacle he was the worship leader of the church and as we read psalm 73 brother asaph is giving us a testimony of an experience that he had it turns out the brother asaph was struggling with something the chapter starts out in verse one truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart then it says in verse two but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped you know and then as we read on for half the chapter you know we see that brother asaph had become discouraged you know he began to start looking at those around him those that maybe didn't seem to be struggling like he was maybe they were seemed to be living a little bit more of a comfortable lifestyle or didn't seem to have the same struggles that he had seemed to have it easier seems to be more secure seems to just float along and he began to get discouraged by that it says in verse 13 verily i have cleansed my heart in vain i have washed my hands in innocency he began to think maybe maybe i'm missing something maybe i'm fooling myself maybe i'm putting all this effort and struggle into into walking a certain way and it doesn't have to be this hard maybe i'm just making it too hard on myself maybe i'm missing out on something you know maybe if he took a little bit of a bigger job or spent a little bit more time with a hobby or maybe spent more time in finances or investments or maybe built a larger social circle or whatever it took to be just a little bit more comfortable a little bit more successful to feel a little bit more accepted or to be a little bit more secure maybe i wouldn't have to struggle so much while i'm serving god you know brother asap's testimony he gets to this place of discouragement and he's just about to throw in the towel and then there's this verse in verse 17. it says this until i went into the sanctuary of god that's right then understood i therein something changed for brother asaph in the sanctuary of god he began to realize maybe he had his eye on the wrong thing after coming into the sanctuary his testimony changes completely it says in verse 23 nevertheless i am continually with thee thou is holding me by my right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire besides thee two totally different witnesses and the difference was the sanctuary of god now keep in mind the sanctuary of god is not a church building or a worship service you know that's this isn't about asap going into church and coming out of a worship service differently this isn't a congregational thing this is the word sanctuary means a special place a place set apart from everything around it webster has an an uh statement which i thought was interesting a place of safety or security a place of immunity from prosecution or enforcement to the law a place with just you and god you know asaph began to find himself where he began to measure his success his security his progress by physical things he kind of looked at physical measurements by his associates by the things that he had or didn't have by the things he had accomplished or didn't accomplish and he began to use a physical measuring gauge to measure whether he was where he needed to be that he was somehow exposed or unsafe or insecure you know it's only human to look at trying to meet your physical needs with physical things we're taught that from the time we're children you know get better education get a better job save up these things have these things and you're more successful you're more secure pay attention to what people think about you how you look all these things and if we're not careful that can become our sanctuary that can become our place of safety that can become the basis of our security even without knowing it that's what asap started to think look at what everyone else has is their safety maybe i'm exposed you see that's what lot did you know he began to establish for himself a place of safety a place of comfort first near and then in the walls of sodom you know it was easier there he surrounded him with surrounded himself with things that secured him that's the problem that the children of israel had in egypt as well you know they weren't held there by physical chains they were held there by the belief that their security and their safety and their comfort were based on building treasure cities for pharaoh and it wasn't until a visitation of the lord came by their way for both of them pulling them out of that frame of thinking and bringing them into the sanctuary of god that they began to have the right approach you know once you find yourself in that sanctuary you begin to realize that none of these physical indicators have anything to do with your security or your comfort or your success or your safety doesn't matter who you know doesn't matter what your social circles are doesn't matter whether you've got money in the bank or not it doesn't matter if you're healthy or not it doesn't matter if you have a nice home or not none of that is a measure of a sanctuary but the sanctuary of god is based exclusively on his presence you know once asaph found himself in the sanctuary of god he began to realize in verse 23 who's always been with him holding his hand in verse regardless of the physical circumstances in verse 24 that in spite of all his planning and all his effort ultimately it was god guiding his steps and his path and then in spite of all good works he might do it was god making him acceptable in glory the sanctuary of god that place that is not bound by physical circumstances but by his presence so you know as we read psalm 73 this morning you know i would maybe remind you from the testimony of asaph not to get your eyes on physical circumstances in any way good or bad your sanctuary isn't there but in the presence of the lord that sanctuary with him something that only you can do with him find that place and in there is safety security so let's read that together as we read the testimony of asap in psalm 20 73 starting in verse 1 truly god is good to israel even to such as our of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nice slipped for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore pride capacity them about as a chain violence covert them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are rung out to them and they say how does god know and is there knowledge in the most high behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in richness verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning if i say i will speak thus the old i should offend against the generation of thy children when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i therein surely thou did set them in slippery places thou casted them down into destruction how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors as a dream when one awakens so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reigns so foolish was i and ignoring i was a beast before thee nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by thy right hand thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me the glory whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee my flesh and my heart fail it but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works [Music] oh there's a country far beyond the stirring time oh and it's the city where the [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh

then i'll have no fear i will have no fear i got one more rivet across one more batter to climb one more valley that i gotta go through i'm leaving my troubles behind one more battle with the devil

school uh service was just exactly what i was thinking in my mind and the reason why i resolved it resulted to this song um you know trying as much as possible to do the best we can as individuals you know trying to save you know for the family thinking about the future you know what happened you know maybe the worst case scenario what happens if i'm no longer here you know am i getting everything

just take the spiritual thing and you put it right there and um you know when things happen you just go to and say okay oh oh god okay uh almost like secondary but which is not supposed to be um and

20 first psalm that brother neville would like to ask this blessing upon his son and so if you would like to turn there [Music] we'd like to read the fourth through the 8th the verse this morning and it reads behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is the shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night the lord shall preserve thee from all evil and shall preserve thy soul the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from time from this time forth and even forever more amen and those are the

the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you this morning god bless you thank you [Music] hey man thank you musicians this morning and and uh uh it's already 11 o'clock so we've we've already had an hour of preliminaries but we'll do our best with it and i'm trying to turn my [Music] this thing off this i didn't know i brought it out here all right i think i killed it i'd like to kill them all you love the lord this morning let's stand this morning and turn in our bibles to the gospel of saint john and i'd like to speak this morning if i had a title i'm not good at titles but i think i would probably like to refer to it possibly as the the present tense resurrection the present tense resurrection and this morning i'll try to hurry it it's a it's a little bit of a lengthy lesson but it sure is full of so much meat that i just trust it'll be a blessing so we know this is the story the story in the 11th chapter is the story of of the death of lazarus and how that that they sent a word and it's a beautiful scripture reading um so um we could pick it up here [Music] uh here maybe at the 20th verse and it said then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went to meet him but mary still in but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hath been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever you will ask of the father he will give thee and jesus said to her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus now that's her doctrine okay now jesus is going to correct her doctrine i hope that this morning this opens up to us i know i'm not capable of opening it up to you but i just hope the holy spirit does and you'd go back home and read over these scriptures and the sermon this morning jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us without this heavenly father we ask me to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning now as we go into the word of god i'd like to say this this morning to start we know the word of god is a great storehouse that and we realized that in our day there was a promise that god would fulfill the scriptures of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 john 14 and other scriptures pertaining to our day and so we understand when the messenger came that he was a lot of the time on this earth to deliver his message and in that message was everything that we needed but i'd like to present it to you this way about the storehouse because i the lord put this on my heart to share with you and i think it helps increase our understanding of where that we are we have not missed anything we're talking oh i got her i gotta say before i get going i'm sorry i want to congratulate our brother and sister on their 25th uh wedding anniversary brother sister would you stand up so we can applaud you before we go forward amen amen so when you're born into this world as we just saw little alex here all the food that alex is ever going to eat is already in this world right it's it's all all here uh but yet he can't eat it you understand it's it's there in this earth and it's stored up it's stored up in the refrigerator it's stored up in the freezer it's stored up in the gardens it's stored up in the supermarket it's there all the food is there that he's ever going to eat but he's not able to eat it anyway because he has to grow into it you understand now he gets his food through his mother eating and then she produces food for him and it was the way he developed in the womb but everything's there but he can't eat it you can't take him to bob's right now and and and have a nice big uh steak because he hasn't grown into the maturity to eat it and to digest it so that's what this message did when it put it in in the in the storehouse he says so so you have to grow into it and it's the same with the message word of god it's all stored up but we have to grow into it before we can eat it so as we're going along we're not trying to go back to the things that brother branham said and figure it out we're not going backwards it's there because god always works from the standpoint of the spoken word the spoken word is the original seed so he spoke it and he spoke it and he spoke it and he spoke it but when we first came into this we were just birthed we were babies we couldn't eat these things even the scripture said that paul said i can't feed you strong meat because you're not mature enough even to discern between what's right and what's wrong but we've grown and you know so we're growing up so now there's going to be things in the message that are been stored up for us in there but that we've now had to grow into maturity that god can now take these things that are in there and and break them to us in the form of food and start feeding us and making us stronger so as we we talk about these things we're we're not even beginning to speak from the standpoint that we've missed anything you understand we're coming in to not new things but we're coming into new food for us it still comes from the source it still comes from the voice of god does nothing until he first reveals it to his servants the prophets but there's we just because we have it written in book form and we have it on tape form doesn't mean it's been fed to us just because it's in the freezer or in the refrigerator at brother neville's home doesn't mean that alex is eating it but it's there for him to eat when he comes to that place of maturity so i believe that this morning where we were many different places in the gospel and and the word of god has different effect on your body when you get older and you eat it doesn't make you go up it makes you go out but so if you understand that wherever you're at in your life or in your growth whether you're a babe in the lord whether you're you you've been serving the lord for a while whether you've been a long time in the word grew up in it it doesn't matter there's food for you in the season that you are in there's food for you to eat today right where you are and so you feed a meal out and it has different effect on different people depending on what that their need is and so as we break into this word and we begin to look at some of these things that our messenger spoke to us in this great sermon that we're we're looking at it is the rising of the sun there's food in there and and i believe that we could go through it from the front of the book to the back of the book and there would still be food left in there that we haven't even seen or tasted or even realized yet but as we mature into that place god will feed us so he doesn't have to speak a new word just like he didn't create new food whatever was on this earth that god placed here man has been eating that from the beginning of time and it's been feeding us when we were babies when we were young children when we were middle-aged children middle-aged adults old adults it's god's word and it's there for us this morning so at whatever place you are you can delve in to this beautiful gospel and so we just are going through this great message and so i just wanted to review just a few uh quick statements if i could we're going to play 14 minutes this morning so maybe i can break it up into four 20-minute parts i trust maybe the lord we can but so we we started out and we we realized in the uh in the uh 111th paragraph the prophet of god makes this statement he says and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and and so uh when when we we realize that that it's not that we've missed anything it's not that we're trying to go backwards to be something because he has already placed it as something that's going to come the bride has got to come forth the bride has got to come forth so we understand that the placing of his ministry the ministry of the son of man which is none other than god himself coming and taking a redeemed vessel and veiling himself in that vessel so that he himself was present tense with us some people couldn't see past the veil they couldn't see past the veil of jesus oh isn't this joseph's son no it wasn't joseph's son it took a revelation to see who that he was but it it in our generation we understand that there was a promise that the lord jesus christ would return to the gentiles and do the same works the same signs the same wonders through the gentiles that he did to the jews because if god ever does one thing one way he's always got to continue to do it that way so we we began to see is he beginning to explain he said something had to come to maturity and he used the type in the old testament of when the wheat came to maturity that the high priest would take that wheat now we have a high priest don't we we have a high priest after the order of what melchizedek amen and what did that order do that order could speak something into existence it could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart it could do all manner of wonders because it was god veiled in a vessel now it was god veiled in a redeemed vessel showing that god didn't finish his work i know this is hard for some people to take but he didn't finish all his work when he was here in the beginning but he finishes it up at the end time and so we we see that one came through the ministry of the son of man one had come to maturity and that was presented over the people and waved over the people as a sign that the rest of the crop would come to maturity so in our generation the ministry of malachi 4 5 the ministry of revelations 10 7 the the ministry of luke 17 30 god veiled in a man who was fulfilling the prophetic prophecy of malachi 4 5 the prophetic prophecy that there would be a seventh church age messenger the prophetic prophecy that god himself would stand present in our midst hid behind a human veil that was fulfilled and placed before it only for those that were going to be called to maturity and so we read this thing he said it can he said now the bride's got to come forth and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and any others has spoken of the bride it can only manifest so the bride can only manifest what was spoken of her to manifest so everything he said of the bride that's the only thing she can manifest the works that i do shall she do also she shall go into all the world she shall do this speaking that's what he's doing he's speaking of his wife the church the church is his wife not denominational churches not blasphemous names not satan's church which is so close it would deceive the very elected possible but he's talking about that she can only manifest what was spoken ever so when god sent a prophet he didn't speak of the church world he spoke of the elect lady the bride of christ because that was part of the elijah ministry the alex the eliezer type in the scriptures that he come to present a bride without spot or wrinkle so she's got to come forth we're just reviewing here and he goes on and he he talks about this and he says and so we're we're building this up because now he's talking about this bride what he's doing is he's speaking this bride into existence by his work she's here but she doesn't know it she's living but she's dead while she yet lives so something has got to quicken her or bring her to life when something's dead and it's brought to life what do we call that we're going somewhere that'll make us shout right here buddy all right so he so he said now the only time he says until the church becomes both this paragraph 113 until the church becomes both the dynamics and the mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did so in other words do you understand what he's saying here he says the dynamics and the mechanics have to come together in order for her to do the things that he did well that was spoken of her the works that i do shall you do also so she can only manifest what was spoken of her you understand that so if he never spoke that of us what happens if the word spoke he said the pr the the minister shall be dressed in long robes and have a pointed hat and carry a staff and he shall stamp everybody on the head with 666. that's what we'd be doing but that isn't what he spoke what he's focused she'll be like me as i am so shall she be that's what he spoke of her why is he doing that because he's if this type is like in esther you can have all of my kingdom to the half oh what a beautiful beautiful type of the scriptures all these scriptures all these men that lived this were living for this day when this flesh and this church and him would become one the invisible union of the heavenly bride the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom coming into a beautiful union so he said he said i'll give he said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his my mechanics that the world will not be able to stand it and i'll raise him up again in the last day that's the easter message the eastern message is the dynamics and the mechanics so we just talked about it in our preview that we've got the mechanics down we got the church orders we got the deacons sitting here we got the ministry in place we got everybody waiting our our sisters aren't putting on weiner tight dresses you know brother graham spoke about that dresses that are so tight they wrap you up like a look like a hot dog you know we don't have big high heeled shoes on you you know i'm i'm called a god to preach the gospel if i don't i'll be men at the judgment seat and i got enough to be judged for i don't want to be guilty of not telling you the truth besides a real child of god loves correction i mean it does it good but we've got that down you know we're not doing those things we're not cutting our hair we've got the mechanics as i like how brother orlando says it you know we've done the man part now god's got to do the god part so we talked about how we got everything in order we got all our doctrine in order we got all our teaching in order and for we've been polishing it up and make sure it's good in the hubcaps but brother ben says what good does it do you if you have all the mechanics together and it's even filled with gasoline but there's got to come a spark to ignite the gasoline i like the way brother randy shared it with me brother randy murray shared it with me he said brother david it's like a pinata i thought what he says yeah it's like a pinata and you just stuff it full of candy and and the the candy being the word like he said you fill the tank full of gasoline he says you just stuff it full of word and you stuff it for the word he says but something's got to come and hit the pinata and break it open that the candy can come out so we got the mechanics and i'm saying this because we haven't missed anything so we've got to have something that comes and smacks it breaks it open and let's this gasoline this word in us be sparked to life that it moves us to do the works that we've been for ordained to do and walk in so it's not something that goes backwards and so we we understand that he says and then he goes to say this in 116. it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come and when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline so let me put this in scriptural words if i could in other words that the dynamics are there and that spark comes he says that that fire that spark comes to connect with the promises that have been given her to make them come to life okay now we haven't missed that we're on the edge of it right now he says when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with the octane the promises of word in the gasoline the octane is the promises that are in the word the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection now we're gonna he's gonna go on this more that's the real power of god's mechanics with the dynamics it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gasoline that fires it's the spark that fires the gasoline now i say that because we've always been expecting the word that's what we say right the word says this the word says that the word says this the word said that but we've been expecting the word but the word doesn't the the word doesn't fire you put it in your tank but now it takes something from above not within it takes something that god has to send at his time in his season in his place and make the octane the power the promises in that word come come to pass so we think just because i've got the word the word is going to do it no the word won't do it on itself the scripture says i came not to you in word only but in power and demonstration of the spirit so listen the 17th verse and then we'll go to our tape you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word now listen to this it's the father living that's what he said to philip have i been with you so long can you know not who i am he who hath seen me have seen the father it was the father living and what did he say i don't do these works it's not i that does the works it's the father that's in me that does the work so he was testifying to the spark or the dynamic power of god that moved on him and made him fulfill what was spoken of him hallelujah so it was the father his life that gave jesus his life and made him what he is if god ever does something one way he'll do it the same so now our messenger is telling us that the very spark that sparked jesus is the same spark that's going to spark us now and we went over this we're not talking about the restoration of pentecost this is beyond pentecost this is beyond the rain falling on the just and the unjust many people out there have pentecostal blessings the prophet of god said i was in that tent meeting a man spoke in tongues and he was doing all kinds of stuff another man was real genuine he interpreted he said i didn't know how it could be and the lord revealed to him that the rain falls on the just and unjust sinners can have faith in a promise of god and it'll come to pass in their life we are not worried about temporary signs and wonders we are worried about fulfilling our eternal purpose in the lord jesus christ that's what our hearts desire is that eternally we will be what the word said we will be and so he said you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the father living the father sent me so i send you okay as the father sent me so i send you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god so what is jesus testifying to he's testifying that there is a dynamic spark that fired him and so if the dynamic spark of god fired him he's saying the same dynamic spark that fired jesus is going to fire the bride because what was ever spoke of the groom was also spoken of the pride because these two are one and they're part of one another so i'm sitting here waiting for what i'm waiting for the promise that something's going to come and bring the word that is in me and make it the father living so we're not in condemnation here we're not saying oh if you don't have these signs and you don't have these things and you're not doing this you're not saved you don't have the holy ghost no we're realizing father i've come to the hour of the promise i've polished my car i filled it full of gas i'm sitting in the driver's seat not my will but thy will be done father i've i've prayed i've passed i've i've sought your face lord i wanted you to move in my life i want to see these signs and wonders father i can't produce them i'm a sheep i don't produce wool i bear wall father give me that spark i can do nothing without you i am not here to glorify myself i am here to glorify you lord i'm promised in your word by the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 that there is a spark that's going to come and make these promises of the word live in me i know it's there because i've watched it waved over me now we always say oh we can't do that we can't be brother branham we will never do that brother of them didn't even say for us to be him he said as he is so are we because the spirit of god the holy spirit doesn't come to speak of himself but it comes to bring us in remembrance of everything that was spoken of us you're a part of him right all right so that's that's where we've come to to this place he says he said i'll send you in the same mechanics and it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place and then there's some beautiful things that we'll go over here so let's just stop right here and we're going to listen from paragraph 118 to a paragraph 1 of 50 through 156 it's 14 minutes this next 14 minutes may i say this way brother branham says says it this way now this is deep now and be sure to catch this good that's what he's going to describe about these next 14 minutes so lord bless you this morning so what you're looking for this morning is we're looking for the revelation that's going to bring us to the place that we realize that we are the recipients of the spark because if your heart condemns you it's hard to go forward but if your heart condemns you not then ask whatever you will and the father will give it to you and when you can see it's your birthright then it becomes wonderful so if the brothers would just play that if you have i guess your devices your phones your books i hope you're joining me in this study and you're delving into this word with me and you're preparing to come to service because you'll only get out of it what you put into it and and uh but but i i this is just a blessing so i hope that we you we can listen to it for a few minutes it's 14 minutes and then we'll maybe spend 20 minutes going through it or 30 and have it bless you so god bless you this morning as we listen to our messenger what i believe is the voice of god to us in this day and i believe the holy spirit today has placed it in his will that we would go to the storehouse that he could feed us this meal because we've matured enough to be able to eat this this morning god bless you paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you go it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life i remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice the same spirit now romans 8 1 now let's just read that again in romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm sorry and romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's a sketch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt in you oh there you are if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bride grew he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit forming in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he made eid from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word or adam was the spoken word you see he took from him and then taken the he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eaves who are still part of adam's fence is adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamics that quickened the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones then how is this mortal fresh go become his flesh we'll get to it how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh my the predestinated ones of course like the seed laid up on the earth the one that has life and many of them are dead they were just rotten seeds the waters and things burned them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god knowed it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own how this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the sun was set across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to light it was not to bring all the dirt to the knife but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the line not all men will receive christ oh no but those which god foreordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's when it comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun's so hot that rock said there's no sun so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and to begin to spring forth the line it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the earth but to quicken the life of the seed now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't set why won't all the people receive it it wasn't said to him god told me i don't believe i don't care what you said you could raise up the dead or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe that this turn on you're unbelievers it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't even sent to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them that perish is foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed is life my crude little story about the farmer putting the egg uh the eagle egg under the heat see that little eagle was absolutely he was a he was odd looking little creature when this uh farmer had did that thing that he did to put this uh eagle egg under this old hand and she hatched out a funny looking chicken it was a odd little thought he didn't look like him his feathers wasn't like the rest of him and he just he was an odd little guy and uh all rested chickens recognized him in odd fella and the hen went around he didn't even like the dice she was feeding me he just didn't like that scratching in the barnyard he didn't have nothing to do with that so he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there any thing and he never tasted anything that he just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it see because he wasn't a chicken too and uh the hen would cluck and you know there's a miracle just bad there is no such a thing join the church it just didn't hit right with the little guy so he fought around the hand until one day his mammy the old eagle old laid so many eggs and there was one missing she knew that that eagle was somewhere so she starts out on the hunt for him and she's circled over the mountain tops and down in the valleys over everywhere where he might of be by this time it's time for him to be born the time can me hatched out so maybe a crow come in and picked up my egg maybe a vulture i don't know if something picked up my egg but i know that egg is in my mind i got a son somewhere i got the honey oh god he's that great eagle and his thoughts he wanted to have a church in order to have a people no matter what cuddled him no matter what he's hatched out under he's hunting he's hunting for his own and one day the story goes this old eagle flew over the barnyard just looking everywhere and she found him oh for that resurrection to recognize that he really wasn't chicken natural he was an eagle and he's always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard a scream and said look up this way and he looked above him and there was a creature with 14 feet wings powerful in all the chickens he was in a barnyard and claimed him to be her son that mama how can it get to you they just jump start flopping or you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated poor dane church you know he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over that wave she he's the same yesterday forever not some mythical story but a reality that reflected that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a phd not a llg not a good neighbor but a son of god molded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you hunch for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to a eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word amen the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to obedience to the word of god quickly what do you want to know how i could get there with her he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't get no higher to jump he's a chicken see but this eagle said that's my soul well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are your eagles just start spreading the wholes get a little exercise start moving up the word to the word the works that i do shall you also he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he also because i live he lived though so in the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you he quickens your mortal body see what does it do now listen to what you know that this easter i want to mean more to you than any easter egg i want you to see we know what it's done for him but i want you to see it's not well it has done the same for you amen what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything a bunch of cigarettes and you women who once had short hair and painted and carried on wore shorts and things like that oh it wants something to scream and you look down here and it was the word hey it quickened your you said no more sharks no more liquor for me no more no more stealing no more see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjections of love christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's hard for women to wear uh flashes and the words that don't see it you do that you're drawn to it see it's you that it becomes you become part of the word it brought your body not well you say well let me tell you something my pastor what your pastor said what the word says if you want to be a chicken go on with them but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the eagles he's the peter of the hymns see not of the eagles the eagle eats on eagles from the thing they queen of the bible said it's wrong to do that demand and so forth and what all you do it's wrong to say days and miracles just pass this bible said he's the same yesterday forever let's say that's mental telepathy there's some kind of mind reading this discernment all these divisions and things is nonsense see they are chickens that's right they don't know what eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're eager to begin with why you are that seed that the resurrection of the s o n has gone in the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are a eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it ha it's the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now how we pleasure these flesh and is born because quickly while we're yet mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickens that body what's quick it brings the life the spirit that wants like to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quickened well the things die and you're resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics there's your resurrection there's the church in the resurrection with you these bodies right now are quickened okay you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word see the dynamic if it comes upon water in the splutter some miracles we'll just stop right there for a second let's just jump back and just take a moment to run this down to us [Music] as we just look at this how beautiful it is here has we read it and so we we want to do what we can to let this uh sink in real deep i got to get my pages in order here if you just give me a second 20 said all right and then i think we started on the paragraph um 118 is that correct okay it's here somewhere alrighty all right so let's just let's just let's don't let's just let this skip by us here this morning okay because he's he's saying something here to us and if i could say it this way that that god hides it from the wise and prudent so somebody can be listening to this and they hear the story of the eagle and they already kind of heard the story of the eagle and he makes statements in here but you understand since god always hides everything in simplicity he always kind of wraps statements mixed in with things and that's what he said he says when he writes a love letter to his bride he makes statements in there that other people would miss he said oh i really miss you well she knows what that means or you know i think about a certain thing she knows what it means because it's it's written to her in in such a a beautiful way here so now he's he's talking about the the church and we read this in the 16 he said if he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection so now let's go back over to what he said if we could turn uh if we could turn as he's he's talking down here in 18 about about romans chapter 1 he said if the spirit that was in the bridegroom dwells in the bride all right so that's what what our our point is in 20 says god made the first bridegroom he made the bridegroom first he was both man and woman in spirit formed in the dust of the earth to make him material and notice when he made eve from adam he took not another part of clay he took the same piece of clay the same word from adam was a spoken word see he took from him and then taken the masculine and feminine spirit he took the feminine spirit away from adam and placed in eve so it's still part of adam's spirit it's adam's flesh so eve was adam's flesh right so he took the spirit of adam and that's what made eve it took it so we have to be what flesh of his flesh bone of his bone so he goes down here he's talking about this he says then it was adam's spirit the dynamic that quickened the mechanics of his body eve was his body so adam's spirit was the dynamics of eve that brought eve's body to life now why is that now listen what he's saying don't miss this because here's the question that he poses to us and if you just walk through this real quick looking for the next line you walk right over what he said now listen look at what he asked us here he said so adam's spirit is the dynamics or the life of eve that's what quickened the flesh well you're in flesh right so watch what he says here so the bride must be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone now here's the question then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh how many heard that when i heard that i thought i'd stop me in my tracks because what what is what is that satan's got me doing he's always got me looking down got me thinking i'm a chicken always looking at the bugs in my life always trying to eat the bugs out of my life the little problems in my life the little things in my life you know what i mean i can't rise any higher but he's actually telling us here he's actually preaching to us about a present tense resurrection about our bodies not another body not a body we keep looking for some other day but the question is how is our body how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh we'll get to in a minute how is it done what is this great transformation so he sets that right in there and it's it's it's it's absolutely the very question that's on all of our hearts and minds how is this thing that i look in the mirror that's got so many problems and everything how is it going to become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone how is it done how's it going to happen now he's telling us he's saying if the same spirit that dwells in jesus dwells in you now don't miss it because if not you start running around looking for that spirit somewhere oh i need the baptism the holy spirit i need more pouring out of god i'm going to run down to the altar again and cry through and i'm going to run up and shout and i'm going to carry it on and we try to produce it but he's going to produce it you can do nothing without me all the father hath given will come and he said now he said oh my 24 oh my the predestinated one of course like the seed laying upon the earth so he's now he's going to tell you how is this done how is it going to happen how is your flesh going to become his flesh how is this done what is the transformation he preached the whole message god's power to transform god's ability to take what's in the seed and bring it to life and so he he moves on here he says many of them were dead they just rotten the water and things burn it up but now there was a seed lying there ready for life and god knew it was lying there now the predestinated ones are the first ones quickened by the holy s by the holy spirit for the spirit comes to claim its own now this goes deep be sure to catch it good so we don't want you to miss this if that's what i'm saying so we haven't missed it it's something that is fixing to happen okay if if you can believe it and look to this promise and claim this promise because remember evidence is possession if you have the evidence of something you're possessing that evidence and faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen so how do you receive evidence you receive evidence by revelation so god always works by faith so when it's revealed to you it now becomes evidence or possession so he says how's it going to do he says now the sun is sent across the earth so who who will volunteer to be a rock you you're a rock you you're dirt and philip you can be no amit phillip he's a soldier so he is a rock so you come here philip rock come here brother dirt and then we have rather clever now i i i i told you remember a while back how the lord told me to go to certain barber and i i just was led and i so i go to the barber shop i tell the lady about the message of the hour and she said there's just a young man right in here that gave me a book so i was back the other day and he said i said who's this uh you know i started talking about the word of god she said oh that young man was there from your church and i said oh i said what was his name his name's brother trevor and i said brother clever so i got the picture so we ended up testifying to the same barber did you know that was you i just figured you hadn't been listening i told the whole story and you didn't catch it all right so you understand the dirt right adam was taken out of eve so we're that same part of dirt so brother rem said the sun comes across now it comes on the rock and all the rock feels is oh it's hot okay no that's not the way phil feels but he's he's a rock so we're using him as a rock that's all the sun falls on him right now this brother he's just here he's just regular dirt now our brother's not dirt so don't go out of here saying burma is that very dark no he's just standing here for your behalf the sun's shining on him okay but now here's the same dirt it's the same dirt the only difference is is this there's a seed in here now listen to what he said when the sun shines on this seed not only does it bring the seed to life but it quickens the dirt that's housing the seed so the dirt that's housing the seed is this mortal body now this mark he can't manifest that seed unless it's manifested through the dirt so he's got to take this dirt this mortal body this dirt and quicken it also so it doesn't just quicken the seed it quickens the dirt around the seed you thank you dirt rocks now do you understand what he's saying here he's saying this sun's coming up but this is real deep i hope you catch it so the minute you believe that you've got a seed in you the word of god said if that seeds in you it'll quicken your mortal body also so what's it going to do it's going to bring this mortal body into subjection to the word is that right what was jesus mortal body subject to he was a sinner he wasn't a sinner but he was shaped in sin right we we were shaped in sin it came into the world speaking lies but yet he came in the form of sin so how are we going to get to have a body like in his body we're going to have a body liken to his body because he's going to bring to life this dirt also amen oh i hope you get it because the flesh warts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and we find these things are contrary one to the other but now we also understand that he has a dynamic a power a spark something that he sends that you can't do but he could do for you and give you the quickening power to bring this flesh under subjection hallelujah that's what i want let's just read it he now the sun goes across paragraph 26 goes across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life not to bring all dirt to life but to bring that part of dirt which is enclosed around the life what is the part of dirt that's enclosed around your life your mortal body this body not some other body not something down the road not some other day that's where the accuser sits right now he points to your flesh but we don't look at the flesh we look at the what the promise you don't look at the symptoms you look at the promise that the eagle doesn't look at the chickens maybe you've never flown there before maybe you haven't realized ever before that this mortal body can actually come under subjection to the word of god but that's why he's hunted you that's why he stored up this food that's why he's brought it to this hour that you can realize wait finally i've got a revelation and a promise of the word that i can bring this flesh and this flesh will be brought how has he done it the father sparked him and pushed him into it realized his position all of a sudden come on fire oh i hope you can grab hold of it because if not you'll let your very self defeat you when he promised he wouldn't lose you nor forsake you but he be with you even in you till the end he says upon now not all men will receive christ but those which are foreign to life is housed around some of the of the earth that's the one he comes to quicken they're the ones now let's go to 28 just let's follow this real quick for a second now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh the old sun is so hot the rock says oh the sun is hot but the little seed that's what i'm looking for and begin to spring forth to life it quickens that part of dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not the quickened the dirt but the but to quicken the life of the seed so he can't he he's telling us here he's not just going to quicken the like life of the seed and let you struggle with the hope that someday you'll be free from this flesh you'll never have rest but he said come unto me oh you get a heavy burden and i'll give you the rest you understand what i'm saying we understand what he's saying this morning he's actually telling you i have got a power i have got a spark that not only can bring your seed to life not only can reveal to who you are but it can actually take this mortal flesh body and quicken it to full obedience to the word how many wants that i want that am i going to condemn myself because where i'm at right now isn't there or am i going to by faith and what is faith faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen so the word of god tells me that there's a quickening power that's going to fall upon the seed that's in me and it's also going to quicken the dirt around that seed i am the resurrection in the life he that believeth on me shall never die so then then we we see that and he says he says mostly people won't receive it it wasn't sent for them and then he says let's go to my little story about the eagle right the eagle's in the barnyard it doesn't even know it's an eagle he was always taught to look down looking at the bugs or something in the barnyard we're always talk to look at the flesh look at all the faults in our flesh look at all this oh i've got to overcome this i've got to overcome this i can't jump up higher i can't move out with god i got to keep looking at this i got to keep doing this and we've been taught to look down oh this morning by the revelation of god's word if we can look up and say satan i have a promise in god's word that this body right here not by me doing it not by fasting my problem away not by creating a strong mental faith but by an outside source lord i know i've got the holy spirit but i still struggle and now he's telling you but wait a minute there's an outside spark there's a quickening power when that same spirit that brought him under subjection comes on you it will also bring you under subjection now you don't produce that oh i hope you can grab it i hope you can understand your sins hasn't stopped him unbelief don't stop god he knew you were there he's going to hunt you he's going to come to your barnyard he's going to reveal you to an eagle he's going to show you how to flop those wings and he's going to take this body that might be acting like a chicken and turn it into a eagle because it's eagle to eagle right he says he says and he comes down here in the 41st thirst eagle to eagle the word before the foundation the word to word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour it's the word that's written for the hour you're the word that was written to the hour you sit here with all this trouble you have in your flesh and everything but that don't matter to god because you were written for this hour he chose you to be here he chose selected you he called you from all parts of the world all denominations all lives all matters of barnyards and everything from all the different countries that are representing you you are the word that was written for this hour wait a minute lord let me don't look in the mirror that's not where your evidence lies don't look at your past that's not where the evidence lies don't look at the bugs in your life that's not where the evidence lies where does the evidence lie it lies in the spoken word that was spoken to you through the mouth of malachi 4 5. that's where the evidence of the church lies and that's how the church now if she has that spoken evidence then that becomes her possession and she can look right in the face of her flesh she can look at the mirror and say david mcgarry you wretch this body is going to be quickened by the spark that god promised for this age oh and you look at all the darkness on it and you say how could it be how can anything be because he said so let's just read down he says written out you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to the obedience to the word of god this spirit his spirit the same spirit where did we ever get the idea that we were going to produce this spirit within ourselves you can do nothing without me where did we always get the idea that if we believed what we believed that we automatically should have this spirit because we've been taught to look down we've been taught to look at our flesh and judge our spirit by the flesh and every time you judge your spirit by your flesh you condemn yourself but if you would judge yourself by what god spoke of you then you could claim the possession of the perfection of my flesh and my flesh being brought into full subjection to the word of god remember not some future body what did we say the other day breakfast everything's a paradox we're trapped in it it's a setup he's not going to lose one if he said this body would be quickened and brought into subjection this body will be quickened and brought in subjection that's thus saith the lord because a prophet only speaks thus saith of the lord and a way of a true prophet is only to speak what god reveals to him now let's just go here to 48. now watch this this is deep get this real good what does it do what does this eagle screaming over the barnyard and bringing this eagle that's in the barnyard what does it do when when it goes over it when it's waved over it what does it do that's what he says what does it do listen now now listen is it up there paragraph 148. want you to make the visual connect you know i don't want you to think oh brother mcgeary's just putting this together no we're reading it write down the way he brought it to us it's just that he says it in such a way that people can sit there and it just huge but that's why he said if you don't see jesus christ in every word go back and read it again and this is what he said he said i'll put this here and i'll hit all the high points he said you ministers go back and go back through it and take the time so listen what does it do now listen so that you'll know and this easter i want it to mean more to you than any easter ever did see i want you to see it we know what it done for him but i want you to see it not will it has done the same for you see what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life praise god praise god what a promise you say brother mcgary you need to run back for it no i don't need to run back i never missed it i couldn't even eat this food i hadn't matured enough to come to the place that i could say god keeps his word my unbelief is not going to stop him from keeping his word if he started a perfect work in me he will perform it till the end and part of the end of the performance of god is that this mortal body this one i'm living in now will be quickened to life i don't care what the old devil says he can stick his pitchfork in me all he wants he is not going to stop god from doing this and bringing it to pass it'll fix your marriage it'll fix your fears it'll fix your doubts it'll fix your physical your financial will fix everything you may not make another dollar but you'll be happy with the dollar you got that's right i mean why how long are we going to condemn ourselves for being in the barnyard flop now listen we're closing up i hope you're not tired like i said we'll arrange to shorten things up if we can brings it to life he says now you who are once walked along with great big cigars and he explains everything we were and all the liquor and everything we had the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth he wants you to totally understand that it's actually the dust because when the seed got quickened how many knows the seeds got quicker than you sure you know it because you believed the message that was part one part two is now that power that's in that seed is now going to also transform this flesh i'm looking forward to that the spirit raised him from the dead dwelt in you it will bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subject to what christ who is christ the word not theology but the word then you say that the these things oh i think it's all right and he talks about people who just deny the word he says but he says the words he had quickened you you are drawn to it it it's you then see it's you then so look at you you are your body you are your spirit you are your mind i think it's all he says it's you then it quickens you that you are drawn to it so you just look at this what god's doing to us if you just take this every time i get a message right i read it and i say oh i'm short right i want more of god so i get drawn up higher and i get drawn up higher well well here's the finish line just just picture right right here that this is the finish line this is the line we're trying to get across and we're over here and we're praying and reading and we read something and all of a sudden something clicks us and we say oh i gotta rise up higher so we get up and we go a little higher we feel good for a while then something else comes along and it moves us so we go oh i feel drawn a little higher i feel drawn a little higher i keep pulling up i get more mature he starts feeding me more it makes me want to grow more all the time without even realizing it i'm moving towards the finish line i'm being raptured without even realizing it and he talks about his pastor now listen what he says here he says oh because in the the 100 verse 153 peop they say the days of miracles last that's only telepathy some kind of mind reading discernment all these visions and things that's nonsense see they are chickens they don't know what eagle food is what we're talking about this morning's eagle food it's only for the bodies that were created the dirt around the seed that was created to be quickened can you believe jack's in your body all that it is though i might look at you and you got rad ears and rat tails i don't care what i see he knows he's going to take that body and he's going to quicken it he's going to take that dirt and he's going to bring that dirt subject to the word please this morning get rid of the condemnation he knows what he's going to quicken he knows what dirt he's going to change you ever hear this saying they got dirt on you well you got dirt on you you got sinful flesh you got dirt you were born in sin shape the iniquity came in the world speaking lies he who say that he sinneth not is a liar sure you're dirt but what's he telling us in the storehouse was a promise of a spark that in its season when the church was mature enough to eat it he was going to bring that spark forth and start transforming those bodies and bringing them into perfect subjection to god's word hallelujah oh i'm looking forward to that every time i fall i can stand and say oh satan you did that who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect for the seed of god remains in me if the seed of god remains in me then i have thus saith the lord that he will quicken the dirt around that seed listen present tense resurrection but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with why you are the seed that resurrection of the s-o-n has dawned right so when you hear the voice and you hear the message that means the resurrection is in its what dawn now you're growing into it we're closing up now and the wave sheaths upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle the resurrection of the sun has dawned there's a sheaf off waved over the earth to make you recognize that what you're not a chicken you're not as just a sinner you're the sons and daughters of god whose names are written on the lamb's book of life it brings you to the realization of that and then when that comes to the realization look as we go down here now he says that's the dawn so that's the first step now if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamics of the word dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body now how we flesh now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly well we were yet mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickened that body what's quicken brings it to life the spirit that once used to like drink and run around commit adultery all the things is quickened why the thing died you are resurrected it quickens your mortal body i'm resurrected i mean there's a present day resurrection you come out of everything that's death let's just finish up now with paragraph 156 therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you were apart of the mechanics oh there is your resurrection what are you looking for why are you all looking for a resurrection someplace else if this body is quickened and it's brought to life he that liveth shall never see death amen speaking of the past church he says those that are dead they shall they shall have life and you should not taste death if this earthly body be what dissolve i have one waiting for me i'm quickened this body is quickened it's changed in the twinkling of an eye you say what's the resurrection the resurrection is when he sends that life he sends that spark you can't bring it you can't bring yourself into subjection you can't set new rules you can have a new form of life it's absolutely a promise to you because you've recognized you're an eagle that eagle was in the barnyard full of bugs full of dirt never flown in its life but once that sheep offering came and revealed it was an eagle it was now promised that that chicken body mentality he was living in would now be transformed and his body would actually take on the spirit of an eagle he was resurrected out of the barnyard and that's what that's what he he said uh uh about that eagle he said what a resurrection it was he says there's your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quickened see you've heard you believed it changed you from denomination to the word now you may not have been in the nomination church domination but we were always in some form of denomination denomination is man's rule over your flesh i hope you understand it we're in a present tense resurrection the church has matured to the place if you can be hungry that god has come to the place that that spark is ready to touch the gasoline the word that's in us do you anticipate it do you believe it's for you do you believe it's possible don't let the battle that's in your mind what did god give you to defeat your mind he gave you his promised word heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away if i said that i will quicken your body and this is the lord speaking and i said that i would transform your body into it becoming perfectly subjected to the word you cannot take the failures of your flesh and make the word of god of none effect his word will prevail no matter how upset you might feel so thank you for enduring so long this morning lord richly bless you but i hope you understand you are in a resurrection you are right here now to the place that god can feed you the spark of revelation that's going to allow you to bring your flesh into total subjection of the word even so come quickly lord jesus there's your resurrection there's the church in the resurrection
