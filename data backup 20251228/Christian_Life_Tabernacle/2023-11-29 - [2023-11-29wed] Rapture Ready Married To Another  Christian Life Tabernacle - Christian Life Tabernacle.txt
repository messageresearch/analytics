life is not in your hands but your life is in his hands why don't we just go to that one who holds it all in his hands Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we can approach you not as a God that's a far off worshiping from afar Lord but that you're present here amongst us living in your bride the same yesterday today and forever Lord we don't have to wonder we don't have to speculate but Lord you are Vindicated amongst your bride here in the end time knowing that soon and very soon is the translation of these bodies Lord we're excited we're in great expectation we're rejoicing in the message of the hour and what we have heard and we want to share it we want to live it we want to believe it we want to just go out and be a light in a Dying World seeking and saving the Lost Lord performing the signs and wonders that you would have us to do according to thy will Lord we know that these are moments that you provide for your bride to just shut away from the things of the world to come into your presence Lord to bring our licks of fire together here where the pillar of fire is amongst us Lord that we could just Worship You Lord not just in spirit but in spirit and in truth Lord and now we look to you in this portion of the service that you would come Lord and now that you would pick up your word Lord and you would break it to each individual that they could receive what they have need of Lord the spiritual food that you have provided in the season that we are now living we love you Lord we surrender ourselves to you we do commit the needs that have been mentioned into the thy hands and we know Lord that by the preaching of the Gospel there can be those that are born again filled with the Holy Ghost the deaf ears can be open the blind eyes can be open the infirmities of the flesh can be chased away never to return again so here we are Lord in the seat where all things are possible we surrender ourselves to you that you could have your perfect will and way in this service we love you we commit the people to you now in your most precious name the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen praise the Lord if you have your bibles if you could turn to Matthew uh 25 man it's certainly good to be in Fellowship uh we just bring greetings from Brother Ray Erikson and the Believers there in blon Ohio and now brother Wayne Lawson has uh become the pastor there and so they send their greetings to you and it's just good to have friends and family and brothers and sisters um of precious like faith and just remember us as we'll be leaving this weekend also to be in fellowship with uh brother uh Craig Boer um just reading in our Bibles in Matthew uh chapter 25 I want to read verse 1 through 7 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at the midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps I want you to notice all 10 of them Rose and trimmed their lamps but one was trimmed ring their lamps for nothing they didn't even have any oil but they were all going through the motions they were all going to church they were all screaming and shouting and rejoicing but one of them had oil now we're not talking about just oil on the flesh but somebody had the indwelling of the spirit they had something to take them and pack them into the presence of their bridegroom amen my we just are excited to be here and be able to minister for a little bit if you also turn in your Bibles to uh Romans chap chapter 7 we're going to be pulling our inspiration from invisible Union and um this this message would really just uh something on my heart maybe I'll just tell you now I want to speak to you a little bit uh on the thought Rapture Ready Rapture Ready and now my subject would be married to another married to another in Romans 7 uh it would read like this if you're there it would read know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law so he's not speaking to people who are ignorant and haven't uh heard what the the the prophets of old or Moses law have been taught but it says how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so we Paul is laying on this principle there's only one way to be loosed from the law that is that husband is dead so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she is called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from the law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man so you're going to notice uh Paul is going to say married to another notice this phrase I believe three or four times he says though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become Deb to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another now who who are we being married to who are we being married to even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God so if we are being married to another and we being being married to Christ the word then we are bringing forth fruit unto God Amen you may have your seats as you turn in your Bibles to Revelations 19 the prophet of God would say in invisible Unity he'd say to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ so to be to be in the bride so we're just going to take some time by the grace of God and just labor maybe to to lay a foundation of how we are being prepared and how we are being ready to be in this Rapture as you tur in your Bibles just looking into Revelations chapter 19 and verse 7 we we're going to have uh maybe a lot of material to move through we tried to to prep uh the brothers in the back to maybe have scriptures and quotes available so we can maybe uh try not to move too quickly but quickly enough to try to cover some ground certainly won't be able to catch it all but uh the portion that God would have for you we pray that you would receive it it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready let us be glad well we can just close up our Bibles just close them up I like brother Billy said one time we were fellowshipping and he said somebody has to you know brother brandham said we could go out and read our Bible and just and that's all we need for church somebody got to manifest that one of us might do it one day let us be glad and rejoice that's a good way to start service let us be glad and rejoice in this Thanksgiving season we got a lot to be thankful for let us be glad and rejoice well what are you happy about what are you rejoicing for why are you excited what be why because the marriage of the Lamb is at hand hallu and this marriage could only take place because the word has been restored Christ the word has been restored and is present amongst us that we can be married in an invisible Union to him I'll just read this portion out of um uh um invisible Union uh brother brandom at the very end of paragraph 379 says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the Rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse now I'm so glad he ain't talking about the bride but he's talking about the condition of the church he's talking about the condition of the world it's only going to get worse and now we're we're we're 60 years past the preaching of this message and we can say this day this scripture this prophecy is fulfilled we're entering into the Rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that say Amen it's got to get worse and it can't go like this see it's got to be something it's moving right now friend oh I'm so glad about it it's moving right now I want to ask you where is it moving is it is it moving somewhere off out there in the blue sky somewhere where is this Rapture moving where is this Rapture age moving where is the word of God that has been Vindicated in this age where is it moving I want to say it's moving right here amongst us it's moving in The Bride of Jesus Christ that is established itself here in Bedford Texas oh but we're not from a natural land we're from a Heavenly land and we're going back to the beginning where it all started to be with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ forever and forever it's moving right now friend the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus sayith the Lord oh I say rejoice be glad and rejoice pride of Jesus Christ for the marriage of the Lamb is at hand it's moving right now right amongst us we have moved into the rapture agej we got something to be thankful for we got something to Rejoice we got something to shout about we got something to be thankful for that God rich and mercy he called your name he didn't leave you out there in dark denominational sin of Lady oia wondering about wondering what is truth but he called your name he called you out of the dark traditions of denominations he called you out of sin he called you away from that first husband that you were married to by your first birth and all he set you free that you might be married to the Risen Christ who holds everything in his hands oh aren't you glad about it oh praise His wonderful name I just don't know how to Pace myself you forgive me uh we just want to read this out of the Rapture maybe if they can put that up for for us here the first thing that comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now it's lamp trimming time so so we're seeing we're pulling Matthew 25 right into here rise and trim your lamps what was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't have any oil in their lamp see but it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi 4 time it's Luke 17 it's all those prophecies that it can fit perfectly and set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right here so what is the prophet doing the proom the prophet is showing us our Promised Land he's showing us the hour that we're living in he's showing us our borders he's showing us what what our expectation is for the age that what can I expect what am I looking for look Joshua and Caleb uh they had evidence of a good land they knew where the land was they came back packing the fruits they came back saying look what the prophet said is true it's a good land it's over there let us go we're more than able to take it so now the prophet is coming he's telling the bride look it's a good land here's the evidence of it this is your borders this is your land this is your boundaries oh and I want to say to the bride There Is No Boundaries all things are possible to them that believe look we don't have to be bound down here by some man's theology or some man's idea that can tell you you can only go so high but this bride has broken out of the horse and buggy age we've broken out of the airplane age we've gone into the astronaut age why because there is an astronaut here Jesus Christ has risen amongst his bride that all things are possible to them that believe what is he doing the prophet is showing our expectation I want to say our expectation Rapture our expectation is the change of our bodies Our expectation is the promises that lay in the written word I say there a yay and amen to every promise it's laying right there if you can believe it oh you can have it what do you have need of tonight look we might not get another church service this might be a you might as well get all you came for don't wait for Sunday don't wait for tomorrow but Christ is resurrected amongst us he's right here right now he's amongst us what do you have need of we have an open book it's an open book test that's right we're not wondering what the answers are are we wondering are we ponding are we groping in darkness wondering where we're at where we're going this is an open book I love open book test well what was it you said back there brother Billy I I thought I'd preach on which one am I yeah I thought I'd preach on that a little bit he was looking at there we got these little fancy tablets now you can adjust your your your sound and everything like that they wanted to give me one I was like I wouldn't even know what to do with that I'd make a mess up things and I'd spend 30 minutes trying to figure out the tablet we wouldn't get nowhere but I guess on there you have a designation like this mik has a designation and so he's asking him which one am I what do you have to wonder which one are you tonight am I the eagle or am I the crow am I the sinner that that that's that's lost and undone am I just am I just a goat that's on the left hand I'm asking which one are you I tell you just as the prophet of God said that that Satan voted against you Jesus voted for you I ask you tonight why don't you go ahead and cast your vote tonight go ahead and cast you I'm For You Lord I am the bride I am Sanctified I am bone of your bone I am flesh oh I'm casting my vote to this message of the hour because I'm not gross groping in darkness it's an open book test oh Hallelujah so the prophet of God he's taken Malachi 45 Luke 1730 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Matthew 25 Zechariah 4:17 Isaiah 60 Joel 2:25 all these promises all these descriptions that the Saints for Ages were probing for prophets had spoken the word the Saints oh they were look up your Redemption draw they were looking for the hour that we are now living oh let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come I'm asking you where are you going to be married are you waiting for some ceremony in the sky I say Malachi 4:5 has come to perform the wedding ceremony if you can recognize his presence amen amongst us I wonder are we sufficiently impressed with the word amongst us oh my we got to be married to another we got a lot of baggage we got a lot of things of the world we got a lot of things on our mind Weighing on us but this message has come that you might be married to another oh without this message don't you understand you you couldn't even uh divorce that first nature right it took a kinsman redeemer to say She's Mine you can't have her it wasn't legal in the first place because I put the predestinated uh ring of predestination on her finger before I even formed the world Hallelujah let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come well maybe this might not be speaking to your heart but we'll move a little bit further let the great physician come and start to deal with your heart deal with your mind deal with the complexes and the hardships and the family issues and the thing that you're going to look all things are possible right now you don't got to wait for it tomorrow we got testimony amongst us of a husband that had been Wayward but God rich in Mercy answering prayers and seeking out that lost seed God the presence of God came into the room and said you're mine oh hallelujah it's going home time are you Rapture Ready are you Rapture Ready I ain't talking about just being ready I ain't talking about being Pentecostal ready I screamed I danced I shouted well what' you get about it I'm talking about being Rapture Ready I'm talking about being married to the king of King being married to the Lord Of Glory am oh praise His Wonderful Name the prophet of God would say in the voice of the sign he said that John the Baptist was a sign of Jesus coming he said it's a sign of preparation are you catching that now what is he saying he's saying that Elijah spirit it's a sign of his coming it's a sign of preparation that Elijah spirit Malachi 4:5 what is it doing it's preparing you it's showing you the things that have been fulfilled the things that are being fulfilled now things that are going to be it's it's it's a it's a voice of preparation and what was that voice of preparation John saying repent the Kingdom of Heaven is ahead look the voice is still the same it's a voice of preparation repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand you must be born again you got to be born again you you got to be married to another there there's an expectation or a preparation that Malachi 4:5 is giving unto the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not an expectation of another age see that's the problem where the church gets a lot of their Pro their problems from they start looking unto a glare of another age and then that becomes their expectation oh my I even think about looking about by my dad our pastor's testimony when he came in back in the 60s and and the 70s it might seem like there was a great move and and people were were coming out all over and I start to think my I wish I could live back there I feel like I feel like everybody's you know it's just swn over and you you're gleaning during this Harvest time you go out and you try to witness and and nobody hear it and all of a sudden I start looking back to the very beginning well it have been nice to live there and oh I back there in Joel 228 when it first broke out there back on 1906 on auu Street wouldn't that be wonderful to go back there and all of a sudden if you start to put your expect expectation on an age gone by you're going to go backwards instead of forward but I want to say our expectation has been set by Malachi 45 just like he said at the very beginning of invisible union he said I'm not looking for Revival in this generation he says I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in this generation now don't get that backwards the prophet of God was not doing away with Revival but what he was wanting you to do is say Look Away to Jesus your Revival isn't some church Revival your Revival isn't some Pentecostal meeting and outpouring of the spirit that falls on the just and the unjust but what he was telling you is your Revival is in the coming of the lord your Revival is in the seventh seal your Revival is in the third pole your Revival is in the opening of the word that Christ has come down there is your Revival oh let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has that is your Revival we got to be married to another it's a voice of preparation getting you ready Rapture Ready let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew 3 this is me going slow Matthew 3 would say like this forgive me interpreters let you catch your breath as I do mine for this is that which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah say in the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight so here's that voice of preparation what I'm preparing you now I'm coming and telling you repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the king is now coming we we got to make the valleys uh level and and the and the the the the mountains low we we got to we got to make straight the path of the Lord for the king is coming it was a voice of preparation it was a sign of his coming it was the introduction to his presence but we got to hear the voice you you got to get the preparation because what was John's commission it was to introduce the lamb right so you you wanted to hear the voice of of the messenger because his voice was preparing you and making you ready that he could introduce you to the word made flesh dwelling among you so it's important for us to receive the instruction it's important for us to be taught it's important us to realize that this voice of preparation by the spirit of Elijah is actually preparing you and making you ready that you can go into higher Heights and into deeper depths but if it becomes theology if if it becomes intellectualism then it's not taking you anywhere it's just filling your mind with rules and regulations and there's actually no growth you just become puffed up and I Know It All a and there's really no life and no fruit that's evident coming out for you but we want to be in a place where we have a revelation of really what the voice of preparation is doing and what it's supposed to be doing in our lives yeah I was thinking about this voice of preparation and and years ago uh one of my climbers I was teaching him how to climb and and and and now he's really uh train him because we we we were moving into another another realm of professionalism it wasn't good enough just to maybe just to be a good climber and and be better than maybe the landscapers and what but we we wanted to to build ourself and to the elite and to the best of the best and so I was I was I was talking to him I was like look I I got to start teaching teaching you the rigging equipment and the rigging gear and and I got you get get you wearing spikes and and and we got to use the right blade devices and rigging techniques and he said you know I don't need that I don't need that I'm born again I I don't need that you know I I've been in church all my life and and I've never even got out in the word I really I really don't need it I I recognize I recognize you're the boss and everything but you know we're still getting things done right quite nice a lot of us do the message that way a lot of us do Malachi 45 that way like well you know I know he's a prophet and it's good and I'll just listen to it here and there and you're not learning you're not being instructed because you don't have a revelation of where he want to take you I I want to go in Rapture I want to be Rapture Ready I want to get out of here I'm not trying to stay anybody trying to stay here well then don't worry about buying a new house gotcha right don't don't let that consume you don't let that worry you let us be glad and rejoice and so as he told me he's like you know I'm pretty good I don't need that I

man I'd rather just blow up I don't want to live in a hole for 20 you kidding me come what Me shows they're afraid of something come on they'd rather spend a billion dollars to live in a hole right instead of surrender their life I say I just want to surrender my life I don't want to live in no hole for 20 years you wouldn't be able to get away from it anyways don't fool yourself why don't you just surrender your life and be married to another oh if you just come under Eagle's Wings if you just come under the shield of his wings I'll keep you there I'll bro over you I'll keep you not even

you preparing for school you preparing for your job you preparing for this you preparing for that but are you preparing for a Rapture now it becomes well let's just keep moving we want to be prepared there's a preparation being made turn with me to Hebrews chapter 12 please put them swords to use don't worry you can find Hebrews I've given up to and looked in the very beginning like man why can't I find Hebrews everybody think I don't read my Bible right take your time Hebrews chapter 12 and we'll read read verse one wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now that word patience has a great meaning it says the characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings and the church said it's the characteristics that you're you're not swerved from from the purpose that you have been placed here for that your faithfulness to the word of God your faithfulness to the message no matter how great the trial no matter how hard the sufferings are look Satan wants to pile it on you he he wants to weigh you down he wants to distract you he wants to get you off course so then I want to ask you if if we have an adversary that that is trying to distract you he's trying to get you off course I don't know about you how many have ever got off course how do we stay on course I got a little scripture if you turn in your Bibles to Exodus 20 I believe it is 23 we can get an Old Testament type here in Exodus 23 it says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way so then so how are how are we going to be kept in the way yes how are we going to stay in the way that is called Holiness how are we going to stay on this straight and narrow Highway how are we going to stay living in this Rapture age how are we going to stay Rapture Ready behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee Oh Hallelujah he's not only going to keep you in the way but to bring thee into the place which I have prepared oh this voice of preparation Malachi 4:5 is keeping you in the way and it's bringing you onto a place that I have prepared for you in my father's house are me any Mansions if it were not so I wouldn't have told you but I go and prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and I have sent my word I have sent my message I have sent my angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place that I've prepared oh let us be glad and rejoice oh that's what the end time messages to do is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture restoring the faith bringing you into the promise you're living in the hour of promis church hey don't give up on me yet let's go we're just getting started we're talking about being Rapture Ready let's turn in our Bibles to Jude 1 if you find Jude 2 let me let me know it's right before Revelations beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful of me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints he's he's telling us here that we got what what is this message to do it's to restore us back to the original faith and now here he's telling you look we got to contend for it we got to fight for it I want to tell you it's worth fighting for it's worth working for it's worth tying for come on you got to fight for this thing everybody else is fighting for everything else what about the bride are you fighting to get in his presence are you fighting to pray are you fighting for Revelation are you fighting are you contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints are you fighting for the Rapture my goodness people will fight for a place on Black Friday they they'll fight over a TV sale they'll fight over their place in line they'll get family up there they'll do all this what about us I say why don't you fight for your place fight for the message fight for the faith contend contend contend fight fight prophet of God said and God's provided way so if what if the people are prepared in the wrong way what if a soldier went to the field remember we're laboring along the thought of how Malachi 4:5 the voice of preparation is preparing us on how to fight on how to live he what if a soldier went to the field not trained for battle but go uh go out there to dance they might be ever so good dancers but they've got to be trained to fight that's what this message is doing is it's training you on how to fight it's preparing you it's teaching you may the prophet of God would talk about sixc Smith yeah brother brand I believe in one place he says he fought 15 professional fights he was 15 and0 and uh 6C Smith because he knocked out a guy in 6 seconds was his trainer and he said he'd be training him and he' just keep hitting him in the stomach he said in one place he'd even lift him up in the wall against the wall and hit him in the stomach and he say why why are you doing that to me you're about to kill me he said it'll be good for you is it why he says cuz your body has to to learn how to respond you got to be trained to be able to take the punch I got to punch you over and over again I got to hit you over and over and over again that way when you're fighting the enemy you've been trained and you've been properly taught the prophet of God said look I might got to I I might got to uh pour it over on you I might got to really lay it on you but I say oh you you got to have it that you can be able to stand the test why do the ministers keep saying that over and over why does the pastor keep down going down that line why does the Evangelist keep saying those things you got to keep being punched over and over because you're being trained you're being taught that way you can stand before the enemy and you know how to fight that you can take the punch when it comes oh some of us have got taken some pretty big punches I say praise God you still here hallelujah why because you've been trained under the angel of Malachi for that's brought you into the presence of the I am that's keeping you he's keeping you in the way to bring you into the place that he's prepared building you up into the statue of a perfect man now we just laid a little Foundation here to move into where we want to launch from so now brother brandom and invisible Union here paragraph 35 they can put that up but we're going to be addressing his text Romans 7 verse 1-4 says and Paul here is giv an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace and illustrating it like a marriage and divorce said this passage is very seldomly preached on because it's more or less pertains like to marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage divorce of how he's trying to set an order here as a church can no more be married to the world and Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it you following me that could be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband and I have my own thoughts about that and I believe that the what the Bible says is the truth now I believe also it's my belief that this unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy what are you talking about Prophet what are you talking about Paul he's talking about you he's talking about the elect lady he's talking about one of the great mysteries of prophecies concerning the bride in lady OA that would be trapped here come on does it sound familiar you didn't do it in the first place you were trapped into it so now our text is Romans 4 it says wherefore my brethren you also become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth for fruit unto God so we just work quickly here he says in paragraph 153 so to be married to the second son to to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first denominational husband cuz there isn't one of them that can take all the word of God everything outside of the message of the is a substitute everything outside of the message of the hour is a substitute and I want to tell you your first denominational husband and and we could we could go different ways with this and talk about the age because I want to say the denominational husband to the age of Lady OA is Pentecostalism and that first husband will always be back there trying to press itself back into a place of influence again it'll try to offer you a glare from another age try to tantalize you with Things From Another age and try to get you to drift back into that marriage oh with a denominational husband but that thing's got to be dead and your first husband is a denominational Spirit it can be ever so religious oh what are you talking about brother Matthew well hello Kane couldn't get no more religious than that you think your Works has done anything for you ask Cain about that there's only one way and that's by Revelation faith is a revelation my sheep hear my voice and another they ain't going to follow your first husband gots to die look look look look at Matthew 25 you can even be virtuous no oil they they were all virgins they were all virtuous no oil you can go to church go to Camp you can do all the things you can trim your lamp no oil so I want to say this look at your fruit we won't labor here too long because we want to keep moving quickly look at your if you're bringing forth oranges and grapefruits and and tangerines and and lemons and tangelos and all these things it's checkup time all right everybody look at your life we're talking about being Rapture Ready we're talking about being prepared to go on this trip to go on this journey look at your life it's okay don't don't don't squirm now too much don't get up and use the restroom right now look at your life look at your fruit H have we just been grafted into the message hey there's benefits trust me I I've had friends that I've witnessed to uh uh before I was marriage and married and and even once thank you love for putting up with that we're witnessing to somebody they came and lived with us for a few months because I wanted them to receive what I had we had ran together out in the world and one of my friends he came and lived with me uh before I was married he lived with me for eight months man he he went to the church and he entered into into the services even the this was in Arizona even the pastor there even had him speak at one of the uh uh uh Services of his testimony and give his testimony to the people and I remember a good sister uh was starting to talk to them and and they they were uh starting to talk and everything and and and it just bugged me to no end because I knew he was riding on my coattails I knew he had come in and had just grafted his way in he was living a Victorious Life he was drug free and alcohol free he was enjoying the benefits of the spirit he was moving in the camps he was moving in the service everything was all right until I said hey buddy it's time for you now to go out and get on your own and then when the punches came he had never been married to another and it was just like that he was back to drugs and alcohols and it wasn't months later I was preaching his funeral right here in this building cuz he ODed on drugs I say look at the fruit that's in your life now we know god holds it all in the hand that you're predestined but there got to be something in your heart that wants to be pleasing to the Lord that wants to have complete and total deliverance from that first husband that F I hate that guy I hate him I want him to die I wanted to title the service death to my ex I want my ex-husband to die we have probably got some hits but it ain't nothing that Paul didn't preach every Speck of them gots to die but I wonder how we kind of keep them around because we like the entertainment we like that part we like passing the time what you got a mixed bag of fruit maybe you've just been grafted in on I don't want a mixed bag I want the Holy Ghost and Power in my life ruling and reigning on the throne of my heart from the Sun up to the sun down let me give you glory Lord all of my thoughts all of my thinking all of my words everything that I do do everything that I say Lord I'm Rapture Ready I want you to come any moment any time oh God I'm ready I've laid it all down every Speck of that old man's dead the only thing I want is you and your word I Want It All let's go it's going home time Hallelujah prophet of God said he said you can't live with it you can't just say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion now now if you notice where the Prophet is I believe he's at Romans 711 now if you could put that up Romans 711 till okay look what he says I'll divorce them and hang them up here till occasion a lot of us have divorced him and hung them up until occasion well what does that mean for sin taking occasion by The Commandments deceived me and by it slew me look if you don't die to that thing and you you leave it there for occasion it's going to get you that's right go ahead you think you got the victory you went here you went to that church meeting you got all enthused and you got all excited that guy's just going to take a backseat and all right go ahead go ahead run a little bit I've been waiting a long time a real long time I've been waiting 6,000 years I know how you think and how you do matter of fact this ain't the first time you've done this I'll just wait around cuz I know you ain't got complete and total Victory there got to come a heart cry in The Believer that's said I played Church long enough maybe I really don't have what I thought I had I want to ask you are you Sanctified are you living a life that's s Sanctified and consecrated are you hungering for your Bible are you listening to the message of the hour every day I say if you ain't listening to the message of the hour every day now I no I don't I don't I don't want to accept that just because I'm a minister uh-uh no I can't no I I a't I ain't listen to that cuz cuz I'm M listen to that that's my husband oh call me crazy I don't know how to say it but when I hear the voice I'm not hearing a man I'm hearing my mate Christ the word my mate who I've been married to I'm hearing a voice from another world I'm hearing something that sounds like home I'm hearing something that's calling me back to where I came from I want to hear it I want to feed on it it gives me Victory it gives me joy it gives me peace it gives me Deliverance it builds me up It prepares me it makes me ready it gets all the the leaven out it clears my mind it clears my heart it brings me into peace it brings me into his presence am I talking hello because he sent his Angel to keep you in the way no sir no rting of divorcement he dies the nature of this world has to die every Speck of them has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature oh did you catch it did you catch it did you hear it you have to be reunited again oh what is United means that means you had it in the first place oh Hallelujah you got to be reunited again with the nature you had in the first place that means this this nature you had in the beginning wasn't really your first nature in the carnal in the natural it was but there was another nature in the garden of called the tree of life and there you were in the logos that is your nature that is your person and by Divine promise according to Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 you have been reunited with the tree of life that you can be married to another oh let us rejoice let us be glad for the marriage of the Lamb Has Come Oh Hallelujah forgive me I can't help it cuz I know what I was yes sir I want to tell you like Paul said yes sir Paul said I am an apostle he said I met the Loos just like the apostles but yet I was one that was born out of season but he said go ahead call me the least of the Apostles he said but by the grace of God I am what I am Hallelujah call me whatever you want to call me I don't care but by the grace of God I am what I am which one are you I tell you which one I am I'm that eagle I'm the predestinated I'm the bride the move is on for the bride th thus say the Lord you have now entered into the Rapture age hallelujah hallelujah let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come y'all going to have to help me I can't get excited for everybody cuz y'all are pulling sorry it ain't me y'all are the ones pulling well be glad it's either come or hadn't hello let us be glad I'm not done yet 2:16 we'll keep pressing we'll bring this somewhere to a close short 216 now invisible Union that'd be a good place to stop but ah I want to invite the musicians but I don't want them to sit there for 15 minutes again paragraph 26 now you but when you were separated from that Union by spiritual death oh yeah come on we're we're going somewhere real quick hang in there now you but when you were separated from that Union by spiritual death your natural desires is to cut your hair your natural desire is to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire is to be intellectual smart man know something better than the other that's what Eve wanted that's the very thing she wanted look if you're professing the message if you're professing to be be a believer but you're living contrary to the word I want to tell you you are living in spiritual adultery now now don't don't get upset don't be alarmed because God rich in Mercy solved your problem he solved your problem he rigged this thing so that you have a way out see your natural desire is to be intellectual the lust of the flesh the pride of life the lust of the eye right yeah I don't want to detour but we we could we could use the type not only in the flesh but in the spiritual that's why the prophet of God said that in the beginning say I'm not looking for Revival in this generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord is because he was wanting the the the bride to know where to look it's not it's not a public show he said I will meet you in there and that that same message right after that I believe in paragraph 46 when he says that he says now watch when the bride starts to line herself up with the word he says then the Revival will come forward so he's not doing away with the Revival but the Revival is in the third pool that isn't that that isn't a public show it's the coming of the Lord he comes as a thief in the night this isn't the first part of Revelation where he comes in a cloud and all eyes will see him and behold him that is not are coming this is the coming of a thief in a night that nobody knows about it that it's a secret invisible Union between Christ the anointed word for the age and the bride and you are standing right here right now being married to the perfect word of God that has come to restore us back to the original faith that we can receive the translation of our bodies oh I want to preach a message on The Last Enemy Hallelujah don't you realize where we're sitting church that you have been anointed to face The Last Enemy what is The Last Enemy The Last Enemy is death that's why Paul could stand there and say oh death hallelujah oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory now we're going to try to bring it somewhere to a close 1 John 2:16 says for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life I won't try to hurry because I won't get through all of it anyways is not of the father but is of the world get all the leaven out yes get Rapture Ready it's lamp trimming time we Must Die daily bringing forth the fruit of the word now we'll just try to end along these lines we're talking about being married to another right Romans 7 makes way for Romans 8 amen okay so Romans 7 you you got to be married to another so then once you've become married to another now you're enjoying the marriage benefits Hallelujah now that you're first husband has died every spectum of his I don't want religion I don't want Pentecostalism don't give me a song and a dance I if I get excited and catch a revelation and I do Sing and Shout praise God but don't give me a substitute give me the word give me Christ the word the revealed mate that's what I'm interested in where does Ro Romans 8 take you now come on we're talking about being married to another not a right writing of divorcement but that dude is dead what does Romans 8 start out with there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus speaks about the receiving the spirit of adoption The Same Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead oh it now dwells in you quickening your mortal body this is what the restoration of the faith this is what being married to another this is what the Angel that's keeping you in the way has opened up these great and exceeding precious promises that you might be benefiting under Christ the word your husband it goes on and keeps going on in Romans 8 how you're predestinated those I've called I've predestinated I've Justified them I've also glorified we'll ask the musicians to come he says now just jumping back into invisible union he says you never did it hallu because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life do you are are you hearing what he's saying you never did it because because why that little germ that was in you yes Hallelujah you didn't know nothing about it but the great prophet Eagle that little germ that was in you was to be you what to be who you are what to be your very character what to be your very nature that predestinated seed that germ seed of predestination that he placed on the inside of you was packing all the potentials of the I am that you could be everything that he said you would be under the ospice of Malachi 4:5 and the and the Fulfillment of Prophecy for the day that we're living in Oh Glory to God hallu he says and that's my paragraph 307 and that's my message oh my five minutes we've been an hour and three minutes five minutes of your time I want to end end right here he says and that's my message to you Church you that's a union spiritual union by the word that you're dead to these old husbands you're born a new don't try to dig him up am he's dead now this is a Vindicated Prophet I want to say it's more than a Vindicated Prophet this is the voice of God to you yes sir this is the voice of the Resurrection to you you are born a new don't try to dig him up he's dead if you're born if you're a born again Christian that little germ that was predestinated to you it's word coming on word on word on word on word and come into the full stature of Christ that's right so he can come get his bride now we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord look he said don't dig him up if the prophet of God said don't dig him up then what is Satan going to try to get you to do he's trying to get you to dig him up he's giving you the shovel he's telling you where to dig come on he's trying to get you to dig up your past he's trying to get you to dig up old thoughts he's trying to allow that old nature to come back into a position of influence but the prophet of God is telling you don't dig him up don't entertain the past don't entertain the things of the world why what are you doing you're digging up a dead man right then I say this think about it now the power of Resurrection is in you yes sir I say which one are you which one do you want to resurrect do you want to resurrect the old man or that germ seed that was to be you from the very be I say I choose the word I choose the germ seed that was to be me that come to life by the revealed word of the hour let's all stand hallelujah praise His wonderful [Music] name oh hallelujah it's time we say get behind me Satan it's written it's been spoken I Am The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you're Justified he said your
