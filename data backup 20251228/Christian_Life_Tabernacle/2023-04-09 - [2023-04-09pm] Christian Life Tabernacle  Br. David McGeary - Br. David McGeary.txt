recognize it or feel it but we know it's true because your word does not fail and that's what we rely on Father we rely on every promise that you gave us and we ask you to bless us this evening father and be with us in a mighty way and just lift up our hearts that we might be about your business we ask these things in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen Lord bless you tonight if you have your Bibles let's turn over to the gospel of Saint Luke and starting in the 24th chapter and the 32nd verse amen I I um I'm going to see if I can be shorter than this morning and somebody came to me and they said brother McGarry that was good but it was awful short and I thought well you know that's all right Short's good I believe there's a statement somewhere he said that the best sermons are only 25 to 30 minutes long so I'm not that good of a Preacher amen let's read here it's a great story I I think it just is wonderful I like to read it he said and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us well he talked with us by the way and while he opened the scriptures to us Luke the 24th chapter and the 33rd verse and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread and as they spoke Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and Afraid and supposed that they had seen the spirit and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do we do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for the spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye see me have and when he had spoken and showed them his hands and his feet and well they yet believed it and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he said unto them have ye hear any me and they gave him a piece of boiled fish and of honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them this thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I will send the promise of my father upon you but Terry in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endured with power from on high and he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he as he parted from them he carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you what uh what a wonderful story I you know I I think that it's it's always I guess in man's nature when God comes by that that there's always an element of maybe a little of a little fear or something rising up in your heart but I like the words that he always speaks he says peace be still but I I remember many times in their prayer line the prophet of God would say to the people he would say now don't worry that won't hurt you it's only the Lord Jesus amen that's the kind of love that he had and that warm sweet Spirit it wouldn't hurt you I just wanted to just uh this uh wonderful Easter day and we talked about it this morning how that what type of man that Jesus was the love that he had in his heart The Compassion the kindness the the great ability to endure and and to stay with and not forsake his disciples though they must have put him through all kinds of Trials we find that they were continually murmuring in their heart and questioning him and a lot of things we could take place and he was always with nails guard hands uh uh rebuking him I could say it that way with that tender love I'll say you know why do you murmur why do you complain you know oh ye of little faith you know he's always trying to get him to believe and to recognize everything that was there for him and and as we were just talking about all that he was and the great eight things that he came to accomplish because we know that sin separated man from God and man could still worship God man could still be aware that there was a God in fact Man All Through Time looked and they saw something that was greater than they were and they would worship it excuse me we find out that in many places they found that people worship the Sun because it was a great power and and they they realized that that it brought light and life and it it was important to their substance they never realized the power of the Sun and where that power came from that that power came from a creator that put that power in the sun to do what it was created for and we find that about the Moon that the moon was a great reflector of the Sun so the moon uh performed the function for which God created it for so the the Sea and the tide and we know the moon and Tim has the effect on the tide the tide coming up and the going out and the rivers and the lakes and everything was put into motion for God because God had a purpose in everything in fact he wrote the first Bible in the stars and in the Zodiac and in nature itself and Paul spoke it this way he said the invisible things of God are clearly seen by the visible things around us as we see God everywhere we see the purpose of God and so we see that in the Sun that God put that power in the sun he put the power in the plant to grow up and to bring forth life and and it could there if I could say that upon upon everything that we could see there was a power placed within it in order for it to carry out his good pleasure and so we talked about this great man got separated from God and so the only place that man could find God is in the things that they could see and touch and then we know we could go through the great Bible stories of of how that God appeared and how he separated out of people and how that he got a land everything in Shadow and type so that we could look at the great Bible story and we could see what God was unfolding for us our beautiful unfolding of the word of God but one day he came and he broke the chain and broke what separated man from God and that was sin he he paid the price for sin that is important to me because I would hate to have to pay my own debt because I don't have the ability to pay the debt I don't have the means to pay the debt I'm insufficient to pay the debt what was uh would be required I uh if if I had to work I couldn't work a lifetime to pay it if I had to sell all that I had I couldn't accumulate enough to pay the debt I I was indebted forever to sin because the day that I was born in sin and shaped in iniquity came and speaking lies I was indebted to God from my first breath when I as a child I I you would steal a cookie you'd have cookie crumbs on your face and the cookie in your hand and Mommy would say did you take a cookie and you'd say no Mommy I did and why because it was your nature you you know if I mean it was your nature so many times you see a child that oh they they I think the first word they learn is mine you know somehow another kid will pick up their toy and they go mine it's mine and you'll see him fight and and you'll see him holler and scream and just carry on because somebody's got their toy and where did they get that you know did you parents teach that to them you don't know if it was the attributes of sin it was the condition that man was in because they were separated from God that they didn't have that touch that Supernatural touch from God and if so man was separated from sin and then we know that he paid a great price for that he paid the debt amen I owe the debt that I could not pay He Paid a Debt he did not owe and that that payment of that debt set us free and now man could enter into fellowship with God and and so we find in this great story here that that they finally came to know the Lord and they were blessed with great joy and he told them to go out and he gave him a commission he said that the gospel should be preached and sent to the Salvation of sins and act in the salvation of man should be preached in all the nations beginning at Jerusalem he was going to bring this good news to the world and that's what he told them you're Witnesses of this and and we believe in their scriptures where Paul speaks he says that we he's this week neglect not such a great salvation that we heard of of them that witnessed it and then it was shared and brought to us so we're sitting here tonight because somebody witnessed that many many years ago and they begin to tell the story but you know the the the part that seemed to have been lost is that he told them to wait until they were endued with power and authority from on high and uh you know it's a paradox I find in the scripture because he gave us power and authority but yet he told us to be subject one to another so just like the power that he gave the son it had a specific purpose and reason behind the power that he gave the son and the power that he was going to give the church it had a Pacific purpose and a Pacific reason behind that power that he gave them because everything that God does has a purpose he didn't give the power and authority to us because he tempered it in fact he said that power without character is satanic so it wasn't power for power's sake or authority for Authority sake because he told us to be subject one to another and if you think well what did he give me power and authority for and I think that's what we got to begin to understand that when God empowers somebody that if the empowerment is given not for a display or knock for a if I could say this some sort of a personal gratification or some sort of personal uh exalting of oneself and he said that that's even when they say they came back and they were rejoicing I think the brothers just mentioned that in their prayer that they were rejoicing over the fact that the Devils were subject to them and he said don't rejoice in that he said but rather Rejoice because your name if written in the Lambs Book of Life how how much greater so we talk about this great power and authority and the purpose that God gave it to us and we know in Peter he says be sober and be be vigilant because of your adversary the devil is like a roaring lion going about seeking whom he may devour so we know that the power and authority that's given to the church was the power and authority to defeat the adversary because that's what an adversary is an adversary is is what some call an opponent or one that is in opposition of your goal and we run a race don't we at the end the race is into the Swift but it's to those that endure those that stay true to course those that don't lose the vision so the power and authority that God gave the church was directed solely at the adversary that's right the adversary the one that opposes every promise that God gives us every every thing that God bought for us at Calvary all the blessings that he poured onto us all the promises that he had given us in his word and had you ever have one of those little promised little things where you go up and you pull the little promise out and you read your promise for the day you know I I encourage that I think every day you ought to find a promise a promise because it's by these precious promises that were partakers of divine nature and we have an adversary and what the adversary is opposed to he's opposed to those promises whether he battles you in your mind whether he points out your shortcomings uh whether he makes accusation against you there's there's no telling the number of ways that he uses to oppose you and kind of fight against you and to rob you of the joy of your salvation he's an opponent he's adverse another clip you want to go put it in Drive he's trying to get you to put it in reverse you want to go up he wants to push you down you want to go to the right he tries to turn the road to the left I don't care what is his whole purpose is to oppose you he opposes you you wouldn't think but keep just that's what he is he's the your adversary and Peter said thinking not strange that the fiery darts of your enemy the trying of your faith it's it it's such a a a a a battle that that we have because of the great adversary and he fought Jesus tooth and nail his whole Ministry trying to keep Jesus from going to that cross because once he went to that cross he was defeated he oh he thought he had him well he said I got you now and he put the Stinger of death in him I love how our messenger tells that story but something happened he overcame death he overcame the grave he overcame the sting and he did it by the spirit that was in him amen the the the victory was in love divine that father I've loved them that are in the world he said and I've loved them till the end might they know the love in where that we love one another so we see that the power and authority that was given to the church was given to be over the adversary not over one another even he told the ministry he said whatever you do don't become Lords over God's Heritage and let the greatest among you be the least and serve the younger and so the pitcher is what's beautiful because he wrote this great picture and he opened up their understanding and showed them in the scripture that he had overcome the adversary because these things were written of them that he must suffer and die and Rise the third day can you imagine I would have liked to have been there for that service how do you like Jesus to open the scripture well what has Jesus always do you know he just doesn't come down and and give you a sensation or or give you a feeling but he always opens it up into the word of God and I believe in blessing I believe in praising God the Bible says that they went into the temple and they praised God continually day and night what were they doing they were thanking him for what that he had revealed to them they're great too now we're possessors of eternal life what a revelation how would you like to have been there when Jesus explained to you that you've got eternal life that you would never die that he that that that would not suffer the second death as many as believed on him he gave power to become the Sons and Daughters of God that was the good news amen they followed them and they saw us works and they saw the things that he'd done and and yet they had a different expectation oh we thought that you were he that would Deliver Us from the hand of the Romans Grace do we know that's how they felt because the conversation prior to this was them walking to Emmaus oh this is a great thing we thought oh we thought he would be can you imagine here they are talking to him the very Lord Of Glory and they're saying you haven't heard of yourself you know you haven't heard of you haven't heard of what's what's happened these days here's the guy it happened to amen you know it kind of reminds me of a true story there there was a a great guitar player uh uh that is pretty famous and his name was Chad Atkins and Chet Atkins was on a cruise and and there was a man playing a guitar out on the deck of the cruise and uh Chet Atkins walked up to him and said uh do you mind if I I play a little and so he took the guitar and he played a little bit you know and said this is a nice guitar and very good and played a few things and gave it back to the guy and the guy looked at him and said you know you're pretty good but you ain't no Chet Atkins you know I thought about that a little bit and you know we kind of take that same stance with the Lord sometime but but here they were talking to him and they didn't know because their eyes were holding and and it and they sat there and then they they they they their hearts burned within them because what was he doing he was going over the scriptures with them and and showing them in the scriptures and laying out the scriptures and what's so beautiful about this story here here he was he was going to give them power from on high he was going to endure him with power from on high he was going to give them power and authority over their adversaries but first he had to tie it to the scriptures because the word is what has the power and authority over Satan Satan can impersonate any gift but he can't impersonate that word that word is the absolute that word is the ultimate that word is what's going to happen all God needs us to do is have faith in it believe that's the way it's going to be not falter from it not try to fix it let him fix it he's the quickener he's the one that quickens the word and makes it alive in the promise that it's applied to okay and so this he gave him this great power and he he broke the scriptures to him and and showed him how that everything that took place beginning at Moses and the law and the prophets and the Psalms Glory oh I would I wanted to be on that walk but you know in a way I feel I have been because he come in this day and he dailed himself in in a prophet and he took us down through a walk through the scriptures he took us over in the Book of Revelation and showed us the seven Church ages he went over there and he opened the Seven Seals to us and he revealed to us the mystery of Christ standing in this whole last age standing there unfolding the great work how that the seed was going to go into the ground and come up to justification sanctification the restoration of the gifts the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the Capstone to the church oh my God in one way I feel I walked on that road to Emmaus in this lady of sea age where all the word and all the purpose of God was once again restored to the church turning us back to battle with our adversary that's where we have power for we have power to to defeat what opposes the word of God you know some things you don't have power over you don't you know you can stand out there all day long until the sun to stop still but if you don't have a little word to stop that son it's going to go right on with the way that God created it the laws of God are still going to be in place because all the laws of God are for your benefit you need rest he lets the sun go down and he he gives you a light to sleep by and he lets you reach you need food and it gives you Seasons a time to eat a time to plant a time to grow in other words God's got a great economy and a great Harmony that a Believer can live in and be at peace with and and love life and love the good things of God and love one another but it's when somebody that comes in and opposes that and tries to rob you of your peace and Rob you of your joy then then that's when you've got the power and authority to stop him in his tracks no way it's not given for demonstration and most of the time it's not given for yourself it's given for another person and and you know the the the the the the the motive there's got to be an objective then what's our objective with the power and authority that he gave us our objective is to stop the adversary stop him from robbing lives stop him from binding people stop him from stealing our children stop him from stealing our loved ones the the objective of the power that he was going to give the church the the reason he was going to give them this power and this Authority because they had an objective they had to go into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll do this you'll do this you'll do that why because it had an objective behind it and the objective of the power and authority that he was going to give him was for them to overcome the adversary as he overcame and what was the motive behind it what's the motive it'll never be the motives so you can show you got power that's just such a wrong motive it's like like why do you want this the baptism of the Holy Spirit you know the prophet of God said you have to have a reason to ask for your healing it isn't just to be healed to be healed to say I got healed I got healed I had faith I got healed now you're spiritually sick I'd rather be physically sick than spiritually sick you know that that could that's never what it was given for you know we've done this and blessed God you know and I'll say it and I'll say it all the days of my life if I knew where the devil was I'd be as far away from that place as possible the only reason I'm going to slay him is when he comes to seek me like a roaring lion when he comes to devour me when he comes to take my joy my peace my long suffering my Temperance my patience my goodness my kindness my my faith when he comes to attack the virtues that make me the statue that I'm supposed to be and the Capstone when he comes to to take for me and fight me then I've got power and authority to tell him to stop right there because he's keeping me because the power he gave me has a purpose the motive of it is to stop the enemy the objective I mean is to stop the enemy what motivates that power and authority so something's got to motivate it something's got to to bring it up you know the the athletic world oh they they try to get the person motivated excuse me because they've Talent they've got the ability I've met a lot of people that aren't just self-motivated they could do anything but they do nothing because they don't have any motivation they don't have anything that places the talent into movement and they they they they they just they just don't want to be involved or they don't want to carry a burden so we have an objective with what God's given us and and he he's he's imdued us with this great Authority over the enemy all things with the their their subject unto his word and what did he gave you he gave you his word because Satan's not going to be subject to you he's going to be subject to who's in you because greater is he that is in you than he who is in the world and can and he's in You by promise and he's in You by his word and he expresses himself and that's what the spirit does is it brings you into remembrance of everything that he said every promise that he gave you yeah it just fills you up in your fiber but there's got to be something in a believer that rises this power and authority uh to the surface where it will be used and it isn't just having it that's not the motive it's not to exercise it but the motive behind it is love what motivated God to give a son what motivated God to send his only begotten son to to to he as a father to create the second Adam in the womb of Mary and and the life that he had didn't come from Joseph it didn't come from Marriage he was the father of it amen what motivated him to do that what motivated God to become man and and to have a a a a a a a son that learned obedience by the things he suffered what motivated God to do that well you know the scripture God so loved the world is why that he did it everything that he did as we read this morning it was motivated by love so he had the power and authority but you know he had the power and authority to call down 10 Legions of angels but he didn't do it because his power and his authority was governed by his motive we never want to lose the fact yes we've got power yes we've got signs and wonders yes these Works will follow us but they don't give Glory until they're motivated by the right motive and how many people are going to come in that day and say Lord we did all these things and he's going to say you know depart from me and you say doers of iniquity you said well how can a man be doing all those things and be Wicked iniquities unbelief you didn't believe why that I gave you this power you didn't understand the reason for it you exalted yourself and that's just what the enemy wanted to do he wanted to exalt himself above the Angels he wanted to be worshiped and I wonder if sometimes if if that isn't slipping into the lives of people that they they want all a great demonstrations be because somehow they they they want it to come back to them but can you imagine a church that's motivated by the true motive objective when they see the adversary on someone that they love they see the adversary they're not just doing it because it's a promise they're just not doing it because the scriptures say we can lay hands on you and you'll rise up and and it boy if you don't rise up you ain't got no faith I'm tired of praying for people and it always being on them you know if you have faith you'll get better how about if I had love they'd get better how about if I had compassion they would get better how about if I raised to my position that I belong in that they would get better how about if I saw this being the adversary and I knew that God had given me something that he empowered me with something just like the son is empowered he empowered this son that this son could carry out the purpose that he gave that son then it's no longer me that does it but it's Christ in me that does the work is the love of God that is shed abroad in my heart that does the work it's it's the goodness of God I can't stand that devil but the minute you just take it and turn it one way or the other oh you might have power but it never accomplishes the purpose it becomes hybrid it becomes deformed it it starts to point to the church instead of to him God don't share his glory with anybody he don't need to and we don't want him to we want him to get all the praise we want him to get all the honor and so that's what motivates it wouldn't motivated he gave him this power and he gave him this Authority he told him to go preach the gospel and to be endued with power from on high so when they went into that upper room and they got the power from on high when you feel or or or think or or or or someplace because I want to enter into fellowship with you on this what do you think it was that they received was it a third person was it a uh a sensation was it anointing no because he said I will be with you and I will be in you and in that day you will know that I am in the father and I am in you Hallelujah praise God what did he pour out what did he give him he gave him the same spirit that raised him from the dead that's what he gave them because if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body so what did he give him he gave him the word he gave him his word I want you to know some beautiful thing about the Lord and when we are listening to Faith it just struck me so much the that Jesus always gives you something to believe in first he just doesn't ask you to have faith he gives you a sign he gives you a wonder he gives you a conviction he gives you his word because Faith cometh by what hearing and hearing his word he gives you something to believe what do you think the prophet did when he sat there and he told the person to come up and they had a desire in their heart and the only way that they're ever going to get that desire is by faith because God works by faith he wants you to believe in fact he said if you don't believe you're slothful he says you have not because you ask not and you don't ask because you don't believe so what does he do what did he do he said oh cure you're Mr uh g.j Wags from uh such and such place and your address is 2153 West Brook Street what was he doing he was giving that man something so he he believed he said I'm going to join my faith with your faith because wherever two or three agree on any one thing it'll come to pass he was giving them Something to Believe it wasn't raw faith God's the author of our faith he that's what he was doing he was authoring the faith he was saying I'll show you this I'll do this I'll do that that's what Jesus said he said if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my works I've given you a reason to believe and he said because you've seen those things he says now you have no excuse he didn't throw him out there Raw and challenge you to have faith though he authored your faith he's given you a reason to believe how many of you are believing for things and you could turn around and look back and see the mighty hand of God in your life all along the way why because he's trying to author your faith he's trying to raise the faith up inside of you he wants your faith to be motivated by love why are you asking for demonstration purposes oh Lord I want to do a miracle because I want all of the church to know that God hears my prayers ooh that's sick that's sad but what if it's Lord I have a servant at home and he's sick he said okay I'll come pray no you don't have to pray Lord if you'll just speak the word I'm a man of authority I know I can say to this person do this and I can say to that person and do that he said if I can do this in the carnal how much more can you do it in the spiritual Lord just speak the word if you'll just say it I know my servant will be well and he says so I haven't seen such great faith in all of Israel go and find it as you so desire what motivated that Centurion to come and humble himself at the feet of Jesus love in his heart why do you think God's got the cap off this statue of a perfect man with the right motive and objective that's the thing and faith has a final resting place the resting place of faith is the word of God it's got to have I don't care what experience you have if you shout praise God I imagine these guys were shouting in the temple I can see the high priest come up say settle down boys you're getting a little Rowdy here I might have to put you in the outer Court why they were ready to go in and eat the showbread you know what I mean they were on fire they just seen the Lord Of Glory be taken up into heaven they just were commissioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel what do you think they were doing in the temples the only place they knew where to worship they were in there praying and getting fired up getting ready to hit the street then they got the power oh they're not drunk as you suppose but this is that amen you know that Capstone this is that this is this is what it is so I don't care what your experience is if you don't tie that experience to the word a scripture if if you feel a blessing of God in your life tie it to a word tie it to a scripture tie it to a promise and then it becomes Everlasting because heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away blessings pass away Sensations pass away moves of the spirit pass away but his word never passes away you can anchor on it every day of your life you can know it's true and just think he took that same spirit that raised him from the dead and put it in you I I I I I just I I love it I believe the scripture like is in Saint John 14 12. I believe I might have just read it but he said he says verily verily I send to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever ye ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it if ye love me keep my commandment oh why did he take the spirit that he had that Rose him from the dead why did he give it to us for a sensation know that we could do the same works that he did that we wouldn't be ashamed that we would know that he's within us and that we have the power and Authority to perform that which he gave us the spirit for just like the sun's power was placed in it by the Creator the power is placed in You by the same creator by the same one that gave you the spirit that's why he gives you his spirit not to say I'm Spirit-filled but to say now I can do the works that he did because I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me I work that I do and he did I can do also not me that does the work but Christ that dwelleth in me thus the work and our understanding becomes open now we start becoming an army that's motivated by love and we start seeing that adversary taking our possessions taking our joy shaking our peace taking our loved ones doing all these things and finally We rise up and our love just can't stand it no more and we start moving him out I'm going to possess your gate you used to enter into this person's life through this weakness I've come with compassion and mercy to plug that hole in their life and put Christ in their stead put the Lord Jesus where you used to enter in now he's going to stand there and the protection of the Gospel is going to flow out upon him and then we start becoming a great Army because the Same Spirit that raised him from the dead is what he poured back on the church he gave him life I am the life the resurrection and the life no man cometh to the father but by me I am the resurrection and the life and I've come to dwell in you I've come to take my Abode with you I've come to invite you to invite me into your heart and I think that's what's something that we all need to do is get someplace and start inviting him back into our heart back into every part of our life back into our being Lord I really want to be victorious I really want to serve you I really want to do a work on your name I really want to spread this hope in this gospel this is the last chance the world's got if they don't come into this Ark if they don't come into this place of safety if they're left outside Lord they'll perish the last chance to get them in and in the love in your heart is moved you beyond embarrassment Beyond reproach you just can't keep still you can't hold your peace because there's a bubbling brook bubbling up inside of you what a resurrection what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is in this day the restoration of the power of the Resurrection restored back into the bride that the same life that he had they had also he became us that we could become him all them great songs all them great stories they all come as they are understanding are opened up in the scripture so let's go have a good week let's let the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit let's let the power that God's given us let our faith rise up because the prophet of God said if we don't use the faith that God gives us he says we're being slothful oh Lord put me to work for your kingdom you love the Lord God bless
