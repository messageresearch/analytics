because without you we can't do anything then come help us because you're always there to rescue those that wait upon you with all our hearts we say thank you in committing ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen uh you may have your seats for a moment with all my heart I'd like to thank the pastor and every single one of you because recently in the month of December I had a I had surgery in in Istanbul in Turkey and many of you prayed for me and some of you even texted me I would like to thank you all and say that God uh answered to your prayers hallelu the doctor when they announced the surgery they told me it was a risky surgery but it was needed that surgery was needed I said well I'm in your hands [Music] now it was very difficult because before the surgery there was a lot of back and forth we were going to the hospitals the test and and all kinds of test and that really got my wife very tired and uh during the surgery she was very tired one of my son was sons was supposed to come and help her the first one they tried to get the visa to go to Turkey they gave him the Visa in November but they told him that he could only get two turkey in about on the 18th of December uh the surgery was supposed to be on the 25th of December uh the one who was in France he tried but he couldn't get the visa but glory to God my son who is in the United States my my my son inlaw he came to my rescue he came the day of the surgery that night he needed his presence because my wife was really tired he helped me in a lot of things to to walk again but the most important thing is today I can also meet you on this side of Eternity may let his name be blessed be I I I couldn't stay in brazaville because there was a lot of work I thought about coming here so I can rest a little bit and by the grace of God I feel a little bit a lot better so I can do something for God so then let's stand so we can read the word of God First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 15 excuse me now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither that corruption inherit incorruption may the Lord bless the reading of his word and may have your seats the subject I would like to to to speak on tonight is our true being our true being because at the light of the revealed message in this uh Dark Age that that of confusion that we are living in the revealed word has told us of what we are made of as human being what we are made of a human being is a Triumph Triumph being I'm just going to introduce my subject I I can also just stop at the in introduction we believe that we are all at the end time the the the uh Global uh uh events are showing us that we are living in the end time we're living at the time where man history will come to an end because God has to enter in the on scene all those mod events are showing the same thing there's inumerable signs that are flashing out throughout the world showing that there's no more time you can see the the just uh uh uh um evil of around us criminality you look criminality Satanism is being expanded everywhere the the uh man being deprived of morals and the the social media uh gay marriage and all those things in observing the group that received the evening light the message that's being preached over the pulpit by Brother David it it it looks like in this time the message and the messenger they almost look like a failure everyone that's come in contact with the message they've come to the realization that the message is true and Powerful but with the time that's going by it seems like as time go by people are looking at the message and the me Messenger as a failure there is all kinds of question mark in people mind in people that are not focusing to the message that's been given we have seen Great Men of God stand up and turn their backs and say that the prophet is not true Prophet they have seen a contradiction in the message that was brought to us by the pillar of fire the this message that was Vindicated by by the supernatural that's never been seen before and other things a time of multiplication of doctrines throughout the world and that's why I would like to speak on our true being there were so many interpret particular interpretation of the message I don't know how it was happening on this end but to us many they've brought things in that the second coming had already happened in 63 others were already in millenniums with the message leadership and the spirit of leadership with a lot of uh Pride it went throughout all the nations and these things have have brought a lot of Believers to become cold and they have returned to the things that they had once vomited brothers and sisters brother Bram says it's Satan that is trying to do his best so we can fail but never the L the predestinated SE that the elected of God will never be will never be uh uh uh uh uh deceived standing because God said that we will never be deceived then with all this confusion it seems like we are being conquered but don't worry about it the prophet says it's always in a weakness in the weakest moment it's that's when God comes on the scene for something that he prepared before and says in the end time evangelism paragraph 22 says this it's always in them weakest moments when it looks like the true message and this message is the true message regardless of whatever state you find yourself believe me this message is the true message those that go away from it that say that it's not a true message did did that what else can they propose to us if you leave this message where are you going to go what is better than this message that's going to touch your heart this message is the cap Stone says when when it seems like that the true message is about defeated that's when God steps in he let the message and the messenger get to the end of the road see [Music] then then he comes on he comes in and he rides on the W high on the waves that's right we can see that in the Old Testament Moses was a great messenger he was a great a really great messenger he had signs and wonders follow him in Egypt but when they came out when they come to the the at the at the start of the Red Sea Moses looked like he was defeated the the army of the Egypt was in the back a hill to the right a mountain to the left before the sea and the mockers dayon and cor was saying to each other where are you taking us let's go and and and give ourselves back in we're going to go back and just go back to Egypt where are we going to go now says it's when you come to the end that that's when God comes on the scene and when God came on the scene as Moses was working with God Moses pronounced the word he said these Egyptians that you see now you shall see them no more it was by inspiration because God had to come on the scene for something that he had already prepared he he hit the water with the S and the water opened up the the markers were surprised the markers in this age they will be the same there will be there will be the message will create a way but there's a lot of testimonies in the Old Testament the three young Hebrews before the fire they were convincing them so they can deny their faith you're going to die young what is it for you but they were convinced when you are convinced and you are concerned you're never going to fear anything because our God will always be with you the prophet of God said according to the voice that spoke at the river in 1933 the voice said this message will will will will will introduce Jesus Christ to the world this message was sent to to introduce Jesus Christ to the world that he will take us to Christ because the same way that John the Baptist was was was send to uh prepare the way for the first coming this message also has to prepare us for the coming of the Lord and I believe that the predestinated seed regardless of what's happening to the left or right will hold on to the message even if everything seems to come to an end she will always hold on to the message and we'll go to uh we'll go for back uh we'll go forward regardless in the message the absolute paragraph 163 the prophet will say oh I remember when he came there in the light when I was standing in the river in 1933 in June he said as John the Baptist was sent to prepare the first coming of Jesus of the first coming the first coming of Christ I am sending you with a message for the world to announce and to prepare the second coming of Christ this message is sent to the world when the message is preached is announcing and preparing the second coming of Christ and he went in the world in the whole world and the fire of Revival were were L for 15 years at every Mountain uh Divine Healing all over the Nations and the power and the restoration and now I believe that it's ready to bring us to the the the the the the point of what he was sent for to produce the faith that will take away the church this message is at the at the point to bring uh to bring us to the uh the the the culminating moment to produce the faith that will take the church to Glory that's the truth it's in it's in the message we are really at the end time I believe this is what the the the the elected are standing on not everything that's been added to the message but the true message look at this this Divine message is not preached to the flesh FH because the flesh has nothing to do with the kingdom of God the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God but it's unfortunate my friends that in churches that everything is centered around the programs to Rejoice the flesh instead of bringing the people of God in the presence of a holy God in there are in many churches a program of entertainment of all kinds a con concert where people dance like in the world our God is sacred and in sanctuary and in a place like we are gathered here we we have to reflect the sacredness of God of the god that we are serving but today there's no sacredness even in the worship we are no longer worshiping in spirit and people like a lot of movement let me tell you this when this message came to us I received it I received it in 1980 it was based upon the uh the the soon coming of Christ all the listeners of the message in in the assemblies they were in the true expectation as the word was being preached you will see that people were connected directly to the mouth that was speaking to them everyone was pressings to come to church early so they can hear it it it would that would it was calling forth for an atmosphere that was sacred and everyone had the fear of God that was visible to the point where uh the the the the urgency was palpable everyone was waiting for the coming of the Lord when he will come you you would people will run away even from the very smell of sin they would run away from it but today people they stay on the smartphone till late at night uh forgetting that they're going to go to work uh in that time the the true love was was animated in every believer they were they had an attentiveness towards one another regardless of race or color they were calling we will call us calling themselves beloved in the true sense of the word when they will say beloved it was coming from the heart and when we were greeting one another and they were hugging one another there was the feeling you would feel that they will love one another even if were meeting for the first time but the moment you saw someone with a a message in hand our hearts were filled with love oh my precious brother but it's not like that today things have changed in that time people were burning they were burning to meet Jesus Christ they were burning to be like Jesus Christ and those that were in need among the Believers they were they were taken care of unconditionally not not by uh uh uh you must but it was by love the the the the the feeling of compassion that was deep it was it was motivating sons and daughters in the in the Gathering and then the the the the the uh salvations of the souls our our our true being the the salvation of the souls and and the soul and our soul is our true being is the one that that takes the most important place in our life we will try to bring everybody to see the message that we had received why in that time we were receiving the word directly from our theophany and I believe that the time has come because our God the Alpha and the Omega is the alha and Omega but there's nothing between the two you understand what I'm trying to say that time that we were living in we are trying we are hoping to relieve that life that time because that God that God is the beginning and the end and follow me my friends uh in our days we can uh realize that in our daily lives as Christians we we pay little attention to our true being we're not taking care of him but we as even as we know that this body that we are living in is only worth uh 85 cents this this body that we are living in but we are true us as invisible we are we are communicating but we have never seen one another I'm speaking to you you understand I'm speaking to you you are looking at the envelope that's containing me but you are not looking at me you see my body but you are not seeing the real me if this body falls here you're going to say brother Raphael is gone let's take his body let's take his body but where am I take his body and take it to the funeral you see my hand it's my hand but my me who am I I see you I see your your bodies but who are you a spirit we take uh very little care of our true being that's why my brother my sister if this life is real as we are together here if it's real then life must be serious we have to approach it with a lot of seriousness and and knowing all [Music] together that uh uh uh death and the tomb is not the purpose of our Liv because you are dust and you shall return to dust that was never a a a word that was preached to a true being it was not that word was not spoken to the soul but it was spoken to the flesh that's why this is the message of the seventh angel to you the elect the prophet says you are you are a spiritual you are a spiritual union with the Bri with a bride with a bridegroom by the word by the word the word has to take the most important place in our lives he says you that are dead to your old husband you are born again there's no way to try to bring him up is dead if you are a Christian born again this little germ that's predestinated in you it's word upon word a word upon word until it comes to the Statue of of of the of Christ it said don't worry about your weakness hold on to the word add word upon word word upon word because you are a seed you have to produce you have to come to maturity it's not your Affair your Affair it's to eat the word it's to drink and drink until the fruit comes forth that's true in a in a manner for him to come and take the bride I believe it's time for us to develop our true being it's a time where we have to develop our true being because there's a true Union that's being established between Christ and his bride because the time is at hand will soon go and I believe as men of God now we have to work a lot more to the progress of the uh the the the uh uh internal being and and to uh uh take away our Believers to move them away from all kinds of distractions they they have come into the churches for after them to distract people there's a lot of Destruction that that have come into the church to excite the flesh the church is a sanctuary of God the the the flesh cannot take the first place Holiness has to appear by the word the prophet shows us something it says the the same man the same man with the same uh brain and the same uh uh faculty that he's had for for 6,000 years the same type of man using the same tools that has been on Earth for all this time this man this man is realizing or is building things uh uh that are amazing he's making a lot of progress he's making a lot of H scientific exploits that we can that we could could have never imagined a 100 years ago the the world has got as has known a lot of progress a lot of progress since a 100 years ago I'm not scientific I'm not in the Civilized world the new technology with artificial intelligence it's making things uh that men can never could have never done a 100 years ago I was in Turkey they they put something on my my body on my hand for 10 minutes so they can clear the the uh the the arteries in my heart the uh blood vessels in my heart we couldn't have we could have never imagined that 100 years ago I saw two days ago the taxis in China without drivers a lot of cars you call them it comes if they take you you sit down you by yourself in the car it takes you to your destination and it's going to go to Europe soon it's those are things 100 years ago you can never imagine them the the the the scientific world is progressing at a high speed but in the spiritual World there are no progress with the Believers and the people listen to The Prophet God keep his word God keeps his word paragraph 30 and then the pental came with the restoration of gifts and you spoke in tongue and you have made it a Doctrine what happened your light was was put out what's the problem because you didn't hold on to the word God does something for somebody he feels like he's in heaven that he's the best H others don't have anything and people have to have what he has and it stops right there God cannot go forward like that when God gives you say thank you you wait on the again he's going to give again he's going to give again that's how you progress that when there's a movement of God in the church all the others are false it's us that have the Revelation then let everybody look at us you cannot go forward like that we cannot limit God to just our church God is is unlimited and his power is unlimited if we can remain quiet he will do more says the word of God develop itself and we have to develop as the word of God is developing do you believe that it's a prophet as the time time is coming forth science is developing is that true if the natural world and man is the same man who who he was 6,000 years ago when God created him he has the same intellectual capacity he has the same intellect he the same man he was thousands of years ago with the same uh five senses but look at the progress that he's made towards the last 50 years he doesn't stop at the phone at the telephone with with telephone that we had was our he continued to develop he continued to develop he he doesn't stop like us the religious when we have gift we stop at the gift when we have prophecy we have the prophecy everybody has to talk about it that's not it don't limit God those are gifts but it's not God but if we can have the giver he's going to give us more paragraph 31 look at this Fallen Son of God had done he invented uh uh automobiles he invented radio the the lights the atomic bombs and and and and and and react rea doors look at at what speed the the the the pages of science are moving rapidly oh if the Sons and Daughters of God will only give themselves to God if they will only wait upon God he will take care of developing Us in revealing himself more to us but we are holding on to a a an old dogma of the church and to stay [Music] there when God wants to develop the word we are living in the end in the end days we are living in a Time where the Magnificent Church of God has to stand for shining as the Lady of the Valley but us we have stayed behind oh I belong to the Presbyterian I'm a Methodist P this I'm that says what shame name we have to be developed the spirit of God is is pouring itself we have to be we have to have been developed to where the spirit of God is Flowing not just an anointing for us to jump and Shout just not just baptism but from baptism to baptism and we become stable and mature and with weight not just a revelation oh the just shall live by faith all sanctification all the the the gift of holy ghost from Revelation to Revelation from power to power from glory to glory that we may be at the end of the road ready for the Rapture but we are holding ourselves back to the this old story and saying oh we are always going backwards let's go forth this Hebrews were saying and listen we are well fed even even if we are working hard we have what we have garlic we have garlic let's be happy with it we have the spirit we speak in tongue what else do you want we want the giver we want the giver is the perfect love it's the relations that are flowing my brother my sister says Moses had a revelation and today had a revelation Moses was in the presence of God he had something [Music] else he came to show them he returned to show them that the same God who existed thousand years ago was the same was always the same that he he he brought forth signs and wonders before them to show them that he was always the same and he said that the message and the messenger they are one we cannot believe William Bram and not consider everything that God did with [Music] him that's what holds Us in the the the unshakable faith today anyone can come within interpretation and they want they want people to follow them what does he have as an Evidence what does he have as a Vindication that God is work now even if he has signs and wonders following him that's not the evidence the evidence is the holding forth to the prophet of the hour oh blessed be the name of the Lord it's the same yesterday today and forever dispensation will change time will change people will change but God remains that's why stay with this message regardless of what happens that you may understand or not understand stay with the message he has to be the same every time his word word is the the Eternal truth he cannot move to the left to the right of it he has to remain the same my my my dear friend brothers and sisters we we we we we realize in this and time and days that denominations modern churches even uh uh uh message churches they have adopted a social gospel that is putting an emphasis on the flesh where the value is only 85 cents 84 when you have the body in in in in its powder form it's not even a spoonful and what does the prophet say what for for this thing that has no significant this body that is not even a dollar we are ready to do anything we we dress it with very expensive clothes yeah we put a coat on with that's over hundred something dollars that's the prophet speaking we put a fur c on it that's worth thousands hundreds of dollars we we put a hat on it that cost a lot of money and when we put it on we want everybody to look at it cume SMY we put a a smokey suit on it millions of dollars and shoes when you wear it you walk you want everybody to look at it it just gives uh Pride for nothing but you are not even worth anything for the 84 we build honorable Church uh houses that we are pride of proud of me I have this house in this city we buy cars that is feeding our egos when I par everybody looks at me that's the flesh that is not your true being we are talking about your true being on what what does that true being really has need of we accumulate a lot of material things a lot of money that we are taking care of uh with uh uh selfishly we are uh taking care of self selfishly when around us our brothers and sisters they see our old parents they they are they have to work so they can even get more tired parents they work for you they they rais you up they they change you to school they have 75 80 years old you you still want them to go to work I see them in Walmart old people there he has to work he's been abandoned by his children with that money what are you doing with it if you cannot help your own parents how are you going to help a brother or a sister that is not even from your origin we are Christians see the Christians of the other time that it doesn't change if Jesus is the same Christianity is the same if in the time that we're taking care of one another if Jesus is the same we'll do the same thing your your own parents you're not taking care of them WM you let them at Walmart in cious Pharmacy tired and he's there working it's it's even painful to see them at home I believe that Christianity is another thing if we can live for others how much more for our own parents sometimes they live in a uh uh without anything no help but you have millions in house you have in the bank but you don't want to help them it's for you and when you die they are those that they have economies for their dogs let's stand I didn't touch my subject I just wanted to introduce it so we can speak on it next time listen my brothers let's let's know this that our true being has to be our most important thing from now on our true being has nothing to do with all this material that will perish we have to give it its place a true being it has no need for a lot of noise you you can remagine the president of United States sitting here you you start jumping and and shouting around him you won't do that but our God is more than the president of the United States is a sacred God and here is a sanctuary it has to reflect it has to reflect the fear of god let's bow our heads oh oh I love I love him let's sing that I love him I love him I

how much more should the bride of Christ be changing into his image and being molded and the only way that comes by is God's provided way for the age it's going to be by the voice of Malachi 4:5 that this bride is changed into his image and I I love the caution of the Holy Spirit saying don't stop yes sir if God does something great if he moves on the scene if there's something wonderful keep going sir keep going it it might be good to to to rejoice in the things that God has done but the prophet of God over and over cautioned us man has always looking at what God has has done he's looking forward to what he's going to do but what is he doing right now he's molding you he's changing you he under Glory under Glory I just think that was just marvelous I needed that Lord Lord help me I I
