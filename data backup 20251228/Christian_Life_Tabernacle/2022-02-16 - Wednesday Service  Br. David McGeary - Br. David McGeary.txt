clear vision and rest in peace we ask these things this evening because we've come to worship you and hear from you father we just asked again that you would bless every need of the people in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles let's open up to the gospel of saint john the 11th chapter and we just want to read a verse here and it says of course in the 24th verse of john 11 this is martha's response and to jesus and and jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth without this amen may the lord add his blessing to the word you may be seated tonight we are going to continue our little study going forward out of the message the rising of the sun and so we're going to listen to another 20 minutes but i'd like to approach this in a a way of thinking you know you can always go back and listen to this message over and over again is just wonderful but i thought of a little uh a part of the approach to this is brother ben makes this statement he says i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from dead and we also raised from the dead we for we were in him and i'd like to just approach this little portion if you could uh get your mindset in this way and i call call it the reading of the benefits now normally when you have a reading of a will or of the benefits it's because somebody has passed on and therefore you become the beneficiary or someone who receives the benefits or receive something and increase to improve your life or something something that's handed down for the purpose of keeping things going like they might uh you know keep the blessings to the family going maybe they pass down a house or they pass down a car it's just kind of a way of keeping things going but those benefits only come after death our benefits are just the opposite they come after life so these are not death benefits if you have an insurance policy that you have benefits and a life insurance policy but it's not really a life insurance policy it's a death benefit policy so the benefits come at the end of life but this benefits came at the beginning of life so they're they're not they're they're not hand-me-down benefits they're not benefits that are only for a uh a period of time maybe just the time that you have left and they're dispersed but but these are eternal benefits right and so it makes it it makes it so a wonderful so uh and he and we're gonna listen so we're gonna talk a little bit this time not after we listen but point out a few things before we listen and i know that that the message will speak to each one of you but as we listen to this we want to understand the whole concept of what he did gave us something that there's something there for us to receive there's benefits and that that's what we don't want to miss it's not an acknowledgement of an event or it's not an acknowledgement of something that he did is not sitting back and saying oh he rose from the dead and that's what he said that the that when he broke that easter seal or death what death did it it sealed us away when you think of death that person's life is over there they're sealed everything what they have done is is finished at that time and so you look at it like it puts a seal on it and there's that person's life it's been sealed up by death it's over every his record now is sealed and and there's there's no more to be written right no more to be done and then he gives his benefits down but this seal it it it broke something that nobody ever saw everybody watched people go down and watch their lives be over and watch their lives be over and because their life was over the only benefit they could give you is what was left over from their life you know and and it's like uh those of us that are older like now that you know i i have things and at 72 years old you get to the place i'm sure some of you are heading there i don't see many of you but but you don't want no more stuff you know and so now you know my mother she'll be hundred years old i think the 25th of july she'll be 100 i believe and and we're kind of wondering well who wants this and who wants that i don't want any of it i'm not like a boat pitcher you know but i don't need any more stuff you know what i mean so it'll just it'll just go down but it's if you understand that this seal what death has always been it's been the end of that person's story okay that their story's over it's been that way for everybody for all time if it's been that the story's been written and what things they have their inheritance is passed out amongst the the kids and the grandkids and it's all spread out and then that life is sealed away but because this seal was not the end of life it was the start of life and so the seal was broken and he said and and we'll read it i'd just like to read it to us he said now he said so he says now the true easter seal on this sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed so good that so now when he broke the seal of death now we knew that there was life after death so he proved that there was life after death the secret of that there is life after death but we could know the fact that there's life after death but that's not what we're looking for we want to look for the benefits what who's the beneficiary because the seal was broken now there's benefits from it and that's what we want to look as we re listen to this next 20 minutes it's like the prophet's reading the benefits of the breaking of the easter seal because this seal is broken there's benefits to you there's benefits to you this is what'll happen because after one of the benefits you'll listen to them say was that every predestinated seed would come to life what a benefit in other words it's not going to pass you by and then again he makes this statement he said so he's talking about as we pick it up he'll be talking about this seal he says so we now he knew we knew that the secret of life after death is there because here's a man that lived as we did and died as we do and now he's alive and he goes on to say so he says he said when he come forth on that morning because i live you live also not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection but all those seeds that was resting in god's great promise was the benefactors of the resurrection so that's what we want to listen to this evening what are my personal benefits from jesus raising from the dead now if if it's in the natural you have to be written in the will well this is what he's going to point out here you were written in the benefits of the resurrection your name was there so you're a ben you're a benefit a beneficiary so you can lay claim to what's yours that's right and i i am and so we're going to listen but so so we understand now that we're there there were benefits he says because ye live because i live you shall live also that was the breaking of the seal that was the breaking not just that there's life after death that's like a fact but the breaking of the seal was because i live you live also so if you really believe that he's risen and he really is then you can understand because he lives i am going to live also we're not waiting that's right and worrying that's right we're already sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and then he so we're he'll talk about this benefit and and then who the beneficiaries are the ones who's predestinated the ones whose names written on the lamb's book of life and we you need to sit back and go that's me that's me i'm there that's who i am he revealed to me that my name's in there so if he's revealed to you that your name's on the lamb's book of life then you're entitled to know what your benefits are so he's we're just talking about the benefits and this little section and it goes on and that and so he says and he'll make this statement and you'll hear it he says he come to redeem or bring to life those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their names on the book of life so that's who's that's who is in the beneficiary policy of not death but of life and and he goes he says and here they are on earth without hope and he come not only to be a blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed okay so now that's the benefits he's going to share the benefits what what what did he benefit by rising what was the benefits because i live you live also so as we listen to this i think of it kind of like of the seal being opened what we might consider in the natural is is the will being open but it's not the will of death this is the will of life so these aren't death benefits these are life benefits and he says to share with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on earth and also germatized no matter how long it is kept in darkness it comes forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he come to share it with us so there's something he wants to share yes sir you know so he's telling us guys this is like kind of a prelude you know he's reading it open to us now it's going to start opening to us the benefits of the of the will of life the will of life i like that the beneficiaries of life and then we'll talk he'll talk a little bit about how that you receive uh those benefits he and he says here this is you'll notice it on paragraph ac60 he says now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this so we draw benefits from what he did but now how do you go about drawing the benefits how do you get the benefits so he's going to tell you they're there but how do you get them how do i tap in to get these benefits and i i thought this was a marvelous little secret as he'll share it with us he'll say he says we also share resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we can cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to so that that's how you draw it's not by word it's by proving that he's alive is how that you draw the benefits by proving to the world that he he's he's alive that's how we draw from these benefits is it they are proving his life uh in us now and that's what i thought just thought that was uh just a tremendous thing and so there are just a few things to look at it as as you we listen to this next 20 minutes take it personal this is not a recorded sermon of brother branham that is something that he talked about long ago once you understand the revelation of the storehouse that this was laid up for you personally for a certain time we we understand that right many times people have uh trust funds and they have uh inheritances and they'll say this person can't receive it until they become 18. it's laying there all the time right but there's a time frame in which this benefit is going to come forth how does god distribute his benefits by revelation amen by revealing to you that this benefit is now available to you so it's it's different in just reading uh reading the benefits and and and just saying that they're there but what's different is when it's revealed to you that now is your time to take possession of that benefit yes sir that's right so that's why healing you can read about healing and you know that he's a healer and you know that it's written in there and you believe it's in there but the difference of it is when it's revealed to you that you know it's a benefit because you believe god's a healer but now you he reveals to you it's time for you to take possession of the benefit and prove to the world that he's alive amen and it it changes because the we all know the thinking of man has gone mad and and so he gave us some advice he said let this mind be in you that was in christ so he went to calvary not for himself but for us he didn't nobody took his life from him he laid it down to break the seal to prove to you that there's life after death and because i live you shall live also and not taste death and all the other benefits that come with it so he's going to describe who the beneficiaries are what the benefits are and how that we lay hold of the benefits and and so when we listen to it let's listen to it beyond just oh this is one of the sermons and we're studying the sermon if you could listen to it like he is here how many knows he's here why is he here because i feel him no he's here because he promised to be here and what does he possess he possesses all the benefits of what a man possesses when he's able to overcome death helen the great what what's the final end of sickness death so if you can overcome the final result then you've overcome the sickness okay and now we're sitting there and he's done that at the end so we're starting to approach okay what's happening this evening god sent the beneficiary reader he sent the revealer to reveal to everybody whose name is written on the lamb's book of life what the benefits are of the resurrection now those of you who have studied this we're stopping tonight right before the wave offering but you've got to understand the idea of showing the benefits before you can understand the purpose of the wave offering so okay i i just hope that you enjoy we were going to play 30 minutes but there was so much in this 20 minutes that i thought let's just take some time let's feed on it let's feast on it we're believers in this message it's what we are you know what i mean we're not trying to come up with a new spirit we're not trying to come up with a new approach we are trying to feast on the revealed word of god this by playing this we all are receiving equally there's no big eyes no little ears our young people are are the youngest person i don't care if you're 11 12 10 9 you can hear the word of god and and be blessed and so this evening let's just uh take a few moments these next 20 minutes and we'll listen to the word of god let's pray as we go forward and and you just listen and study and read along and take notes and absorb in what he's saying listen to every line every verse and just and and just suck this word up into your spirit that he is speaking to me about my benefits and i'm going to have to identify myself as a recipient and then i have to pray and take possession of my benefits our gracious heavenly father lord i just believe at such a time with the turmoil that's laying ahead of us in the world lord people are are afraid they won't be able to heat their homes they they're afraid that there's not going to be supply for this or supply for that father but one of our benefits is that the righteous shall never beg bread lord we don't worry about those things but we want to just ask you to speak to us and place us in the word place each one of us personally in our place in the word of god and speak to us each individually that we might know that you're talking to us personally and as an individual telling us of all the benefits of the life policy when you broke that seal and came out of that grave there were benefits and you wanted to share them with every true believer father what are they how do i get them open my eyes give me i said that i might see father that i can really prove to the world that these benefits are real and draw from them we ask it tonight in jesus name we pray amen god bless you enjoy the word now today we have a tuberculosis easter seal people send a message one to the other and to support this great uh fun or drive for the doctors and medical science to work upon uh something to retire or to help the tuberculosis they are sealed what we call an easter seal when we send message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken because the seal is what's got a message bound on the inside and now the true easter seal on this sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world uh grouped in darkness groped around man suspicion theories was among man's heart traditions made up man worshiped idols they worshipped the son they worshipped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and alive and he said when he come forth on that morning because i live you live also not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection but all those seed that was resting in god's great promise was a benefactor of that resurrection to life because he said because i live amen ye shall live also that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that's in christ be brought up with him at this glorious sunrise god has proven or vindicated his word all the glooms and doubt that have moved in people's minds was taken away because here was he who once lived eat drink and fellowship with mankind that said i have power to lay my life down i have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made the statement but he proved it to be the truth oh what a glorious thing that is i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from the dead while we were in him notice now as the gloom covered the earth and the seeds cannot live without the s-u into her eyes and plume had covered the earth and now the s-o-n was risen and all gloom was banished by this light as it spread across of the nations to the people that he is not here but he has risen what uh what a statement he had proved his word he had proved it be to be true for he had now conquered death hell and the grave the trinity of the devil death hell and the grave for satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hell and also the grave and that was the trinity of satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go up the grave and being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the trinity of satan which was death that had helped man in captivity all these years but now the true trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and it broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore had the keys of death and hell god in one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and it proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and at the trinity of god was made known because only god alone had power to bring life back again he was that emmanuel god had been manifested in the flesh no wonder he could claim there matthew the 27th chapter all powers in heaven earth is given into my hand i send you to be my witnesses to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and caught out triumph with all the power in heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the holy ghost and all that there ever was what's in him all powers in heaven and earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples just believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore i have the keys to step in hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every for our deen predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained to do he is raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is i am alive or quickened the word means the word quicken the greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rock every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seat has to come forth again he was quickened not only that and will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there ye will be also in luke 24 chapter 49 first he said behold i send the promise of the father upon you but terry are waiting in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from ohio to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that god came before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated thief now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also dramatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he come to share it with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news was if a man died for our sake that's good news if christ was born that's good news but never a news never was there news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise and he's alive forevermore and had the keys to both death and hell in his hands all the gloom was shook away there was no more gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave there was no oh he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel good news notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead and i'll meet with them to confirm this to them oh god how in this last days there shall be light again across here i'll prove to my disciples don't tell them that i am not dead and i'm not a tradition but i am a living christ amen i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we as beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life he never was a life lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living and how can we do it by word only or it is written the gospel can not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he is alive lord now if there is another gospel that paul spoke to one of the groups i am so surprised that you turn to another gospel which is the weather but a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news and because i live you live also and i live in you and the works that i do john 14 12 the works that i do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be life at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we has been a fisher we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it for some traditional man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has a son has life and if the life of a man is dead be projected in you you will live the same life he is if the blood of a man was a certain type you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of one man into another he'd absolutely be that tight blood and if your spirit that's in you is reconciled and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you romans 8 11 says if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body that same life then pain powers then same beneficiaries that he had your own earth from god he redeemed you a seed that was forward known by god whose names was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and that gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was a crisis because he proves what he talks about how i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised that he talks about amen that is the identification that we are of beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he's talked about what he promised to do in christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved him what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it in all the days of the proposal he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to god again oh what a message a easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in christ at his crucifixion they were ending at his resurrection we are of his beneficiaries quicken after being dead in darkness in a darkened world of unbelief or churches and denominations and so forth have brought us out and there's something in us calling old we want god we're hundred and thirsty for god we joined the methodist baptist pentecostals presbyterians what more still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all others couldn't while we was groping in darkness a great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of god like he was the manifestation of the promised word of god i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption amen he manifested in every word of god that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on the easter morning ah them who were once groping in darkness and wandering around if they should wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules all those things passed away well that was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man-made reason there had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again when they say that jesus christ is deceit yesterday forever that his power isn't the same that his gospel isn't the same when the bible says it's the same god's desire for denomination ever creeds and he moves forward with his holy spirit as he promised has proved it to us that he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quicken after being dead in the world and sin and trespasses he is quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus his brain is spirit brings his same life again on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ the body the anointed bloody if the spirit of god anointed that body in such a way that when that seed fell into the earth he just wouldn't let him rest there no no he quickly raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you he'll also raise you up okay so did you you see who the beneficiaries were did you see there was benefits so now you can start to see what that he's telling the people is that all these benefits of the resurrection have been hid from us by traditions of man and dogmas and false teachings and organizations and all these things and now so there's something that is coming to restore back the benefits now listen this this statement i i just thought that we take this statement and he said i will not see my holy one see corruption but when you start looking at in the context he's saying like he was the manifestation of the promised word of god i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to seek corruption he manifested it every word of god that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on easter morning so if he proved that right and he just got saying one of our benefits is that we were in him he will not leave you in hell you will not be eternal separated from god you will not be in the grave so now he says it he says that if you believeth in me you shall never die well now our messenger comes by and he gives us a vision of beyond the curtain of time and he sees all those saints living not falling not in darkness but alive now if and i i i don't want to jump ahead but he's talking he's starting to talk about this beneficiary power the works that i do you should how that's been hid from us how that's the benefit how that that life's in us he proved it well we are by his see exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature so he sends somebody who is a sinner just like we were comes out and feasts on the true word of god and manifest back to us that same life that was in christ the same resurrection and he's revealing it to us so he can prove to us that those benefits of the resurrection are still here for us to lay hold on we're not looking back we're looking forward we've just got to get to the place where we understand that this is a restoration message it isn't the malachi is not fulfilled until the faith of the fathers is in you do you understand that's what proves it you can't say oh brother branham came and fulfilled malachi 4 5 no brother branham is the prophet of malachi 4 5. you are the fulfillment of it you are the word made flesh and that's what he's talking about he said everything that was promised of me got proved right so if everything that was promised of him was proved everything that was promised of jesus was proved then everything that was promised of you has to be proved also right we could just jump right into proving his word how he predestinates the believer there to prove that his word is true oh i just think it's a thrilling so he's opening to us the benef beneficiary package of everything that was in the resurrection and showing us is still alive and still real and still there for you and you can have it and now we just got to start building that up so i thought he alluded to in here very beautifully how he tied the commission of going in to all the world and preaching the gospel is what ignites if i could say that or stimulates the benefits that are in you yes sir so if you lay dormant then you don't you don't partake of those benefits but when you carry out the commission it automatically stimulates that life in you and brings it there because he's going to prove what you're testifying to is true so we'll just leave it there tonight and now the words that we're saying this is because now you can look forward to these meetings and know that the resurrected word by his spirit using human flesh not the man but that god can use that to speak to you and to stimulate and revelate what benefits that you have that you can draw from maybe you're a nervous person maybe you're depressed maybe you're uncertain maybe you wish that certain things were different in your life and certain people in your life were different and and uh you don't understand why things have transpired the way they've transpired you have all kinds of uncertainties the word of god can address all those feelings all those questions he can do exceedingly and abundantly of what you can even ask or think it's not just coming in like i've got this in mind and i've got this in mind and i'm listening for this oh no just listen hear ye him and he'll he'll do something for you everybody here i believe god's got something more for you a blessing a reward a answer to a question a joy a satisfaction okay it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom so you can walk in to these meetings and you could say yeah i've got a lot of things that i didn't do good this week but i'm trusting that they're covered by the blood i confess my sins now i know that he speaks i know that he knows what i have need of and i'm looking forward for him to open up and reveal to me some of the benefits of the resurrection that are there for me and when all those benefits come together it'll take you right out of here amen so you want more of him god bless you let's stand together tonight we'll have brother billy come and close with a song or two and prayer but if you have a need maybe somebody on your heart or a question on your heart and you just want to you know it's there but you want to let
