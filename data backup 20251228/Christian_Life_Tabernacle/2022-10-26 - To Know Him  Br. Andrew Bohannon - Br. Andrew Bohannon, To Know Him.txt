foreign [Music] more than anything and then as you walk that we may Manifest this love and throughout the world Amen who certainly thankful for that amen a reminder there will be a youth meaning this coming Friday for single ages 13 to 30 never been married it's going to be from 6 p.m to 9 00 p.m here at the church amen amen amen tomorrow is a big day a very important day amen I wasn't feeling 100 but I wanted to be here to just make sure that I remind all of you tomorrow is a big day tomorrow is Friday David's birthday and it may not certainly I appreciate him I I was just thinking about it from home and uh I was thinking about all the things that barbano said about a shepherd He said he leads the ship to a pasture and the water it protects his ship from the wild animals it says he guards the ship in the night and in all weathers and he keeps them and and is always with him in fact it says one place that he gets to a place where he smells like a sheep he talks like a sheep and you know we certainly have to be mindful at this times like this that we could certainly just thank God for having a Godly past or one we could certainly say he fills this criteria he leads us to the water you know so many churches today can't even play the message in their churches they they contend with someone coming and telling them what the prophet said and putting together their minds and and what the prophets say and didn't say but to have a pastor who before he could preach it will take what the prophet say so you know before before he can even open his mouth what he actually said I think that's really important that's really something that that is to be commended and I I've always felt like in this congregation we are the most fed of all the people all the churches that there is we receive the word exactly as it was spoken you can hear it and go check it for yourself and found out that's what he said but when I'm says in the message Jehovah of Miracles he says I'm going to skip some of it he says this is a great day because the Lord has made and no doubt many of you in the service this morning you enjoy the wonderful fellowship and and your pastor's message and that's good I'm so glad you did it says it says just remember it says back him up in your prayers it says he's your he's The Shepherd of the flock and the shepherd is is a feeder he's a feeder and then he says so you you back him up in your prayer you support him with everything every in every way that you can and God will keep giving you those messages to him so it's it's it's our support it's a coming together in prayer and doing us and then God will keep giving out those messages with him he says again in another place it says any Shepherd that is interested in getting a sheep with with with with vitamins and those and these are the spiritual vitamins as it was it helps the ship to grow in into stronger Faith In Our God and then it says I appreciate such man Shepherd is always on duty did you know Shepherd of the sheep is with them both day and night someone who's you could you could you could always count on him to be there regardless of what you're going through to know that he's going to be there so I I say this to say you know it's you know as they say it's important to tell someone things when it's still alive then write a whole list when he's dead when he's gone and and say how wonderful it was I think it's important that we appreciate the pastor that God has given us to to appreciate the things that he does for us and and and and all that he puts so we can receive the message so don't forget text him tomorrow you can start at midnight you can start sending your texts wait until 4am for the calls you could text him and just wish him happy birthday and let him know that you're praying for him amen brother writes please pray for my son he's having surgery tomorrow and everything that may go well amen if you have any need and or something that you would like to raise before the Lord just lived to end up to him he certainly sees your heart Amen brother Tim Salah if you could just come and takes his knees before the Lord the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can come amen foreign [Music] [Music] I'm sure it's uh a reflection of the day that we're living in [Music] I think we need to uh [Music] be more appreciative of the time we have to come together [Music] you look around the room I'm going to match you guys but I'm not surrounded every day by this many beautiful people there's a comfort that we get from just coming together there's a blessing to that [Music] you know Peter and John went to the temple there's a man sitting there begging and he said [Music] look on us the man was expecting something from them hey you're gonna put a coin in my bed he said look on us there was benefits and blessings that they can impart to that man and they did he got up and walked [Music] sisters brothers alike children you all have a benefit to somebody else by being here you look at those that come out of Sunday school with a smile on their face the little kids that are doing the bible study on their own different things like that [Music] is quickening something to us I just want to encourage you to stay on the straight and narrow [Music] let's go before the Lord our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord as we've stated Lord just the benefit of coming together in this place the Lord has been set aside Sanctified for this service Lord we worship you and Lord we've come to expect and know that you're going to meet us here Lord lord it's not always done by the way of the supernatural where there's open Miracles and healings speaking in tongues but lord it's something that's done on the inside something by the quickening power of your word Lord imparts eternal life to each one of us and we grow day by day Lord line upon line precept upon precept as your word says Lord may we all benefit from coming to the house of the Lord tonight as we leave this place Lord it will all fill that surely we've been met and our hearts been touched and blessed by coming together foreign Lord we expect your word Lord when it comes forth to answer every question in our hearts Lord and Lord those requests like brother graver's son Lord there's many going this surgery Lord I have family members that are in need I'm sure others Lord have those that have been calling out for a long time but Lord I heard your prophets say this morning thank you [Music] that you allow everything that comes on us something our Lord is for our benefit but Lord we just ask that we can overcome this Lord by Your Word by your will by the way I've answered prayer Lord and it strengthened us Lord it it gives us the courage to stand forth in another day [Music] the Lord we pray us we all combine our faith and lift these things up to you Lord that each need would be meant tonight Lord there be a comfort in our hearts Lord we just want to worship you in spirit in the truth Lord demonstrate yourself before us we pray Lord Lord bless the ties and offerings use it for your honor and glory and truly Lord we want to remember our pastor his wife his family Lord the the ears of Paul and struggle the Lord we pray that you'll be a benefit to him Lord as we walk before you circumspectfully now we ask all these things the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] oh and the blood that Jesus share for me way way back on kind of Glory oh and a blind that gives me strength from day to there it will never learn its power oh foreign [Music] it will never [Music] just sing the course again tonight oh foreign [Music] that gives me strength from day to them it won't ever learned his heart second first oh it's smooth my doubt and calm my feet [Music] and it's right all along my tears that gives me strength from day or today it won't end Hallelujah let your stand and sing it as your fat brother injury

my tears oh and apply that gives me strength from day to there oh we will name oh foreign [Music] oh and it flows to the Lord was fine that gives me strength today it will never lose Hallelujah and we're grateful for the blood it just even though it was shed 2 000 years ago it's still effective it's still in effect today amen we're so grateful for that praise the Lord how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord Jesus God praise God Run Away by our hearts [Music] precious Lord we come to you lord lord we're so needy Lord sometimes uh as I think of what I need Lord it just comes to mind there's so many more things that I'm needy of that I'm unaware of Lord but father it's so good to know you as a father Lord you meet every need oh God to your children Lord and here we are tonight Lord we're helpless and hopeless without you father but Lord we know that there was a blood that was shared oh God and it loosed the promises to us Lord and so tonight father as we Fellowship around your word Lord we just ask God that this can be another time that we can just put our feet under the table and feet at your table Lord Lord that your word would make in us the change that's necessary for us to move forward Lord in your word father we pray your help and guidance as we Lord we're mortal men and women here tonight Lord but we just want to lift up your great name and acknowledge Lord how you making in US Lord a resurrected Savior and Lord It's so wonderful Lord what what a joy it is and an honor Lord that we can stand here we pray God do you take full control this service Lord may your spirit have the right of way in every heart and Lord when we leave here Lord may we say like those who are coming from Emmaus did not our hearts burn as you spoke to us along the way commit our pastor to you and Lord the up-and-coming things Lord we're just we're just entrusting it now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord we appreciate the musicians thank you very much if you have your Bibles and we'll just go into the word of God Lord just put a little thought we won't be long if we go we're going to turn in Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12. in verse 2 it says this says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may be that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen and also over in Genesis chapter 1 . Genesis chapter 1 and verse 11 through 12. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and herbs yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good amen you may have your seeds we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word if we were dismissed tonight and having having had read the word we would be affected and God would have done something for us but I believe God's got more amen you know I was just thinking about a a quote that was read over this past weekend and we just want to try to share a little something about being united with another nature in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ statement was made in paragraph 213 it says that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up until an occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature amen if that's the emphasis that brother branham's pointing out and you know if there's ever an ice have that we might see we want to make this our vision this is a goal that we want to place before us is the old man the old nature every bit of it has to die we can't take any of our past as as good as it might seem you know as as much as it may have benefited us to feel a certain security or to feel a certain benefit the old man and all of its accolades and all of its accomplishments they have to rot away so that this new nature this this nature from the new birth can actually be on display amen isn't that wonderful that you know God's promised to bring forth that in in our lives and you know it's you know I I so appreciate like I think it was said earlier you know how we can come together and you know God has brought us you know he's restored the word and we can have faith in the pure word of God again and you know it it brings like like a Unity you know and that's that's kind of a theme is you know we want to unite not just you know in Fellowship here but each one of us have individually we must Unite with Christ by the way of a new birth you know and and in order for this old nature and this old man to to to you know to die out you know you got to starve him you know it's just hey I get it we're human you know we got to go to school we got work we got things with family and you know what there's a way to go about it but to not feed that nature you know God's given us a blood that you know we're we're in Christ we can die with Christ and yet we don't have to to to you know take that second look Brothers you know uh young people we don't have to uh play that extra video game we don't have to take up the next posting on on uh you know Instagram or whatever those things just to somehow feel better you know there's things that we can do to to just you know I'm going to sacrifice that because I know that God's working something in me renewing me and bringing United me to another nature you know this nature is is an eternal life nature this nature doesn't consume the blessings of God just for myself right the family of God they're not living for themselves they're living for a future day right I heard it said and and I believe it's true eternal life is living for others amen you know that's the only thing really that will be Resurrected is the life we live for others how can we serve God everybody desires to serve God the nominal World wants to serve God you know there's even people in politics and religion they believe they're serving God but they're killing you you see but now we just oh my we're not we're not trying to live our life in a rearview mirror you know we don't want to try to take all of the past successes or failures and try to bring them into our current life because God has created something that's a part of himself in you and me amen I had this experience and before we get into this message I'm going to take some quotes out of the power of transformation but you know I had an experience we did some traveling and you know the Lord allowed us to go to Florida and it was a wonderful trip and I noticed that sometimes and it just spoke to me about sometimes in life you know you have you have obligations you have you know goals to meet you have a job you know they they have goals for you and you have obligations in school you gotta you know have a passing grade used to be 70 was passing I don't know what it is now but you know you have these certain requirements in life and so it puts a pressure on you and it keeps on you and it's like a the hounds of Hell dogging you you know and it's just kind of pooling on you and it constantly is training you but keeping you pressing towards a mark right you got to go ahead of you and so as we were doing some traveling and we were kind of following and it wasn't just me driving and everybody's in one car we're we're carpooling so I noticed that as I'm driving now I'm trying to strategize with traffic and things that are going on around me and I'm trying to over anticipate because I got somebody that's following me you see there's some people that are following your example there's people that are watching your life because your life is an epistle read of all men and so as we realize that God has planted something in us and he's reuniting us with the nature that this life it's an eternal life can be on display because that's the greatest drawing card that this world has is the manifestation of this hour it's not the days of Noah where some man is is building an ark or a replica of the Ark no no this is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4. I will send you you're you're part of that fulfillment I'm part of that fulfillment I'm the you you're the you in that he I'm identified he did this for me he sent Elijah in this end time aren't you happy about that you know you think about the seed that God planted you know within the seed when God was in the beginning in Genesis he was he was there and he said let there be this right let there be that let there be this and let there be that he's so in seed sow in seed and you know as God you know God doesn't get in a hurry like me well I got a deadline and I'm we got to get this done got to get this done but see that's not our God God don't get in a hurry and sometimes I feel in my heart like I'm doing wrong because I'm just trying to squeeze every moment you know trying to be super ultra productive what is that that's being conformed but be not conformed but be transformed by the renewing of your mind how are we going to be uh this transformation is a change from what we were to what God wants us to be what he spoke us to be we are going to be that because nothing can hinder that nothing's going to stop it but God doesn't get in a hurry and so I feel you know sometimes a shame you know because you look how you you get the busyness of life and then all of a sudden you're in the Stream of that channel and you just look like everybody else but we're called to be separated a people that wait on the Lord a people that that you know my God has made provision for me I don't have to fret for tomorrow he holds my tomorrow you know tomorrow's not guaranteed anyway but once you've been born again oh what a hope there's a hope of a a land Beyond this time and this Dimension oh my and I thank God that he gives us a foretaste he gives us a down payment oh bless his name we we have an assurance it's steadfast amen thank God for The Incorruptible seed that's been sown into our hearts amen let my heart be the bedding ground Lord isn't that the Cry Of Your Heart Lord what you said in your word you you'll raise up stones but oh God here am I amen I'm a ready heart I want to see you moving me amen amen it's not just for my neighbor but oh God let it be living out in me amen you know we want to be transformed by the renewing of our mind and you know a lot of times in our normal days you know we rehearse the same thoughts over and over and over again because the devil Works through memory through reasonings for conscience imaginations and is constantly worn against us because it's it's it's almost like it's it's an unpenetrable reality but the only reality that we must live in is the word of God amen the revealed word of this hour and so it takes it takes a washing it takes a dedication you know it takes an Earnest Cry of the heart God you know I'm not satisfied with just enough I want more and God has more you wouldn't be hungering and thirsting tonight for more if there wasn't something to satisfy that deep call ain't that wonderful and it's an inexhaustible Fountain that's right that's the source of life that we're drawing from and you know I don't I don't believe I'll be long but I'm just holding on you know my pastor made a statement that just keeps kind of kind of rehearsing in my heart and mind and and I think it's a good statement he said you know sacrifice what you know to know him and you know a lot of the times you know the things that we think is the things that we've discovered or experienced and we've declared as a truth or a reality but but really I want to know him I don't want to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified and you know the busyness and the goings-on tries to pull us into that channel of to know more about where the world's headed as far as what the next war or the next earthquake or the next this we're human we deal with these thoughts but God is challenging us and telling us where the source of life is and where the renewing comes is in the word of God and I just I'm so grateful you know I want to sacrifice everything else to know him and the power of his resurrection amen and not just the thought of knowing him but to know him the person the person of Truth the person of healing the person of Resurrection because God that's what he does he comes and he he tells you that oh you know I've died for you you know there was this great Chasm and and because of the Fall because of your your your your mother Eve you were lost and there was this great Chasm but but I paid the price I I covered that with my own blood and oh then you receive it you accept it not because oh just so much that you repented but God's word has found you amen God's word has come to you in this end time and he's breathed life into your vessel oh praise God thank the Lord for his goodness you know we're not looking for some outside anointing right we're looking for that inside something to burst forth amen there's something on the inside that God placed within that seed power to transform all it needs is the right atmosphere the water the the seasonal rains come and and it brings forth a crop amen and the certain Sun if you know as we've we've heard that you know when the sun comes up it's kind of low it's that's not really the growing season but when it's at full strength yeah and that's that's the real growing time amen aren't you thankful that you've come in this evening time where the light has come to bring you to life I'm so grateful now the power of transformation brother Branham says this and paragraph 59 he says now we want to be transformed ourselves by the renewing of our mind see not what we have here on this Earth or what we're going to look for on this Earth but what we are coming to in the world to come transformed by the renewing of our mind you know it's it's so easy to get caught up into the things that we can see you know I'm struggling with this you know I I keep going to this and it's it's like a a broken record here I am again this is the same thing and it's like a reoccurring theme I can't seem to get the victory so we're going over but God said that there's there's many things of course that give us overcoming but you know we've got to take up the word upon our lips you know it's not just thinking the word but it's actually speaking the word to this body this old nature you know this Nature has to hear you say I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthened me it's not this same cycle this same cycle because the power of transformation is in the seed it's just waiting for a heart of Faith to speak it and believe it and act in faith let's jump let's jump out in faith because you're the word all the potentials of God are dwelling in you but we don't want to mix that old nature and try to pull God's nature and manufacture something that'll just bring death you know think about what you know David he wanted to do something good for the Lord he was anointed to do the job but it wasn't the will of God for him to do it so praise God we got a perfect will to seek we've got a perfect will that God wants to lead us into each one of our lives in the great composition of the Sheep music every single vessel here every single soul everything everybody has a part to play younger old middle-aged uh woman a man we all have a part to play in this great Symphony amen and it's you know yeah we we know it's you know be a father to the fatherless feed the poor we know that those are things that are attributed with the gospel but we want to go out and and do the will of God not just here in church where we're worshiping thanking God free in the spirit but let the freedom and liberty that we have here tonight let it be a factual when the neighbors are out there and they're I don't know how I'm going to be able to get my car running again yeah I don't either but you know what I know a god you know can we be available can we be willing vessels because see the power to change the situation is lying in a seed form within you to a world that doesn't see what you see by faith the the possibility so grateful that there's something on the inside when everything on the outside looked like it's just coming to Pieces there's something on the inside when we look God's in full control he's not going to lose a one every single promise that he made to you concerning your family concerning your end oh he's going to fulfill it you know I wrestled with plain about 15 minutes of this tape because I'm not a very good read of it you know I just I so appreciate um God being the example you know the scripture says in John 13 and 7 he says Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter well I'm so grateful that a lot of the times what God has done for us we don't know at the moment that he's doing it don't you find that to be the case in your life a lot of times God's done some things for you and we don't realize it but let's let's get ours our tuning fork on yeah and let's start recognizing God is doing what he promised he said that he would Purge you of all your iniquity right he paid the price and and so let's not lower the standard even if what we're looking at in the mirror doesn't line up but let's not let that lower our confession because what God planted it will come to manifestation God can't fail and he can't lie and he sowed The Incorruptible seed and it must come forth amen you know he's in John you know he says that and that's our wonderful communion scripture in it it's just amazing you know he wanted to commune with them on what he was doing God wants to commune with us what he's doing in our lives he's cleansing us he's he's renewing our mind he's he's preparing us and conditioning us that he can manifest himself in each one of us to our father to our mother to our brother to our children oh my but there's this old man that needs to be renewed we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind the scripture admonishes don't be so soon shaken in mind right we have the thing that brings the stabilizers the word of God you know in this message power of transformation brother Branham makes this statement in verse or in paragraph 40 he says I'm 41. but dear friends I'm not a young like I like you all this morning but I'm old and I've been through many hard battles see and by going through these hard battles brings you where you are this morning I'm sure you understand that God has put me through it that my life might open up a way to say this is it see then you all have run over that road and before me there was someone who opened the way for me to go and when we opened the road one for another you see as you see sometimes these old veterans getting old and his his marks all over him Paul said in one time I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ you see how Timothy looked upon those I guess with reverence as he committed young Timothy I just I think about you know we know who that one that was the example to brother Branham and that was our Lord Jesus Christ and he's he was not only the messenger but he he was the message he he declared the very Life of Christ that had come to maturity amen and so I'm so grateful that someone who would who would lay their life down that Christ might pick it up and express his own very nature amen isn't that wonderful that we have the same promise to to to be reunited with divine nature what a privileged people you know there's people when you get down going down the road and they're driving 90 miles an hour where are they going well they just turned on the stop sign and then they're at the convenience store what are they in the hurry for there's there's an anointing there's a press upon the people you know the scripture says they drive to and fro but yet we have the word of God my my and to think that so many have laid their life down for this gospel you know and and I like I I certainly would agree with what brother Billy said about our pastor you know there's there's marks of the Lord amen and so I'm so grateful that you know he hasn't lifted up a Ministry he hasn't lifted up a man he's lifted up the word amen so that's what I want to do in my life and honoring of a man that's that's has scars that's been battle trained you know there's there's sufferings that we go through there's misunderstandings there's hardships there's things that we bear but we take our position amen we know God can do Supernatural but when we've received the new birth and the promise of a life forever if if God doesn't supernaturally heal my body I still have the promise that he would never lead me never forsake me he will be with me even in me to the very end well he said he would give me the grace to bear and I'm trusting in his word because he can't lie Lord renew my mind let me see this the right way God I need iceap I need healing for my eyes you're a Healer God come take the bedding ground of my heart and let it be that this Lover of My Soul will come give me a renewed Vision renew my mind amen now transforming I used to work at the Public Service Company where we had Transformers the word the word itself means something transforms means something to be changed something that's changed from one thing to another oh my you know sometimes you go so many I don't know how it is with you but you know I gave my heart to Lord in 99 and it's been a journey but sometimes when you get a few years clicked from the time that he's he's made himself so real sometimes you you kind of forget the way that you were your old nature though you still battle it in increments oh my you know even the scripture says all have come short of the glory of God there is going to be no flesh glorified in his presence you know I think it's a great admonition no matter if we've been serving 50 years or five days or five minutes don't put no confidence in the flesh even if I don't feel good even if I'm tired God you made a promise God you're working your will out in my life no matter the hardship no matter the struggle God you're more than able and I'm persuaded that what I've committed to you you're you will keep it unto the day that's where my faith lies is what you promised me not whether you promise somebody else but what you promised me sometimes I wonder if we know what he promised us well we need a renewing of our mind you know when I grew up and this is not to make anything to nobody but you know I was taught I was taught that God did things for those who helped themselves you know if that was the case Jesus Christ wouldn't have had to die did what nobody could do by one man sin entered into Humanity but by one example of obedience to the word Made A Way oh I'm so grateful that he's the way I'm so grateful that there's some seed within us that could humble ourselves to the word of God and the will of God not everybody has this privilege brother Branham gives this wonderful example about the tadpole in paragraph 45 you know you you're transformed from from one species to the next you know the tadpole it it evolves up to the next species the Frog and so in 47 he says renew your mind the things that you once thought to be precious lay that aside and be transformed to something else what you was one time what you are now you know that's a great encouragement you know I I'll stop here for a moment and just give a testimony I love testimonies because testimony is not what I do for God it's what God's done for me you know I the Lord has been so gracious and when I was a young person in high school I I wasn't taught the way of the Lord I I had a conscience what was right and I went against it and so I paid I paid the consequence you know the scripture says you know you'll reap what you sow so I knew there was things I wasn't doing right and so I was associated with the people that we ended up getting into a bad situation and a car wreck and I ended up becoming permanently injured in my back and um you know they call it you know broken back I fractured out L5 S1 a herniated disc in my neck and I was you know I had to hope you know not I'm not a very smart person from the standpoint of book smart and you know being able to read and write and all that kind of stuff so I really didn't put too much of my future towards um education but I put it towards Sports you know I was a golfer and I played baseball well when I was in you know found myself in a car wreck and now I realize that I'm all busted up and they you know they told me hey this is your future is is not going to involve that and so it was a it was a crushing blow and so it sent me into you know hey my mom told me if you're sick go to the doctor and do what they say so that sounded good enough so I went and did what he said or did what she said and the doctors they prescribed medication they gave me you know Vicodin they gave me all these anti-depressants the muscle relax you know they just did what the book told them to do this is the condition do this this is the way to treat this condition and so I was always told and it felt like a death sentence it felt like a prison sentence you'll have this condition there's no cure for it it's permanent you know for somebody who had great Ambitions and goals and really wanted to have a happy future that was a crushing blow and yet you know I I was in that condition for years suffering under that bondage well I just got to take some more medicine and when that didn't work I just had to add a little alcohol and a little bit of this and a little bit of that hey I'm I'm I gotta cope with this that's what they told me you just have to deal with it okay okay but there's something on the inside that was crying out there was something on the inside that had power to transform me from what I was to what he wanted amen I'm so grateful for that because you know you go so long in a condition and you finally just say I've had enough I've had enough I've got to have God so I'm I'm in that condition and you know by the grace of God you know we we suffered more you know it went from bad to worse you know contracted meningitis many many years later and you know God knows how to get to where we we're in a position where it's business this business or his death and there I was and said you know I gotta have a conference and uh you know from my heart I just said Lord you know if you'll let me live and you'll heal me of this condition I'll serve you no more arguments you talk about a renewing of the Mind see that's where I believe God wants us to surrender all of what the old man has to do in it I didn't do nothing to earn what God has given me it is a free gift salvation is a free gift the seed that he planted and all its attributes has nothing to do with our Humanity it has everything to do with the plan of God and I'm so grateful that I was there and I came to that broken place where I got to have God and if if God doesn't show up well there's something that was just I've made peace with God I'm you know what this is not anybody else's fault I made decisions I was given account you know what if your mercy doesn't come here in this condition I'm a goner that's that's the way every day should be huh have we gotten to where we've taken the grace and mercy of God for granted I'm sitting there and the Lord allows me to live and you know by his grace couple months after that I met a man he introduced the message to me and all of a sudden that which was longing in the heart the victory over sin the victory over the old man it became a reality through God's provided Channel God sent a prophet with Supernatural Vindication of his presence you know this is a sign of judgment this is Mercy God came he broke the bonds uh you know I had I had an experience with the Lord I was going to a non-denominational but I didn't have the victory I still played I was still plagued with with lustful thoughts and and pride of life and I was still plagued with doing little besetting things but praise God this message is the pure word of God to transform us to change us into Sons and Daughters of God not to be the old man patched up but to be a new creature in Christ Jesus and I'm so grateful because you know the Lord through a brother introduced me to our pastor and it's just what I had need of you know God loves to do things for his children he I called him on a Friday I got his number I called him on the Friday he was doing a remodel you know the Tran the the the the the contrast the the pastor over there at the mega church you know they were flaunting two million dollar you know earrings and you know all of the flare and all the fluff and here is this man of God like that man probably never had to work a day in his life and here is just a common man amongst this he he just like was said he smelling like the Sheep he was out doing sheep things he was just working he's not trying to make a name for himself he's just serving God what's next in front of me what's next I heard and oh come on yeah come on by and so you know here started attending the fellowship and you know my brother Tom Ray came preach and I was in the meeting and the Lord supernaturally healed my body it's it was a wonderful thing and I'm still reaping the benefits I tell you I used to walk with the stoop and I was afraid to straighten up because it felt like a knife but God's mercy has touched me and restored me God has come with a word of restoration if there's complexes if there's plaguing things in your mind God is here to restore by the renewing in the washing of the water of God's word to your heart you know I I think this is interesting how I got to feel the healing virtue of God and oh my you know your carnal mind is real near and so all of a sudden that thing started kind of working back and telling me well you know you could redeem all of those years of your lost potential oh I grabbed a hold of that and I started you know they said hey I talked with somebody who's in the know about baseball and I was like you know he's like if you if you're three times a week you need to run three miles a day you need to build up your cardio you need to practice this you need to keep your pitches down you need to get ahead of the account all this stuff you know that might sound really silly for somebody who wanted to be 31 years old go back into baseball even if it was just minor league or whatever just to see just to see but you you type that out in your world what is what is he tempt what is the devil through your carnal mind tempting you to chase after here I was like yeah you know what I can testify of the healing virtue you could see what see you know your carnal mind will compare even like Moses he failed but you know or whatever you know sometimes when we're driven on our own will we'll justify it any old way we even quote scriptures we'll quote the prophet but let's keep the word pure and let it be pure in our heart to manifest Christ amen and so here I was I'm starting to really tune up and by this time my wife had you know started coming to the fellowship and I um I was missing Church you know the games were being on Sunday and Wednesday and I was I was kind of I was thinking you know it won't always be like this you know I'm just it's just Four Season they'll they'll all see I'll be Vindicated they'll all see it was actually for the Lord you know this is subconscious I'm not telling nobody this but this is the carnal mind you have a carnal mind I'm just here on the altar sharing my heart with you but you battle this every day he's come in tempting you telling you all kinds of nonsense hey do this be this you'll be this all this no sir I will be what God spoke me to be oh I I got into that thing after a while feeling bad but I was doing good and so I was like you know it came down to the show time where I was going to do a tryout and you know this this is the grace of God he just said you [Music] that's about as quiet as it was for a few days but the reality came and I laid it down if you're doing something because of your carnal mind lay it down lay it down God wants to manifest himself through you he's manifest himself to you he's manifested himself for you now he wants to take you and manifest himself through you he has the power to transform what you are to what he said you will be ain't that wonderful we just always want to check our motive and our objective you know when we make decisions we're influenced by spirits but I don't want to be influenced by no other Spirit but the Holy Spirit I don't want nothing to have dominion over my mind except the Living Word of God amen [Music] thank you I have no way to know what time it is well you're enjoying the word of the Lord I'm so thankful that God is faithful because what he planted in each one of us is going to come to a fruitation you know so all of that you're longing for if you'll just do like the scripture says be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind I believe that's a wonderful thing to the Lord because he stands waiting and willing to impart himself into our lives into our circumstances where we're having trouble at work with our boss or where we're having trouble with that school mate where we're having trouble with the neighbor who always drives his car over our yard to park his car or with the children that won't pick up the dirty clothes God's even in the little things God's wanting to come and he's wanting to transform the situation but if we can take a promised word of God the scripture admonishes us and says by these exceedingly great and precious promises are we going to be partakers of divine nature what a what a promised what people a Heritage he's he's loose that amen it was for you and Jesus Christ paid the price he's loosed there was someone that had a hold on that to where you couldn't redeem that Birthright you had a right to a land he struck that off and you can be all that God said you were to be I'm so grateful for that praise the Lord you know I didn't get to what I was trying to get to but Lord knows you know the power of transformation is is in the word of God you know when he sowed deceived he said let everything bring forth and see everything was in that order and because God is God he's a Creator and he creates by a spoken word it must come to pass because he spoke it it's just that simple but the devil has sown corruption in the minds of man to where now even his thoughts we become spokesmans we become repeaters of you know his theme his agenda you know haste we want your opinion on this I get this all the time you know about this next candidate for for whatever hey we want your vote you see the devil came to to to to to to pervert see to deform brother Branham lays this down really plainly see the corrupter came and deformed the seed of God how did he do it it's striking he says he did it through education through civilization through science so now as we're living in this world whether we're from Congo or Africa or or Mexico or wherever there's certain things in culture and Science and all of these things we've identified those as Who We Are but we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind let go of that so that we can be identified with the Life of Christ amen you know he took he took and said you know let there be this let there be this and and the world was in darkness and he transformed that chaos and that Darkness into a Garden of Eden amen isn't that a part beautiful parallel of your life my life you know the light of God shown our pathway we receive that light amen then you become the light amen to be a beautiful garden let the light let there be light and the mass of creation out there there came over around the Sun and began to revolve around the Sun and became a Garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God it done the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word of God amen you know I'll just you know this is a quote from paragraph 81 he says when when God had spoken it he knowed his word was a seed and it could it would bring forth of its kind now it's it was commanded to bring forth after its kind and it will always do it if man don't tamper with it and so will God's church and everything else bring forth of the kind like it was at the first if theologians don't tamper with it with that word trying to put it somewhere else or something else God has spoken it and no matter how much they can they try to contaminate it and tamper it and so forth it's going to bring forth of its kind there's nothing to stop it amen amen he says this in paragraph 94 I think this is very important so he says oh I would like to stop here for just a minute to say this is where we are facing yet the completion of that word I like to know what we're facing I mean you you talk about someone who could just not just see what the eye can see but you're talking about someone who can see past time he says now I want to stop here a minute there's something that we're facing now the completion of that word now God said let there be and hear it come up first perfectly just exactly now this tree can only bring forth of that that tree this tree only can bring forth this tree and Adam a Son of God can only bring forth the Son of God you get what I mean it's everything like after its kind and so God could say well I'll just rest now and did you notice it was very few words that God ever spoke actually from that time on he committed it after the Fall To His prophets and they bring forth the word now you see God rested he didn't have no more to do he just had a headquarters and knocked at the door and he says father what is it and he sent the word by them down by them and that's and he has a system and a way of doing things let it be just and that's the way it was everything and of its seed bringing forth of its kind now when everything looks so pretty and everything come to pass just like God had said now here comes the slimy dirty Deceiver now that's what I'm trying to warn you all hear about when you see God's seed beginning to take hold to grow how many seas the seed of God beginning to take hold and grow I'm not just talking about as a congregation I'm talking about in your individual lives this is not just don't don't let the devil just say push it off to your neighbor but how is he the the the enemy trying to do this in our lives amen but the prophet is warning us as we begin to to see the the seed begin to take hold to grow watch out for that fella coming he's slick as he can be he'll quote scripture just to who would have it see watch him because he is a Deceiver I'm going to call him instead of a conformer being conformed he is a deformer you're deforming the things that has been conformed he is a deformer and he a deformer and perverter or a corrupter of the Original Seed in the original program amen you know I just see that he's warning us you know there's going to come a time you know you you get it on both sides you get fanaticism that they wanted to worship the the idol of the Prophet Daniel you see and there's they said look we're going to worship God we're not going to worship these idols and there's people lifting up the image of the prophet right but see there's God has a system and his provided way is so that there would be one a prophet go knock on the headquarters give thus and thus and bring it down and that's the food for the seed amen so if they start steering away from the the system which God brings life to the seed we need to take heed and not just you know Wednesday and Sunday can you imagine if you met with somebody and you're like man I haven't eaten since since Wednesday and you're like man Sunday comes I had Nate said Sunday you're like ebl anemic you see and I think a lot of the health conditions in the world today is not so much that they're not eating but they're not building themselves up in the vitamins the pure word vitamins the the original instead of all this hybrid stuff you know we have a carnal mind that we have to starve out you know hey a little bit of news you know a little bit of knowledge about this product or that product it doesn't hurt you know what I say if we're feeding if the majority of our free time is feeding and in love then we're recognizing we're coming in Union with another nature otherwise it's time to check up the nature that's God's planted in you will thirst I cannot be satisfied with nothing else but the literal life of Jesus Christ manifested in me doing the same thing he did when someone came mocking hold my bees spitting on him these are not just examples that we can look at and not our head and say yeah but these are potentials I don't want to miss an opportunity you know sometimes God is wanting to use you in the hardest people oh my goodness then that's the one you want me to get underneath God he thought it not robbery he humbled himself no one can get that low the Creator stooped way down for me and you that ought to give us courage I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me I don't mean to keep you I just I wanted to get to this last thing and maybe we can invite the musicians to be able to commune with Christ oh what a privilege you know the scripture says there and John chapter 13. you know because God was doing something for Peter and he was even telling him you don't know what I'm doing and there's been some training there's been a lot of God training you and you didn't know what he was doing in your life but he's been doing something he's been transforming you when you go and you go to prayer and you listen to those quotes and you read your Bible it might not seem like very much as materializing right before your eyes but God's faithful he says this he says Peter said in verse 9 he says Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but my hands in my head and Jesus said he that is washed needeth not saved to be washed his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean and he taken His Garment and set down again and he said unto them know ye what I have done to you do you know what God has done to you could you could you tell somebody what God has done to you I mean if you can understand what I'm saying now you're not too young if God has done something for you think about that you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you you know God has a purpose in doing the things that he's done for you you go through experiences and the grace of God is there you were bound you were in shackles and he loosed you what I've done to you do unto others if someone's done you wrong when you're driving home from work you're tired you had a bad day they cut you off well how many times you cut God off in your life someone said bad things about you how many times you said some bad things about God or his plan in your life or his program Healing Hearts from sin and you're like but what God has done to you do unto others amen you have that potential you don't have to fear because what he's done to you he's actually with you to do it for others aren't you grateful for that why don't we stand [Music] let's sing in moments like these yeah it's like me I sing out of [Music] us to Jesus [Music] [Music] I lived up my hands to the Lord [Music] [Music] singing [Music] singing [Music] [Music] you know it's on my heart you know if you feel that you want God to renew your mind to transform you by his promises you could sit there in your heart
