[Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Man, our hearts really go out to the family of Sister Heidi. It's been a tough year for them. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious and kind heavenly father, we come as children looking up to one that can provide all of our needs, everything, Lord, that we're short. All the the broken pieces, [Music] Lord, we just lay them before you, Lord. just work your will in our lives, we pray. Lead us how you'd see fit. And Lord, do the things that your word promised to do in this day, [Music] Lord, that's to to have a body, a group of people, Lord, that can live in unity because they're following the same word. They believe the same things. Lord, your word is eternal and you said you wouldn't lose a one. So, as we sit here tonight, Lord, there's many upon our hearts and lives that we come in contact with and our hearts go out to. Lord, we just don't see how they can make that choice or find your provided way. We don't understand it all, Lord. But we have compassion. We also have a belief, Lord, that your word will be fulfilled. So tonight, Lord, even though we come as faithbelieving saints, Lord, with many, many needs upon our hearts, we also come rejoicing. We come thankful, Lord. &gt;&gt; That we even have access &gt;&gt; that you're still on the mercy seat tonight, Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we just combine our faith together. Lift up our voices in unison to say, &gt;&gt; "Oh Lord, just come quickly." &gt;&gt; Bless us tonight, Lord, when your word pours forth that each one of us, Lord, can be spoken to, not just lip to ear, but Lord, down in the the inside of the inside. all those doors in our hearts. Lord, may they all swing open and may you just clean us from inside and out. Lord, we ask Lord that everything would be put under the blood. As we leave this place, we can say, "Surely, surely I've been blessed for being in the house of the Lord tonight." Lord, just use us for your honor and your glory. Use these tithes and offerings we collect for your benefit, Lord. Lord, those that aren't here tonight, Lord, we we remember them as well. And truly, Lord, the universal bride of Christ around this world, Lord, prepare us. And may we look up for our redemption drawth nigh. We ask all these things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Oh, God will make a way [Music] where there seems to be no way. Oh, he works in ways we cannot see. He will make a way for me. He will be my God. Hold me closely to his side. Oh, and with love and strength for each new day he will make a way. God will make you believe that tonight. Let's just sing it one more time. Oh, and God will make a way where there seems to be no way. [Music] No words in way we cannot see. He will make a way for me. Oh, and he will be my God.

Oh, and joy comes in the morning. Oh, and travels in on high. Just worship him tonight. Oh, and for a friend in Jesus, go and know why you're here. Oh, and if your heart is broken, oh, and just lift your hand and sing. Oh, and I know that I can make it. Oh, and I know that I can stand. Oh, and matter what my way. Oh, and my life is in your hand.

All the father hath given me will come. That you wouldn't lose a one and that your sheep heard your voice and another they wouldn't follow. Father, may we take refuge and comfort in the kind, comforting words that you spoke to us, encouraging us, Father, that we can make it and by your grace and mercy that we can overcome. We trust that you'll continue to lift us up into your glory and your goodness that we can be a burning reflecting light of your love for us, Father, that they may know that you love us and that we love one another. And that this great love's available to all that would enter in. We ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. We we uh uh brother Paul's going to preach for us tonight and and I will admit that I put pressure on him to preach in English. So you just reach out there and just suck the words right out of his his spirit and and he'll minister to us. Uh this weekend Leslie and I are are going to uh they're having a service. It's for brother Biscll as you know. He passed away I believe last Tuesday and a week or so back and uh they're having just a service. It's uh not really a memorial service but people are coming just to pay our respects and and to let the family know that we love them and they've always been a part of us. And then brother Tom and brother Mike and them will be here to preach for us for our November meeting. So, we're looking forward to that. And also, our October 19th uh family uh day is coming up. So, let's keep those things in prayer. So, you love the Lord this evening. The Lord's good. So, we're looking forward to uh uh ministering uh this Sunday, but we're listening forward to the word tonight. if our heart stays the same, we'll probably be ministering at a harvest time uh this coming Sunday. So, and then the some of the brothers are headed towards the men's meeting in uh Tennessee, I believe it is. So, uh we have a lot coming and a lot going, but the Lord be with us wherever we go and wherever we are. So, we just trust that. So, Brother Paul, we're going to sing Amazing Grace for you, okay? Because I know that it it takes courage, but I appreciate your humility, brother. I think everybody in this church appreciates your humility. So, as we sing it, you come in the grace of God and minister the word to us without fear or favor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May sing great. How sweet the sound that save a wretch like me. I once was lost but now was blind but now [Music] are you glad for that grace that taught you to fear to wash that My heart [Music] and my dear relief, [Music] how precious [Music] of the hour. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, when we've been there 10,000 years, &gt;&gt; just think of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] King and the son we know last day to sing our praise and be worthy. Well, let's turn our hearts and worship him in that chorus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, you know with all our hearts, we really want to praise you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we know if we can be here in your house is just by your grace. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Nothing else, just your grace. &gt;&gt; So we pray, oh Lord, that [Music] You come and open the world for us and teach us. Bless brother David and each one of your sons and daughters here tonight. We just surrender everything in your hands believing that you'll calm yourself and preach your word because nobody no one is worthy to preach it unless you do it through him. Thank you Lord. We love you tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. As for the David say, I don't know if I will do it, but we just s that with Jesus we can make it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Since last time I preach in English, but the David every time asked me to preach in English and he said that he doesn't want me to go back in French. Just keep going on. So let's take our Bible in the book of Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3, we start with the verse 13. The Bible say, "Wherefore I desire that ye f not at my tribulation for you, which is your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father our lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in the heaven and earth is named. Amen. that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might be his spirit in the in a man &gt;&gt; that Christ may dwell in your heart by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend it with all saint what is the breath the length the depth and the heart &gt;&gt; and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. and to him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, word without end. Amen. You can be seated. When I told my wife this morning that brother David asked me to preach in English, she said, "Oh my God, I think you the service won't be long. [Laughter] because I think you you should not have more word to say as when you preach in French. I say I'm going to do something. So I don't know if the service will be long or not. I don't know. Just let the Holy Spirit lead us and try to say something. And you know it like when the baby is learning to speak sometime you want to say mommy is going to say mama but you can understand is calling mommy. &gt;&gt; So maybe I want to say baby but I say baby. You're going to understand what I want to say. just just keep me in prayer. I I know my wife is praying for me. So you can join her and &gt;&gt; so I can do something for the Lord. So according to the scripture we we we read the Lord put on my heart something I can take from the uh the verse 15 of Ephesians third the Bible say that all family in heaven &gt;&gt; and Earth at name by the name of Jesus Christ. And I know that we are all sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We are member of God's family. &gt;&gt; We are member of Jesus Christ family. &gt;&gt; And like in the world in some family or in all family we have some benefit. Yes. &gt;&gt; So tonight I want to talk about the benefit of being a member of Jesus family. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What benefit we have to be a member of Jesus family. If we can come to the church every time we have service, it's because we have something in our hearts &gt;&gt; telling us that we have a part of something. &gt;&gt; We have me we are member of that family. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so every time we have families meeting, we have to show up &gt;&gt; and to know what our household, how a lord, how a king, how a god want to tell us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What he want us to be like. &gt;&gt; Amen. That why every time we come to the church &gt;&gt; sometime we are obliged to surrender something we are doing sometime we let the jobs relate something that could be important for this world but for us we think that the word of God or our family's meaning is more important &gt;&gt; uh somewhere say in law and grace preach June 10th 54 paragraph 126 he say you become a member you not a servant God don't call you his servant &gt;&gt; but you are a member of his family you become a member You not a servant. You son and daughters. We are now sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; A member of God's family. &gt;&gt; My oh my. I might live in a shake, but I'm a I have a blood. &gt;&gt; There you are. a member of the household of God. &gt;&gt; That scripture that what the scripture says what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us. &gt;&gt; See that we should be called the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Oh my there we are the membership. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the B talking about the membership of Jesus Christ family of God family I said that in the world I don't know what's benefit the US president families has &gt;&gt; but I think that his family have some benefit &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; maybe security maybe I don't know But we want to know we want to know what benefit we have because sometime we are just walking like some people we don't know what they are &gt;&gt; right who's the father &gt;&gt; we think we talk we we do a lot of things sometime we for that our father is the king of kings &gt;&gt; is the lord of lord &gt;&gt; and we have some part of I don't know I can't say part but we have the full &gt;&gt; benefit of his kingdom &gt;&gt; as a Christian we have a full benefit of the kingdom so everything God says in the Bible &gt;&gt; every promise &gt;&gt; belong to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we are here tonight. And he said here he did he say oh sorry I say he did in French but he say but when God exalt him so high I here in the second the second seal second seal paragraph 149. But when God exalt him, so I till he has to look down to see heaven. &gt;&gt; See how God in humility. &gt;&gt; See? And he gave him a name so great that the whole family of heaven is named after him. And every family of the earth, all the family on earth is named Jesus. &gt;&gt; All the families in heaven is named Jesus. &gt;&gt; And such name that every knee will bow &gt;&gt; and every tongue will confess &gt;&gt; to him being Lord. Either here or in hell, hell will bow to it. &gt;&gt; Everything else will bow to it. See, but first it was humility. &gt;&gt; Then it become great. &gt;&gt; See, let God exalt. &gt;&gt; He that humbers himself, God will exalt. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible say that everything, every power, every thing even the L should bow in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; So if our name &gt;&gt; we belong to this family. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. It means that everything &gt;&gt; the devil with all demons everything should bow &gt;&gt; in front of us &gt;&gt; because our name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Every son, every daughter have the name of his father. &gt;&gt; That's why we are called Christian. So if in the name of Jesus, one benefit we have is everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everything &gt;&gt; should bow &gt;&gt; in front of us. &gt;&gt; I was reading one story in the book of Esther. I think we're going to read it. the book of Esther. I'm going to start with the chapter five, the last verse. I'm going through the sixth chapter. So Esther chapter 5:14 Bible say then said Zer his wife Amen wife and all his friend unto him. Let a gallow be made of 50 cubit eye and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mukai may be angled. Don then go down and merly with the king unto the banquet and the thing plays ammon and he calls the gallows to be made. That's the devil plan. &gt;&gt; He make it. &gt;&gt; I know that sometime the devil making some plan for each one of us. &gt;&gt; But when the devil's making his plan, &gt;&gt; God looking at you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Make his plan &gt;&gt; and early in the morning &gt;&gt; to fulfill the plan he come to the king's court. The Bible say chapter six on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of record of chronicles and they were with before the king &gt;&gt; and it was found written that Malachi had told of Batner and Teres two of the king chamber the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king Iserus. And the king said, "What honor and dignity have been done to Madukai for this?" Then say the king's servant that ministry unto him, "There's nothing done for him." &gt;&gt; Did God make a plan? He touched &gt;&gt; he disturbed the sleep of the king. &gt;&gt; He was not able to sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh, so I can do something for Amen. Verse four. And the king said, "Who is in the courts?" It was the enemy with his plan. Now Amen was come into the outward part of the king's house to speak unto the king to hang Madukai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. &gt;&gt; And the king's servant said unto him, Behold, Herman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. So Amen coming. And the king say unto him, "What shall be done unto the men whom the king delighted to honor?" &gt;&gt; How a man doubt in his heart to whom who the king delight to honor more than to myself? And Aman answer the king for the man who the king delight to honor. Let the royal apple be brought which the king used to wear and the earth and the king rideth upon and the corn royal which is the set upon his head &gt;&gt; and let this and us be delivered to the end of one of the king's most noble prince that they may that they There heard the man with whom the king delighted to honor and bring him on the horseback to the street of the city and proclaimed before him. Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor. Then the king said to Ammon, "Make us and take the apple and the earth and thou has said and to heaven so to Madai the Jew." That's the best part of the story. That's at the king gate. Let nothing fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that thou hast spoken. &gt;&gt; Then took Amen the apple and the o and a roachi and brought him on the oback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him. Then shall it be done and to the man whom the king delighted to honor. And Malachi came again to the king gates. But Ammon as to his house mourning and having his head covered. And Ammon told Zer, his f his wife and all his friend everything that had befallen him. Then saith his wise men and Zerish his wife unto him, "If Malachi be of the seed of the Jew, if Malachi is from Jesus family, &gt;&gt; before whom thou hast began to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. but shall surely &gt;&gt; fall before him. &gt;&gt; If Malachi, &gt;&gt; if you &gt;&gt; is from the seed of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the wise man, the the Malachi wise man told if it's for the seed of Jew &gt;&gt; if he's from Jesus family &gt;&gt; you never &gt;&gt; never &gt;&gt; can't prevail against him &gt;&gt; but every time you try &gt;&gt; you fall &gt;&gt; in front of him &gt;&gt; sometime we don't realize who we Ah, that's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think Mukai did nothing. He knew nothing. &gt;&gt; But when Ammon make his plan, God, &gt;&gt; his father make know the plan &gt;&gt; for him. If the devil makes something make a plan for you, surely God will make another plan for you. &gt;&gt; Just stand as we stand that he will make a way. &gt;&gt; He will do something to keep you, &gt;&gt; to lead you. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; to take care of you. Lordam say in the forsaking all forsaking all preached 23rd July 52 62 paragraph 143 is talking about our father our Jesus &gt;&gt; he said he went to the lower city and the smallest man in the city looked down on the top of him. Zak that right at Jericho way down did he had the lowest man that were that there was in the earth. He was come to the world with an illegitimate that call in because they really believe that the baby was born out of the holy bedlock. We going to paragraph 144. But he say but God gave him a name above every name. That name in the heaven, every name that name in the earth till the whole family in heaven and earth is named the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That he forsook he was rewarded. Sure. He did all right. He came to the earth creator of heaven and earth. And he add nothing to it. &gt;&gt; The creator, &gt;&gt; but he add nothing to it &gt;&gt; until he cursed the tree. &gt;&gt; Satan tempted him fasting for us, but he received food that the others knew nothing about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One day he said, "So I have food. said, "Why don't you come eat?" He said, "I have food that you know not of." That's right. He had food that they didn't know nothing of. He on earth. He had no shadow. They say no place, no house, nothing belonging to him. But you know what? He become a sher for everyone of us. That's one of our benefit. &gt;&gt; What kind of shadow we have? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In front of whom everything should bow. &gt;&gt; God made him a shadow for the whole human race. &gt;&gt; He had no shadow for his own but is our shadow. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've been talking so much about fallout shelters. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We got one. &gt;&gt; That's why fallout shelters go in some hole and the ground and they tell me &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; those palm will eat and blast the all in the ground for 150 ft deep for and something mile score. Why it will break every bone in you if you was a half a might deep in the ground. Sure it would anywhere but we got a shadow. &gt;&gt; Christ is our shadow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said 151, he gave up his sunship between him and the father to be made sin for us. Did you know that he knew no sin became sin for us? He knew no sin. He never sin, but it became a sin for us. to give us the benefit to be free from sin. &gt;&gt; Now he can he can make sinners son. Amen. That the good part. Take sinners and make sons. &gt;&gt; Take sinners and make dollars. When he give up his sunship to become sin, now he takes sinners and make sons out of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. &gt;&gt; What a benefit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God won't be sword on anything. &gt;&gt; No, sir. You can't do this become God's seed to eat &gt;&gt; his son became sin offering &gt;&gt; that he might buy now &gt;&gt; take sinners &gt;&gt; and make sons of God out of them. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful thing that is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, yes sir, he gave his strength. He became weak &gt;&gt; that he might be our strength. &gt;&gt; He is our sufficient strength. &gt;&gt; We don't need no other strength but the strength of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is my strength from day to day. Without him I would fall. &gt;&gt; That how wonderful. What you forsake, &gt;&gt; what you receive &gt;&gt; for what you ever pursue. &gt;&gt; My forsake the world. &gt;&gt; Forsake your own idea. &gt;&gt; Forsake your doubt. &gt;&gt; Forsake your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Forsake your frustration. &gt;&gt; Forsake it and receive him. &gt;&gt; Believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God want us just to believe. &gt;&gt; You know that this word at brother David preach it our thought is every time about our path forward. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who we are? &gt;&gt; What are you doing? And what the David preached last time, the main thing is we have to have the faith in our death &gt;&gt; really to believe that we are died from the world &gt;&gt; and we can be identified with God's family &gt;&gt; to re show our membership from this family. There's a lot of benefit. I I can I can preach about all benefit we have as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; But I know that we have all benefit we can have in this world. &gt;&gt; But we have to live as a member of this family. Yes, &gt;&gt; our daily life has to be like Christ. The Bible say in the book of Romans chapter 6, Romans chapter 6 verse one. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? Knowing not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life. &gt;&gt; For if we have been planned to together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him. &gt;&gt; That the body of sin must be destroyed, that henceforth we should not self serve sin. &gt;&gt; For he that is dead is freed from sin. &gt;&gt; Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead died died no more. Death have no more dominion over him. &gt;&gt; For in that he died. He died unto sin once. But in that he liveth. He liveth unto God. &gt;&gt; The Bible show that we have to die from the world. and be born again &gt;&gt; to be a part of a God family. &gt;&gt; You can't be a a God family members without the new birth. &gt;&gt; It's not impossible &gt;&gt; because we can't join the family but we have to born in the family. We have to born in Christ to be a Christ like &gt;&gt; to be like Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To have this desire to be like Christ every time everywhere &gt;&gt; that we can show to this world &gt;&gt; that we are Christian. &gt;&gt; Our names is Jesus. Our family's name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; So we can like Buddh preached last time be Jesus for someone else. &gt;&gt; We can't be Jesus for someone else if we are not Jesus. &gt;&gt; If we don't live like Jesus. &gt;&gt; If we don't pray like Jesus. If we don't have the faith like Jesus &gt;&gt; but David said it sometime we we are afraid to pray for sick because we sometimes say that I don't know if God can &gt;&gt; he is the sick but if we became like Jesus you know Jesus in the front of Lazarus st he say oh Lord I know &gt;&gt; I that you always &gt;&gt; answer to my prayer in he knew it. &gt;&gt; So if we are like Jesus, &gt;&gt; we can have the same faith. &gt;&gt; He said that I can be Jesus for someone. &gt;&gt; I can do like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus sent me to do like him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Buham said in identify with Jes with Christ preach 20th December 59 paragraph 66 he say God made a man to desire to have an example. Sometime in our daily life we want to have an example. Some student want to be like one teacher because they love this teacher. They like how we teach, how we talk, how we perform something. Some people want to be like some Hollywood actress. But God put in our hearts the desire to be like someone &gt;&gt; to do like someone. &gt;&gt; And he said and God gave him an example. &gt;&gt; That example is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to be identified with him. Now if you would be more like him then there wouldn't be so many big shot in the world &gt;&gt; if everyone like the Bible say was the member of Jesus family and do everything like Jesus like the example He say then where wouldn't be so many big shot in the world that wouldn't be any angry children in the world &gt;&gt; that wouldn't be any whiskey or drinking of gambling God gave us an example to be like &gt;&gt; but we refuse to be it &gt;&gt; we refuse to be a member of his family &gt;&gt; now that's what the matter with the word. They got the desire. God has given them that, but they've turning the wrong way. &gt;&gt; It's time to return back. &gt;&gt; It's time for each one of us to return back &gt;&gt; and get on the right road. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And get facing Calvary. Nature proves it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said now if people of this day &gt;&gt; with that great desire and great ambition to be like somebody for example if they took Christ as their example then we would have we could fire every police there was. That's right. &gt;&gt; There will be no more crime, &gt;&gt; no more things. So the police will never have a job. He say we could fire every police there was in the nation. Everybody will be make and amble. Everybody will be kind and have bodily love one for the other. &gt;&gt; There will never be a divorce case ever played in our country. There will never be any sickness and no s no more sickness because we have the power. &gt;&gt; Even if the sickness come, we have the power to cast out the devil. We could even dismiss hospitals and everybody try to make Jesus Christ the example. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have need for nothing else. &gt;&gt; So the nature in is in the man. But he put he put it on the wrong thing. He makes some men. And you know the Bible said we are cursed when we make flesh our stay as a member of God family. We can't make this flesh our stay. &gt;&gt; It's not possible. When you try to make flesh your stay or put your trust in flesh, the Bible said you are cursing. &gt;&gt; How well I know it's so easy to do it. &gt;&gt; The when I was little boy I read a book of thousand the mama had an old fur that Mr. the wedding I'd give her late before the dresser. I cut that thing up and make me a thousand street and slept in the tree for a week. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be thousand. I wanted I wanted to be thousand. Then when I read the book of the Lawn Star Ranger, I wrote the broomstick out being a hobby horse trying to be the Lawn Star Ranger. It's no more than what people will do. So sometime if you spend your time on social media looking some at some people who want to be to have some influence on social media. You can try to be like them. Say it no more than what people will do. It's what you read, the music you listen to. &gt;&gt; Go into a restaurant and it's old rock and roll. No wonder the people are going crazy. &gt;&gt; That enough to drive a human being crazy. &gt;&gt; But oh, I'll be thankful all through eternity to one day &gt;&gt; I read about Jesus. that satisfy me. &gt;&gt; I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; That's my desire &gt;&gt; to be able to turn the other cheek. &gt;&gt; Oh, go the second mile. &gt;&gt; To be able to forgive &gt;&gt; when the odd is all against you or nothing against anybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell them you rightfully or wrongfully for your right doing but still love them. &gt;&gt; That the way I want to be. &gt;&gt; That the way we want to be &gt;&gt; as a family member. I want to be that kind of a person. I want to be able that when I'm will I win not back. That the kind of an example that God gave us in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We are to be identified with him. &gt;&gt; He say how do you become identified with him? You'd say brother now uh you have to dress like the Hollywood stars and do this other things. But how do you become identify with Jesus Christ? The first you repent. Amen. &gt;&gt; First you repent of what you all already have done &gt;&gt; and then you identify with him here in the pool. No doubt. But what many will be identified with him in a few minute in the pool you are identify with him in bicism. For if we are buried in Christ, we are identified to his death. &gt;&gt; Burial in burial and resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's why we are baptized. &gt;&gt; We go down into the water come back up to witness that we believe in the death, &gt;&gt; burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we be planning in his likeness, in his death, God gave us a promise. &gt;&gt; We'll be like him in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That a promise, it can fail. &gt;&gt; Identify yourself with some movie queen and see where you'll be. Identify yourself with some cowboy or some teenager and see where you'll be. But I challenge you &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; That's not brother Paul, &gt;&gt; but brother Bam. &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight. Identify yourself with Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in his death, &gt;&gt; in his resurrection, and see &gt;&gt; where you'll be at the resurrection. &gt;&gt; For if we suffer with him, we shall reign with him. &gt;&gt; God has given us the promise. &gt;&gt; May world desire is to be like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my desire tonight &gt;&gt; to be like him. &gt;&gt; To do everything like him. &gt;&gt; Take me, oh Lord, and mold me and make me. &gt;&gt; Shape me over again. like the prophet that went down to the porter house, &gt;&gt; break me out and it m me &gt;&gt; that I pray tonight. &gt;&gt; We know that as I say every preacher when you preach in the Bible and the message is showing us the benefit we have. But the thing we can look at tonight are we member of this family? Are all these benefits belong to us? That where we are tonight. We are here tonight. And may God help us when we stand. We can stand. A musician can come. The main thing tonight is we know that we have the most powerful father. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the most powerful name and sometime trials, troubles, many things in our life can keep us so far from our privilege, &gt;&gt; from our benefit. Sometime you can feel that like you are not a member of this family because you make something wrong. But our father say that if you repent &gt;&gt; from everything, he's able &gt;&gt; not only to forgive you but to justify you. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put in your mind that you are not a member of this big and greatest family. Keep in your mind if every time God put it in your heart the desire to be in the church, it mean you have a seed in your heart. You have a God seed in your life. just come. The warrior of the world and the son himself will bring the seeds to life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So your life can show exactly what food who you are. A two sons, a two daughters of God. Let's pray. Our heavenly father, we thank you tonight. I know that sometime I don't say exactly [Music] something how I want to say but it doesn't matter. The main thing tonight oh Lord is that we can see how much you loved us, &gt;&gt; how much you did everything for us. And you want to remind us tonight that we are member of your family and every benefit of this family belong to us. Oh, we thank you for that. How wonderful it is. [Music] May we just help each one us to look at his life, to make everything right, to look at you our example. We need you tonight, Lord. And we commit everything in your hand. All our life we commit in your hands while we pray and ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Amen. Wasn't that wonderful? Let's just sing this song for a moment to be like Jesus. [Music] On earth I long to be like him. All through life's journey from birth to glory. I only have to be like Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, that was wonderful. &gt;&gt; That was wonderful. Here we are sitting the sons and daughters of God in the family of God. And as Romans says, we're joint hes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're joint hes. Everything that he was, all that the father was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, we're h sitting here with power to move mountains, &gt;&gt; to pluck up trees, &gt;&gt; to withstand the enemy, and all Satan can do is accuse you. &gt;&gt; But there's nothing shall be laid to the charge of God's elect &gt;&gt; because the seed of God remains in them. Now, can you So, we we have this abundance of power, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz he he give it to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I like what he said in in Luke the the 10th chapter. He said, "Behold, I gave unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you." &gt;&gt; That's the power he gave us. &gt;&gt; Just think that you have that power. I just I thought as Paul talked about benefits, I thought, "Wow, we got all these benefits, but they're unused benefits." &gt;&gt; You know, the the the same I think it was Joseph when he got in in prison, the gift that got him in prison &gt;&gt; was the same gift that got him out. [Music] and and this the fact that sometimes you get in trouble, but the the the God in you, the Christ in you will get you out of that trouble. &gt;&gt; Satan gets on you, you got to fight back at him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But and you got to fight back that not from a negative standpoint, but from by the claim of your inheritance. Wait a minute, Satan. You can't put this on me. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I'm not going to let this spirit overtake my life. I'm not going to beat myself down. Even the prodal son, how far away he got from God &gt;&gt; to where he was absolutely just squandered everything, &gt;&gt; came to his senses &gt;&gt; and said, "In my father's house, &gt;&gt; the servants are living better than I am." And when he went back, he wasn't received as a servant. &gt;&gt; He was received as a son. &gt;&gt; And the father put his coat on him and he said, "Rejoice because that which is lost." Oh, and we could take these great power. And when the the disciples and he told that to disciples, he said, "I've given you power. Nothing shall by any means hurt you." He said, ' Notwithstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given me the power. But I don't rejoice in that. I rejoice because I'm in his family. &gt;&gt; My name was written in the Lamb's book of life. This is my inheritance. The life of the Holy Spirit and the power of God is your inheritance as a believer. &gt;&gt; And what did he come back to restore? Not religions, but life &gt;&gt; and life more abundantly. Oh my. Let us let us have courage &gt;&gt; to step up and and know that he's empowered us. I love that story that he read to us. Doesn't it make your heart just leap? &gt;&gt; We can do this. &gt;&gt; We can be victorious. &gt;&gt; We can overcome. &gt;&gt; We can win our children. We can see. We can't have victory over sickness and death and and discouragement and depression. &gt;&gt; We have life and life more abundant. Oh, we just need to we just need to start being who that we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you. I'm not a very good singer. I like this song. Whatever you're playing, you know it. &gt;&gt; Will you come help me sing? This is my desire to [Music] Oh Lord, with all my heart I worship you. [Music] and all I have within me, Lord.
