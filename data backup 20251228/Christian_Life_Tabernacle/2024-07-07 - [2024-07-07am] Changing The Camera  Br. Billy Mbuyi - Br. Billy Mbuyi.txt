name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning want to welcome all our visitors and we're certainly glad to be GA in his presence amen with believe that something could be said this morning amen that will be of a uh help to you amen um before we get started certainly want to continue to remember our pastor he'll certainly be back next week and we pray that the Lord will give them traveling mercies and bring back to us um the our youth meetings are going to be a couple of months from now so in August 30th is our youth meeting so it's the Labor Day weekend um so the first service is on the 30th so usually when you say Labor Day weekend people think forward but so it's it starts from the 30th to the 1st um it's going to be brother Danny stean ministering and so um it's going to start on August uh the 30th and wer until September 1st uh what we would like to do and the reason for the early notification is so that um we can uh perhaps try to get back in the same way that we did it before uh which was we we won the church part participation we want everybody to to be part of the meeting it's not something that we just do where we say it's youth meeting and then no we want uh those that could that have the ability to host um we've always I believe that's with the leadership of our pastor that's how we've always been led to do it not to have kids stay at the hotel and other places but have our own church family be able to host them and and have kids staying at your places and and and different so if you could do that uh we'll have uh certainly we'll put some uh uh pages in the library so we can fill it up and have it all filled up and you can uh and if you're able to continue uh bring a meal to those that are hosting and all those things so we'll just try to organize it the same way we've done it before and I believe it'll be a blessing for the whole body not just for the Youth but all of us together working together amen let's open our Bibles this morning um and we'll continue to announce it and make U uh make it more uh uh give more details as we move uh forward uh Luke Chapter 5 are you happy to be in the house of God this morning amen my my heart desires for God to speak to me I came to church to hear from God and yet I'm the one standing here so we'll see that uh Luke Chapter 5 uh verse one a very familiar scripture reading it says I just wait a until you get to the page and also don't forget tonight is our communion service so I believe the church will be just as full as it is this morning so I pray and I have a hope and I believe and I put my faith in there that we be just as full amen and brother Matthew will be ministering for us Luke Chapter 5 it says and it came to pass that as people pressed upon him to hear the word of of God he stood by the lake of greenstone I I just love it I I trust as Believers we learn to press upon the word to hear the word of God we learn to put everything aside and Our obligation when it's time for the word let's press into the word of God and I believe when you do that you'll get r word results but R makes a statement it's too early that that there's there's never been anybody that that that has borrowed something that God has borrowed something from them and never returned 100 fold and and it's very important if you can borrow him your time this morning say Lord I have given you my time now I know his his time he gave you but let's just look at it from this other angle so if you give him your time this morning you will go out of here blessed so he stood by the lake Green starred and he said and he saw two ships standing by the lake uh but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing the Nets so they had gone try to fish and they couldn't get anything so they came back and they were washing the Nets and it was the end of the day and everything was done and and and and that was the case and he entered into one of the ships and it said which was Simon's and prayed him that he that he would uh uh Thrust out uh uh little from the land and he sat down and he taught the people out of the ship and he says now when he had left when he had had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and and let uh draw your net for the dra and Simon answered and said unto him and said Master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will draw down the net let's continue and when they had done it they said and they enclosed a great multitude of fish and the net break and they bacon unto their Partners uh which were uh in the other ship and that they should come and help them and they came and fill both ships and they and they began to sink it says when Simon Peter saw so when s when Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus feet saying depart from me for I am I am a sinful man oh Lord for he had he was astonished and all and all that they were that were with him and the droughts of the fish which they had which they had taken and so was also James and John and and Sons of zebede which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from hence forth Thou shalt catch man and when they had brought their ship to the land they forsook all and followed him our father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus we ask this amen you may have your seats this morning this morning uh we I I just want to start out and say that just come to an understanding and and say this morning the the the it's it's the word of God that brings faith in the hearts of Believers but will say one place that some people worship trees and they have faith in in the Sun and the Moon and all of those things but he said that when you do that the only problem is those things they don't they have no ability to speak back to you because they are dead and they will speak about how they will draw it says a men will say well I'll touch the tree and this is going to happen but if you do that the tree has no virtue that it would Minister back to you so you could get but real faith comes from God and it only comes from the word of God we we can get excited we can say all that we want but only when you hear the word of God that's when you can receive real Faith you can receive enthusiasm from somebody you can receive motivation from a speaker you can receive all of that but you can never really receive true Faith because Faith only comes by the word of God and as sons of daughters of God we live by the word of God by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God the word of God is our Lifeline is what gives us life the word is the blood that flows through our vein it's a heartbeat so if you take the word away from us we are dead the word is what gives us life and that's the understanding I want us to have this morning the word of God is God himself giving himself to the believer so if you have the word of God you have God himself you don't have a men's interpretation if you say I'm standing on the word of God in other word God is with you it means what you are doing you are standing on him you are he's the one holding you up so if you ever want to know whether you are wrong or you are right just find out what the word said if you stand by the word God will vindicate his own word and I want to say this but makes a statement he says when we eat the word we become the word so if God can stand upon his own word if God is obligated to his own word if God will protect his own word when you eat the word you become the word then God is obligated to protect you that's not difficult the scripture says we are the word of God we are his thoughts Express so God is obligated to protect us to guide us to lead us in all things so the word of God to the believer is the complete absolute so when the word speaks you might as well close your windows close your doors close everything and just say God has already spoken I'm moving forward with that you don't need to hear another opinion you don't need to hear what another man says you don't need to hear another explanation when God has spoken you can move forward and know that God will bring his word to come to pass and that's what we need to have in our hearts today I come to church because I heard the word of God I come because I've been touched by the word of God don't be enticed by men's word men's word will only lead you AAR but God's word will bring you to his eternal salvation he will bring you the promise of God into your life so when we stand We Stand upon the word of God oh I enjoy what brother Ben was Beno was speaking about last Wednesday how that it's our own culture and and it's our own uh tradition that comes into the way of God why because we take the word of God we mix it with our tradition we mix it with our own understanding we we cause it to say something that God didn't say we cause it we in other word we make the word of God a non effect and why is that because man has no ability man is trying to produce something where God is wanting us to wait upon him what what is what is denomination is men that fails to wait upon God they've come up with their own explanation about things and they've filled up the buckets and they'll fill up all things and and God has no room every scripture has a meaning they know about it everything has a so there's no room for God to move no this is the Living Word of God this is the Eternal Word of God God is his own interpreter and he interprets it into your life daily let me say that daily the interpretation of yesterday may not be relevant for today it's according to what he wants to do today that's why the prophet will look at them Jesus looked at them and he says you claim to read the scripture in them you think you have you have eternal life if you really believe your Bible you would know who I am why because I am that which Moses spoke about I am that which Abraham spoke about when Abraham saw the same word when Abraham saw the word manifested in his day he believed it but you claim to be sons of Abraham yet the same word the same person of the word that stood before Abraham you are rejecting him so it's not what we claim to say is what the word says it's what we believe to know that the same word is being manifested so the word of God when he speaks all of the other opinions don't matter that's you you all you need is to hear what is God said what is really what is the Bible says I can come here and give you a bunch of explanation and that will do you no good that's why I love the leadership of our pastor we play tapes in our church why do we do that because we want everybody to know what's been spoken here is not a man's interpretation it's exactly what the prophet said so the word of God is a seed and we know the scripture tells us when a seed when God plant his seed is bound to produce exactly what God wants it to produce yes amen he said my word will not go out void and return void it will not go out and return void but it will bring that which I have purpos it to bring forth so I want to just for a moment this morning I'll try not to be long I I I just want to perhaps a strange subject and as you could tell my my inspiration came out of this message at Thy word I want to uh uh preach on changing the camera A View From Another camera and you don't understand but you will see where that came from as as we continue so the the prophet will will take out the scripture as we read in Luke and and it will say it must have been a a Monday because they had just gone people had gone to church and and usually Jesus will try to hold his meetings so he doesn't interfere with all the church services and and people he didn't want people to miss church he wanted them to go to their synagogue and go and and he he held his meetings in the all days and and so he would have them come on the Monday and he said he went down by by the the seashore and he this young preacher and there was just something about him as you preach as you begin to speak about the word of God and you can look at it when you really look at the ible you will understand he went by the seashore it wasn't a place where you'll find rich people and those that were well-doing and everything because the word of God never really came to them the word of God CES to those that are needy and those that are lacking and those that are hungry because those are the ones that really came to draw he wasn't looking for uh the great people but he came to the lordship of Israel we'll understand even as you read the prophet will tell us his own Ministry when he came he didn't come to those that were well and in fact the description is there was the uneducated people it was the cast down people it was those that with the stretchers and all with all kinds of ways and really the needy people that's whom the word of God came to so this young Minister will come and he will go by the seashore and he came and some will recognize him and he began to stand by the seashore and to to talk and and all of the sudden uh uh people begin to gather to hear what he had to say they will gather up and they will hear him speak and and they will gather up men and women like some that came from work some that were working they left what they were doing and they came they gather around and they begin to hear much of what he was to say and this gospel precious gospel began to come out of his mouth there was just something drawing about what he was saying just how he said a precious word was coming out of him and he would begin to preach and they will come and they will live what they were doing they begin to draw closer to him and he will come and he will begin to say the word of God in such a way that they never even heard it it will pierce their hearts the word of God will begin to do something into their hearts and they begin to hear it and something within their heart begin to leap and they wanted to hear more about what it was talking about he said you have been you have heard of this but yet I say unto you and you will began to preach the beatitude and all of those things and he began to to preach to to to the people that were gathered and all of the sudden the scripture will tell us that many more began to gather together many came and woman and children and all of them they begin to gather and as they were gathering the multitude he realized that at the shore he didn't have a place to stand anymore so what he will do is he saw this fishermen that came and they didn't have anything and they stood there and B will say uh perhaps they looked at him they said well we went and we tried to cut fish we didn't get anything but there's this young Rabbi over there preaching let's just go listen to him for a moment and as they came and said the word be to draw them it began to pull upon them let me say this every son and the daughter of God is pulled is draw by the word of God when we hear the word of God there is connection that happens there's something within our hearts that wants us for us to become what we are hearing there's something about what's been spoken that answers to the needs of our heart you're here perhaps you came here this morning I don't know what your situation is but I want to say this this morning if you hear the word of God this morning the word of God has the answer of what you are looking for so he came and and and he he he took the the the boat and he took the Sheep and and he he he he pushed it a little bit so he can stand on a little bit away from the shore and he began to preach and he began to preach and and they were there the children believing and wanting to hear they were pressing to hear his voice and pressing to hear what he that he had to say they were looking for that what he was what what was it that what message did he bring it to them and what good was that message to them they didn't were not just interested oh because it was a man speaking but what he was saying had something to do with what they were going through into their lives what he was saying has an answer had an answer to what challenge they were facing what he came to do when he was preaching his way of preaching his style of preaching for some reason had the answer for the problems of man he knew just how to tackle every need that every person had he just knew how to position his word perfectly he just knew how to say something and and it will be the end of it and it will take away the questions that was filled into the hearts of people and B will say this and he said uh this is in the message at TI word preaching 0608 paragraph 15 it says and and then it says now let's change the camera just a moment if you can put it up let's change the camera for just a moment in our minds it says look sitting down sitting there on the stump and old chunk hold the side of the seashore see Peter sitting up there and James and and John and Sons of zebede sitting up there it says had fish all night discouraged and any and any and any of you fishermen knows that there were that uh what it was to fish all night and don't catch nothing that's really discouraging so they washed out the Nets and and hang them up to dry and and it says and there were and and there there was sitting on the stump and some of them said well here comes this guy that preaches he says let's see what he has what's going on what he's going to say it says I can see the old Apostle get the chunk and and sit down and and and he says and after a while he began to listen and said there's something a little different about this that fellow he says moving his chunk it saids just a little bit closer and after a while he's standing right up against him oh I love that he will call you just little by little it's it's never a one time where you just come and out no he's pulling you in fact let me say this you will get so close you wouldn't even know know that you got so close he will draw you in a manner that's unbelievable to your own thinking he will draw you to where you don't know how how did I get here why how did I believe this message how did I come to believe him I don't understand it but what he's the one doing the drawing let me say this when we come our own way that's how we fail because what happens is we build our own reputation and we got this expose that we talked about ourselves and how we looked at the message and everything but if it's him doing the drawing you will always be grateful you'll always say Lord I don't know how I got here I don't know what but you draw me to this message so he said right up against him it says there's something about him that draws men to him it it says he still got the the same power and if you'll be lifted up he'll draw man unto him let me say this this morning you perhaps came to church just like Peter all discouraged up and all you know you know now remember this is what they made the living out of they they were fishermen so they they were paid by what they would take and go sell out and and go sell to the people and perhaps they were in debt and they had things that they had to do and they had families to feed and all of those things so they were counting on the fact that they will go and catch fish and go sell it so they can make it living so yeah they are discouraged perhaps sitting there when they came into service that morning perhaps on their mind that were thinking how am I going to take care of that bill how am I going to pay the rent tonight how am I going to do this and they had all those question let me say this the questions and the problems of men are the same and that hasn't changed and let me say this God also has not changed it's the same every time if God took the the cares and the needs of men in the past he the same God here today this morning taking care of the needs of people let's not kid ourselves let's not think that your problem is greater than anybody in the history in fact we can bring out problems that you never heard of and then and then they sit there and they heard the word it was by the hearing of the word of God that they got the solution to what they were looking for and this morning whatever problem you have let me say this let not Satan lie to you that you can go work harder so you can get a solution that you can go do more so you can get a solution come to the master this morning hear the word of the master this morning and let him bring you a solution to your problem and so it says regardless of what was going on it never stopped them from listening to the word of God they came anyhow to hear the word of God and so oh I love love this and after he's done preaching now it's time he looks at them and the scripture says he just come and after he done and he took Peter's boat the in four verse four it says when he had left speaking he said unto his Simon Peter said launch out in the deep and let down your net for the drop and Simon answered unto him and he said said unto him it said Master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net but my sister that's the answer to all men's problem this morning the let and let me just set it up for you these people were fishermen from when they were kids these people they that's what they they grew up on the F on the shore and they grew up their lifestyle that that's what they did day in and day out they knew but what I'm says they knew just how to look at the Moon and no when it's time to fish or not time to fish in other words when it was time to fish they knew this is the time to go they knew everything about all that there is about fishing what kind of nature use what kind of boat what direction should I be coming they were experting what they were doing and as Peter is speaking let me say this to the world it looks like it could have been been an embarrassment it looks like something was about to go terribly wrong for this young Master always preaching and it says perhaps some looked in in their heart they said well we just looked at we we we went we just came back and we are washing our Nets this is going to be such an embarrassment but he says nevertheless a tie word we will do what you want us to do and what did he do he launched out he went out to do according to the word of God what was the difference when they went out before they went by themselves but when they went the second time they went with the word of God the word of God will make the difference the word of God will defeat the Devil any place any time under any circumstances the word of God will bring fish where there's no fish the word of God will create when there's nothing the word of God will bring into existence where doesn't exist what made the difference at Thy word I will stand here at Thy word I will come to church at Thy word I will worship you at Thy word I will do just because you said I'll do that I will give myself just because you said to do that and when you stand upon his word let me say this when you stand upon God's word you are shifting the responsibility from you to God yes [Applause] when you are taking God as his word you are saying I'm no longer responsible for the outcome come on I no longer responsible for the shame I'm no longer responsible for what's about to happen right now I'm standing on God's word and he is responsible for his own word we we are scared of the shame we are scared of the exposure letting me expose let it be exposed let me say this for the one says this there's one thing that God cannot do and that is to [Applause] fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away when you stand upon God's word you are standing on the Eternal yes sir whatever will never pass away you are standing on God himself he says this in paragraph 18 and it says in other word I can hear Peter say oh I love this I love how the prophet just goes and get into all the minds and and he Paints the scenery for you in a manner that's never seen before and said I could hear Peter say well Lord it says why I'm a fisherman it says we was born and raised by the Sea my goodness that's his reputation I was born and raised by the sea I know the sea well and it says why it says we know when there's a moon when the moon is Right excuse me we know when the moon is is right and then it says when all the signs are right there's not even a fish in the water it says well we told all night it says we all all night long and we know when when the signs are right it says and we never even took one fish this is when the signs were right we took nothing and then you come around and tell me to go back in in some water where there's been when when we've been uh see uh uh sinning it says and let down to get the whole boat full of them it says why it couldn't be now now listen to what he says if we had had said that then he wouldn't have got them but he said Lord I toil all night I have taken nothing but nevertheless at Thy word I'm going to let down the net it says there you are there's the secret there's the secret to Christian Living there is the secret to your overcoming there is the secret to your vict ictory there's the secret to overcoming the things of the world there's the secret to everything that you have need of it says take God at his word now listen to this if there's no fish there God is able to put fish in there I like that I love that kind of God I love that kind of God I can serve that kind of God he's a creator of all things and then it says if if he did not if if he did not do it the same net that went through the water that went through that water all night on caught nothing but when God said put down there there was fish in there and let me say this it's the same net it's the same people it was the same condition it was the same everything science said it wouldn't happen but the difference is they went by the word of God and it happened and let me say this it's not different from you this morning the same sickness the same trouble the same problem when you bring it by the word of God it brings a different [Applause] result because it's him now because why the difference is he's now the Man In Charge he's now taking care of everything he's now the difference is he's now with you he says in paragraph 19 he says well maybe tonight you might have seen through you have you might have been seen through all uh through all every doctor every doctor's office in the country maybe you've been you've been you've been through healing meetings and you've been anointed many times but tonight at Thy word Lord here I come that's the way it says that's the way it is at Thy Word I'm come I'm letting the net cuz you told me if it says and if you would ask anything in my name you I'll do it and I believe that that's the truth and I'm letting down detet right now at your command at the Commandment of the Lord my brother my sister let's not live below our privileges trouble of Liv are going to be there every time but what we have been given brother bam says we have been given the authority to cast down the enemy at every Junction what we have been given is the word of God to overcome the devil at every Junction he brings problem we cast it down he brings trouble we cast it down he bring things we cast it down by which command by the command of the Lord say I am a child of God I am a daughter of God I'm standing upon his word and I'm speaking at his command butam continue says don't be afraid I want to say this this morning don't never be afraid of the devil don't let the devil make your life miserable every time it tries you bring the word of God into your life don't be afraid ask a whole Lord let me just say this I I feel like sometimes we ask God things that a man can do come on come on I've said this before we ask God the things that brother Ben can help me with we ask God the things that somebody next to you can help you with the scripture says ask a whole lot ask the impossible ask the invisible ask more if he cares about the little fish how much more you he want you to ask in abundance he want he will move Heaven and Earth for you for one of his sheep he's going to do it this morning why because it say his command but when I'm ask I said well I want the next squirrel when he comes I want it to go over there over there over there over there over there over there over there really you said I ask I ask it happened he told Moses speak the word Moses said well I'm looking on this side there's a mountain I'm looking on that side there's a mountain I'm looking behind there's the Phil there's a the Egyptians coming all I could see is the right SE in front it said he told me to speak what am I going to say right sea open up oh at the word of God the right sea open up I don't care what the challenge is it's the same God today if it's not the same God then we are wasting our time but he promise you'll be the same yesterday today and forever if he doesn't do what he did yesterday then we are here for nothing but I know about the scripture and by the word of God that is here to do the same thing ask a whole lot you have not because you ask not and you have not you have and you you ask not because you believe not that's right it says ask when you and it says you shall receive seek you shall it shall you shall find knock and it it'll be open and it'll be open it says that's God's word it says now let's we'll we'll we'll go down for the drought it says and I can see the old Apostle I love this I can see the old Apostle running the big scene out there in the water getting ready and then it says when he began to pull on the net it says Made couple of pulls and there was nothing he pulled his said well yeah there you go I I told you it was nothing but then it says but after sometime began after a while something began to tug it says begin to take a hold let it says just let let it it says just let down one time he says just let down one time and try the little effort that you might not feel much he says the second little effort that you might not that you might you might not it says may go several effort but after a while you feel a tug something caught a hold something has got something something is on the other end of the line let me say this people don't believe God exists because they haven't pulled long enough people don't believe this message is true because they haven't been around long enough if you come in with a doubt at the end only your doubt is going to be manifested God is looking for people that are ready to just keep going they have given their lives and they know it's God or nothing they they will stand there until it happens don't keep pulling If Abraham had to pull for 25 years how much longer do we have to pull we'll pull until it happens yes you want to know the reality of this message you stay in it you eat it you drink it God will make it a reality to [Applause] you we read one or two books and all of the sudden oh I you know I don't really see how this is going to happen well you looking from the wrong camera that's your own camera how about this other camera what is it saying on the other camera this camera is a Heavenly camera this camera is there to give you heavenly vision about your life this camera tells you you continue to pull you may pull one time you got nothing you may pull two times you got nothing you may come and be prayed for you feel nothing but you keep pulling you keep pulling God will make his word come true [Applause] he said this oh I love this it said he launched out and this is where it really I have to just speak to my own self and say let's not be afraid to cast down to cast out at the word of God to launch out because Faith what the faith in the word of God requires you to go with no support of any man faith in the word of God requires that you testify for something before you can even receive it faith in the word of God requires that you claim The Possession while it's yet coming along the way faith in the word of God is the requirement that we have to stand upon what he said regardless of all the symptoms that's piling up so he's saying we got to launch out whatever you have need of let's get into the habit of launching out let's get into the habit of claiming it let's get into the habit of going let me say this perhaps this morning in your camera all you see is failings oh I did this wrong and I failed again and man I I I woke up again I did the same thing I don't know how long this business of the word it seems like it's just not producing what it says it will produce that's your camera maybe your camera this morning is I've been struggling with this forever I don't know how I'm ever going to overcome this that's your camera so the difference between God's camera and your camera is you're doing all the viewing come on you're doing all the Talking you doing all the examination but the difference is in G's camera he does all the Talking let me say this if you will stay long enough to hear what he has to say not what you have to say not what you understand about the circumstance your your circumstance is your own that's wonderful but let's hear what he has to say ask him what are you seeing from your side of the camera from the camera that you're seeing how what are you seeing about my life let him bring his vision to become your vision Wonder but about I'm say oh I like I would speak of that for a while launch out that's the trouble with people face tonight they are afraid to turn loose there are many of that's got faith but they are afraid to turn it loose it says faith without works is dead now we can go in a whole new Direction right now faith without works is dead God doesn't want us to be a people that just says we believe but there's no actions attached to it we know but one him Express he explained what that means it says uh speaking of a Paul and it speaks about them speaking about Abraham how that one was God's view and the other was man's view that the one has to be seen it was the faith that was seen in Abraham by God but yet when uh when when the other was talking about it was what men saw from from Abraham so what we are trying to do with our life is to line up what God sees with what man sees together so the and and the expression is not us claiming something that we are not it's us standing on the promise of what God Said and expect him to come to bring the promise to come to pass so when we are speaking about faith without expression in other word if I believe I'm Healed then I have to act doubt that I'm Healed then I have to confess that I'm Healed then I have to testify that I'm Healed then it's my business to make sure that I don't have a negative testimony regardless of the symptoms that's presenting before me it's my obligation to keep reciting the word of God to keep reciting the promise of God oh but it's God's obligation to come to his word and say that you have believed long enough you have stood upon my word long enough now it's my business to make it a reality to you he says without faith uh faith without works is dead it says that's the all that's it says just the body without the spirit is De if you've got faith it says if you've got faith show me your faith by your Works a little bit further down he goes in he says that's what's the matter with people today in the world many of them have faith it says they are afraid to launch out with it it says they're just afraid to venture a little bit they want the action they want to see God move before they can move they want to see they want to move until they get the feeling until they get some tingling no God didn't say that in fact is the high priest of your confession he wants you to confess first so he can have something he can go with the formula is I will stand here I'm going to testify to the whole world I'm a Christian I'm going to testify that God saved me I'm going to testify that God heals me he's going to bring it to come to pass just a little bit just to say well it says I can do all things through Christ that strengthen me it says look at me says launch out into the deep let down it says let down for the Dr and I want to say this God wants us to live by his word God wants us to stand by his word he says in the message the testimony of the raised dead boy he says paragraph 22 he says I like this it says oh I tell you this it says the most marvelous things that I've ever seen in my life is the greatest hour of my life is it says when when I get up against the wall it says I can't it says and I can't go over it under it or around it it says that's right I trust it says then I trust in God and he opens the way he opens the way and I go through the thing God takes you through it it says that's when when you come out on the other side it says it's like Samson when he killed the L lion it says when he got out on the other side when he killed the lion he got the sweetest honey that he's ever gotten that he ever eaten out of the old carcass of the lion and when something it says and the same time at the some time if you if you will overcome something by the grace of God it'll be one of the sweetest thing that you will ever taste in your life it's sweetness to walk with God the the I I was telling young people one time and I was telling them and and all of the sudden I asked the testimony I was telling him was 20 years old I believe and I looked at him and I said how many are 20 years old and you know over 20 so you like and and when God does something for you it lasts forever it's it's as as though it happened just today or the day before you you never go across it and it becomes old no it's always new every morning why because you know the same God who did yesterday he's here to do today the same God who did the other time he's here to do today oh I like this and B makes this statement it says it says when man extremity when man gets to his extremity it's an opportunity for God man's extremity is God's opportunity when you come to your width ends when you've done all that you can and it doesn't work when you've done all you tried and you try this you try this but says that's an opportunity for God to come and work it out the question is are we taking use of the opportunity are we actually making use of the opportunity you say I'm weak this morning wonderful that's God's opportunity to make you stronger you said I like the Holy Ghost this morning wonderful don't look at it as and oh I'm being despised and I'm lacking and everybody's got it let me tell you you'll find out most people don't got what they're talking about what we need is to to remove this myth about oh I I'm I'm this I'm that no it's you and God yes the relationship is not you and the church and God no it's you and God we are gathered here as Believers with each one with a relationship directly with God and the way God deals with you it's not necessarily how he deals with the other so what we want to do is to make our relationship personal and not let it go through somebody else if somebody else is on fire and I'm not made to be that way that's wonderful you just be what God made you you don't try to do whatever oh because over there they do this and they jump we got to jump we got to do no then you lost you don't know who's leading you when he's leading you let him do the leading let him do the showing let him do the revealing let him do the guiding let him do everything let me say this your weakness or your lacking is his opportunity if you sick this morning I couldn't tell you how much God wants to heal you this morning we can speak about it today till the end of time and it will still not be enough he's made it such that when we are lacking it's his business to feel the lacking we said last Sunday night that God wants us to depend on him I and I want to say this if you want to repeat that scripture for yourself every day do it because it's going to be very helpful because it's going to help you when you go and you hit the wall it's going to help you you when you fail yourself all you have to know is God wants to help me more than I want to help myself he wants me to walk by him he wants me to live by him he wants to challenge my achievement he wants me to do it with him so now I'm running out of time we could turn again the camera in one of this meetings that Jesus was having and we see a little boy come around the meeting with Five Loaves and two little of fish how it came about and and forgive me I don't mean to offend anybody but perhaps Jesus was preaching and and they realized time went out and people didn't eat and perhaps even as our messenger we realize oh he's gone over time you know they were renting a place and realized it says we'll just take the money and pay for the overtime and and just take care of that business because he didn't preach the gospel for money so here's Jesus is preaching and he realizes that people are hungry the the real disciple comes and say what are we going to do they're hungry and everything and so they said well can we go buy and this is one angle One camera can we go buy who can we go well there's a market over there there's another one over there but the time they already closed at this time we wouldn't be able to do but even if we go we'll need a lot of people to carry enough to feed all of these people from this side of camera where he was preaching he realized that there was a need so he asked they said is there anything at all that we have in here they said they looked around and everything and they find this boy with five love and two little fish and it says okay bring it they bring it he takes it and He blesses it and all of the sudden they able to feed 5,000 so over on one side it's completely impossible it's completely unscientific as the prophet will say it doesn't match any record there's nothing that you could say this is possible science-based but on the other side it's possible all things are possible and let me just read the statement how bham says it he says I can imagine he says this it says it says the drama this is paragraph 27 and I can imagine see the drama how they draw the mind and everything um and the little boy he said he wasn't it wasn't very much he could hardly fit himself with that he says but once paragraph 27 but once what was in his what what what he had had given had gave to Jesus Jesus fed 5,000 it says you may not have much but turn it loose once yes sir let him have it what you got sir you if you have if you've got if you haven't if you got much Faith put it in him turn it loose see what he will do as long as it's in is it in your it's it is in his hand as long as it it it's in his hand it wasn't much but when it got in in here Jesus hands it meant something so when it's in your hand it doesn't mean much it can't do much but when it comes to Jesus hands it means something it says it would only f it only feed him here but it's it's hardly could do that but he fed F he fed 5,000 taken up the basket full afterwards Hallelujah he says why when I think of that my soul shakes and trembles that God in God at his word he says he said he said cause them all that sat down and I can see him look down the little boy and said Do you believe I can do it he says that's what I'm that that's what he's trying to find tonight somebody with a childlike Faith who would stand by and say Jesus I believe you can do this is not wanting us to grow up to where we understand everything no with to childlike friend said father I my my faith is very small right now and he said okay father in fact I don't even have anything right now if you don't have anything just hear the word the word creates faith and God comes and moves upon Faith because we understand without faith it's impossible to please God he says he says this he says and then he says Jesus I Believe I Can Do I can do it it says if he can get somebody to do that he will do it but if you are back off and say I don't know I'm just afraid it says I know I know I I I know I believe you it says he can't use it if anything is helpless it says a spineless person who claims to be a Christian and afraid to stand to stand on conviction God don't want cowards like that he can't use them it says like all body Robinson I says I used to like was re I used to like was reading his book and he says he was quite a man he says Lord give me the backbone the size of a solo and give me plenty of knowledge in in the gble plenty of knowledge in the gble and of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as I got a tooth in my mouth he says then G him till I die hallu G him till I die that's the kind of faith and determination we need somebody who will do something at TH word Lord at TH word at TH word word Lord whatever things you are asking ask in my name and I will do it oh God is not looking for us to back up he wants us to move forward God's Army that's in Retreat he move forward God's army goes and take Victory God's Army knows that whatever weapon we have in our hands it's given for us to overcome with he talks about en closing about the Hebrews children oh I like this yeah they are the king gives an order whoever that's un B to the Statue will be executed will die now they come and they consulted with one another and they came and they said what are we going to do f it and then this said our God is able to Deliver Us from this Fierce furnace but nevertheless if he doesn't do it will not bow to you I like that determination but what says the Christian has to be the most determined person that they ever was the most persevering person there has to be on this planet is a believer I don't care how Satan will turn it around I don't care how much it will hit it up if we are believers We Believe till we die if we are believers we know that our God is greater than Satan Our God will change the circumstance at any time if God wants us to die we'll die by the word but when our God has spoken we can never go against it we will stand there till we die oh he began to speak and oh I like this I said oh perhaps when they say that in Heaven There was a commotion I love it he said I want you to have a view paragraph 32 he said it said when they said that they stood there they stood there and then it says uh paragraph 32 on that same message at that word it said right up and then it says they began to stagger the intense heat coming forth and and and coming close and then it says and one more step they were going into there it says look like the black picture of for a Believer doesn't it it says let's turn our camera there's another camera we're going to look at at the same at that time there's something going on down there it says there's something going on up there too let me say this every time there's something going on into your life there's something going on up there HJ the Earth is only a reflection of what's happening in heaven if you ever want heaven to come for you if you ever want to get God out of his throne you take God as his word if you ever want to know what heaven is going to react you take God at his word whatever is happening here is only a reflection of what's happening in heaven so he says now it says let's look up there and see what's going on and I can see him setting up and his great PRI ly robe hanging around him watching him down there across and he says and I see this great Archangel Gabriel came up and pull his sword and and and he said and unshield his sword and and stand there say master I have have you says have you looked down in Babylon why there's men down there three people it says that's taking you at your word they are standing on it and they are fixing to be burned this morning this morning you met may be burning in fire you may be thinking you about to go in the fire but there's already a messenger up there giving the news of what's Happening down here there's already an in somebody over there telling your story there's somebody over there bringing the attention of what's happening to God and then he says I can hear him say Gabrielle watch them excuse me my just tears are getting in my eyes it says I can hear him say look I stood by your side he said let me go down there I will change the scene this morning believe I could do it he says I can hear him say Gabriel you've been a good Angel you've done just what I've told you to do ever since I created you but he says but stick your sword back in there it says stuck it back there Gabriel took his place at his side and then it says here comes another angel flashing up real quick his name was ww he says and he had control of all the waters and I can himar him saying Master look down in Babylon he says have you considered Babylon Master he says he said uh let me go down there and I it says in the an aluan destruction you gave me the power over the water he says I broke up the Springs I broke up the atmosphere down there I washed the over let me go down there he says this morning I washed the Babylon off the the face of the earth I believe he could have done it but that's right he said if you consider them oh I love this I love this he says his eyes Is On The Sparrow his eyes Is On The Sparrow his eyes is on the sparrow and I know he watch watches me he says Sing Because I'm happy he watches over every hour he says he knows every everything that you are doing that's right he says watch over them all he says I've watched over them all night now this is God's it says and you Angel are great listen to this you've done all it says you've done you've done what you've you've been told to do I can I can I it says I can't let you go this morning because I'm going myself it's a mansiz job this is not an angel job when you engage God it is mensiz job he's not going to take a mensiz job and give it to Angel no this is his responsibility this is his power this is him that's going to come on the S he's not going to send you just says it's a man-sized job I want to I didn't know I said what's a mansiz job I just started rejoicing I said whatever it is God I need a mansiz job this morning I don't need an angel to come to my rescue I need the author of the word to come and wear the word in reality oh my brother my sister let's not cast down the things let's not fail to realize in whose presence we are standing let's not let's not forget whose words have we believed this is not the words of man this is the words of God let's all stand this morning he will do a mansiz job this morning he's ready to do it all that he's asking for us what are you standing upon what are you acting upon are you act acting upon his word or are you acting upon your own understanding remember I said if we ever want this message to become a reality we just need to stand upon his word the problem the trouble is we have so many other Escape Route that the devil is offering well if it doesn't work you can do this if this doesn't work you can do this I don't want to do anything if it requires death I'm ready to die that's what those boys said if it requires death because I stood upon God's word let it be if it doesn't come that's wonderful but I'm standing on God's word and then because they did that they caused a maniz job to come out of the Heaven's camera something begin to transpire they begin to look God said no I'm not going to you know God wants us to put him to work right he he wants to see his children call upon him I'll tell you when I'm home and my one of my kids cry out I don't say oh who's crying again no I come out if if it's a cry that that that is of a need I show up and I don't care what's the CH if it's a lion I'll take him now this is a father in the natural if it's a snake I'll take it whatever it is if it's a person with a gun I have the authority to take it I'm talking about just a man how much more as the word of God how much more the word of God if we will stand upon his word how much more are we invoking out of him because remember no one word will fall to the ground the scripture says God will make every word the truth God will take the least amount of word the most amount of word and make it the truth ever every time and what he's asking for you to do is to stand upon that word why because when we do it the whole Heaven is mobilized about you the whole Heaven is talking about you how many wants heaven to talk about you this morning how many have a need and say heaven I call upon Heaven this morning and say I have a need in my heart I want heaven to hear my voice I have a situation that's been going on I

morning if you take him at his word this morning not tomorrow not any at a minute this morning he will come and make his word true to you I need a mansiz job I need a view from a different camera I
